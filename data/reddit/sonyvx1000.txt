Tried to do the same
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:12:35
Use Abra or Cash App. Quick and instant
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:35:38
Any good alternatives?

Goddamn! The prices have been declining but look how the technology improved! We have 3D memes now

Bitcoin is still above $6,000 which is still amazing. The resent spike was due to the fork. I don't think we're crashing, just a bunch of stuff going to which is causing people to panic. I'd hold if you bought in the past two weeks. I believe we will get back in the $7,000s soon enough. Just give it time for everything to settle

Any amount that you don't mind losing
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:26:41
It doesn't say how much bitcoin I bought with the amount of money used
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:02:14
With such a small amount, just enjoy the ride. If you have extra cash, gradually buy more when you think the price is right
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:29:46
Delta or Blockfolio are both good
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:11:40
Maybe. But not anytime soon
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:32:45
That's awesome that you put in the work for this and are sharing it. Not to take away from your work but why didn't you just use a crypto portfolio tracker such a Delta, Blockfolio or one of the others which gives you everything you need in a single app/ website?

Half now, half later
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:25:50
Corrupt country and laws won't make it easy otherwise hundreds of people would be doing this
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:10:31
These are cool but I wish they didn’t specify the total btc amount engraved on the top
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:37:04
You can buy as little as you want

Square charges a premium built into the BTC price so you don’t have a direct fee like Coinbase does. It’s still cheaper than Coinbase by a few bucks though and has instant buy and withdraw. I’ve also used Abra app but Cash App has the best rates out of all three. And no fee to withdraw either
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:17:37
I think you’re only able to buy and withdraw BTC from Cash App. Abra and Coinbase lets you receive BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:21:20
It’s on the Google Play store. I have an iPhone so I can’t personally confirm 
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:42:29
Pissed I have to spend $15 to buy $1000 worth of ETH. I don't remember the fees this high
Edit: The fee is actually $40
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:53:58
As much as I want this to be true, I'm gonna wait until we see a little uptrend before I buy back in

Wow coinpayments website is censored in New York

I was going to transfer my bitcoin from Coinbase into a wallet so I did a test transfer and it's been about an hour now too
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:31:16
Thanks for the link. I received the Coinbase email a little while ago too
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:48:47
Use a VPN?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:56:10
Is this the same for Coinbase since they're linked?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:41:18
Keep me posted when it launches. Being able to quickly view your portfolio is all I'm looking for 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:59:40
Money and hoes
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:20:24
I hope so 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:18:31
I bought one off eBay a few days ago for $1.19

Your funds may still be pending so you cannot move them from your account until they are cleared
