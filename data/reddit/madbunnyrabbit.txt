See. You're just waffling to yourself. You don't have a point. You never did. That's been my point all along and *you* just proved it.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:18:03
So is it more stimulating to talk to me or to your alts? Personally I find conversation with other actual human beings to be more rewarding. If you're providing content like you claim you should be able to answer simple questions like this.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:02:16
Didn't I predict you would say this a couple of comments ago?
Seriously why don't you simplify your point enough so that a mere mortal like myself can wrap my head around it?
If what you have to say is so important then why not try to spread your message instead of wasting your life telling people they're too stupid to appreciate your genius?
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:39:20
You have a purpose here? Only if talking to yourself counts as a "purpose".
@_date: 2016-04-24 06:24:25
You're not one of OP's alts by any chance are you?
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:41:49
About 90% of the content of this thread is you talking to yourself. 
"Nobody here that is intelligent or significant has called my content baseless."
You might want to check out the top comment. 
Also I don't think I've called you any names but the hypocrisy of you whining about it and calling me a troll *in the same sentance* is very impressive.
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:47:21
Summarise the main point you were trying to make in this thread in one sentence. Go.
If you have anything coherent to say it shouldn't be too difficult. If you're just waffling you won't be able to and will make some excuse about how I wouldn't be capable of comprehending you.
Do this and I'll tell you how I'm spending my life.

Accounts made within days of each other. Post in the same subs. He's having a nice conversation with himself elsewhere in the thread. The fawning nature of your comment (OMG u r so intelijent!). The condescending nature of your reply to me.
I think it all makes perfect sense actually.

Does it seem intelligent to you to make baseless, cryptic threats to people on reddit? Don't you think that's a little bit pathetic?
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:47:00
No problem. Sorry, I was being a little spiky too.
You seem to know what OP is talking about. Do you think you could summarise his main point? I'm having a little trouble following.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:12:42

To be fair Mark Zuckerberg had a lot more than 10% of Facebook shares and that didn't stop people from investing. The only reason this situation is different is that there is a *chance* that Satoshi is dead/outofplay and if that is the case, that has been priced in already. No one ever claimed that Microsoft was a shitty investment just because Bill Gates owned a lot of it.

Rubbish. Chuck Norris mines in his head. Whilst juggling.
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:56:34
Also if there are multiple blockchains is there an incentive for miners to leave one chain to perform an attack on one of the others? As a matter of interest is this something that happens with altcoins?
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:34:02
Question here : Is it viable (or even desirable) to have multiple blockchains for different applications (eg voting, property) or will one dominant blockchain be enough for all purposes?

I've got my BTC in an old electrum wallet. How do I access my BCH so I can sell it?
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:27:55
Bit complicated for beginners but yeah, this is an excellent way of doing it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:37:07
Sounds pretty straightforward.
Thanks mate.
EDIT : Having had a quick look at this might it be wise to wait a couple of weeks or months before moving the BCH so that any kinks can be ironed out? Of course I'd be running the risk that the price will collapse completely.....
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:31:50


Nah. I'd stand by my original statement that that's...... Not *quite* true.

@_date: 2017-08-12 19:58:21
The fee is too small so other transactions are being prioritised over it. Sunday evenings are a pretty quiet so it has a good chance of going through then. Otherwise the transaction should drop after about 72 hours and the balance will be returned to your wallet and you can try sending it again. You just have to wait it out.

I think he meant in the crypto field, not in general. As in the people you would need to hire to build your own blockchain are already working on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-25 00:15:49
I hope it happens. If Goldman Sachs wants to pay people 500k to work on blockchains that would be great. Until then most of the top cryptocurrency people are working on bitcoin.
I'd actually be really interested to see what kind of implementation of crypto a big bank would try to make. I bet there's loads of really smart people scratching their heads thinking how they can compete with bitcoins success or join it.

Well that's good I guess. The original text sounded a lot dumber.
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:14:31
To be fair apart from the investing in blockchain part, which isn't in the article, this is correct. You can use the blockchain without using (much) bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-22 09:32:08
No one's having a go at you it's just that the sub gets swamped with price posts every time the price jumps ten dollars, that's all.
The price hitting $280 on one exchange when it's $270 on bitstamp.... well, yeah, that probably is more relevant to @_date: 2015-03-01 21:24:38

I didn't read the whole thing but some of it seems a little muddled.
"A public key is created from a secret key, often called a key pair. The public key is not often seen itself but operates behind the scenes, proving ownership. With only the public address it is impossible with current and foreseeable technology to find the public key."
Now I am no expert but would it be better to write :
"A *private* key is created from a *public address*, often called a key pair. The *private* key is not often seen but but operates behind the scenes, proving ownership. With only the public address it is impossible with current and foreseeable technology to find the *private* key.

To be fair no one is saying the sale and consumption of illegal drugs is a good thing. Just literally that "'Silk Road' Was Safer Than the Streets for Buyers/Sellers".

There is a school of though that says that if the world's economies keep developing as they are then there will never be a major armed conflict between two superpowers ever again as their economies are too integrated and they would both stand to lose far more than they could ever hope to gain. Bitcoin could certainly accelerate this process.
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:18:20
The quote in context :
"The original code for Bitcoin was designed to produce a fixed amount. Its popularity has meant the digital currency is coming to its limit faster than many expected.
Among Bitcoin's core engineers there is a division about how to fix this problem.
One group advocates doubling the size of the "blocks" in Bitcoin, something that could help, but may be short-term. Another group advocates rewriting its underlying protocols to have far more blocks - a solution that would make old Bitcoins incompatible with the new ones. "
So it whilst the BBC haven't phrased it very well and I suspect don't really understand what they're talking about, OP is deliberately taking what they've said out of context so he can call them a bunch of idiots.
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:44:43
He didn't say he wanted to change it. Just that he would implement it differently if he started from scratch.
@_date: 2015-03-02 08:51:17
In all fairness reviewing and understanding code like this is beyond the capabilities of 99.99% of the population of the earth and would be a major undertaking for the rest. Bitcoin will have to find simpler and cheaper (a trezor is what? $100) solutions before it can hope to get widespread adoption.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:43:55
To be fair. Even if one version is substantially worse it would probably win out if it was backed by a lot of yelling and meming compared to a better version backed by silence.
@_date: 2016-05-17 08:53:58
Am I misunderstanding something?
How does 20% of miners dropping out reduce the blocksize limit?
I was under the impression that even if only 1 person was mining the blocks would still be the same size.
@_date: 2016-05-17 10:25:26
Maybe the price will double and all will be well.....
@_date: 2016-05-17 09:28:43
But if they drop out gradually then the perceived drop in blocksize won't be clogging up the network straight away would that be right?
Thanks for taking the time to explain to me. I've been interested in bitcoin for a couple of years now and it's always nice to get more understanding of how it works.

That's exactly the point, hundreds of threads, the price moves all the time it's not really news.
Now things like the EU ruling on taxation. That's news and will (hopefully) affect the price.

Seen the amount of trolling on this sub?
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:32:18
As a secondary question to this, how easy is it for the developers to change the protocol. Do they have to get agreement from a majority of the miners? Do they vote?
I've heard that a lot of the early adopters see anonymity as a major plus point and would not want that compromised which would not be such a big issue for some other investors (myself included). But anonymity may have to be sacrificed when regulation comes.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:23:51

@_date: 2013-11-28 11:52:48
I don't think there is such a thing as bitcoin's "true" value. Such a thing would be linked to what you can buy for bitcoin, which is linked to the exchange rate which is liked to demand.
