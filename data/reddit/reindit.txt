I currently have it listed for .01 BTC.
Was planning to fix the BTC price, not a USD price for whole shop.

I have one. But have been working on my lightning/BTC accepting only shop to finish first: 
Just need a few more weeks to get design done, but i could maybe open up and test with/for you early!?
Also have a lot of other hyper inflated reichsmarks etc I am planning to sell for a good price to help lightning/BTC adoption...

Great speaker. Good arguments.
But... It feels like a planted question with a rehearsed answer (including him correcting himself).
Anyway, I love bitcoin and I'm convinced/really hoping it's the future.
Still, talks like this, make me wonder what's in it for the guy giving the talk :)

Took me half a vacation day to set it up, but i already had the blockchain synced....
After the setup I spent another two days playing around opening/closing channels and sending satoshis back and forth tho to get the hang of it :)

I hooked mine up to spark wallet (android). Can make invoices on my phone, which are received by my node at home.

Don't have much funds left to open channels myself, i suggest [ if you havent found them already.
They opened a .002 BTC channel to me after filling in their form and taught me some valuable lessons about not being able to open two-way channels over c-lightning etc :)
Enjoy the node and our future :)

I just fired up my own lightning node yesterday and you are the second one i see doing the same since then.
Let's hope we can convince more and more people to join!
Let's grow this network :)

Even though i have a static IP i chose to set mine up under a torv2 onion adress.
This would surely work well with a dynamic IP and give you some extra privacy benefits (not sharing your own public IP).
If you need help, PM me, and:

Hope you get it all working to receive those satoshis, good luck!

I just recently set mine up, not following that guide tho.
But feel free to PM me when you get stuck!
!lntip 100
Hope you make it to receiving these satoshis, hang in there :)

Love it!
And luckily it can't fall off the wall (yet) with all the rock coming out.
