You are not a noob. It's murzika's fault. Please stop using mBTC, murzika!
It's more easy to understand to say  50 000 bits (= more or less 25 $).

Worse than the 70s, I think 40s, 50s. North Korea is medieval regime with the nuke.

I was on cheapair.com by smartphone, trying to buy ticket LasVegas &lt;-&gt; Paris.  But only credit carte accepted, nowhere bitcoin option.

Yes! I'm from Europe too. I like Kraken. In Mars, I wanted to open an account on Bistamp, Kraken, bitcoin.de. I sent docs ( a valid government issued ID, a proof of residency). Only Bitstamp refused my docs, it said " it's not enough high quality image". I re-took image, it re-refused. So I gave up. ( By the way , KYC is right, but how about KYE Known Your Exchange). Bitstamp is not so good. I'm happy now with Kraken and bitcoin.de, the best is Kraken.
