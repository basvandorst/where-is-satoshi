Semi-technical I would say.  I work at an ISP and I'm attempting to evangelize bitcoin and block chains internally.  My audience is mostly my coworkers that have a semi-technical understanding of networks and routing, which is why I went for the OSI analogies.  Thanks for the feedback!

My understanding is that while those funds are encumbered in the payment channel, it cannot be used outside of that payment channel.  If you tried to spend that money while it's locked up, it will get rejected by the bitcoin network.  But remember that a network of payment channels facilitates payment among a diverse group of people (through transaction routing).  Any one individual is likely to have multiple payment channels open so transactions can get routed to its final destination.

Thanks for pointing that out.  I've corrected the mistake--no more Mary.

All current and former Fed Chairpersons agree!  Not in a bubble economy, and the Fed is not to blame!

Thanks for the feedback.  I agree with every one of your points, and I've corrected them to reflect. Thanks!

His whole argument basically boils down to bitcoin not having any intrinsic value.  He should know that there is no such thing as intrinsic value. Value is subjective.

That was a really great article.

I'd do him

Might as well be the bitcoin axis of evil.

This article is plain ridiculous.  Etheream is a voluntary system.  Like all things in life, all participants acting in a voluntary system assume the risks inherent to that system.  The hard fork that just occurred demonstrates that the Ethereum system is capable of enforcing private property rights.  Consider a bank robber that gets away with the money because there was a flaw (i.e., vulnerability) in the vault.  In that situation, victims would want their money back and it would be righteous to do so!  Contracts are violated all the time, but it's property rights that matter!  I prefer to participate in a system that protects my valuables from theft or fraud.  Also, it's now clear that the "code is contract" dogma is incorrect.  Clearly, consensus is contract.

Love the last sentence.

Super informative!
