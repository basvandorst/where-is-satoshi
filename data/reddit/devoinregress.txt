I work for a very large online publishing company and we have readers who write in saying they would rather pay/donate than see ads. Truth is they are the vast minority and it just isn’t worth our time to implement and support a paid tier of users.
Adblock is the wrong solution to a very real problem. I don’t blame people for using adblock, there are a lot of shit ads out there that block people from what they go to websites for. Advertising on the web today is, for the most part, broken. Fortunately at the company I work for we see this as an issue and have a team that creates custom ad units that work along side our content instead of disrupting that content. It’s not perfect by any means, but it’s core to our revenue stream and the extra effort always pays off.

Thats what everyone says but the point of (good) advertising is not to get a direct sale but to build brand awareness. It doesn’t matter if you go out and buy it or not, they just want the brand to be a household name that when it comes time to buying, people have heard of it.
It’s awesome that you are one of the few people who is willing to pay for content, it really is. I wish the majority of people felt that way so it could be economically viable.

Ad sales is moving away from click based payment and many sites are selling display ads to their whole audience instead of highly targeted ads. The sale goes through when the ad shows up, regardless if you click or not. 
Unfortunately not many things in life are truly free. The cost of those free things are often subsidized by paid things. Your attention span, bandwidth, and privacy is what puts food on the table of the people who run the sites you visit. Can they do a better job at making less annoying and intrusive ads? Yes absolutely and this is a real problem. An annoying ad is bad for brand image and the advertisers don’t like them either.
