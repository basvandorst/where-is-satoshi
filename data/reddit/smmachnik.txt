Not entirely. Some people mine alt coins in the belief that the coin will increase in value in the future because of the tech / use of the coin.

Hello its me, your mom. Give me account info. I'll get this straightened out.

Ummmm no? Where the fuck are you getting this from? Feel free to provide some quotes or timestamps.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:52:47
Honestly i am unsure. How do i check? All i really did was download nicehash miner and start lol. Its nicehash v.2.0.1.4. beta (says at the top of miner).
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:24:28
If i pretend that i bought my GPU's STRICTLY for mining (lets use the 1070 for example) it would take me rougly 6-7 months to break even at the current rate (about $60 a month for the 1070). Anything after that is straight profit. However, if bitcoin continues on its current path, you could invest that $400ish the card would cost, and maybe have $800 at that point (which would be the card broken even PLUS $400 profit). It is this point that many say mining is only viable on a large scale if youre looking to maximize profits. The way i see it myself is if im using the hardware anyway, it is mostly just straight profit to me. Another savings account if you will that stacks while im at work, sleeping, gaming, etc.

"employ some logic please". The logical thing would be to determine whether this brand new fucking twitter account and website is legit or not. The less logical thing to do would be to jump just because someone said so, regardless of that person's status or accomplishments.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:04:57
Seemed like you were implying if i knew more background information that should sway my opinion. My direction with this discussion was aiming towards not quickly jumping on anything and everything in general solely because someone says its legit. Understood though no worries.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:08:14
Did either of you even watch the video? Lmao this is the OPPOSITE of fud. The guy being interviewed says himself he is invested in block-chain tech and if he were to discuss where bitcoin would be in 6 - 12 months the lady asks him "over 10k"? he immediately says yes, "over 15k?" he immediately says yes again and kind of cuts her off as in he is predicting quite a rise in the next year.

Think about this a bit. I'm not implying that he's lying. But i'm also questioning just taking someone's word for it and I don't care who that person is. I hope to god that they are legit because I would order some in fact. I am only questioning and learning simple as that. "what does adam have to gain from lying about this"?: refer to the first sentence directly above your response. ONCE AGAIN I am by no means implying that just digging and trying to gain knowledge before jumping to conclusions because of a tweet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:14:34
If a bank freezes your account for depositing funds from bitcoin and no other influencing factors I would immediately contact an attorney. If within the US at least.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:10:22
The only negative i received out of the entire interview was that he states bitcoin is a little jagged around the edges and they are essentially (without saying) that they have no idea where or when a correction is coming in either the BTC market or the STOCK market which is essentially stating a "due theory".
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:27:46
Leave that out? You leave it out in your initial claim of drawing only 1350 watts. ppl looking into mining might not be nerds and are novices therefore they will not know that includes undervolting so why leave it out? And to your first sentence, you just proved my point. You cant claim 1350 at the wall with a 12 card rig if you just said yourself it depends on the card. I'm not gonna fucking argue with you point is not every 12 card rig is going to pull 1350 from the wall. Your initial post should have stated 1350 at the wall depending on type of card, mobo, cpu and over/underclocking, etc.  So instead of starting this ridiculous back and forth garbage by stating "i must know better" just back ur claim up of 1350 at the wall initially. Neither of us are right or wrong it depends on whether you are assuming every reader here knows how to undervolt or not. Now get back to tending to your rig as this is quite useless. Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:52:39
Maybe you should have provided the premises since YOU ARE MAKING THE CLAIM. Fuckin loser lmao.

Dont get me wrong i have some nice things but not EVERYTHING.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:17:24
Honestly GPU's nowdays are built for a lot of gaming. I have mine pretty much factory clocks (+100 mem on the 1070). Ive had my 960 for 2 years still doesnt skip a beat 1070 is new-ish. I would assume that it would burn them out "faster" than normal wear but I have yet to actually burn out a card in my lifetime. I would be surprised if i cant get AT MINIMUM 3 -5 years out of this 1070 without any other unrelated issues. I have reduced the power output to them to improve elec cost (which isnt much anyway $0.10 kwh where i live). As long as you keep your temps in check which is around 75c max you should be fine. mine run at 57 and 63. The worse is probably constantly starting and stopping as obviously heating and cooling expands and contracts which could wiggle something loose i suppose. In all my research ive found that should be no problems. Yeah i might burn one out in 4 years instead of 5, but by that time im upgrading anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:33:42
Rofl. Hes not just talking about bitcoin. Hes talking about the economy in general including standard assets and funds. So what he doesnt say all hail btc he endorsed blockchain as well as predicting a future for btc. Not once did he rattle me with any statements about bitcoin ALONE bursting. He is basically stating the entire fucking economy is due for some downtime because its been 8 or 9 years since the last economic collapse. How do you derive at bitcoin bubble from that? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:12:39
No problem. I am pretty informed on a number of cryptocurrencies and their use cases, some knowledge on blockchain tech (not a ton), not much info on the developers (will work on that), etc. Which im assuming is about, lets seeee, MOST of the ppl that are hopping on board at this time. I am not quite sure what the big deal is that I am not an expert? Thank you for your input though im sure everyone looking to learn more in this space would appreciate it as well.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:27:31
Im mining on nicehash so with both gpus running im at about $3 a day. Im sure i could get more profit if i mined coins directly but i like the ease and simplicity of nicehash and i prefer btc anyway. My daily earnings fluctuates between $2.70 and $3.25
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:27:58
Dude in the video sounds pretty damn smart to me though. Pretty much tells her straight up he predicts bitcoin well over 15k within 6-12 months and is intrigued by block-chain tech and is personally invested in it. Seems pretty good to me. But then again, i actually watched the video.
edit: also, he claims distributed ledger tech is the future. Once again, seems pretty solid.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:31:52

So to make this easy for me in the future, as it stands now: Say i have 10k invested (spent) on BTC. One day that turns into 100k. I could essentially sell, transfer my 100k to my bank, and pay the long term cap gains tax of x% and all is kosher?

rofl i wish i could have "special cards". i just said with undervolting its possible. no need to get all butthurt about it. So my statement is accurate please read above: "undervolting them puts them at 1200 - 1300 for the cards alone". Nothing innacurate there.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:59:51
AFAIK you would only have to report any tradings from coin to coin or coin to cash. if you purchase btc and simply hold, even if it has grown in value, you have not realized any capital gains. I believe the trading from coin to coin or coin to fiat triggers a taxable event. Therefore, i believe you would pay taxes on any earnings from trading one coin to the other, or to fiat, etc. If this has always been a loss you can try and calculate what that actual loss is (good luck) and possibly report it as a capital loss. But once again AFAIK if you bought bitcoin and simply just still have it there is no taxable event and you don't need to do anything unless you convert it back to fiat. PLEASE NOTE!: I am not a CPA, Trade professional, or Tax accountant. This information is SOLELY from what i have read on here, other tax info sites, etc. Anyone can chime in if this is completely wrong or have better / more information.

@_date: 2017-11-03 09:46:56
Nobody wants to spend it or pay with it because it is rapidly increasing in value. If it ever levels off at its peak or "standard" for a few years with little volatility people will start looking at it more as a currency. How can it be a currency now? It can swing up 300, 500, 800 in just a single day. Hard to use it to buy something with that in mind even if said person plans on replacing what they spent. Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:45:20
Yes i think that is correct. But in order for the seller to make any money i think it has to be under that amount? Hopefully someone with more knowledge chimes in. Anyway that's what i was getting at is if the seller only profits if it is under $10k then it sounds like the seller is in for a big loss lol.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:17:46

Obviously you didn't actually watch this fool yip yap. He clearly states that he is invested in block-chain tech and predicts bitcoin well over 15k within 6-12 months. The worst i took from this video is he says bitcoin is "jagged around the edges". How the FUCK are you fools getting FUD from this? Do you even watch the shit thats posted on here? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:40:33
Hes labeling the entire economy a bubble dude. The first half of the video is about markets and ceo confidence and economic history not jack about bitcoin. I agree for sure the headline is entirely biased but for him the pretty much say that one would have to be an idiot for not endorsing blockchain tech as the future will sit well with me.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:32:32

@_date: 2017-11-29 02:37:52
Im not concerned with bloomberg one bit or any other of their articles. I am concerned with how many fucking conclusions everyone on here jumps too at some words on a webpage. He talks about CEO confidence compared to markets, etc and he talks about the economy as a whole and how its been 8 or 9 years since the last ECONOMIC collapse he isnt talking about bitcoin being a giant fucking bubble or bursting. To say this is bitcoin fud you must also say that its economic fud and general stock market fud as well. I took more positives for blockchain tech and btc out of this video than i did anything else. But let me guess, you didnt even watch it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:00:02
Agreed with key word being reliable. I will add however you do not need ultra high speed. Unless of course you are setting up a warehouse full of miners then you may want to look into the actual internet usage more.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:48:15
That's not really okay with me im not 100% certain on the matter. That IS however, another reason the banks and most of government can fuck off and bitcoin is life.

@_date: 2017-11-03 13:49:31
S2x or not doesnt matter either way or whatever coin it is, is going to continue to increase in value as it gets adopted. Thats all there is to it. Most ppl will not spend it when it is rising as quickly as it has been. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:29:31
From what i hear and this is the direction im going is get some money into GDAX (other part of coinbase) and purchase there for no fees on limit orders. If you are trying to use credit card only then coinbase is easy as hell just fairly high fees.

You will always get the same quantity as long as you control your keys. If you have them on an exchange and don't get the quantity then that exchange imo is a scam. I don't personally think that is going to be the factor that makes us plow through the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:47:17

Nah, i really don't need to know that though :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:56:44
just the GPU's maybe. not the whole system. a 1070 draws 150w factory. even undervolting them puts them at 1200 to 1300 for the cards alone. The claim is true.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:38:34
I have mine on a ledger from the last fork and still awaiting instructions from ledger on how to get my bcash...

That's what i figured.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:11:45
I currently GPU mine on nicehash but thats because i currently have the GPU's to do it. My gtx1070 and gtx960 net me around $2.50 - $3.00 a day which isnt much but fuck it if i can add to my bitcoin why the hell not i already have the hardware in a gaming rig. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:25:51
"Under the terms, the buyer agreed to a price of $2,250.25 for the trade, meaning the seller collects that money if the price is less that $10,000 by the end of next year, and the buyer gets to purchase bitcoin at the strike price if it is higher." 
With the way bitcoin is going, who in their right mind would think it would be LESS than $10k by the end of NEXT year? I repeat the end of NEXT year. Or am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:29:21
Yes, by the time i would get an s9 and break even it probably wouldn't be very profitable anymore if at all. I mine with my gaming rig cuz i already have the hardware to do it whether i mine or not so i might as well put it to use to stack some coin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:01:41
What is googling something going to accomplish? So i now have some background on Adam from google. I will still take the same position and question it before i would immediately send money to a brand new website with a brand new twitter. Once again, I will be very pleased if this is legit and more and more signs and pointing towards that. The fact that you have an issue with questioning and challenging the initial assumption that this is real without any REAL backing or questioning except for hearsay and a tweet is unfortunate.

Wow amazing what a huge amount of FUD... But if ppl actually took 5 fucking minutes to watch the video this is main stream media acknowledging blockchain tech and confirming bitcoins positive future.

@_date: 2018-03-19 14:30:01
Im not defining a swing so that question is invalid. I am defining TRENDS. Zoom in to the 1 minute scale. What do you see? Zoom into the 1 minute scale a day later its probably entirely different. A trend is dependent on the timeframe you are looking at. on the DAILY CHART, you know, the one i was talking about, we are STILL in a downtrend, unless this possible higher low are forming sticks. Its not hard dude. Im sorry you are super bullish and it is looking that way on the short term but not on the longer term. Please don't make me repeat again. Its really not hard.
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:09:56
On the weekly and monthly it isn't an uptrend. Don't get me wrong im all for the price skyrocketing but in order to be an uptrend we need to see higher highs and higher lows. We are still waiting to establish a higher high. HOWEVER, we have established a lower high on the weekly chart which defines this as a DOWNTREND. I'm not sure what you are looking at but you may actually need to use your eyes and not just hopes and dreams.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:35:16
Even being pessimistic hes not wrong. Zoom out to the daily charts we are still very bearish. Just means hopefully more time to stock up!
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:24:45
Because this spike up doesnt mean its going up. We are STILL in a downtrend..
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:06:12
Agreed. However my viewpoint was on the *daily* as stated. The big turn for me is when i can confidently see higher highs and lower lows from our bottom out at 5873 on feb 6th and i do not see that yet i see a double top with possibly a higher low currently forming depending where we go from here. I definitely agree with people viewing charts differently and the scale on which those are viewed. Either way hopefully good things from here on out!
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:30:45
whats in 2 weeks? besides the usual back up to normal? i think 9,000 other people might ask you to elaborate as well.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:07:47
As far as i know its not a ban on bitcoin itself but a ban on trading ICO's which includes trading them for bitcoin or bitcoin for them. My guess is everyone panicked thinking bitcoin itself was being banned and most of us realized thats not the exact case and are now buying in the dip. Also I am guessing other people are figuring that out too and buying back (feeling stupid) / buying the dip. I am by no means an expert but a long time listener as well and that is my take on it.

@_date: 2017-10-23 06:51:54
I'm wondering as well. So if i transfer my coins to my ledger (i have already), when i transfer them back to say kraken or whatever exchange i will automatically have equal amount in BTG? TIA
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:50:24
Gotcha! Thanks guys
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:06:46
Interested as well. I have my BTC on a ledger nano s. Wondering if it will show the balance on there or once i transfer it to an exchange?
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:00:22
So to put even more simply if i had a million dollars in BTC (i wish) as long as i withdraw less than $600 per transaction there is no capital gains penalty? Is that per EACH transaction or day, etc? Sorry if this is a dumb question i know very little about taxes.

What you say makes sense but... As far as i know, as long as you have your recovery seed you should be able to recover your funds on almost any wallet. Meaning that if they were to "block", or etc, you could just acquire a different wallet and recover the funds and use that instead. Anyone feel free to correct me if I am wrong I am not an expert either.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:16:00
Either am I. But if you READ the replies they TELL YOU the answer. no programming needed...
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:26:24
Lol im 27. Why coudnt you retire with 1 mil? Invest part in the market, obtain assets, etc. Im different then most ppl i guess in terms of spending.  Surprises me how many ppl making 300k a year cant retire until after 50. Dont buy a 1mil house and an 80k car and blow ur wad on everything and anything could be retired in 10 years.

Can anyone inform me on if i can send my btc from ledger nano s to kraken or another exchange and will automatically get equal amount of BTG? Or does the exchange sent to have to first be supporting BTG? Or how I actually physically access BTG. Doesnt havw to be an in depth response unless necessary. Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:17:20
I want 5,000,000 accounts not 4.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:44:31
No worries! i just wanted to make sure i wasnt missing anything as i am not an expert on blockchain or bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:28:47
Youd rather die? Holy fuck dude u should talk to someone. Or maybe just do this thing called budgeting. Either ur an attention seeker or have issues. I would guess the first considering you now have pondered taking ur own life over fucking cryptos. Gtfo.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:42:51
Read  reply up top. Your coins are not actually stored on the wallet. It is just a key to access your coins. Think of it as a car kind of. If my car is in your driveway you still can't drive it without the key. I can keep my car in your driveway or mine as long as I alone have the key then I'm the only one that can drive it. The car are the "coins" and the key is the ledger or any other wallet.

Why would fiat need to make it? It doesnt matter if it does or doesnt. 2 mil is 2 mil whether its in crypto or fiat. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:43:36
Il take 5,000,000.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:32:15
Okay so from what i get it will determine if whether or not Kraken or whatever exchange one is using will support the new "coin" (BTG). As far as actually being able to send it to the exchange and sell / buy. My next question then would be is there an expiration on the possibility of a replay? Or would one always have to be wary about making a transaction on one side of the fork replaying to another. I don't need a super in depth response as i am still researching and can learn on my own but just curious if replay possibility is indefinite or not (If that makes sense)?

No offense but i doubt "pepperjackjesus" has 750k in bitcoin and still holding. Could be entirely wrong but most ppl with that amount of money don't broadcast it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:59:16
Yikes! Good thing i had said correct me if im wrong cuz i didnt know. Im not a tax expert and wasnt giving advice jackass.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:32:03
Do you or anyone else know if Kraken plans on taking care of the split as well? TIA
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:22:22
WTF is that going to help him with. Hes worried about his $6K on his COINBASE ACCOUNT. THAT HE CANT GET INTO. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:41:00
Are you saying thag the BTC got received, and then sent to another address? Thats not forwarding.. he sent the btc to the wrong address and when the person realized it they most likely sent it to another one of their storage addresses. No different than making a singlr transaction if im not mistaken? Just want to make sure that ACTUAL "forwarding" a tranaaction is possible or not. You have to HAVE the BTC in the account before u can send it obviously?
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:45:16
I am not sure if the phrase is created by the wallet to be honest. Maybe someone else can enlighten us. But once again as  said, ledger and trezor are supported by other options.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:33:33
Can i ask how sending them to an address can end with them being forwarded to a different address? Im not understanding why they woudnt go to the address u actually sent them too...?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:15:25
so what about my 24 words ledger gave me?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:44:07
Really sold me on the "warranty". Wouldnt want my stations breaking or anything.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:33:29
Just to make sure by "back up the keys" you mean just keep multiple copies of the 24 word recovery phrase correct?
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:02:53
Rofl so where do you buy your bitcoin the local swap meet? Im willing to bet you trust a third party enough to buy it THEN take it off an exchange. "DARWIN". 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:26:20
I think he is saying can he move his coins to the ledger and still get the split coin (btg). Maybe?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:21:10
If i held 190 BTC i would just remove myself from said position and retire. But that's just me. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:41:31
I also came across this on the official ledger wallet site. Seems like they are going to let us know what to do as soon as they are able to.
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:48:47
conspiracy? LMAO.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:45:52
With YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE. Are you reading any of these replies? lol
