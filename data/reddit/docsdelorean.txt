I like bitcoin, but I can't help but roll my eyes when guys like OP call fiat money "fake money". You're delusional if you seriously think that
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:42:50
I love how the media is labeling anyone pro bitcoin as " defying trump!!!" common
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:11:39
what planet do you live on? lol Democrats love to take away liberties.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:52:42
It's always about choosing the lesser evil, and democrats by far are the most evil.

I don't see you getting a good ROI from this 
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:27:13
Fiat works without electricity but not without the govt backing it. Bitcoin needs electricity but doesn't need a government..... Yeah its easier to get electricity than a functional government when both are missing.

@_date: 2018-10-17 03:37:54

anonymous payments will get shut down one day, idk why fanboys/anarchist don't get this. Society cannot survive if criminals can move money freely.

smh, you guys that believe Libra is bad for bitcoin/cryptocurrency or refuse to see the big picture are idiots. Like it or not, the fact that this is backed by fiat is important. they have the potential to put Libra in the hands of nearly 1/3 people on earth.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:43:56
Trump would go down as the bitcoin president.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:41:35

@_date: 2019-02-09 03:04:31
This guy maybe right but if you only own a few hundred dollars of Crypto you won't ever get wealthy. You'll just get a nice return

The US has sent aid to Venezuelans, denying a dictator access to funds was the right thing to do.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:40:31

@_date: 2019-04-20 17:46:31
USA doesn't want the corrupt govt to have money to keep fucking their citizens over.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:06:38

McAfee is not a good spokesman for anything, nothing he says can be taken seriously
@_date: 2018-11-08 02:57:10
This is a stretch
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:56:59
Your comment makes no sense

@_date: 2019-01-09 13:00:22
Crypto does need rules, other wise it'll crash and burn. The cryptocommunity has some toxic anarchist and it's not good for business. Gemini, Coinbase, ETFs, etc are all good regulation for crypto. Don't like it? Don't use them. You anarchist can stick to Monero, and let the rule followers lead the way. Now that is freedom. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:04:35
You could say this about every successful product or business that uses the internet.

I could think of a million charitable things to do than buy a car that cost as much as a house then brag about it
