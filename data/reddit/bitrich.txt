NEVER accept PayPal for bitcoin. You can get a charge back up to 180 days later.
I know it's tempting because of the high premium you can charge but trust me. From a years experience doing it back in 2013. You will most likely lose more than you gain in the end. PayPal will back the thieves also.

Other than high deposit fees for credit cards I have had nothing but good experiences there. Customer service is truly awesome. Instant response. Once I added a new card to make a deposit but was having issues with my cam and could not verify the card. Without any prompt I got a call 15 mins later from coin.mx customer service asking if I had any issue and what they could do to help. Very rare in bitcoin exchanges. I have to respect that. I just wish the site was faster, less buggy and cheaper deposits for CC's

I'm not saying another crypto couldn't take bitcoin's spot eventually. But it wouldn't happen overnight. If a newer coin or system proves to be better or solve some big problem and bitcoin can't be updated or patched to compete I'm sure it will gain the majority of users and market cap with time. But for right now bitcoin has the network effect and market cap which is one in the same speaking in terms of coin to coin. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:19:22
CC companies generally charge around 3% per transaction. And I read somewhere that something like 12% of payments made by CC are eventually charged back to the merchant from the banks. Leaving the merchant to eat the loss. So from this perspective payments made in bitcoin are a huge advantage. No risk of chargeback, minimal transaction fees of about $0.10 currently. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:11:35
Last I checked you can set the tx fee in the options, but you may need to do that on the desktop site. You can select generous, recommended or frugal. I believe the recommended is $0.10 right now but has been as low as a penny or two at times. These settings need to be adjusted over time. If you choose to pay no tx fee you will be waiting a day or two for it to confirm if at all.

So you feel like 2.1 quadrillion units is not enough to serve a substantial economy? 
 That being said, I don't believe bitcoin will be the one world currency. But I think it will take a respectable sized market. And once again I never said bitcoin was impervious. I just said the network effect is the reason a clone of bitcoin does not immediately have the same utility or value.
 Also, I believe if myspace was open source and decentralized, it would have been able to evolve much more efficiently. I believe a decentralized social network will end up killing Facebook in the coming years. The point is I agree the network effect is in no way impervious.  Technically it would be very easy for everyone to switch to another crypto currency. But it would be a much slower process I believe. And I think bitcoin will be the most trusted until the average person is comfortable using cryptos.
I agree scalability needs a solution. And I have read several great ideas to fix that issue. I'm confident as bitcoin evolves that problem will be solved. There is major incentive to make sure bitcoin is prepared to scale. We're seeing things in the works already.
I am curious what your opinion is on the future of crypto in general and if you feel the blockchain protocol will innovate in other areas other than currency?

I think the stream of bad news subsided, based on past patterns we were due for a reversal. Once the downtrend broke good news began to have effect on the price. Many people are expecting a big move this summer due to faster than expected growth and are trying to get in early. Also, bitcoin has shown it's resilience and has gained confidence. More people are learning what it actually is and can do.
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:19:36
Cheapest is coinbase.com but you won't get them instantly. There a verification process. If you have a debit or credit card and don't mind paying about 5-7% over average you can sign up, verify and buy bitcoin or litecoin instantly at coin.mx. I've used them several times with no issues. The whole process for a new member takes less than 30 mins.

Get set up with coinkite, bitpay, or coinbase. Use cold paper wallets for any long storage if you choose to hold some. I would plan on holding at least a small amount this is good for the economy. Use a payment service as mentioned above while you learn about cryptos. When you feel comfortable you can set up your own system for accepting payments and liquidating as needed. No need to run a full client that requires a download of the entire blockchain. Plenty of light clients can be used. Once you realize the implication of this new technology you'll realize crypto currency isn't going anywhere, it will evolve of course and so should you as needed.  This is alot like when the beginning of the internet and email

The IRS can tax any sort of income of US citizens. That being said I think they will have a hard time with taxing most bitcoin users. US exchanges will have to report to the IRS just like etrade. But remember you only owe on realized profit. If you stay in crypto as a base you don't owe taxes. Only when you sell for USD. So basically they are taxing USD gains made from bitcoin. Personally I only trade to increase my crypto holdings I never stay in fiat long. I think that's the strategy that will pay off longterm

You'll need to look on his computer and/or smartphone for bitcoin wallets first. Also look for paper wallets wherever he may have hidden them. If you have no idea how to look for a bitcoin wallet on his computer start by going to the start bar and looking through programs. Open his browser and go to blockchain.info. Click wallet in the top right, if he has a wallet there it should show a string of numbers in the identifier text field. Then you'll need a password and possibly a 2 factor code. You'll have to post your findings for additional help. Whatever you do DO NOT post any pics of paper wallets or QR codes. This could be a private key and it will get stolen instantly if you post it. A wallet address will start with a "1" and be followed by a string of about 30 characters or so I believe. It's ok to post a public address. Be careful who you share any other info with while you are searching.

Payment can be accepted by presenting the customer a simple QR code on screen. I would recommend processing bitcoin payments in house. You could sell as much as needed instantly through coinbase or another exchange. I'm sure you'd be surprised at how many people would accept payment from your company in btc. 
If it's more practical to pay a processing company to accept the btc and pay your company in USD, coinbase, bitpay, gocoin are all great and cheaper than CC processors but will charge a fee for their service.
Benefits for customers:
 Customers could have the ability to pay for a service anonymously without having to sign up for a membership or provide any personal information.
 It can be made a very fast and simple process. Customer can click "pay with bitcoin", a QR code or text address pops up, the customer pulls out their favorite bitcoin wallet (or clicks a browser button to open a browser integrated wallet) scans the address and sends payment. 
 Without all the processing fees, chargeback risks, and additional security required to keep a customers personal information secure, your company should be able to offer a discount to the customer for paying in bitcoin or litecoin. Similar to cash discounts offered by many retailers.
 Since bitcoin is very new and not yet widely adopted, the market value is likely to increase exponentially within the next few years. Many people will be looking for ways to spend their new purchasing power and it would be silly to turn your back on this new economy. Many earlier adopters have already made huge gains and are looking for places to spend or just support bitcoin. (Look how successful overstock and tiger direct have been without large scale promotions.)
Benefits to the merchant:
 0 risk of charge backs. (Being an online retailer in the past I know this accounts for a good % of lose annually to anyone accepting CC's as payment)
 Much lower processing fees than CC's. Especially if you accept and process bitcoin payments "in house" which is simple. 
 Lower costs to provide security for a customers personal information. 
 Once bitcoin is more widely accepted, a portion of the company's holdings can be kept in bitcoin which offers many additional benefits. Deflationary, secure, borderless, easily transferred, etc.
 Your company can take advantage of the current buzz and also the bitcoin demographic. Your almost guaranteed to get a boost in business even if just people looking to support bitcoin.
 By accepting crypto currency as payment your company will be supporting freedom and privacy. If the banksters decided to attack the porn industry some day your company is at their mercy because they flip a switch and your accounts are frozen. With bitcoin no one can freeze your account or otherwise control your funds unless you lose or give away unintentionally the private key.
That's all I can think of at the moment but this is an innovative, emerging technology that has lots of potential. The implications are world changing and the new ideas for how we use and think about money are enormous. Your company can either be at the forefront on technology and innovation or be left behind. If you make the process simple and easy and allow customers to pay quickly without a membership or personal information, if will be a news worthy event and will really show people the potential.

While.I have to admit he's right, in my opinion its highly unlikely that bitcoin will lose its position as most capitalized crypto at least for the next several years. It has the most users and market cap because it has built a certain amount of trust with users and investors. Yes another system or.coin could prove a better option eventually but the chances are low that it would happen overnight. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:30:14
Like saying there's no reason to use Facebook when "studentface" or some other clone works the same. It's the network effect, and you can't clone that. It takes time to build. Then you could say, why use an alt when you can do the same with bitcoin? Once most of the speculation dies down and people use bitcoin for more utility, then yes a larger market cap gives it more stability and utility. Once everyone realizes that they will use the highest market cap coin

*i said it seems trollish, i didnt directly call you a troll. in fact i didnt think you were a troll.
the fact is dumping 3000 coins on any one of the most liquid exchanges will definitely have an effect but maybe not as much as your thinking. the part thats not a fact is that any coins from the 30k being auctioned will be dumped at all much less all at once. 
for reference we just had somewhere around 5000 coins dumped in the last hour at just one high volume exchange.
i understand that you may have just been hoping to offer advice to others and possibly help them out and i also understand you personally have something to gain if others take your advice i was just pointing it out. and then after you asked 
why its bad i pointed out its trollish to do that in my opinion. thats all. carry on and good luck

I'm pretty sure in every qt client you can input commands to dump private key (dumpprivkey). Then use a QR code generator to convert it to a QR. Save the image and print on paper. Obviously a paper wallet generator is easier but I've had to make my own a couple times for alts. Make sure you do everything offline and overwrite/delete all the info before going online

Yeah but wasn't the early 2013 bubble an increase of around 1000%? And the 2011 bubble an increase of around 3000%?
The last one was around a 600% increase so that seems correct. Slightly misleading having the % on the right side. I understand the patterns are similar and one could assume any bubbles in the future would follow this pattern with a more optimistic "post-crash" just curious about the % gains

hmmm. There has to be an explanation somewhere. Im sorry for your loss I know that has to suck. While ive never had a wallet hacked I have lost btc on several occasions by failed investments and even for a password to an encrypted key once.
Ive used blockchain wallet for a couple years now and never had an issue. I only keep a small amount there and I use every optional security feature.

A mixing service makes tracing bitcoin hard. I wouldn't say it makes laundering money easy. If you had a bunch of dirty cash it's still easier to launder it without bothering with bitcoin. On the other hand if you have bitcoin and just want remove your trail from it a mixing service works good. But that's not money laundering. Money laundering is concealing the source of funds that are the proceeds of illegal activity.

It's because if you accept payment in  bitcoin it's easy to bypass the sellers fees. I went through it all with paypal and ebay a year ago. First paypal froze my account several times, then finally closed it indefinitely. Then ebay started closing my ads. I found work-arounds for every rule until they finally just straight up said I could not sell bitcoin on their site. So I quit, then a few months later they allow it. Kinda pissed me off but I could easily get back in the game if I wanted

If even the smallest toe was dipped into pricing a small amount in bitcoin the value would likely rise dramatically thus making it more feasible. It could happen eventually but not overnight. It would have to be gradual and the bitcoin infrastructure would need more development. Which would accelerate if actual steps were taken toward pricing some oil in bitcoin

A lot of people bought around the top of the last bubble. Which means historically you'll have to wait about a year to be back in black. Bitcoin has only been a quick profits vehicle for a minority. If you bought in for the honorable reasons you should be willing to hang on at least until the general population see the same things you did. If you bought in to see a profit in less than a year you simply bought at the wrong time sorry. If you need the value now then exchange back to slave notes and carry on. If you want something better for your children then hold on and spread the word.

Personally I think a big advantage for consumers is when paying with bitcoin, you are not giving away any personal information. When you pay with CC you are giving out all the info someone would need to steal your identity or drain your bank account. And it happens alot. Identity theft is a huge problem. Bitcoin transactions are completely clear within 10 mins where as a credit card payment takes weeks to clear and can be charged back at any time up to 6 months later. 
Another benefit is the fact that you actually own and control your own wealth. You are not supporting an elitist organization that has enslaved the population of the world with a debt based monetary system that slowly drains the wealth from the holders of the currency and gives it to the private shareholders of the federal reserve.
As a holder of bitcoin, you have a guarantee that as the economy grows your assets become more valuable. Deflationary traits of bitcoin give the user an advantage. Eventually as the benefits are realized and trust is gained merchants will be willing to offer more discounts due to better profit margins and increasing value of the currency.
Other than that the utility is a benefit for many people who do international business or have a need to keep large amounts of value easily accessible and easy to transport. 
Many more advantages such as low transaction fees will be realized overtime as the numbers come out of what is actually saved annually

I have a Bither "cold wallet" on an older smartphone that remains in airplane mode and is not connected to any network. I have the "hot wallet" on my everyday smartphone. When signing a transaction with the cold wallet does it truly stay cold? I have a small amount of btc kept cold for testing and have had no problems so far (for about 4 months) 
It's open-source which I like but I do not know enough to vet it myself. Just wondering why I haven't heard about more people using it? If it works how I think this is a very secure setup that makes it fairly easy to spend from cold storage. Similar to what Trezor does. Does anyone have any opinions or input? Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:32:38
I disagree many merchants do offer discounts and incentives. We have only in the last few months had larger companies begin to accept btc and it takes time for them to actually see the financial benefits on paper and figure how much its worth to them

It usually reflects the value of usd being more at that exchange. In other words in may be harder to get usd in to the exchange which makes it more valuable. That may not be the case in this instance but usually there's a reason for it. There may be a larger supply of btc being sold there for some reason.

First off I never trust the opinions of anyone who writes "BitCoin" as if the name is some corporate trademark. Lol
The rate of supply argument is old and has already shown in the real world to be warantless. Perhaps at some later time it could be a problem but I tend to think it works perfectly. The merchants accepting bitcoin will lower prices as needed to tempt people out of their btc. With time as people build trust with btc and see the benefits in real life the discounts will be priced in and buying with btc will be much cheaper than fiat. Imo the speculative aspect helps attract new users and give btc a strong base. As critical mass is achieved the stability will grow and the user base may move more towards daily commerce than speculators. The environment will go through many phases. But know that for the same reason a person would want to hoard btc a merchant or payee will try harder to get that btc from the payor. With gold it's different because it's not as easily spent or transacted

Most people are naturally skeptical when you talk about the market price. Although the potential for very high market rate is adopted widespread it's best to talk about why we need a decentralized currency.
Start them with the history of money and how it came to be, they must understand this. Then explain how the current monetary system works and why the fed is stealing from us. 
It helps to understand why we need something like bitcoin first, then explain why we can trust bitcoin.
Then explain how using credit cards online is just giving away all your personal info and access to your account and how using bitcoin does not give away info. And how people can transact directly person to person from anywhere in the world by sharing QR code or address just like email.
If you can get them slightly interested, direct them to get on youtube and check out some videos by andreas antonopoulos. I find he has a way of explaining how bitcoin works in simple terms. 
Most of the people I talk to that insist its a scam or just a shared delusion are the ones who have no idea how it works or what it really is.  The implications of decentralized currency are hard for the average person to understand unless they understand why we use money and how the current system is the true scam

Buying your btc on the dips will help a lot. Honestly it stays fairly stable most of the time within 2-3% The major volatility only occurs around big news. A good portion of people playing poker for bitcoin are looking to increase their bitcoin holdings mostly so fluctuations are not an issue.
You could cash out regularly on coinbase just keep an eye on the charts so you dont sell during a flash crash and buy on a spike and you'll find it's not that bad in fact you may make some gains.

1. The market would react accordingly depending on the exact scenario (amount, possible intent, etc. ) I see no major issue in fact they may decide they need to at some point.
2. No not really. 
So far the environment has been somewhat inviting and many politicians are excited about the potential as well.
 Bitcoin can benefit anyone who takes advantage of it so what's the point in fighting it? 
Besides attacking bitcoin would likely only serve to force the protocol to adapt and close vulnerabilities and weaknesses as they present themselves. Evolving as needed to survive as it does now.
  In the end I believe they just want their slice of the pie and most are willing to give oblige that. For now at least. Just my 2 bits.....

If you buy bitcoin from a site that asks for you to verify your identity you have connected your name to the address. Same goes for selling. Same goes for posting an address on a forum or other site connected to your name or email address connected to your name. If you buy you bitcoin privately with cash, it's not connected to you. There are exchanges that don't ask for ID but it's rare these days since most have laws to follow. Bitcoin is not anonymous by default. It can be if you take precautions but buying bitcoin with cash or privately usually costs a little more than market price

Well it would depend on what type of manipulation you mean exactly.

I think there will be several sell offs leading up to the auction and depending on how high the bidding goes will effect what happens during.
But I think a few days after they are all sold we will see a big run up similar to what happened after the SR shutdown. I think the attention it receives will help. Also this will likely bring in some new whales who have been waiting for more supply so they can jump in with large positions.
 Ever since the government seized the coins there has been an air of nervousness in the market as to what will happen. I think after they sell and bitcoin shows resilence it may spark a buying frenzy that could be just what is needed for the beginning of a major summer bubble. Why not? So far the pattern has been fairly close to repeating again. It becomes somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy when everyone is expecting it.
In the big picture it doesn't matter much to me my strategy lately is just hold and save up my fiat for dips then buy. At this point I can pretty much spend btc for most of my shopping. O lyrics things i still can not pay with btc is my rent, utilities, and gas. And I'm working on getting my landlord to accept rent through coinbase.
TL; DR: decrease in price for the short term, increase in price within a couple weeks after the auction.

Regardless of deflation, demand will always play a big part in market rate. Lending practices would evolve. Inflationary currencies demand interest be paid on loans to cover loss of value in the currency. A person still has incentive to loan bitcoin if they will receive more bitcoin back. How much it takes for a person to want to loan btc would depend on the risk. There are already btc loan platforms so it's definitely plausible. As far deflation causing hoarders, you have to think the merchants of products will have the same desire to have that deflationary currency as the customer does to keep it. Therefore the merchant will have to lower prices to a low enough level to make the customer want to spend the btc. In a free market these things will work themselves out naturally as they are. The incentives and risks will just be weighed differently and we may see completely new SOPs for loans and financial services.

The claim that the past bubbles were all created because of this bot is completely ridiculous. What about all the huge amounts of btc being purchased and still purchased on other exchanges? What about the millions and millions of dollars of capital investment going into bitcoin start-ups? What about the entire infrastructure that has been created and is growing rapidly? This report is interesting but suspiciously exaggerated and timed. Powers that be are scared to death about what's coming and  the idea is spreading fast. Whether this happened or not doesn't change a thing about what bitcoin is. Before long we wont be worried about how much fiat bitcoin can buy but the general purchasing power.

I think more will actually do this eventually.  As more people trust that the value will grow it will be hard to pry the btc out of the hands of customers...and the merchants will want it just as bad so they will have to give better discounts better representing their savings and the deflation 
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:23:14
I think as confidence grows more retailers will offer deeper discount for using bitcoin. The merchants are the ones saving the money right now. 
The best benefit for consumers right now is the privacy. When you use bitcoin, you shouldn't have to give out your personal info. That being said I'd like to see a wallet that somehow signs signs a transaction with a shipping address. So it can go lime this, find an item you would like to purchase, click buy, send btc, receive package. No sign ups, no personal info. Blockchain info is the receipt. I think if this was possible at most merchants we would have an awesome selling point and use case.

I think he was pretty clear that he is not endorsing any company, and you would be a fool to think any bitcoin related company is low - risk or ask for long term predictions. And he would be a fool to endorse any company that he does not personally have control over. Do your own homework and decide how much risk your willing to take.

The biggest breach is that you do not have title to the bitcoins in your xapo vault. You basically gave your bitcoins to xapo and are trusting them to keep them secure and give them back when you want them. If you don't have a private key you don't have bitcoins.
As far as paper wallets misplacement, just make backup copies. Make an encrypted paper wallet with a simple PIN or password so if someone steals it they still can't get your btc. Then you still have another somewhere else. Paper wallet made securely offline with backups is the safest for long term storage.
And yes xapo insurance only covers $100 IF the breach is not your fault.

In that case it could be proven that you bought bitcoins only. The address you send to could be connected to a person or service. If you want to make them near impossible to track, use a coin mixer service. I do not use them so I do not have one to recommend but they are out there just Google it. Make sure you research the mixer service you are about to use to make sure it's not a scam. Only use one with a good reputation. There are other ways like trading to an alt coin and then back but a mixer is the easiest. 
One could make a fresh paper wallet, send coin through a mixer and to the fresh address. The trail is broken

I've literally never had a problem using bitcoin.  Some have, but pit in perspective,  many more millions of people have had their CC amd personal info stolen and sold. Recently target, michaels, etc. 
Many, many more people have had their CC'S as well as their complete identity stolen than people who lost bitcoin  that's a fact. 
The few hundred million in dollars lost at gox is miniscule compared to the billions lost in legacy banks and investments. Enough to cause many financial crises, depressions, recessions,  etc.
With bitcoin one only needs to secure their keys....with traditional banks and investments you literally have no control. Yes you have some insurance but that means nothing when the value of your dollar is being robbed from the back door. If bitcoin had lost 95% of its value from the beginning (like USD has) it would be dead amd Noone would want any.

I can exchange to btc instantly and save around 5% (after btc buying fee) on just about anything I normally buy. If I use cash I dont. How is that not savings?
Not to mention the appreciation of the bitcoin I already had. It's a huge incentive for me. I'm not buying things I normally wouldn't buy. I'm not just dying to spend my bitcoin. In fact in most case I would rather spend fiat I hate giving up bitcoin. But saving 6% adds up. Groceries are what I've bought mostly. My gf bought me a grill from home depot for father's day with bitcoin. The btc she spent she bought awhile ago so she actually saved around 75% if you look at the appreciation. But even if she exchanged btc just for the purchase she would have saved $20.
I don't see how that is anything but good.

I think anyone bidding in the auction knows any short term price change is insignificant and would still attempt to buy and cheap as possible. I don't think manipulation is required for bitcoin to increase in value and I'm sure someone spending around 1.8 million on bitcoin understands this as well.
That being said I believe the minimum winning bids will be well over what market was friday.

I'm truly suprised at the lack of diligence coinbase has had towards security. Not only do I agree with your suggestion but they need to implement 2FA verification for ALL transactions in or out. Like just about ALL good trading sites do. All a hacker needs to do is get past log-in and they can do as they please. 
How about an option to only allow withdrawals to a specified address? Maybe at least an email verification before any w/d or purchase? So many ways they could improve. 
This is NOT a new discussion people have been asking coinbase for more security for months now. I've seen nothing done other than coinbase securing themselves more. How about your customers?
Please coinbase implement a second verification for any transaction or security settings change!!!!!

Mt. gox is an exchange. It's where people meet to buy or sell bitcoin. When you have bitcoin in your gox account, you don't really control those bitcoin. Gox does and they add credit to your account. There is not 2 objects. All bitcoin are credits stored on the blockchain. What you have when you say you have bitcoin is a private key that is sort of like a deed for bitcoin. When you store bitcoin, you are actually storing a private key. The thief steals the private key. 
When you leave bitcoin on gox you do not have the private key, you gave it to gox. When you keep your private keys offline under your control they are very safe. When you give your private keys to a website you are trusting them to return them and keep them safe.

It's fairly safe for everyday use but I wouldn't store large amounts of bitcoin in anything other than a cold wallet.

I had the same thoughts right after overstock began accepting btc. I think it's a natural development. 
Imagine a shopping center like walmart...walk in...spot an item you like that ...scan a QR code and pay...item scanned to check it has been paid as you leave....or for deliverable items...scan a QR code and pay....item is shipped to your door...this could easily be accomplished by using using a wallet app that stores your shipping address and send that's info with payment.
It could work well at restaurants and bars as well. But I think it will naturally move toward that as crypto becomes widely used.

I could literally spend btc for almost all my daily transactions only I don't like to risk the possibility of getting priced out and my holding balance decreasing.
If I had a wallet that was set to keep a specific balance of btc I can spend freely and maintain the amount I want to hold for speculation as well.

Printing more currency to compensate for a more value coming into an economy is only ok when the "printer" owns the value.
In other words, when our dollars were backed by a fixed amount of gold, in order to inflate the currency you would need to own additional gold to represent the currency you print.
So tell why you think it's ok that the currency you hold is devalued by printing more currency out of thin air? Who is owed the value for that currency printed out of thin air? The federal reserve, the "privately-owned by secret shareholders bank".
But many are taught this is "decent monetary policy". Think outside the box a little. If you work hard for a token or note that represents a certain amount of value, why does the issuer have the right to take that value back over time?
It shouldn't matter how you choose to store or save your value (money) 
And BTW inflation still steals the value of your dollar no matter if it's invested in stocks or under a mattress. That's a common misconception and many will tell you inflation encourages investment and spending.
If I'm wrong please enlighten me and explain why.

All based on the misunderstanding that bitcoin is a completely anonymous currency by default. You have to take steps and risks for it to be completely anonymous. It's pseudo - anonymous because you don't give away any personal information when you pay someone in bitcoin. That is all. It'll take time before the average person understands what bitcoin actually is. There's definitely a learning curve. Which is why I'm more than happy to try and help all I can. I'm no expert by any means but I'm fairly well versed in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-04 05:41:09
If you buy bitcoin and transfer to another address. And that address is can be connected to for instance tigerdirect. Then it has been tracked. When you use a mixer service your coins are added to a pool of other coins. They are mixed up and redistributed back. So basically you are trading your btc for other btc that has been scrambled through a bunch of different addresses. That's the only way to be truly anonymous. That's why it's completely ridiculous that some people are so worried about money laundering.  Cash is way easier to launder..every btc transaction is recorded on the blockchain forever. All it takes is connecting an address to a person one way or another. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:08:19
Ok so explain step by step what you did. Did you create an electrum wallet on an SD card only? How did you backup and where did you store the seed? Was your wallet encrypted with a password? Did you ever send btc from the wallet and if so how?
Personally I've never heard of pi wallet are you sure they are legit? Seems that your btc was sent from the address right after 1 btc arrived at the address.

@_date: 2014-06-14 19:43:53
It's a win. What's happening is merchants that have recently began to accept btc are realizing the savings and beginning to pass it on to consumers. 
This process will take time but it will inevitably occur as long as bitcoin continues to grow and succeed. I would expect 10-15% discounts to pay with bitcoin in a year.
The obvious merchant - end savings from lack of charge backs and CC fees is beginning to show. What will show with more time is the built in deflation. As time passes are more merchants grow confident that bitcoin will be worth more in 6 months that it is currently we will see discounts for that as well.
User incentive will fuel the snowball.

Bither for android has something like this. Once you download the app you have an option for "hot" or "cold" wallet. What you can do is install the "hot" wallet on your everyday phone and install the "cold" wallet on an older smartphone that is normally not connected to a network. Then using the hot wallet scan a cold address as "watch-only". To complete a transaction from a "watch-only" address, you need to sign it with the cold wallet. It's not perfect but it works well and it's convenient.

But to answer your question, there is no personal info given during a bitcoin transaction only your public address. This is one reason it's better than credit cards. Every time you use a debit/credit card you are trusting that person with alot of personal information. With bitcoin they only see the address the btc came from. If that address is not publicly connected to your name or info they will never know who you are. If you bought the btc at an exchange that you had to verify your identity first, the average person couldn't track it to your name but the authorities could.
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:13:02

I have to say, cex.io is alot better IMO.
With cex.io, you have a highly liquid (to btc) asset with an incredibly high dividend (relative to others)
True the price per ghs is higher than hardware, BUT you will be waiting for that hardware to arrive for several weeks or even months in most cases. You also have to maintain that hardware and constantly monitor is basically. Also, you can NOT buy and sell your hardware to generate additional profit several times per day. LOL
This is why I believe cex.io's ghs is higher priced than hardware and very well should be. You can't really compare the 2 on a cost per ghs basis at all IMO
Enter bit-mining.co
"ALL SALES FINAL"
8% yearly fee
priced at 0.04btc/ghs
This is NOT a liquid asset.
Its buying hardware instantly and avoiding hassles of hardware setup, monitoring, and possible failure.
Which SHOULD command a premium over normal hardware. But IMO is still way too high. If they had a trade engine and volume i would consider. But from what I've seen so far, cex.io is king IMO

And I personally believe the fee schedule is high and I have no need to use xapo at all.

My brother in law lost some BTC from the previous phishing site I posted coinbaise.com
At this point he had not realized how his account had been hacked and here is the response from Alex at coinbase:
JAN 14, 2014  |  12:00PM PST 
Alex replied:
Based on this information, it appears that an attacker was able to bypass your 2-factor security after you received your BTC from the sender. It appears that the sender unknowingly sent you a Trojan directly after the BTC was delivered. I remember you saying that your brother in law sent the BTC. That along with the fact the IP address linked to the computer that received the BTC is in Germany, is why I say it was done unknowingly. Unfortunately this type of malicious activity happens more and more. 
Please take the following precautions for the future: 
1) Create a new complex and unique password that is not shared or similar to those used on any other websites.
2) Take advantage of the 2-factor services we offer, either an extra SMS login code, or the authentication apps provided by google and Authy if you can download the smartphone app.
3) Bookmark  in your browser, and only ever use this link to access the website. 
4) You can check the IP login activity of your account anytime by signing-in and visiting this page: 
5) It's possible to limit the IP addresses that can access your account by using the "advanced" settings at the bottom of your account settings page: 
6) Practice due diligence when enabling any 3rd party applications to access your account, or when enabling and sharing your API key. By default these features are turned off, and are only used in more advanced situations. It's possible to see any 3rd party apps which have permission to use your account, whether the API access enabled, and further API restrictions on this page: 
7) Coinbase also offers the ability to create paper wallets for storing your bitcoins completely offline. This tool is an advanced function, but we'll be happy to assist if needed.
Unfortunately we're unable to reclaim or retrieve these funds since they've been sent outside of Coinbase. Whoever withdrew these did leave a trail however, and logged the IP 46.165.211.195 in our system. 
I hope this information helps, and please let me know if/when you'd like me to lift the hold on your account. Please don't hesitate to send us a message on this anytime if needed!

Thank you for getting back with me on this issue. The last time that I logged in was just a little while before I emailed you guys. And no I'm the only one that has any access to my coin base account and computer. After I found out what happened I gave my brother in law my info so he could look at it. He knows a lot more about BTC and how it all works. And he is the one that sent the BTC in the first place. I set up my account and did the SMS to my cell phone with a code after log in as my 2-factor verification. And no I haven't used the verify once every 30 days feature. I set the page up the night before this happened. And I had the BTC sent to the coin base account. My brother in law told me that he sent it so I tried to log in and couldn't for the rest of the day. I just figured that you guys were having technical problems. I haven't had any emails from you guys at all other than the ones responding to the emails that I sent you. I was lead to believe that this was the wave of the future and the safest way to store your money. I have my money on your site for a couple hours and someone steals it. I hope that we can figure what happened and why. $1,100.00 might not be a lot of money to some people but it is to me. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this issue.

All they really need is surrounding businesses to accept bitcoin and some easily accessible Bitcoin ATM's. The marijuana economy could be a closed loop Bitcoin economy. Dispensaries can liquidate as needed with ATM's which also serves to make Btc available to their customers. As long as people can use Btc for daily purchases locally there's no need for banks inside the MJ economy. If the local Colorado businesses want a piece of the MJ economy they will sign up for Coinbase or bitpay and accept Btc. Eventually as the gaps close banks will lose more and more business from Colorado commerce.

im refering to the word "crypto" not negative connotations directly with bitcoin. crypto just sounds secretive and possibly a little scary to some people. Im not asking for any official name changes just thought it was a descriptive nick name that most people understand.
If you already have negative opinions on bitcoin someone calling it something else probably wont effect your opinion. i just meant for those people who have never heard of crypto currency.

You can click "print" and when the drop - down menu that let's you select a printer comes up click "print to file" or "print to pdf" then save the file somewhere handy. Open it up and print it whenever you want. I suggest using the BIP32 option when creating the wallets with at decent password. That way if your pc is comprised and the file is accessed they would need the password as well to access any coins on the wallets.

But yes your right, a drug dealer for instance who accepts bitcoin through an illegal website, would want his coin to be mixed before he cash them out somewhere so he would not be. connected to the site. And that could be considered money laundering. But he wouldn't have to go through the trouble if he accepted cash. Cash is completely anonymous. That's all I meant.

I've.been bullish for over 2 years. I've bought at $10, $60, $100, $350, $500, $600, and even small amounts at $800 and $1200. Its tempting to think short term when you see a downtrend or some dumping but if your buying as an investment you really need to think in years. My advice is buy an amount that you can comfortably forget about for at least a year. Don't try to daytrade in a downtrend unless your experienced. You'll just get burned. And when you check a chart, set it to a log scale and zoom out where you can see at least the past 2 years. You'll feel alot better. Also, there is tons of capital going into services and infrastructure right now, it hasn't even had a chance to show real value yet. Give it time, if your that worried you probably invested too much. This is high risk high return, but personally I think the risk of bitcoin being worthless is pretty low at this point.

One other important thing. ALWAYS use 2 factor authentication for EVERY crypto related account you have as well as email accounts tied to them. With freedom comes responsibility and by exercising your freedom to be your own bank and secure your own wealth you take on the responsibility of securing it properly.

Use bitaddress.org and make sure to check the bip 32 box and add a password. 
What you want to do is go to bitaddress.org. ..save the page as html....disconnect your pc from the internet....then open the saved page to create your wallet(s)....print at least 2 copies and make sure to clear your browser cache before reconnecting to the internet....you can use a fairly simple password for the paper wallet since it won't be online.....
Now there are more careful and paranoid ways to do the same but this method is fairly safe and secure for most users..if you want to be ultra secure you would need a pc that has never been online and run the bitaddress.org html from a usb stick...there are tutorials if you google.

In the situation of no electricity temporarily one could still use battery powered devices like smartphones for trade. Paper wallets work well as long as there is an internet connect to verify funds. In the situation on no internet we would have much bigger problems than bitcoin, entire economies would shut down. Gold may still be valuable for trade but i'm guessing food, water, gas would be more valuable. Blockchain over radio is an option but would depend on electrical power.
But let's face it, in a situation where the world or at least a major part of it loses electricity AND internet connections we have bigger problems and my guess is gold would not be the most valuable thing to trade with. It all depends on the exac t situation. Like is it a long term outage or temporary? Has the world economy shut down? Gold gets much of its value from world trade markets and speculation. How much value does a hunk of gold have when your hunkered down somewhere and starving?

So your argument was why should one use bitcoin when alts can do the same thing and that the market cap of a coin provided no benefit. Mine was because of the network effect and yes it does. The best coin/system will take/keep the market cap in time but for right now it's bitcoin and yes it matters

The main thing is whether you have a complete keypair....public address and private key.
Coinbase doesn't give you a private key, basically they give your account bitcoin credit. So your trusting coinbase with securing your btc. And when/if your account is compromised your screwed they don't take the responsibility. 
With a complete keypair, you can secure your private key yourself and as long as you take basic precautions your btc is safe and can be accessed from almost any wallet software.

Yes if you trade use your crypto to buy something it could be taxable if you gained value. But this wouldn't be staying it crypto. This would be trading your crypto for something else. Let me clarify...If you buy bitcoin and just hold onto it your not liable anything until you liquidate it for something else. At that point you could possibly owe tax.

daily payout in btc for 20 ghs is currently around 0.00074 or around .24 cents USD.
this will decrease with every diff change.
maybe your confusing their daily dollar estimate with daily btc estimate. 
with these type of.contracts what happens is eventually the fees are higher than daily payout and your drained or contract is terminated. your better off just buying bitcoin directly.

Instead of actually learning and making an informed decision they would rather argue and defend their feeling of being smarter than everyone lol. Good job my friend the best way to get people educated is discussion on non bitcoin related forums. Think I'll start a conversation on one of my motorcycle forums. Lots of the libertarian type there. I can't afford to give away .8 btc but I can give away a small amount.

I think your wrong there is huge incentive. That's why we are seeing this explosion of bitcoin accepting merchants. Most are beginning to offer big discount for paying in btc because they are getting the data in and realizing the savings. Yes holding bitcoin too long would be risky for a business but some may be able to pay suppliers quickly as they receive btc.
Well just have to see what happens. I believe closing the loop is hugely beneficial. Once one starts others will follow

I think it was some sort of storage service. Most people it seems have never heard of flexcoin. The irony of a bitcoin storage service is you can store your bitcoin much more securely yourself. The point of bitcoin was no need to trust a 3rd party.  That's what it's designed for. People who are storing their coins at websites and exchanges are just asking for trouble. Fortunately using centralized exchanges and services for bitcoin is only temporary. Soon we will have distributed p2p exchanges and that is when bitcoin/crypto currency will truly shine. Until then don't trust anyone to hold your coins but yourself.

I think coinbase for one should guarantee the coin they store for users or allow users to secure their own private keys. And I think centralized exchanges should be for experienced traders only who understand the risk of handing over your coins to a website. 
We need to find a way to make it clear to new users that if they don't control their private keys they do not have bitcoin. And how to keep those private keys safe. There will be losses and people who do stupid things and blame bitcoin just like what happens with credit cards. I think the key is to educate newbs. Its not hard to keep your coin relatively safe. You don't need to be tech-savy to use an offline wallet. It just needs to be the standard. Not storing coins at an exchange

I was thinking the same thing. But I'm not sure they had any problems with bitcoin withdrawals either. Maybe this could go in a conspiracy thread but what if a dying exchange decided to make one last big move before leaving the scene. I find it hard to believe they weren't aware of TM. In fact there has been linked threads where the owner was warned. The first announce seemed tailored to cause a panic. Now this. Meanwhile people are selling their gox btc cheaper and cheaper. Timing would be perfect for this event because the chart still fits previous bubble patterns. I got a feeling March 1st will be an event for gox and whether they close or not btc will start it's up trend soon after. There will be a few massive buys when we bottom out. I'll be watching for those. At least it's fun to theorize. Lol

1. When receiving a direct bitcoin payment for a small value one there is no need to wait for a confirmation as long as the network propagation is decent. 
2. For larger value transactions one should wait for confirmations, the time it takes for a confirmation is usually around 8 mins but can vary, and every once in awhile can take hours but its fairly rare.
3. If one sends a transaction with no miner fee it usually still confirms but can take days in some cases or could fail and be returned eventually.
4. If bitpay is shouldering the risk of fee-less transactions by informing the merchant the payment is clear when its not yet, I would say tell your friend to talk to bitpay IF the transaction never confirms after a few days.

What your talking about doing would destroy fungibility first of all.

I think the patterns tend to be self fulfilling since so many try to follow previous ones and a lot of traders use the same strategies. We definitely have a ton of different variables in effect now that we didn't have in 2013 though.
The event your seeing was the silk road closure which caused a flash crash, followed by a quick rebound within 24 hours. That gave a lot of people new confidence since the belief for many was if SR was shutdown bitcoin would die along with it.
I think the sell pressure is a lot more consistent now coming from all the new merchants using payment processors among other things. We need buy pressure to build up to match it. (easier access to btc for crypto-curious, more obvious incentives for users, brainless secure storage (trezor)
IMO we may see a self-fulfilling rallly in the next week or so in anticipation of repeating patterns but I doubt it will have the steam to break resistance unless there is some big event or breakthrough. But something like that could happen any day.
There's no doubt bitcoin is growing fast and the fundamentals haven't changed so I'm still long term bullish all the way.
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:51:02
I wouldn't say that's a fact. They are quite hard to steal if stored correctly. Just holding your private key, setting a decent password and having a back up is more secure than any credit card or even physical dollars. Think about it, if you lose or destroy a dollar your screwed. You can always have a back up of you key(s). I would say the issue is people trusting their coins with others (exchanges, etc.) Or not knowing how to keep a private key safe. On the other hand, yes you are correct, IF it some flaw or backdoor was found that may it easy and cheap to steal bitcoins from wallets the price would reflect that. But one reason bitcoin has been so successful value - wise is because in 4+ years no one has successfully been able to hack a wallet without the owner leaving some security hole.
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:55:22
Its actually a great way to move the money.
It will be more cumbersome if your not already set up but once you are it is very simple and fees are negliable.
How you proceed has a lot to do with how much your actually looking to remit.
If your money is currently in an Australian bank account you'll need to set up an account with an exchange that is most compatible with aus and your bank account. Or, use localbitcoins and buy bitcoin privately p2p.
For buying, just make sure its either a reputable and well known exchange or if buying privately, try to have the seller send the Btc first. ALWAYS use escrow at least.
You'll want to negotiate a rate as low as possible of course and make sure to check bitcoinwisdom or other sites to see what the price range looks like. Remember exchanges with the lowest price are like that for a reason. (Fiat deposit costs, time, etc..)
If selling through Coinbase in the US just make sure your buying under their rate.
To lower volatility risk is just negotiate the best buy price you can and sell quickly at a predetermined exchange.
Take note that the only reason this whole process isn't simpler is the lack of banks support. The only hard part is when your converting in and out of fiat.
Only other thing I can say is make sure you use secure addresses. Use an offline wallet and have a backup in a different location. ALWAYS use 2 factor authentication on any website you use and keep your email secure as well.
It will save you money but for someone who doesn't have previous experience with Bitcoin I would recommend practicing with small amounts and getting used to everything before you play with Amy large amount of money.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:56:47
Basically exchanges are made for trading, from bitcoin to fiat currency or from bitcoin to other crypto currencies. People try to buy low and sell high to gain bitcoin or fiat.
Your private key is what you store in a wallet and call bitcoin. The actual units of value that is the currency is all credit on the distributed ledger that is called the blockchain.
When you fund an account at gox, you are transferring ownership of the units of value to gox and they give you credit to your account. 
No one knows yet what exactly happened to the coin but if they were stolen due to transaction malleability then basically what happened is the thief requested a withdrawal of bitcoin and later claimed he did not receive it. Because he was able to change the transaction ID of the withdrawal he was able to make it look like to gox that the withdrawal never happened and gox repeated the withdrawal. He or they did this over and over several years without gox noticing. Which is very hard to believe. But anyway.
It was well known for a couple years that a hacker could potential change the transaction ID after a transaction was made. So gox should have never been confirming transaction using the transaction ID. All they would have needed to do was check the address on the blockchain to verify transactions and the thief would have been unsuccessful. This is why it's hard to believe. Myself I believe that the cold storage wallets were seized by a government agency or they simply lost the private key and are unable to access the cold storage at this time. We will know eventually but I can tell you that bitcoin was not hacked and if users maintain control of their own private keys and store them correctly they will not get hacked and lose coin

@_date: 2014-03-03 21:41:51
Actually bitcoin will be more useful with a higher market value. If we are at $100k per coin the market will have stabilized due to infrastructure that brought us there. So if you had to move a large amount of USD with crypto, you would need a coin with a large cap so as not to move the market with your buy and subsequent sell. Also large cap means larger and better infrastructure. They wouldn't be worth that much for no reason. that's means better liquidity. Beyond the temporary spikes and dives we see as price discovery occurs in this very young and nascent technology, the price will reflect adoption rate and utility. And when your using bitcoin for anything but speculation, the market price does not matter.

I've never used bitcoin paper wallet myself but it's been around awhile and I've never heard of anyone having issues.
But the best way when using an 9 line paper wallet generator is to save the page with the generator as an offline file. Then turn off internet access and generate the address offline. Clear the browser before going back online. That way as long as you are using a legitimate generator there is no way the operator of the site can get your key. Then all you need to make sure of is that your using a clean pc that doesn't have malware.
I use bitaddress.org and create all my wallets offline and follow all the "paranoid" steps. bitaddress.org also offers an option to encrypt the private key showing on the wallet with a password. This way is someone steals the physical wallet they still cant access the btc. I've stored lots of btc in this way and never had a problem. I hope you figure out what happened here. 
Thank you for sharing this is the best way for us to weed out the scammers. In this case I'm skeptical that bitcoinpaperwallet stole your private key but it's certainly plausible.

I'm sorry to hear about that. I'm surprised as well. Coinbase is an awesome platform but the security sucks compared to other sites. I think they are one of the leading start ups and nows there chance to lock in their customers by providing top notch security and customer service to match. Stories like these go along way for a companies rep. They should be doing everything they can to make the newcomers feel safe and secure when purchasing and storing Btc with them.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:28:34
I checked it out as well. I haven't bought anything yet but I was pleasantly surprised by their large inventory of items. Looks very promising to me as well. I plan on making a purchase there soon I will update my experience.

Yes if you gain value by trading btc for a physical it is technically considered taxable per the IRS....but this also goes for anything...If you trade a rock for a car and gain value it's taxable...but I personally believe the the constitution laid out clearly what is legal taxation and what is not. and the IRS is not in line with the constitution. But that's a separate discussion.
I personally believe that taxing bitcoin will prove mostly unenforceable with time. That doesn't mean they won't try

Am I reading this correctly?
(The initial price per Divcoin is $5.00 CAD (USD/BTC equivalent). Fees are 0.00028 per Divcoin, per day, which will be automatically removed before payout.)
What is the fee per day per divcoin? If the above is in btc it's more than a divcoin generates in a day.
That aside, don't forget about difficulty, even if you forget about fees and add a very conservative estimate that the diff will only increase 10% every 15 days or so you quickly realize if will take a hell of a lot longer than 8 months to break even.
At a cost of $5 per gh/s your WAAAAY better off just buying BTC with that $5 you'll end up with more.
And as far as selling the coin after at that point the value will still be determined by what they can potentially payout so I doubt you'll get very much back although it may be more than they are actually worth seems ghs is always overpriced.
Maybe I'm missing something idk. Check out this maybe it will help

for starters
Bitcoinwisdom.com is great for basic charts. You can Google more info about trading strategies, analysis, candlestick charts, etc. 
My advice is don't over analyze it. Pick a strategy and stick to it you'll do better in the long run. Never panic sell or buy.

I allowed it. They recently teamed up with bit pay and now have a bitcoin directory for sites accepting and a few other upgrades. I thought it was a little sketchy myself but I don't currently keep any btc in that wallet so figured I'd test it. So far so good I guess

Where did you come up with that address? Is it somewhere you sent bitcoin before?
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:14:32
Depending on your volume of sales you may want to look into using Coinbase or bitpay as an option. They have api's that make it easy. But you'll have fee's to pay for the convenience.
 I believe with Coinbase the first $1mil of sales is no fees. For a smaller volume you may just be able to handle it yourself. Generate a unique address for each transaction simple as that. All your btc transactions are saved on the blockchain and you can sweep all the addresses to a main address as often as you like. You could even reuse addresses for specific products. Of course you will have to verify payments on a case by case basis if you did that.
Also, look into the "stealth addresses" there was recently a paper published on how it works. From what I understand you can generate multiple payee addresses for a single private key which would tidy up your system and also provide more privacy for your holdings. Above all, do your own research and really learn how the protocol works. Test it out and get familiar with small amounts of Btc if you haven't already. I recommend blockchain.info for an online "hot wallet" but you should keep your bulk offline.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:56:12
I would like to see a simple, user-friendly GUI for creating programmed transactions or contracts. And I mean really user-friendly. Like templates for a last will, recurring payments, lock times, betting, construction projects, trust funds, split bank accounts etc. All in one place. I know bitcoin is capable, but a lot of these arrangements are complicated for most people to set up. Maybe this exists but I'm not aware.

In my 4 years of experience, this has happened almost everytime btc hits all time highs. People move from alts to btc during the rally. Then shortly after btc starts consolidation or correction, alts start playing catch up and then they hit all time highs.
Not saying it's guaranteed, and I'm not buying alts at this time, just sharing my experience.
Disclaimer: I hold 90% btc and 10% split between 2 alts

I made a transaction of 389 bytes Saturday at around 11am EST,  paid 241/byte ($6.21) and it confirmed in 22mins. This was a high fee for my typical experience, the confirmation time was average to long from my typical experience. Maybe I'm lucky or is everyone just sending much larger size (in bytes) transactions?

@_date: 2018-02-16 03:47:14
Think of it like this. At the current price, there's only been about a 10 week period in the entire 9 year history of bitcoin that you could have bought some and not be in profit right now if you hedl. Every time there's a correction after an all time high there's plenty of people who feel the same as you do right now. If you haven't put yourself in a bind it's probably a better idea to just hodl and relax. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:05:29

@_date: 2017-10-28 04:50:06
Whatever address your coins are sitting in when the fork happens, will be your address on 2 separate chains. 2x and 1x. You'll have coins on both chains no matter what each is worth. Move your core coins first and then use your seed for that same wallet to a wallet supporting 2x and you will have split them. Then hodl or sell however you choose.............or do nothing and you'll still have the option later if you want.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:35:56

We are at knocking on the door of a bad bitch [here.]( 
She kept us warm on the cold night when 20k wasn't having it. She was there for us when 16k kicked us out, she's the one who kept us from falling. When 17k gave us the boot, she gave us a warm place to put our range inside of her for weeks. But ultimately, she could not take any more of our shit, and had to let us go on Feb 1st. That stung. FUD was spoken, and feelings were hurt. And boy did we go downhill from there.....
It took us hitting rock bottom, waking up in 6k's dirty bed of despair, with FUD on our face, smelling like broken dreams, regret, and bear shit, to finally take a look in the mirror and say "I've had enough, and I refuse to sink. I am good enough, I have real value, and dog gone it, HODLERS LIKE ME." 
We pulled ourselves up, took a shower, got a clean shave and a slick haircut and started walking back up that long road. And yes, at one point, we did turn back. When everyone is telling you, "you'll never make it, turn around while you still can, your transactions are too slow, your blocks are too small," it's hard to not discouraged. But after a couple nights sleeping in the bear-infested woods with the weak hands and the flippeners, we got it back together and continued on. 
[And here we are]( 2 weeks later, back at *her* door, the day *after* St. Valentine's day, begging for a place to put our price range while we get on our feet again. She doesn't have to let us in right away, she will likely resist our advances, or she could slam that door right in our face and walk away. And if she does we will just have to hang around somewhere between here and 9k, fending off bears and fudsters, until we build up the confidence and support to try again. But we won't give up. We know our future is bright and our destiny is so much bigger than her and her halfway house. We are the ALPHA COIN. And if necessary we will kick in the door. And in the future, after we come and gone, she'll be proud that she had us inside her so many times before we blew up.

There are drawing tools on most charts. Many different types for different strategies. There are also different indicators you can add to the charts for popular strategies. Myself, I like to keep it simple and long term. Some traders use lots of indicators and complex strategies. It's not a science by any means. No matter how complex your strategy your still just taking a guess. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 06:04:28
Yes mine are manually drawn but there are some tools that will add trend lines and indicators automatically based on criteria. Tradingview charts have them, I don't use them so I can't speak to how well they work or even how to properly set them up. Just experiment you'll figure it out. r/bitcoinmarkets is the sub for traders
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:26:36
Ok, I'm going to assume you know very little about these type of charts. I apologize it that is not the case.
 This is called a candlestick chart. Each red or green candle on this chart shows 1 week of bitcoin price data. Green candle means the week started off at a lower price and ended with a higher price. Red is the opposite. The white lines I drew in are called trend lines. The trend lines are drawn so you can easily define a pattern. Here's a full view of the chart and trend lines.
 
I use it for trading, the price will generally follow a trend. Different traders look for different trends or patterns at different time intervals. For instance, this chart is the last 2 years price action at Bitstamp (a bitcoin exchange) The price has generally trended in an upward sloping channel. The white lines I drew mark this channel. 
My strategy is to buy near the bottom of the channel. I don't always sell, but if I do I will try to do it near the top of the channel assuming the price is likely to move downward eventually. On the right side of the chart, you'll see one single white line sloping up, I drew that to mark a shorter term trend that started around 3.15.17. 
I watch for the trends to break in either direction as many traders do, to gauge risk versus reward when I buy or sell.
Hope that is a decent explanation. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:06:51
The indictment I read said "BTCe maintained its servers in the United States"[page 13 article 20](
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:48:41
I could actually see a bounce here. It touched the previous long-term resistance from the channel I've been watching for 2 years. If it doesn't fall back into the channel this could be a good spot for a buy. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:16:46
Idk that confuses me as well. Also I was very surprised to read that. Why would they have their servers in the US?

I'm sick of it. Ridiculous fees, withdrawal limits, loss of financial privacy.   You're right this is not acceptable! All this does is make me want to get away from banks even more. I only keep a minimum amount of fiat already. I'm looking forward to neo-bee, coinkite and other new gen banks. I will support them to the fullest as much as possible. As for now I'll have to set up a new account but it will be at a local credit union and they will be questioned as to whether they are btc friendly.

Your good then, even if they do a CC charge back later PayPal has to cover you. If it happens justake sure you fight. Paypal will let you win a PayPal reversal no problem but if the buyer does a CC chargeback later PayPal may try to take the money from you if you don't make them stick to their seller protection.

Point made you haven't done any research obviously there are a few grocery stores who accept it and you can get a car. Obviously not everyone is going to accept it overnight it takes time to build trust with a new currency. Second market is a big name that recently started a Bitcoin etf. If you are arguing that Bitcoin is not widely accepted enough for you that could be a reasonable argument for you not to use it but can you pay your electric bill with gold? How about pay with some gold at the convenience store? Do you think gold is a ponzi scheme?

The core Bitcoin network can scale to much higher transaction rates than are seen today, assuming that nodes in the network are primarily running on high end servers rather than desktops. Bitcoin was designed to support lightweight clients that only process small parts of the block chain (see simplified payment verification). A configuration in which the vast majority of users sync lightweight clients to more powerful backbone nodes is capable of scaling to millions of users and tens of thousands of transactions per second.
Stole that from wiki.
It leaves out the fact that the "spectacular crashes" have always left the price a lot higher than before each mini-bubble.
Also, I'm no one is saying bitcoin is perfect, and we are definitely in the highly speculative early stages, but we have to accept that this is a blooming technology that will develop over time. Who knows where crypto-currency will go and what markets it will find. Regardless of fiat market price crypto-currency is here to stay and as it develops it will become more useful in everyday situations. 
We are witnessing the birth of an important technology. Give it time to grow an accept that no, it's not 100% ready for everyday use yet, but it has enough useful attributes that there is incentive to continue development to work toward that goal. And the list of businesses accepting bitcoin is growing rapidly and I suspect 2014 will see a major rise in bitcoin's use as a currency.

Happened to my BTC listings also. They have the virtual currencies category but have decided to not allow any new listings there either. I dont know if this is just in the U.S. or what. There are not many BTC listings up at all compared to normal we'll have to see what happens but looks like Ebay may be banning bitcoin
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:57:42
bitmit is one is your talking like an ebay sort of experience. You could actually accept bitcoins on ebay but it's a little tricky work it since ebay has no tools for that. Coinbase would be a good choice if you have a site and just want a simple way to buy/sell/accept/send btc.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:03:11
And honestly the times I have paid with bitcoins for motorcycle parts it was cheaper because of the no fee transfers and the merchant doesn't have to pay insane CC fees. I would argue that more shady things get done in USD than anything. You think drugs can't be bought with USD? What did that study find something like 95% of us bills have traces of cocaine on them? If you don't find use for it don't use...in 5-10 years you will use it whether you know it or not..

Best thing to do if your investing long term is grab what you can and dont pay much attention to the price. If your watching the price constantly you will probably panic sell on a normal correction and take a loss. Just buy an amount you are comfortable with losing and buckle up. You are very likely to profit handsomely long term. or possibly within a few days. Or you may lose half your value this week and double it the next. Know one can predict accurately what will happen. You can guess but when big sell-offs happens, they are not going to warn anyone. Buy on the dips
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:11:44

I'm not having any problems...Coinbase are notorious for not answering your email for about 5 days tho...horrible customer service...and don't even get me started on the non-instant Btc purchases.. sometimes it works OK sometimes you wait 7 days to get your order canceled and then another 7 to get your money back...all based on them saying at the last minute that your transaction was high risk regardless how long you have been a customer or your verification level. Strangely it happened to me twice, both times the price of Btc had went up 10% or more since I ordered. Kinda made me suspicious. 50/50 in my experience
@_date: 2013-09-07 20:02:09
1. Bitcoin ok'd for use in campaign contributions before the next major elections (I think this could cause a few big re-valuations)
2. EBay adopts Btc as official payment option. (Will take off quickly I believe?
3. 2nd huge bubble of the years causes headlines worldwide which leads to revaluation.
4. US economy see another major upset which causes bailout plans like we saw in Europe

Your correct it is not brand new. I started using it when XPM launched maybe 5 days later I found mcx. I just started frequenting the site though. It's hard for anyone to say what will pay off more in the end I try to spread out all my money as much as possible. But whatever you may calculate about the annual returns on mcx I have already made a ridiculous return on mcxfee by trading shares so I would disagree on saying I would have profited more by not buying. I have some shares still and they were basically free since I already took some profit
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:39:46
I almost didn't even respond, but you have a wild conspiracy theory going on yourself there. You give no real technical argument here. You may not understand exactly how Btc works under the hood. Or as I see so often, you told everyone early on how much of a scam it was and how they would lose all their money and it hurts that you were wrong and you aread you didn't buy and make money on the rise from around $5-8 to currently $145ish? You probably haven't took the time to see all the big businesses that are adopting Btc payments everyday? Maybe you missed all the big names and companies who have invested lots of money in the infrastructure? Do you honestly think a currency that has built such infrastructure and trust with main streamers will be worthless overnight? Or maybe you think this weak FUD post will manipulate the price down so you can buy a little cheaper? How about an actual intelligent argument based in fact and with knowledge of what Bitcoin actually is. Maybe then we could have a real debate. Thoughts?
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:17:57
Sorry for the late reply, PayPal doesn't care if your following regulations or not theyade this clear to me. They don't want any part of Bitcoin he said. Well they don't want merchants selling Bitcoin but I guarantee they will want to be part of the scene soon. Or they will be left behind&gt;Not to stick my neck out here, but Paypal is just responding appropriately to regulations being enforced on them by the U.S. Gov.  They are covering their own ass by not allowing their individual customers to engage in regulated activities without following proper AML/KYC regulations.
@_date: 2013-08-22 05:17:15
Oh and BTW in a few more days (or even weeks the buyer has up to 180 days) the buyer will probably do a CC charge back with his bank and then see how well Paypal stands behind you. They will take the money for no other reason than the transaction didn't qualify for seller protection. Doesn't matter what evidence you have. (The two I lost were PayPal "gift" payments with no seller protection I won the initial reversal class but lost the CC charge back) seen it all happen many times. Let us know how you feel after 180 days have passed most of the scammers know this and will buy from you for 6 months before they start doing charhebacks

If the 20% difference is from people buying at gox and cashing out at other exchanges wouldn't we see falling prices at other exchanges? I hate to argue the point because none knows for sure but not everyone is a day trader...I for one have no interest in cashing out all my bitcoins. When I sell Btc I take the profit and buy more Btc. Or I sell enough to cover whatever cash I may need from time to time.  This jump happened overnight (in the US) which makes me think its probably not because of US based customers anyway. Could it be that widespread adoption has started moving very fast especially outside of the US? Why does everyone seem to think they know what the true price should be? Lol quit thinking fiat and start thinking Btc. If Bitcoin was 100k per Bitcoin is that when you will trade it all for fiat? Not me. When its worth that I plan on using it to pay bills and buy things I need.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:30:21
I know right at least have an intelligent argument. There are plenty of intelligent arguments as to why Bitcoin could fail. There are also plenty of intelligent arguments why it will succeed. No doubt Btc is a gamble at this point but the odds of it collapsing are getting smaller everyday. I made my choice and I will in no way put myself in a bad situation should Btc fail. Same applies for USD though except they are actively doing everything possible to ensure it eventually collapses. He totally lost any respect I might have had for his argument when he started cheering for USD.

You can pick this pattern out of the Bitcoin charts several times going back to day one. Seems like a repeating cycle only on a larger scale each time. Next bubble price anyone?
@_date: 2013-08-23 13:42:00
I have done it several times although not through local bitcoins. I like to load the Btc to a paper wallet, and then add the privkey to my android wallet. At meet time, I hand the paper wallet over and accept the cash. After the exchange is made and I am satisfied, I explain to the buyer they must sweep the paper wallet to their wallet. I do this as a buffer just in case someone tries a "snatch and run" type thing and it also helps avoid the awkward "you first" moment. If they take the paper wallet and run or otherwise try to rob me I simply pull out my phone, and make a transfer with a nice miners fee to ensure it happens quickly. The whole thing feels just like a drug deal lol luckily i have some experience from my past lol. I mostly do online transactions and that  puts the risk on the buyer so I use my track record and solid rep to aid in comfort level. It can still be anonymous. Just be careful and follow your instincts they are usually correct.

If your looking at a log chart, it looks alot more tame. Bubble seems to imply a "pop" with the value dropping to less than it started. Which so far has never been the case. Basically this year we just went from a 1000% gain to a 700% gain. And my guess is it will bounce back a lot faster this time. Many positive events recently. The price is mostly psychological. And this correction seems to be more about "lack of buy support" than actual dumping of large amounts of coins. People are more confident now than last time I would guess.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:48:08
BTW gold has not increased in value very much lately just fiat has decreased. An ounce of gold 100 years ago has about the same purchasing power as it does today. Just takes a lot more USD to buy it since USD has been inflated so much and lost value. Now this is fact. You tell me which one is better to hold. Bitcoin is similar to gold in many ways and it is decentralized there is not one guy somewhere making bitcoins and collecting money as the head of a ponzi scheme. Do some actual reading and research and come up with a better argument if you want to troll. Be a good troll and you'll get paid better
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:28:56
Give it some time. Newcomers will usually watch for awhile and then if they decide to invest in some bitcoins it takes time to get accounts verified and money in. Plus some will put in limit orders to buy at the price they want and it will take time. I've had several family members ask about Btc the past couple days because of the NPR spot last week. The good news is that Btc is gaining momentum and there are a lot more buyers than sellers already. I expect the price to continue upward generally for at least the next several weeks.
@_date: 2013-08-22 17:54:49
As I said I would send a receipt with tracking # and only to verified and confirmed users that qualified for seller protection. Still a huge PITA because they hold the funds from every dispute for like 30 days and also after a few disputes they automatically hold every transaction until 3 days after the tracking shows delivered even with no dispute....then after you win the PayPal dispute most scammers will later do a CC charge back with their bank and you have to fight it all over again. Yes I still sell but I only accept non reversible forms of payment. No PayPal under any circumstances. Paypal will eventually freeze your account for non compliance with their terms of service but only after they lose some money by paying u for a CC chargeback that was covered by SP. They lose the money but still have to pay you as long as you qualify for SP. When that happens your account will be frozen and they will make you send them a signed notarized affidavit that you will comply with TOS. Then if it happens again they close your account and keep all your funds for 180 days to cover future chargebacks. They could solve most of the fraud problems by implementing a 2 factor authentification process to send money. Then they could update their TOS to make the buyer liable if they refuse to secure their account.the 2 I disputes I lost were not covered by SP but I had copies of the buyers valid ID, conversation through email before and after the disputes that showed the IP addresses were the same. The latter conversations were from the user claiming his account was hacked and he also verified that no one else had access to his PC...I would have won in ANY court of law but unfortunately PayPal does not bother to even investigate under $500 and if you didn't use SP they don't care to investigate they just let the scammer have the money back. I see PayPal as crooks as well and refuse to give them anymore of my money. They are stupid they could greatly increase revenue by just fighting the fraud but it seems they dont care they have made that clear. I have posted the affidavit here and some other things just trying to help other people who have no idea but i pretty much have just been told that im an idiot so i left it alone. Yes I still sell and I have always have plenty of Btc can do large and small orders always instant transfer and completely private.

Oh and I assume you meant, gold does have intrinsic value, since it obviously does. Intrinsic value may mean something in a collapse situation but the values won't be in dollars gold or bitcoins, they will be food water and ammo, is that what you'd rather you for trade currently? Or the USD which is close to real collapse due to excessive printing to make the public think everythings ok. Read up on a history of paper currencies, read why they failed. Bitcoin isn't perfect but its a great option in my opinion, it takes time to build trust and adoption. People like you who do no real research and spout FUD will be there all the way to the top crying to everyone the sky is falling, every time Btc drops you will be there saying I told you so. Make a good argument and we can debate the specifics

I apree most times the buyers are more nervous than I. Public place always for sure. Yes that may seem paranoid the way I use paper wallets but most of the people who would rather meet in person in my experience are looking for $500+ in Btc and where I'm from you need to be careful when meeting strangers for valuable transactions. I don't think its paranoid to have a backup plan and as long as you make the buyer aware that they should just sweep the Btc from the wallet its fair. It also helps with the fact that confirmations usually take 10 mins. If I hand you a paper wallet and you sweep it yourself you know the Btc is coming.

depends on how much you put in, but you get some interest from any coins you have deposited or are holding, plus the feeshares from however many feeshares your holding every 6 hours. They pay you with a mixed bag of coins, it can add up over weeks, especially when one of the altcoins you have or more is in an uptrend, which the ones on mcx currently seem to be. only just under 10K accounts on mck and only 5k mcxfee at the moment, imagine when the site matures this could be another one of those ridiculous profit stories in bitcoin world

As a buyer you get offers from sellers...as a seller you get offers from buyers...not like local with a long list of prices...makes it easier to get a better deal when sellers fight for sales...also seller can't see others prices...they make you their best offer and you can counter offer or turn it down...same way in opposite if your selling...lots of cool features, ratings system is cooler..the site overall looks more reputable IMO....there is an escrow system but I think it works different lay than local you has less chance of getting scammed out of your coins by them being stuck in escrow with someone claiming they paid u...its still in beta testing but I tried it out for a few mins it seems to be an upgrade from local...try it out and see what you think I am in no way experienced on the site I just read about the features and made some test offers.

@_date: 2013-08-01 22:12:05
In fact I have so far not lost any money to a reversal or chargeback, I "used to" take advantage of their seller protection by shipping a physical item as well as sending btc. You will never lose a reversal but when they do a credit card chargeback you have to fight or paypal will not honor their seller protection policy. And the two times my account was frozen was the same day I called and demanded they return my money per their seller protection. It's a HUGE PITA to deal with. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:17:06
I think we should go ahead and start using smaller denominations on exchanges and wallets. Eventually we will have to do it anyway and it will help break the psychological barrier. Many people who can't afford 1.0 BTC right now feel as if they shouldn't buy because they can only afford a fraction of a bitcoin.
The price can go way higher against USD this is what people have been trying to impress. So far almost 12 million mined and a lot less in circulation, for an inrush of several million new users the value will have to increase exponentially. My thoughts are that bitcoin is still extremely undervalued we have just had a tough time breaking the psych barrier. 
April's surge could have went a lot higher if gox didn't break down and scare everyone, 2011 spike was ended prematurely also. 
I vote we move to mbits or instead of changing denoms every time the value surges just start with the base unit. 1 satoshi. 
Right now you can get 1 million satoshi for about $3.18.
Sounds like a much better deal huh?

This is nothing new, I have a years experience selling Bitcoin for PayPal and have won many cases. In fact I have only lost 2 out of probably 1000. But I used their seller protection mostly by sending a receipt by mail with a tracking  The problem is still that about 50% of transaction get some sort of reversal or charge back. And your money is constantly tied up in disputes. And eventually, after PayPal loses enough money from CC charge backs that they don't win but have to pay you per seller protection, they will freeze your account and have you submit an affidavit claiming you will not sell bit coins (its against their terms of service) then when you think your smart by trying to conceal what the transactions are for, they will freeze every payment for several days because your transactions are (high risk) my last dealings with PayPal were when they froze my account (a second time) claiming they had evidence I was still selling bitcoins. They almost closed my account and held my funds for 180 days (to cover charge backs) . If you sell as virtual goods you may sometimes get lucky but if the buyer does a charge back from their bank or CC company your screwed. They don't care what kind of evidence you have. No seller protection no money..you got lucky. I've got lucky a few times also but trust me you will lose money if the buyer doesn't qualify for seller protection and you don't ship a physical item with tracking...and even then after a few claims that you win they will start flagging transactions and freezing your money. They will even reverse a withdrawal so don't think just because you withdrew the money your good. They will take it back straight from your account in the blink of an eye. Take it from someone with plenty of PayPal/Bitcoin experience find another way. Its not worth it and PayPal is NOT on your side.
