Well I can't say it isn't true. A car you don't need will just degrade over time, you will never make any money on that investment. On top of that, everyone that night in before december is most likely still positive on their portfolio.

What value have Gavin and other devs added to the BCH fork that makes it superior to BTC other than the increased blocksize? If Bitcoin were to increase it's blocksize to 8MB, wouldn't that render BCH completely useless? A common criticism to BCH seems to be that BTC developes faster than BCH bbecause of  the Dev team. 
By way, thanks for answering my questions. Not everyone takes time for that on this sub

Dude what? It's a digital currency. Maybe you should just sell your entire portfolio and move on ��

Then let's hope stupid money flows out, because it's been the worst thing about this market since the last year

It's easy. Either you sell low and buy back in high, or hold on. I can pretty much guarantee you a panic sell now is not going to pay off

So... What exactly went wrong? Did Satoshi underestimate the adoption rate 'it never really hits a scale ceiling' right now it looks very much like it has
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:56:27
I never have. Right now BTC is mostly used for trading between altcoins because the fees are too high, but once those scaling problems are over BTC will be used for what it's meant for which is as a digital currency
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:53:09
That's not what I asked. I'm not sure if just increasing the blocksize will be a lasting solution for the existing scaling problem, and that's a debate I'd rather not engage in. On top of that I haven't even mentioned Segwit in my original comment.
Where did Satoshi say that an increased blocksize would be the solution, and why hasn't the Dev team done that already?

Well the good thing is we aren't the platform controlled by the biggest BCash scammer (advocate) around right now

At this point r/btc is the r/T_D of the crypto community
