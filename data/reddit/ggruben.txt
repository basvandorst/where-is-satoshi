US citizens don't realize they are brainwashed. Even medical professionals can be laughably deluded.

They tripled their staff during the surge and hired 300% more during the panic sells after. Sorry for the confusion.

You are suffering from stockholm syndrome. Except that in Stockholm you'd actually be treated respectfully.

Wouldn't mining decrease when the coin becomes to scarce to be profitable?

For some reason this picture made me miss my childhood cat. I only ever had one cat because my little brother turned out to be allergic. Weird, no cat picture has ever done that to me.

I kinda like the way it is now. Like it's resting a bit after a crazy ride. So many noobs boarded the ship. Bitcoin exchanges were flooded with new users and had to triple their staff. Then during the panic selling they got bogged down again. I spoke to a support person from an exchange yesterday and asked him what it was like with all the panic selling. He said they literally had to hire 300% more people to handle that.

You sound uneducated fam. There's a lot of heavily biased an incorrect sources on religion that are politically motivated and skew everything to fit their point of view. Either you are naive or you are such an individual. Good luck in the future!

I only have a little play money in it now which is as much as I can for the time  being. But for what it's worth, I did exactly the opposite of this and it feels good!

This strategy is fairly containted within the united states as far as a I know. Maybe canada too. In europe you need to apply and qualify for a credit card. Most people won't get one if they can't prove that they have the income to pay it off.   
In the states there are tons of companies giving credit cards out like nothing. That's a different story. But it makes them money, so I guess it makes sense.

As long as there are financial incentives to use it, it will have value.

Unless they make it useless for black markets, it will always have that  utility. I'm not saying that's impossible. I suppose it's possible for the "anonymity" to be compromised to the point that it's no longer an option for black markets. But in that case it would just be replaced with another crypto, and I suppose that the change would be gradual enough for people to elope.

I'm going to get 0.5 bitcoin as soon as I get over my fear of being hacked or educate myself on how to properly secure bitcoin. And as soon as my inheritance comes in of course. I might even risk a whole coin. That would just feel so good. One whole bitcoin. But my email has been hacked/leaked and I'm scared of losing that bitcoin.

I suppose cold storage is a physical device in which case I'm worried about losing it. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:53:00
I agree with that.

Hey this is odd. I'm a Belgian planning on buying 0.5 soon as well as visiting Malaysia.

That sucks. I'm sure they'll update their app soon. I'm on the receiving end so I'm not sure if I can even do anything to speed it up. The estimate for 200~sat has also gone up from 300 to 1000 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:27:36
Thx for looking into it. I did not notice that input. Is this due to a general "backing up"? I suppose with the recent increase in value there are a lot of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:10:43
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:21:04
My transaction finally resolved. I slapped 450sat on my next one because fuck it. I can't wait that long ever again. The value had gone up enough in that time to cover that fee anyway.

Damn. I use mycelium too. I wonder if that can have something to do with it? I gotta say I learned a lot more about bitcoins in the past few hours. I never had this happen.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:36:54
Thank you. I'm just learning about these mechanics today because I've never had this problem. I was hoping I would find some reassurance here. I can wait a day or 2. It's not ideal but as long as they finally arrive I can live with it.

You can't change the fact that this is how humans behave. All you can hope for is that whoever occupies the seat on the left is friends with the one on the right.
