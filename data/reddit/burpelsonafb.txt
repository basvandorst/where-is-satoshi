Why are you assuming that everything will be rising in price? The market will always be determining the value based on a number of factors.

The CME futures market relies on only four pretty small markets to determine pricing. [GDAX]( the largest BTC market only has $687M worth of BTC. That means, moving around a mere $20M could effect the market by 3%. I have a feeling it wouldn't be as hard as one might think to manipulate those four markets. Would be curious to hear what others think.

The fact that the futures markets will be taking prices from four pretty small markets that could be pretty easily manipulated is a bit nerve-racking and could lead to problems. [GDAX]( the largest market only has $687M worth of BTC. That means, moving around a mere $20M could effect the market by 3%. It seems that a dozen whales with some time on their hands could easily make some leveraged futures buys and drop the prices in the four markets in question to make some easy money. Would be curious to hear anybody else's opinion on this.

It reminds me of product placement in movies, when a character says "let me Bing that." And everybody in the audience looks around wondering if anybody actually says that. This guy obviously doesn't know much about crypto, yet he know the name of Bitcoin Cash. I call product placement! :-)

You think their marketing department decided to name their social media handle “wrinkled dog’s anus”?

And then we see it. The hamster IS BERNIE. He gives us a grumpy glance, then continues on the exercise wheel. Pulling out we see that the woman next to you also has a Bernie in her heart, and the dude over there. Camera pulls back, hundreds, then thousands of little Bernies. Cranking away. Then it dawns on us in the audience, everybody has a little Bernie in their heart....Fade to black. Sniffles.

The CEO who had taken it over, later took company money as his own. Embezzlement. How does that implicate Jeb?
