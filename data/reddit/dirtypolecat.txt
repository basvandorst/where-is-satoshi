The miners didn't do this, the pool operators did.  Probably to keep up public relations, so they aren't known as a pool that pockets "accidents" like this.

If it's about choice, then I assume people would want to give as many people that choice as possible, and that would mean avoiding all centralized pools, because one gives up their choice in the matter when joining one.  Is there a reason peer-to-peer pools aren't more popular?

Looking at source code, running processes, and current tcp connections is a better indication of something being off.  A hard drive light don't mean squat, could have been your OS chose that exact moment to rearrange some fragmented files or purge some log files or something.
Edit: you could even run a checksum on the download to make sure you got it from the right place and it hasn't been tampered with.  And I run Linux, and maybe once a day my hard drive light shows a bunch of activity and dies down a little bit later, but I know exactly what it's doing.

I'm trying to tell you it doesn't matter if *you* consider it theft, there are vast swathes of society who do not.  That's what I mean, morals are not absolute.  They are fluid and vary throughout a population and even change over time.  It's considered a good moral in some countries to chop someones limb off for theft, but in the west we consider that abhorrent and cruel.

Your morals do not equal other people's morals.  Remember that.  There is no baseline "standard" you can judge people's morals by.  We just kinda agree on the major things, like murder is wrong.  Taxes....are still kinda fluid when it comes to society as a whole.  Some have no problem, others would like them done away with or reduced.  That's why we constantly argue about it with our governments.
Edit:  An example would be a hardcore Christian thinking they have better morals than an atheist, but the atheist thinks they have better morals than the Christian because they have no problem with LGBT marriage or cannabis or anything.  It's too subjective of a thing to use as an argument.

Measuring currencies value with each other is pretty meaningless.  I know you're making a joke, but in the end, its how many Bitcoins/Dollars/gold/shells/beads people demand for labor or services.  Actual work is worth something, currency is not.  Its only a fluctuating number that represents labor or debt, which doesn't change.
If you were a taxi driver in the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic, giving someone a ride down the street still bought you the same amount of value in goods and services, as long as you weren't transacting in Marks.  You could still barter and trade directly, which is what many people did.

Slackware WAS a damn fine OS...but I was just trying to make an example with the most popular one in use (from my experience) in the late 90's.  Redhat was the high end "professional" one that was marketed to businesses and technology shops.  I mean I coulda picked LFS or Gentoo as well.
Edit:  Off topic, but you got me blabbing about a subject I enjoy ;). I encourage everyone interested in how an OS works to download and compile LFS (Linux From Scratch).  It's got step by step tutorials for newbs, and the end result is a system that you can truly call your own, and slim the kernel down to just what is needed to run your system.  Took me 3 days back in '07, and acquired a great deal of knowledge about the Linux ecosystem, like how startup scripts work, what cross-compiling is, etc.  I even put Apache on it and ran it as my home-hobby website for a couple years.

Of course it never existed.  The mistake was the workers in those failed states allowing themselves to be ruled by a hierarchial single party government doing things in their name rather than democratically and horizontally organizing themselves without anyone telling them what to do.  A classic case of absolute power corrupting absolutely.  Anarchists and Marxist-Leninists/Stalinists/Tankies in history have long clashed over how to implement communism most effectively.  Single party rule, or no rule at all, letting individual communites decide for themselves what's best for them.
Take away centralized power, money, and give control of the means of production to those who actually produce things, and communism will come naturally.   It has to be voluntarily and unanimously chosen by the people, not forced from the top down.

Well, I'm anarcho-communist, and don't subscribe to that whole forceful state redistribution thing.  It would definately have to be voluntary, that's for sure, managed by the workers of industry themselves in a democratic fashion.  Crypto undermines the power of ALL central governments, no matter the ideology they purport to be.
Edit: by the way, people like me see communism and socialism as workers controlling thier own destiny and profits collectively, rather than a capitalist siphoning wealth from a group of workers underneath them simply for owning property (the means of production).  As in, one big democratic union.  I'm not sure where the forceful redistribution of wealth thing came from.  Tarnished by the USSR and eastern bloc dictatorships I guess.  The Bolsheviks who started the russian revolution actually had anarchist allies rounded up, killed, and imprisoned after the USSR formed.  It was never meant to be a totalitarian dictatorship with sociopaths at the helm.
Collective bargaining and striking for better conditions is an example of socialist principles in action.  It's one of the reasons the US now has a standard eight hour work day and child labor laws.  Workers collectively fought for those rights.  Google "haymarket affair" for more info on that.  We are just as much against the state and the elite as many here on this sub.  Bitcoin is one way to wrestle power away from them and return it to the masses.

If Bitcoin software is still under the tight control of the core devs who won't budge when presented with a new idea, then no.  See Litecoin.  It's original purpose was to make mining way more decentralized by being ASIC resistant.  Now we find their implementation of scrypt is flawed.  Vertcoin, with a variable n-factor, is superior to Litecoin in this regard, yet calls to change the core hashing function go unheeded by the Litecoin devs.  This WILL be the death of Litecoin, as there is now nothing separating it from the hundreds of static n-factor scrypt shitcoins out there.  It's just another ho hum altcoin now.

We are ALL slaves to the machine.  Haven't you figured that out? You gotta eat, right? Well sorry, capitalism has exclusive access to fertile land to grow crops and farm for yourself.  Land property rights and absentee ownership.  Sorry buddy.  You can, however, work for us and we'll make sure you see a tiny fraction of our earnings to keep you alive and desperate for more food.
Edit: enclosing parcels of land and enforcing violence on others that try to use it to sustain themselves is about the stupidest thing humanity has ever done.  It's the equivalent of closing off access to air and water and selling it to those that can afford it.  This is why the trading of land for material goods was such a foreign concept to the native Americans.  Land belonged to everyone before Europeans brought their fuedalistic model to the Americas.
And with the way capitalism is destroying the planet in the name of profit, I imagine some WILL start selling access to clean air and water.
Edit: for the purposes of this post, I make a distinction between personal possessions and the treatment of land as "property".

Anarchism means "without rulers, without hierarchies, without oppression."  So explain to me how anarcho socialism, where everyone is given equal footing, an oxymoron.  Capitalism breeds hierarchies, whether voluntary or not, this is what anarchism is against.
By the way, the "failed" socialism you are referring to is typically known as Marxist-Leninist type. You know, the kind with a hierarchical one party government, which anarchists also fought against and died because of it.
The problem was socialism being forced on society on a large scale with people not being ready for it yet.  There has to be a willingness among the entire population for it to work, which it actually has for a limited time on a small scale until these communities were dissolved by state forces.

Yes, nearly every alt goes down more.  Except for Blackcoin.  Look at a price chart for the past week and notice that BC's price has been trending up independent of Bitcoin.  Then look at the properties if this coin and realize why.  Extremely low inflation and BC multipools that trade altcoins for it and pay users in BC(it cannot be mined directly). I'm all in on this coin.
Edit:  I pretty much saved my Bitcoin holdings from this crash by investing in BC two weeks ago, and am still at the same level of value in USD I was before.  When Bitcoin eventually turns around and trends back up, I have a feeling BC is going to rocket upward.

Well, with Blackcoin, there are multipools now that hash on other coin's networks, paying out by exchanging for BTC, exchanging for Blackcoin, and then paying out in that.

It's an experiment to add stability to a coin's price by creating another incentive-based feedback loop.

But it DOES work, it's working right now.  Show an example of a malicious actor exploiting a PoS system or do it yourself, and I will be more inclined to take this document a little more seriously.  Go ahead, show the flaw, and implement an attack.  Blackcoin is also PoS, and has NO check pointing as PPC does.  By the way, block chain check pointing is NOT "validating all blocks by one single entity" but rather a way to roll back the chain in case of an attack.  However, it MUST be done by consensus, no one is obligated to return to the checkpoint.  It is a beta feature that will be removed from PPC in the future, and already is nonexistent in Blackcoin.

Not sure, but you have somewhat of a point.  The encryption part is only used to verify legitimacy of transactions, a "checksum" if you will.

For the first hundred years or so, humans were mostly confined to their local system and surrounding space, mining the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud.  The first Enterprise (warp five capable) allowed them to go fast enough to interact with more than just the Vulcans and a couple other species.

It's is not though.  There are way stronger hashing algorithms out there than sha256.  The reason it is considered secure is because it uses consensus, where control of the block chain is democratically (more or less) determined by the miners.  Without this consensus though, any coin, even Bitcoin falls apart.  Has nothing to do with the technology used to secure it, and everything to do with most miners (51% or more) staying rational.

Here's a simplification: a general purpose computer can add, subtract, multiply and divide.  An ASIC miner can only subtract (but do it much quicker than a regular CPU).  You literally cannot do any other operation except a sha256 hash, it's what they're made to do and nothing else, while regular CPUs can run a wide range of software.  So yeah, it does matter.

If a person's financial situation and surroundings pretty much force them to sell their body or starve, is it really "voluntary"?  You can make the argument that it's a personal and voluntary decision all day long, but this is the reality a lot of sex workers face.
In capitalism, not everyone can make it, it literally requires a desperate underclass to sustain itself.  I wouldn't call a lot of transactions that happen in the real world "voluntary".

And PoW rewards those with enough starting capital to take advantage of economies of scale to mine, ie Chinese mining farms.  Both systems have their flaws, but they are currently the only two known ways to secure a blockchain.  There's really no way around accumulation of wealth to those that already have a lot of wealth to start with.  This is a problem that hopefully can be solved one day to make distribution of crypto currencies more fair to everyone.
Edit: I was wrong about there only being two.  Just did a little research, and apparently there is a coin called "burstcoin" that uses "proof of storage capacity" to mine, in other words, the more storage space you have, the higher your hashing power.  That was kind of interesting to find out.  Although you're still putting the computer to work, just using different equipment, so I guess it may kind of loosely fall under "proof of work".
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:41:55
Because the software is still in the very nascent stages, is buggy, and YMMV.  It gives me greater confidence seeing my balance on a pool slowly go up rather than seeing no block being solved for days and wondering if somethings wrong with my config, or if I need another software update, which is done pretty often.
Edit: there's basically no one-click and run way to begin mining it.  Depending on your platform, simply getting the miner compiled/installed and hashing at its full potential is a feat in itself.  Just Google some of the tutorials available online from different people with different OSs, it's all over the place.  With Bitcoin/clonecoins all I did was made sure I had AMD drivers, download the sgminer binary, copy someone else's config that seems to work for them that had the same hardware as me, and away I went.  Changing coins was just a matter of specifying a different algo and pool address in the config.

You say these things like it's as easy as changing a pair of socks.

I discovered OpenSimulator and was excited about an open source alternative and started setting it up.  After five hours of discovering most of my scripts didn't work, it didn't support flexible prims (at the time), and a physics engine which blows my left nutsack, I went back to Second Life.  Because everyone else was also on Second Life.

You know all the "free market, anti-welfare" types have been duped, right? Actually, so have those on the extreme left. Whether or not the Government controls certain civil institutions is not the issue. Wall Street gambling with Fed money is the issue. Those in privileged positions telling you it's okay to give them more and give you less. Bitcoin is perfect for taking away that power of a few individuals.
Best way to blind the public to what's really going on is to get them fighting amongst themselves over petty bullshit such as differing views on managing the economy, gay rights, abortion, etc. It's all a fucking smokescreen.
Edit: I'm sorry if I offend all the hardcore anarchist types in here, my point was we all need to stop being so divided and partisan on these issues, it seems it's either all or nothing for both the right AND left. We need to turn our collective heads to the man whose manipulating us in this way. I don't "hate" any sort of political view, everyone can bring good ideas to the table. Socialist policies can succeed in a free market, hell look at Sweden (I know, that reference is overused), but they have universal healthcare, yet also have one of the free-est markets in the western world.

No.  No it has not.  Not in the scale of a nation-state. Not without dictators seizing power of a revolution and twisting it for their own ends.  Anarchists communities who have tried this were always destroyed by the forces of statism.

Well, maybe not if you're solo mining, but joining a pool, distributing the rewards, and collectively agreeing on the validity of the blockchain sounds like a pretty "communal" way of doing things.

Oh, they'll just hand out "certificates" for you to redeem your BTC, then people will trade just those amongst themselves, then they'll print more than the number of BTC that exists in their accounts to loan out to people, then they'll declare the certificates "fiat" and no longer tied to BTC, and the circle will be complete.

I see it as operating a little differently, there is no one single program that they all use, it's hundreds of different programs from hundreds of different vendors, each using a slightly different technology to determine the best trading opportunities.

Being more of a geeky, tinkerer type, (I design Android to microcontroller/robotics bluetooth interfaces as one of my hobbies) Android works better for me than the iOS "Fisher Price" dumbed down UI and is much more configurable having access to widely used Linux utilities and compilers.  Apple will always have a niche for those just like you who "just" want a phone, sort of like OSX and Windows have turned computers into commodity appliances geared towards the common consumer rather than those who will gladly pull out a soldering iron to fix a problem.

No one can see the future.  Sure, they mined thousands of Bitcoins, but back in those days the tiny community they had really had no idea it was going to take off like this, bitcoins were worth fractions of cents then, and only to people within that community.  So, they were the only ones to know, and got a head start in mining, a lot of times at a loss of profit, contributing resources because they believed in something.  The fact it blew up like it did was a nice bonus for those who worked so hard to advance the project.  I'm pretty sure the original motivation wasn't greed.

Electronics nerd here, zooming in on that pile of boards.  Looks like it's got:
*  An FTDI for USB-serial comms.
*  The ~~avalon~~ ASICMiner chip.
*  Crystal oscillator. (edit: correction. TWO crystal oscillators, the shiny metal square cans)
*  Some sort of inductor (the large black box with the round indent on top)
*  And some sort of microcontroller, can't read the text on the chip, but probably any old 8-bit PIC or AVR will do.
*  Various passive components, probably what amounts to a few power filter caps, and pullup/pulldown resistors.
My gears are turnin; ;)
Edit:  Correction on the chip,  confused the two companies, but no reason this cannot be done with the Avalon chips that are sold through the batch sales.
Edit:  Aha, I knew there were already some device hackers working on it:

Bitcoin ITSELF is a technological breakthrough.  Encryption algorithms have been around for decades.

Yeah, you don't wanna do that ;). The risk of setting your laptop on fire is more than the diddly squat you'll get mining on it.

Well, before LFS, my only exposure to Linux was the easy-to-use GUI of Suse, and the most complicated thing I'd ever done was download and install Nvidia drivers to play Unreal Tournament.
LFS taught me all about /etc and where Linux keeps all its nitty gritty config stuff, taught me how to recompile the kernel and run "make config" and get it down really really tight by looking up and installing ONLY the modules I need, and also taught me what bootstrapping is and how to compile for a target system on a different computer.
8 years later I'm regularly programming microcontrollers like the PIC and AVR, as well as the Pi, something I NEVER thought I'd get into.  Been even looking for EE and embedded systems design jobs.

Wardenclyffe tower was essentially a giant tesla coil, it was built in hopes of transmitting electricity wirelessly.  NOTHING to do with "free energy". Unfortunately, like everything in the electromagnetic spectrum, the strength dies off very quickly with increasing distance:
Since radio and wireless transmission was a VERY poorly understood phenomenon at the time, they did not realize the impracticality of this.
I've built a couple Tesla coils for fun (which is more precisely defined as an air-core resonant transformer), electronics is one of my hobbies.  The science behind Tesla's experiments is now VERY well understood.  I don't get how people elevate him to god-like status sometimes.  Yes, he had managed to create some paradigm shifting technologies at the time when he was young, most of which we couldn't live without today, but he died old and penniless because he turned into, for lack of a better term, an old kook.

Do not confuse socialism with coercion by a state.  Many theories have socialism/communism existing in a stateless, voluntary society.  There is socialism, and then there is state-imposed democratic socialism.  Stop treating it like a dirty word and lumping it in with atrocities done by a hierarchical society.

Trust in Bitcoin depends on a majority of miners approving the correct transactions.

This. So many people are like "All gubmint bad!". There are things better left to private ventures, and things better left to government. Only the government will fund hugely expensive projects like the national highway system or deep space exploration, without seeing an immediate return on investment. The issue is not whether the government is too large, it's whether it fully represents the will of its people, which it currently isn't doing such a great job with concerning the financial well being of most people in the country, hence why the people are now taking it into their own hands with Bitcoin.
It's kind of funny when I think about it. A currency created using pure communistic approaches (the miners and blockchain) has the capability to fuel the free-est market ever.

Voluntarily.  A commitment made by every human on Earth when we finally realize resource scarcity doesn't exist.  There is enough to go around for all to live a happy life.
I admit, we aren't ready for that.  Not by a long shot.  But eliminating things like hunger, sickness, and the need for basic requirements for survival through technological advancement and mutual cooperation will in turn eliminate greed and the capitalist system will collapse on its own.

They were initially devised as a way to protect the consumer from unauthorized use of his/her account, or if the product delivered was not functional or shoddy quality, although I suspect these days the case is more that the consumer simply wants to rip off the merchant.  
Bitcoin isn't for the squeemish.  I think another thing that will help people become less scared of it is to stop equating it to online banking and credit card transactions.  It's not quite the same.  It's the equivalent of digital cash.  If I hand a shady street vendor in an alley $200 USD for a fake Rolodex watch, and the vendor then runs off with my money, is it not the same deal?  And am I not an idiot for not doing research on that merchant and trying to find out what his/her reputation is like?

All depends on the number of miners and if the hashing power of the network can keep up with the transaction demand.  I personally think with ASICs becoming commonplace that the network would become (which I think it already is) grossly under utilized, and is well prepared for any kind of surge in transaction volume.
Transaction volume = more people buying Bitcoin = Bitcoin goes up in value = more profitability for miners to jump on.  This is the beauty of a system managed and self-regulated by mathematics and free market forces alone.  Satoshi really did think of every contingency.

Fiat implies that an unlimited number of units of that currency can be produced.  Bitcoin is not fiat in this sense.
You can opt to pay a slightly higher transaction fee to expedite your transaction down to minutes.  This creates even more incentive to mine, increasing efficiency even more.  As I said, the whole system is self-regulating through mathematical algorithms.  Which is why it can function without a central authority.

The mistake being that we still put humans in charge of other humans (vanguard party).  The other option (anarchism, direct democracy) is a version of that which we have not tried yet.  Therefore, you can't definitely say it will not ever work, given that we are approaching levels of technology and automation that may make this feasible one day.
Edit: hell, we are already on our way towards liberating our monetary system with cryptocurrency.  Who's to say our entire society can't one day be organized in a non-hierarchical, decentralized fashion, with technology providing for our every need?
I'm not calling for forced redistribution of wealth here.  What I'm saying is, as more and more functions of society are replaced by machinery, and people are put out of work as a result, at what point do we say "You know what?

Speaking as someone who leans anarchist in the traditional sense (not the oxymoron that is anarcho-capitalism), society cannot be forced to suddenly adopt a moneyless and classless society overnight, else you end up with the USSR all over again.  Bitcoin is the perfect transitory instrument, for the first time in history we have an opportunity to adopt the "people's money" and simply drop the instrument of societal manipulation by both state forces and powerful private entities known as fiat money.  After we wrestle that power away from them, then we can work on getting rid of it for good.  And that would require huge advances in technology to automate 99% of mundane processes and provide for everyone's basic needs.  Money will simply be useless at that point.  For now, we have Bitcoin.

1. Established currencies don't have anything backing them either, yet we use them everyday.
2. The self-regulating nature of the network ensures it will always be profitable for a certain number of miners, ensuring that transaction confirmations will always take an hour or less. Miners get on board and process transactions, difficulty goes up, transactions take just as long. Miners drop off, difficulty goes down, transaction time remains largely unchanged. More transactions = more transaction fees going to miners, giving a reason for more miners to jump in.

Hope all goes well for the customers.  In light of all this BFL mess, I've been thinking of something.
It would be awesome if we can get the barrier to entry lowered for people wanting to mine Bitcoin.  Now I know there are the cheap block erupter sticks, but what I was thinking about is something more in line with a "DIY" attitude.
I'm sure some of you are aware of things like Arduino and Raspberri Pi.  These things have opened up a world of possibilities and opportunities for the open hardware scene.  What if there were a kick starter or something to buy up a crapload of ASIC chips from Avalon or some other company, mount them all on Arduino shields or breakout boards, and sell them right alongside all the other components at a store like Fry's or Radio Shack or even online outlets like Adafruit?  Suddenly you give access to thousands of hobbyists to create the cheapest, sleekest (well maybe not sleek, breadboards and messes of wires and whatnot), most efficient hardware out there, and no longer rely on companies like BFL for it, except for the chips themselves.  Chip manufacturers can focus solely on creating ever faster ASIC chips, while all the hardware and system integration is taken care of by the DIY maker community.
Just some ramblings.

Yes, but looking at its history, it's always crashed *up*, always settling to a price that was higher than before the bubble.

Anarchism = rejection of all hierarchy, public and private.
Austrian economics = acceptance of hierarchy (although voluntary) via private ownership of capital, without the state.
Anarcho-capitalism =/= Anarchism.  At least not in the traditional sense.
Edit: now, if we are talking about a voluntary worker-owned cooperative based economy powered by Bitcoin, I can get behind that.
I'm not trying to bash ancaps here, I get where they are coming from.  But realize Bitcoin *can* work in societies that aren't based around private ownership of the means of production.  Bitcoin itself (the mining part) can even be thought of as a voluntary co-op that manages itself via direct democracy, requiring no central management.

Electricity is free and included with my rent, that's exactly what I'm doing with a couple GPU's, makes for a nice little bit of monthly spending money.  But I expect that to dwindle to pennies too in a few months.

Yes, it is, but to tell you the truth, I really had no idea what was going on at the time, just the shocked and concerned looks on my parent's faces told me something was wrong.

Ah, I understand your point now.  Some systems actually do try to correct for this, such as I mentioned, the SELinux patches that make the kernel run userspace programs in a more compartmentalized way, as well as Data Execution Prevention for Windows, but yeah you are right, nothing has been designed from the ground up to protect applications from wreaking havoc on systems in various ways.  VMware comes kinda close, compartmentalizing entire running OS instances from each other.

Power tools
Water (in copious amounts)
Power washers
These things have all killed people.  Also would like to point out the recent death of someone using K2 or Spice.  Drug prohibition will cause people to experiment with substances hundreds of times as dangerous.  It's not about being addicted.  Many people try things once or very occasionally and leave it at that.  If you have ever spun around quickly as a child to purposefully make yourself dizzy, you have partook in an attempt to alter your state of mind.  It's a human thing.

I wanna make this for my Arduino and GLCD shield.
Edit:  Actually, to hell with the GLCD.  I want it to drive a huge LED signboard with a ticker showing GOX, BStamp, and BTC-e and hang it in my living room.  Ethernet shield or WIFI shield and a crapload of LED matrixes and Johnson counter ICs should do the trick.

I'm pretty proficient in C for both PIC and AVR.  Now if I only could easily get my hands on a couple Avalon chips, I'd put 'em on breakout boards for experimentation.

Not only that, people are actually using it to communicate to each other.  There's one with a user sending a link of directed at another user.

Because Dinars are still Fiat and inflationary?
Where are all these knuckleheads in the media coming from as of late?  Why aren't they being pummeled with emails or phone calls explaining how the entire system ACTUALLY works?  Is there not ONE "professional" and "experienced" established  economist or financial guy that has ANY clue WTF they are talking about?
Possibly, just maybe, it's because knowing how Bitcoin works requires some foreknowledge of TWO fields of study, economics, and computer science.  Until we get an economic spokesperson that's also a computer geek, I think this will keep happening.

I'm not really ready to open an exit relay and associate childporn and drugs with my IP.  That is the main disincentive.  I do run a closed repeater relay though.

The internet is the best example of organized anarchy we have ever had. Now only if we can remove human greed and selfishness, then we can apply it to meatspace. Otherwise, social anarchy OR anarcho-capitalism will never work. Takes time to get people to understand that government is not nessesary to advance the human race, and it cannot be forced on them, else it would be a contradiction of what anarchism stands for.
Edit: I lean towards lefty social anarchy myself, but unlike communism, which forces you to share resources at gunpoint, people have to do it willingly. To work towards advancement of the species rather than oneself on your own free will, ala Star Trek style. That kind of collective mindset is still hundreds of years away I think, but I'm hopeful. Marx's ideas were never really supposed to be implemented until we had near 100%	 automation and the end of resource scarcity. Star Trek had the antimatter reactor, which made this work due to the almost unlimited amount of energy it could provide. Also replicators and the rest. When people can finally stop worrying about where thier next meal is coming from, then we can move forward.
Bitcoin actually fits well with this philosophy.  It takes control of resources out of the hands of the few and into the hands of the many, without force.  Money is, after all, a store of value that can be traded for said resources.  While I'd like us to eventually move to a moneyless society, this is a good intermediary.
Edit: Sorry for the rambling block of text. I'm a tad stoned right now.
