It isn't theft unless ythey can never return the coins.  Them not being able to cash people out certainly isn't theft.  There would be no way for them as an organization to do it.

@_date: 2018-01-06 18:48:20
With enough money at stake I agree with you.  The reality is at this time and point in history you would be very unlikely to be personally targeted with malware that steals your private keys.  That will become more and more likely in the future of course.  The site you visit could be targeted and that is more likely, but really you are still looking at very low odds of anything bad happening.  To say you don't trust trezor because it is hardware and you don't trust ANY hardware has to be a lie, because you really can't use Bitcoin without trusting some hardware at some point.  Software, it may be open source but you are trusting others to check it.  No one checks an entire Linux distro and everything to make sure their personal bitcoins are safe.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:35:15
That is the stupidest thing I ever heard.  Without the private keys, you dont own the bitcoin.  The FBI took his computer with the private keys in the clear.  China can not "seize coins" without getting ahold of private keys ie hacking a computer someone has them stored on, sending people to physically steal papers people have the keys written on etc.  I guess if they invented a quantum computer a lot more powerful than exists today they could break all encryption in the world, steal all bitcoin and clear out every physical bank acount in the world because at that point passwords would be meaningless.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:32:16
That is like having a safe in your house, bolting it to the floor, setting a security camera on it and then building two bigger safes around the first.  There is being practical and safe and then there is being "what if someone was peeking in my window and saw my secret key" paranoid.

@_date: 2018-01-06 05:27:57
I don't know that.  If you could prove you controlled the address and someone stole the private key, they could probably sue and get it.

@_date: 2018-01-06 12:34:59
It is hardware.  You control the keys and the seed.  You are not trusting your Bitcoin to a third party.  Bitcoin is digital.  Unless you develop and produce all your own hardware and software you have to trust a third party to some degree.  I am not producing my own silicon chips in my basement so I can use Bitcoin.

No.  Coinbase isn't a scam.  It is like you are in the 90's so you get AOL.  That is cool.  They aren't a scam.  If you stay with AOL through the 2000s and into the 2010s to today, you probably are not getting value for your money.  AOL was a good way to initially get you online, not stay online.

Yeah, the currency that people have put millions of dollars in processing in COULD go to 0, but then again, so could the US dollar.  The US dollar could drop to 0 and Bitcoin and foreign currency be all the trade power you have.  You are playing the game holding US currency too, only it is almost guaranteed you loose money the longer you hold which is why with US currency people try to buy other things with it because as they hold it disappears.

Bitcoin hardly looses 10% of its value really.  It is on its way up extremely fast and it will go down a bit.  If you heald for 2 months at any point in the last year you would have always made money.  It goes up too much, and then needs to correct, then leaps again.

The analogy is fine, you just can't logic this, or maybe you just are unable to see anyone elses views but your own.  A person can feel passionate about buying people beer and not feel the government should force tax payers to pay for others beer.  The same can be said for anything.  People can feel passionate to the poor and not feel the government should force taxes to care for them.  This all started by someone (maybe you, I am not looking back on mobile) said that libertarians don't care about the poor because they don't believe the government should be doing it.  That is a ridiculous argument because people can feel passionate about a lot of things they don't feel the government should be paying for.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:23:59
That would be almost funny, because that is the exact type of thing Bitcoin was designed to prevent.  I know in this case it doesn't, but it would sure help people see the need.

It looses some of its gains.  The thing is, it can't be a currency really unless it grows into it.  It is doing that.  There will always be little hickups on the way.  I bet if you map the kind of growth you see on Bitcoin and overlay the stock of any company and squish it so it matches the gains, you will see the drops in a similar fashion, it is just over a longer period of time because the gains are so much slower.

It just isn't true though.  You can personally find a homeless guy on the street and personally help him get back on his feet.  You act like only rich organizations can help the poor, which is probably the most ignorant thing I ever heard.  Also, it has nothing to do with my original assertion against the person saying that libertarians don't care for the poor.

@_date: 2017-12-18 03:12:15
Maybe you would have more money if you paid fewer taxes.  And, yeah, you could if they wanted help.  Most homeless people in my area have huge drug problems they do not want solved.  But you saying you don't have enough to personally help the homeless says a lot when you are saying libertarians don't care about the poor.  Wanting the government to give someone else's money to help the poor isn't the same as wanting to personally help.  Having a theoretical political concept isn't morally superior to actually taking action.

It could drop, but I personally expect it to rise to 25-30 through February.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:15:57
When people are taxed at 40-50% they have a lot less to give to such organizations too.  Besides my original rebuttal was against the statement that libertarians don't care for the poor because they don't want the government to be the ones doing it.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:37:40
You think you know that.  It isn't "everyone".  Bitcoin will be fully functional with fees close to zero and near instant transactions once everywhere institutes segwit and the lightning network comes online.  Two markets just opened with Bitcoin futures with another for future investing about to, and 401ks and retirement funds are starting to invest in Bitcoin.  You are crazy to think a 30% drop, that happened 5 other times and rose between 92 and 202% every time the following months means anything. You feel anyone who predicts a positive outcome for Bitcoin is trying to predict the future, but you are doing the exact same thing.  There is no reason at all to feel Bitcoin doesn't have a strong future.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:58
Except every transaction is recorded in the block chain.

It is basically like putting $75,000 in Tesla stock and it drops 20% and you panick.  Stocks go up and down.  You hold for a while, thing are more likely to be up.  Same is true for any solid investment really. I have no doubt Bitcoin will be worth more than $19,500 sometime in 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:10:44
Sorry that is the stupidest thing I ever heard.  First let's say I am in a bar and want to buy everyone in the bar a beer, does that naturally follow that I think the government should buy everyone a beer?

@_date: 2017-12-03 15:25:34
You only report when you spend Bitcoin or you convert to other digital currency or cash or something.  If you bought, you don't have to do anything until you sell.

That is what the studies show.  Apparently when people get more exposure to something, their interest grows and they become more invested in it.  Who would have thought?

First off, never said I was libertarian second, just because a government is a republic doesn't make it libertarian.  That is like saying it is democratic so that makes it the most liberal or the most conservative.  Libertarians want to convense others of their view as do liberals or conservatives to move the government closer to their point of view.  Literally your thoughts on this are way out in left field because you are redefining words to try to make yourself right.

Bitcoin is an adaptable technology.  If the iPhone 3 had hardware that could be remotely upgraded for free, along with software, it'd still be popular.  A better comparison is windows, ios or Android in general.  Bitcoin is groundbreaking technology and having been tested so much longer is a huge advantage.  30 years from now, if it is $1,000,000 a coin you could still claim it's a "bubble"
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:28:10
Lol.  The iPhone.  Okay.  The company that was the first to break a trillion?  That iPhone?  Yeah, I wish with the iPhone 3 came out I bought apple.  There is literally nothing to compare this to.  You can't say this is more of a bubble than the other 3 times it looked like it and skyrocketed past that point.  You can only define a bubble in retrospect.  I assume sense you know the future of Bitcoin you have tens of thousands of dollars invested shorting it right?  I mean, you have so much confidence why not get rich as it falls.  
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:47:34
Lol.  It has "always been a bubble" that is true of nothing.  That statement doesn't even make sense.  People did buy stock in "iPhone" by buying apple.  It did quite well. According to you, to say someone bought Bitcoin at $.001 to today would just be in a 6 year bubble.  You can try to say it's a scam, it isn't, but you can say that.  Saying it was a bubble from the start shows me you don't understand finances.

Those statements do NOT jive together.  You change your "opinions" depending on if the statement helps prove your point.

I didn't say it wouldn't hit 7,000 first.  I think that is possible.  I said it'll hit $10,000 first because I think it likely won't ever hit $4,000 again.  I do think after the conference, we will see a surge and that should easily put it at 10.  I believe the reason it isn't there now, if manipulation of the market to lower it so they could buy in before the surge and make a higher percentage on investment.  No other reason for it to hit 9700 and go back to 8500
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:59:06
They will if they want it.  That is like saying if shoes cost $100 to make, and people are only willing to pay $50, they will still get shoes.  They wont.  No one in their right mind would sell coin for less than the mining cost unless they really felt itd be considered worthless.  There is no reason to think that with bitcoin.

I have not researched Givedirectly, but I can tell you from what I have personally seen through a LOT of interactions that the majority of the homeless have huge addiction problem.  This is of course due to the hopelessness taht is involved in being homeless, however, when you are addicted, it is often the only thing that matters in your life. Cash to an addict often makes that persons life worse not better.  Also even food allows them to sell their food stamps and get more money to fuel their addiction.

Then you have black people in other nations which is normally the minority.  Look at the US.  Everything being equal only 1 out of 10 interactions with someone in the US would be a black person.

People would still buy things they want if they dollar was inflationary, they just would think twice before buying useless crap.  Most people wouldn't not get a smartphone if the dollar was inflationary.  They might not buy 5 different cases for it though.  Yeah, when you do money that way, there is less demand for products.  In the short term, it seems pretty bad.  That is because we already have been manipulating the economy and people into getting addicted to spending and having the newest and greatest thing.  This attitude creates a TON of waste and isn't good for the environment or for the individual.  Most people are living in quite the debt because they spend outside of their means.  A inflationary currency would discourage that.  Businesses would have to sell things people perceive to have real value in their life rather than useless crap. People would demand things last longer and our "disposable" economy would end after being voted on by people's wallets.  You have to realize, for thousands of years, gold was the mode of currency.  Coins only had the value of the weight of the coin in the gold or silver.  There is a limited amount of gold and silver in the world, so in some way, it was inflationary, however, it never really got to that point because people would mine and find more gold and silver, but it most definately was not the deflationary currency that we have today.  Those people got along just fine.  What federal governments do is try to manulipate the currency to fine tune and control the economy.  Sometimes it works for a while, then we get these crashes and such. Yeah, the move over would mean a smaller economy, but it would still be a growing one, and probably one that grows at a more even predictable rate.

That doesn't make any sense though.  If everyone accepted bitcoin, there is really no difference between obtaining $1000 worth of bitcoin and spending it and obtaining $1,000 worth of case and spending it.

Nah.  Solar gets a boost from Bitcoin.  Probably helps the environment more than it hurts.  If it causes a lower price of solar even a little and more people move to solar a little sooner, it isn't that much before it offsets itself by reducing other people's emissions,

Good, now that you know what it is, realize it applies to you.  I am literally saying we don't have enough information to know this.  You are saying, you haven't spent any time doing any research about solar effects from Bitcoin, but you know because you did other analysis with solar before.  You are the one who is saying you know somethnig without the research or data to say it.  I am saying there are a multitude of factors and it is an unknown.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:43:22
You literally just aren't reading.  I understood what you said.  If that 20% equals srilanka that means that if Bitcoin add that many years for that many buildings changing over from fossil fuels to solar, that'd mean they met it.  I understand you do that generally, but what you are saying is like saying "I took astronomy and have a degree in astronomy, without doing any calculations at all, I don't think we could in any way use Mars as a gravational assist in traveling to another star." Unless you do all the calculations, you just can't say that, and the calculations are vast.

Okay, USD you said is better in every way.  US has embargo with Iran.  Let's say the US had one against England for some BS reason and you wanted to donate money to someone in England, could you do that with USD?  The answer is no.  All CC companies, and money processing systems would block your transaction atd you likely get put on a terrorist watch list.  Bitcoin you can transfer without anyone else being able to stop the transaction,. However, sense you resulted to name calling already,  I assume you already know this and are just a troll.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:00:11
Yeah. And the population of Sri Lanka is like 21 million, lower than the number of people in New York State.  21 million we can assume like maybe 7 million homes, and that is a very high estimate. Their homes are not like American households on average, they are a lot smaller, so if worldwide the price is low enough that 7 million homes worldwide buy solar who otherwise wouldn't, then they break even.  Or if 7 million get solar one year earlier, they get 1 year offset.  You have to look at all the opportunity costs involved in the situation.  It is a lot to calculate.  It would take someone hundreds of hours to make an educated guess really.  Realize that if Bitcoin offsets the cost of solar by 5% making panels 5% cheaper, then each time there is a solar drop, and a company or a house gets into the solar because of the price, taht is x number of years sooner than they otherwise would. That means that basically anyone who buys into solar, is doing it sooner and you count that energy expenditure for that home or business and the years difference between that drop and the next, and that offsets the same percentage for Bitcoin.

Suddenly there in someone buying solar like crazy.  The more people interested in solar, the lower the cost.  The lower the cost, the more people get solar sooner than they otherwise would have.  It isn't either or.  If the Bitcoin miners didn't buy those solar panels, no one else would have to replace those purchases, there would just be less solar panel purchases in that year.  It isn't like the panels they buy take away from others that would have access to them.  At some point probably in the 2030s or early 2040s it'll all likely be renewable.  That number isn't really going to change too much, but there are some range years there.  If there is suddenly a ton more interest in solar, then price will go down and people that would have waited a year or two now won't wait because of price.  Also, realize that Bitcoin replaces other goods and services that have an environmental impact.  Realize that when a bank transfers money, it has a large system that does it.  Offices, computers, etc.  Bitcoin doesn't have that, so you have to divide out how many money transfers are made at a bank and how many Bitcoin and see how many banks Bitcoin replaces.  Then you have to realize precious metals.  Is Bitcoin in any way effecting the precious metals industry?  If people who would buy gold, buy Bitcoin, is there any reduction at all on physical mining of gold for example.  There is really too many things to really realize if at this time Bitcoin is having a positive or a negative environmental impact.

But that isn't the way biology works.  Video games didn't exist in nature.  Discovering stupid videos and sharing them gives you the same social instinct as you have discovering a piece of fruit and sharing it.  Exploration can be done digitally as well in useless activities.  Creativity once again can be simulated with useless things.  Getting from level to level in a video game takes creativity and the reward center of the brain is triggered a lot quicker for all these things.  Your biology isn't as super specific as you seem to believe.  All of marketing and commercialism is made to play to these things.

Or it gains acceptance as a currency as cash.  Bitcoin being below $25,000 isn't death for it by any means.  If it stabilizes it will be even more adopted and will eventually rise more in a reasonable way. A currency going form $1,000 to $19,000 in a few months isn't normal.  People don't know what to think of Bitcoin and there are a lot of early investors getting out around the highs.  Gold has very little value, but people give it value because we all decided to agree to do so many years ago.  I mean, now it can be used for electronics, but not for thousands of years it couldn't.

Eventually there will be 40-50%  of the population doing nothing except playing games and stuff.  Addiction will become a much bigger problem, and suicide will increase.

The internet is the biggest resource for the distribution of child porn, maybe we should ban it or make a more centralized internet huh?  People use cars to run people over.

I teach biology, and sorry, it doesn't work that way.  People get greater immediate stimulation from winning a level of candy crush than they will get from travel, and personal exploration.  Now, it isn't as long term rewarding, but that involves personal motivation and is no way something that is somehow encoded in the DNA.  The body seeks immediate reward.  That is exactly the reason why people tend to get addicted to gambling, drugs, alcohol, pornography, gaming, etc.

You are incredibly arrogant and really really stupid if you think our biological response system to stimuli is normally a good thing in today's world.  People like sugary foods because of our biology.  They like drugs, and gambling and basically every thing there is to overindulge in because of our biology.  Virtually every positive response from our bodies for doing positive useful things has been replicated in unproductive ways taking advantage of those same systems.  You are very ignorant to basic human responses if you think otherwise.  Our systems were developed to deal with starvation, dangers such as wild animals and winter and storms, it was not meant to deal with scientific research and such.  We need our higher level functioning to deal with that.  Our motivation and discipline to help us overcome our natural desires.  Literally our DNA built in functions would be happiest with us overindulging on cake while having sex in a temperature regulated environment as bells and lights go off telling us how great of a job we are doing.

There will be tons of drops and gains.  We are on an increasing trend though.  It might not even hit a million, but for the next year or so at least I think we will continue to see this increase.  Especially with all the money heading towards it.  The wild card is the economy.  If the stock market had a huge drop, Bitcoin would drop too for a bit.

Listen pal I guess you cant read.  I said that you wouldnt have to pay a gift tax on it.  The person I was replying to thought you would have to pay a gift tax on the interest they obtained after the lock expires.  The gift receiver would have to pay capital gains on that themselves.  So, if you want I have some Dr. Seuss books you can have so you can learn to read and maybe not be a condescending dick.  
EDIT2 So he changed everything he wrote when he realized how poorly he actually read what I wrote.  Here is his original reply that he edited without notice
No they don’t, genius. At the time it is gifted is the only time it matters for tax purposes. Many states have no tax on gifts (e.g. NY, NJ, etc.), while the Federal Government under the current tax code requires the gifter (and not the receiver) to pay taxes on the gift if same isn’t included in his lifetime gift exclusion amount (currently standing at approximately $11 million per individual). Moreover, the annual gift tax exclusion is now $15,000 for 2018, which means any gift less than $15,000 in value to an individual does not need to be reported and doesn’t count against the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption amounts. But since you like talking out of your ass, please tel me more about something you know nothing about.

That all depends how you are reading it.  I see it as having consistently stayed on a trend of almost .5% gain from July on with some bubbles in there.  It has basically always stayed above that.  Compare to other January and February results and they too have dips at that time.  We wouldn't have had that last dip if the stock market didn't have the huge dip.  That is why it recovered to a degree so fast.  We have major investments coming in in the next few months not to mention Robinhood opening up to it.  We have the lightening network gaining strength while segwit gets greater adoption, we are getting the que cleared and fees are quite a bit down.  There is no reason March or earlier won't see numbers greater than $10,000 again.

Social security has absolutely nothing to do with the government loaning car companies money.  As far as inflation, there isn't a direct coorelation like their should be really.  That said if we were going totally theoretical, then the price of the dollar went back to normal when the billions were paid back.  The reality though is that the billions loaned to Tesla were probably not enough to effect the value of the dollar prior to it being paid back.

Lol.  Whatever, we are still trending up from July.  Big-time.  I keep hearing people like you saying it is going to  zero etc.  When it went down to 6300 there were plenty people telling me to sell because it was going to keep going down to 0.  Bitcoin has literally everything going for it right now.  There is no logical reason for it to fall much except because of panicked people or a staggering economy, and even at that it should continue in an upward trend.  It went up like 6000% in the last year.  I wouldn't call that a "downward trend"

That is the way it has to be.  I mean, eventually the currency has to be wide spread used as a currency for buying and selling.  The USD doesnt have the percentage of hoarding that bitcoin has and it is stronger for not having that (even though it is weak for a lot of other reasons).  The best thing for bitcoin would be a billion people with 100 coins not 10000 people with a 10 million

If you could use them forever at McDonalds, and assuming McDonalds will always be around, the Big Mac pretty much inflates with the dollar.  It is likely in 20 or 30 years a big Mac will cost at least $10 because of the inflation of the dollar and rising cost of the food products.  At least that is how it has always been.  It is possible new technologies will plummet the cost of food and big Macs will be 5¢ each.

The technology usefulness.

It did at first to me, but then I  started feeling it is more like the formation of a new currency.  The more widely the currency is accepted and used, the higher it will be.

Copyright is not the only motivation.  For thousands of years people produced works of literature with no copyright system.  However 130 years or more of copyright inhibits progress.  If I cant afford the hope dimond and the person that had it in their possession allowed me to have the exact same diamond without them losing their  own there are no issues there.  You can not compare giving someone a copy to real life goods.  No one is losing money and no one is losing sales with me.  If I really enjoy something I will purchase it, but I am not going to throw the dice at the piece of crap Ill never watch again.  I go to the movies about twice a month.  I have netflix.  I buy dvds occassionally and google play movies from time to time.  If there was a way to purchase unrestricted mkv files that would be one thing, but there is a guy giving me what I want for free over here and a guy who has exactly what I want that refuses to sell it to me on the other side.  People will not respect that.  I purchases like 3 copies of Primer because I thought it was a great movie.  Bought 2 DVDs and a digital copy.  I also had no problem downloding it though because I still didnt have what I actually wanted.

You want me to give you a link that explains what deflationary currency is?  Just look it up on google. You dont understand the term.  Inflationary currency would keep being worth more every year, like a balloon inflates or gets bigger.  Deflationary is worth less every year, like deflating a tire, it gets smaller, it is worth less than before.  Fiat is deflationary because it is worth less today than 100 years ago.   Bitcoin has a hard limit causing it to be inflationary. If 22 million people demand a bitcoin, they cant have it.  There can only ever be 21 million and many are already lost.

There is a difference.  There needs to be a way for people to support those movies and still get what they want.  I want digital copies of movies I can bring anywhere.  Those are rarely ever even for sale, and to make them myself is every bit as illegal as actually downloading the file.  Also I pay for netflix because I like to watch a movie before I buy.  Its selection isnt big enough to really do that though and $5 for a 24 hour rental when there is almost 0 overhead for giving you the media is crazy.

If someone put a gun to your head, how much money could they get?  If you have money in a bank, maybe $500 from ATM limits, maybe a couple hundred at home.  That is it.  With Bitcoin you could transfer it all to a somewhat anonymous address in seconds.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:44:35
So everyone is going to manage their stuff and accept the inconvenience?  Isn't going to happen.  Bitcoin is about freedom.  If you want a company looking over your books, you got it.

That isn't the way it'll work.  Bitcoin is about choice.  You can use an intermediary if you want, but you don't have to.  Bitcoin is the digital cash that is needed.  You don't have to put your cash in a bank, but you can do that.  This is the same thing.  You are talking about the 2 million businesses, because that is what square would open up to the Bitcoin community if they accepted Bitcoin.

In the IS, you can hold forever and not pay taxes.  If you spend it and it has appreciated from the time you bought it until the time you traded it for goods and services you have had an appreciation of an asset that you traded/sold for goods for an increased value.  That is a taxable event.  Is it likely the government coming after you because you bought a Bitcoin for 4,000 and now it is 7000 and you bought a pack of gum in it?  No, but if you are buying everything it Bitcoin profits, you are avoiding taxes.  Buy enough big things in coin and they will catch on.

Yoe are so short sighted.  Kids want to make online purchases, are more tech minded and woul be quick to move away from physical cash, etc.  Also to "cash out" they'd just have to sell for cash, but there will be no reason to do that grandpa.  That'd be like printing all your emails to read later. Eventually everyone will be accepting crypto almost.

@_date: 2018-04-02 00:05:27
I can't, maybe someone else can.  I was told it is possible for Bitcoin to drop support for timelock or change the code for it enough your coins wouldn't be safe.  I was told it happened previously with an old timelock system and it is possible to happen again.  They said not to trust timelock more than months away.  I could have gotten bad info.  Please tell me if I had. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:06:12
If all bitcoins still existed.  More than likely, 1.4 or 1.5 or less.  There is like 75 trillion dollars worth of fiat out there right now. Fiat has deflated where $1 157 years ago would be the same as 27.28 now.  That means that you have to take 75*27.28 and get 2046 so 2.046 QUADRILLION dollars in 155 years.  So, if bitcoin replaced all fiat, in 155 years it would be replacing 2.046 Quadrillion in Fiat because of the inflation.  That is assuming no economic growth, which is crazy honestly.  With AI about to become huge, if this is handled right, we can increase the economy almost indefinitely.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:18:08

Acorn is starting to adopt it, a number of ways Western money is about to go into it.  Several times the number of people in the US that have Bitcoin say they intend to purchase some, and most importantly is it actually makes sense for kids.  Think about it, kids are more digital than most age groups, but have to buy things in dollars because they don't have credit cards.  Bitcoin will allow kids to leave their paper money at home, make purchases online, etc.  The lightening network is progressing nicely, segwit has lowered fees greatly, etc.  There are a lot of reasons to believe that demand will go way up soon.

It is so funny all the doom and groom guys go back in the woodwork when Bitcoin starts to go up.  I remember when it hit $4,000 being told by someone it would never be above $4,000 again and it would drop lower than $1,000.  Most people were agreeing with him.  Then when it is going up, all those users are nowhere to be found.

@_date: 2019-05-24 00:10:07
Wow, thanks.  Ill look into it this week.  Never worked with anything off chain before.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:37:29
Too much info.  I didn't sign up with an email to for instance.  Do they make you do that now?
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:32:36
That number is a lot bigger.  Most people break up their money into multiple addresses.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:55:20
Ah.  I got ya.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:37:50
No you are right if it hits $1,000 there absolutely has to be a major attack and it is impossible for it not to happen because reasons I guess.  /s
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:25:02
I am talking about the majority of people on the Reddit /Bitcoin thread obviously.  Don't be so obtuse.
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:39:29
...both?  I would grab both.  
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:35:17
I bought right before the BSV fork and made like $10 BSV and I got like $20 above my BCH price after buying a little more after I saw a BCH drop and a bitcoin rise, but then I was having a REALLY hard time finding a place to trade in BSV for ANYTHING real.  lol.  I eventually put it on a site I thought would let me transfer it to bitcoin but I had some issues and might have lost my BSV.  Its crap anyway though, but Id like to have it traded for bitcoin.  It isnt worth spending hours trying to work out my $10 of BSV.  Still made a few bucks.  Still banking on bitcoin long term.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:23:42
Lol.  You mean for no one because that isnt a real thing.  Blind tests people dont have a clue when they are being "exposed".  It is all in the head, people think something makes them sick, so they act sick.  You are being bombarded by background radio waves from the sun, as have all of humanity forever.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:58:03
Unless they work at Reddit and are getting your IP address and then quitting and getting a job at your ISP, it isn't really possible unless you say too much info, 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:24:10
So?  Did he put personal info in his account enough to find him?
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:54:05
Look, I am very bullish, but I would NEVER say, "We will never see $x ever again.  Bitcoin is still too new and not established enough.  It could go to $1000 by the end of the year.  I feel it'll be a lot closer to $10,000 or $20,000 but it can go either way.  There are no absolute statements with Bitcoin.  What if Satoshi really does show up in x number of days, proves himself, says that Bitcoin cash (crap) is the "real Bitcoin", and spends his billions getting companies to establish it.  Agreed, extremely unlikely Bitcoin will hit $3,000 again soon, but it absolutely could.
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:38:26
Over $18,000.  I don't know if you are made of money, but that is a lot of money now....
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:26:00
That is a LOT of combos.  That'll take a very long time. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:06:58
Yeah, but I was hoping to get my $10.  Lol
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:01:28
Yes, but 10X or so the storage every 5 or 6 years is faster and faster too.  I doubt even if Bitcoin ends up with more transaction than VISA and Mastercard together that it could keep up with storage increases.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:22:54
I already use about 10-20GB per month.  There is no reason not to add a few more.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:09:34
I am.  They can filter it out digitally if they know the frequency and what it is.  Realize we already get radio waves from the sun and the universes background radiation.  They'd do better studying that in space anyway, and we are close to that.
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:54:19
Have you never looked at ANY stats at all?  Uh..everywhere.  what stat have you found where 100% of the world has phones.  Yes, there are over 7 billion active phones but only because so many people have 2. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:05:26
X-rays are different and you know it.  Microwaves can be used to heat things, so it would heat your tissue.  No, microwaves won't cause cancer nor will they cause any issues other than possibly burning you because it heats up the tissue.  It isn't that I can't feel the waves, NO ONE CAN.  If they could, they could do it when no one tells them they are activated.  Also, yes, a modern x-ray the shield isn't really even needed.  The x-rays used today use so little energy, they are not really harmful unless you have extreme exposure, like every day for years.  Edit:. The effect on "brain waves" isn't true, but holding somethnig that is emitting radiowaves to your head can activate that part of the brain.  It isn't harmful, but it can activate it.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:55:15
It has some traction now.  If it breaks previous records, it'll turn heads for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:19:11
They are cheaper.  Brings down the cost of the attack.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:59:44
Percise would be $400,000.00.  Percise doesn't mean based on any facts, it is estimated to more decimals.  Accurate means correct.  This is neither at this point, it is a random shot in the dark.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:26:54
And it exponentially lost several other times.  You have to compare to percentage changes. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:27:08
Here is the deal.  I believe in Bitcoin, I do, and I have put quite a sum into it, but it could bottom out tomorrow and never recover.  Another coin could find something amazing we never thought of and Bitcoin could never recover from it.  I think that is unlikely, but it is possible.  There are no guarantees here, and it is important to realize that because you sound like you might be highschool age or younger.  
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:29:31
It dropped like 5 other times a similar percentage.  Who thought it never goes down
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:28:55
...yeah there is like a billión and a half people without any phone, electricity, flush toilets, etc.  You underestimate the number of extreme poor. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:26:54
Storage isn't linear either.  In 5 years I'd expect a microsd to be about 10TB.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:37:29
Please don't say that.  Your jinxing it.  But yeah, Bitcoin could go up, down or sideways.  It is always unknown.  We could hit $10,000 next month or we could hit $2,000 next month.  
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:52:26
Here's what you got, you're innocent however you will have to hire a lawyer, go to court in a civil and or a criminal situation.  The FBI can get a warrant to take all your computers and search them to make sure it isn't you.  Yeah, in a year you will get it all back after like $100,000 in lawyer fees and such but no one wants to risk going through that for $5 from a guy that connects to your computer. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:53:25
It is really good because Bitcoin needs some work to handle the massive number of transactions.  It'll get there, but if millions were using it for transactions tomorrow without that processor, we'd be in trouble.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:15:22
Wrong.  The sun emits waves of light on all frequencies basically.  Yes, including the frequencies of 5G.  They are nonionizing radiation, just like daylight is.  It is a different frequency of light.  The thing is, people aren't effected.  We'd have some evidence or some proof if they were.  You'd be able to stick someone in a room and they'd know when you turned the equipment on, and they can't.  There is no good blind studies that show anyone has the ability to detect those frequencies of light.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:14:55
You didn't read what I wrote and it was like 20 words or so.  Man they are making people dumber.  
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:05:32
Moore's law only has to do with circuits on an integrated chip from my understanding, but a similar progress applies across the board.  With that said, it increasing by the same number of times over the same period would be in line with the spirit of Moore's law.  If I were to say "every 5 years it'll increase 500GB" it wouldn't be.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:04:26
No. That is never the way it is.  Look at TVs if you need a more long term example. Always bigger, skinnier and cheaper and better quality.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:20:42
His Reddit might not be connected to his person.  It is fine saying anything if no one knows who you are, 
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:41:33
I did a buy and sell and made like $20.  Lol.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:03:10
I'd be somewhat in the same space.  I am not sure if that might not actually help Bitcoin with people cashing out with others with Amazon dollars.  Thatd make it possible to stay out of Fiat more even.  It could initially negatively effect price though. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:18:34
I definitely see a chance for it .  How much do people spend on Amazon?  I'd buy some if they offered a discount on products, I'd give it as gifts, etc.  
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:36:49
Not in the US.  
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:02:52
I would be too, but I am just saying, to say "Bitcoin wont" anything is too soon to tell.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:34:29
Yeah, and it verries some.  I mean 195 is in the UN.  I can see counting as high as 205, but 210 you are definitely considering areas countries you shouldn't. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:27:37
You lost 2 zeros there.  
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:30:55
There are still like 1.5 billion that don't have a phone or anywhere to charge a phone.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:25:01
Yo are there less than that with losses. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:07:19
So why wouldn't they check coinbase records? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:47:38
Each coin goes up in value.  If people want it more, then it becomes worth more until the market stabalizes.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:29:40
I get it, but there are 1.5 billion that don't have phones or anywhere to power a phone. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:27:00
Their stock drops, they need money so they dip into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:55:21
Actually imagine crypto currency gains when everyone under 18 uses it because they cant get credit cards.  Kids only being able to use cash is really missing out on an opportunity.  
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:57:33
7 is crazy.  Like 2 billion people would have a lot more access to paper money than electronic money that requires electricity, 
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:18:29
You can't do that.  I checked my wallet and was hoping it was above 9000
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:39:02
They'd still have to ask those places for the info.  That is a big paper trail that would bite them in the butt if anything happened to him.  The government would be better off finding him on the coinbase records or whatever. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:28:05
Never sold Bitcoin.  Bought starting in August 2017 and continually bought until this day.  I am far from a bear, but to say "Bitcoin will never..." Anything is just stupid to say because it still jumps up and down.  People get afraid for stupid reasons or no reason and people sell to manipulate the market.  I believe it will go up.  I am excited about the pump and think it is a good start.  Long term, I have always been bullish, I will never make a short term prediction though.  Too many factors to make an educated guess.
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:35:48
You're right!  Let's centralize the whole system!  
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:42:54
You can.  Why not?  No one is going to use it, why would they?  But they can.  Sounds fun though.  I'd like to do that too.  Call it Pirateninjamonkey coin and distribute it to friends.  
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:37:59
I have been crazy bullish, but that does sound fast. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:37:05
The lightning network is that developed?  That is a lot of transactions possibly.  I thought they were still being the middle men. I had no idea it was there yet.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:20:09
Half true.  You could trade for others that want Amazon credit.  
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:31:36
Wow, after the word "Ban" I can say the exact same thing pretty much and be saying it in favor of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:21:48
more countries than exist.  Nice. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:08:35
You are assúming a lot in that.  One thing, you are assuming they'd all turn off their equipment the day it becomes unprofitable, you are asßuming people would bother with an attack when it is that low, etc.  There are a million things that could happen.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:54:30
This law cancels other laws.  Right now, there is a law that says when you train you pay taxes, now with this one you don't.   
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:03:10
It is likely the outside won't be over 110 very often at all and most of the time under 90.

The shop should have gotten ID.  
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:27:48
Maybe I am missing something, but why does it have to use that much data?  That is WAY bigger than the entire block chain.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:42:00
He thought it'd reach a million by whatever date, but he never said it wouldn't drop to my knowledge.  Now, it looks like he'll miss his mark, but I don't recall him saying it will always go up and never down. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:03:27
"not letting you" was what was getting me,. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 15:32:07
Nope.
