So investors can bookmark it until it launches.

If you were to deposit 1 BTC at a price of $500/BTC, then your deposit would be $500 USD. In two years you would get back $625 in Bitcoins. If the value of Bitcoin is at $1000 at the time of withdrawal then you get $625 and we get $375.
The reverse is also true, if the price of Bitcoin goes down then you still get your retuen and we pay the difference. We use investor money and company profits to cover losses in this scenario, but no matter the customer has a guaranteed return.
Hopefully that clarifies it better.

Good question. This answer all depends on the deposit amounts we hold. Our current gold reserve is 20oz., which far exceeds our deposits, we expect to be solvent for at least 2 years even if the price of Bitcoin has a monthly 10% price reduction, which we believe is highly unlikely. We are Bullish Bitcoin
Bottom line we will ensure our customers are taken care of first and foremost. Investors expect risk.

Yes it does. Our goal is to get people into Bitcoin. We understand that people are reluctant because of volitility. This gives them an option to get in and still make profit.
We don't expect customers who are speculating Bitcoin to deposit. We understand that bigger returns can be made by buying BTC and holding, but losses can also be had. We take the risk for you.

Our target customers are those in centralized banks. We want to bring them into the bitcoin market starting with what they know. Many people are skeptical of bitcoin because it is not regulated. We want to bridge that gap. Once they get comfortable with bitcoin they can find other places to put it. I didn't make that very clear in this forum because I know many current bitcoin users are against it. It is clear on our stock contract.
Ultimately our goal is to give non-bitcoin customers a chance to experience bitcoin with a slow transition. If that is evil, then you don't understand how that can make your wallet grow. That is our goal, to make bitcoin grow so it is more accepted to remove the clutch of banks.

Our goal is to get more people into Bitcoin by giving them better interest than traditional banks by taking a snapshot of their deposit and paying them back their deposit plus interest. 
You can choose between 4 different options: Piggy Bank – 2% for 3 months, Nest Egg – 5% for 6 months, Cold Storage – 11% for 1 year, and Time Capsule – 25% for 2 years. (Traditional Banks give you less than 1% in a year)
Deposits are not saved on our website and instead are held @ Coinbase. This allows us to take advantage of their security options. We also back up our customer holdings by physical gold. As we grow so does our gold reserve. 50% of our profit goes directly to fulfilling the reserve.
We are looking for feedback from the community to help improve our service. Please feel free to leave constructive feedback on our Reddit site at

25% is a long term (2 year) holding option, which means we hold them for 2 years and give you your % based on the USD price of your Bitcoins.
In other words Bitcoin would need to get up 25% in 2 years for us to make a profit. We are confident it will.
Our goal is to give customers an incentive to get into Bitcoin by giving better returns than mutant funds etc...

It is an online savings account for bitcoin users. Check  for more details.

I can appreciate your opinion. Maybe check back when it launches and you may reform your opinion. We are dedicated to security and trust, not breaking laws for a buck.
I hope to see you using it in the future. =)

Your right...nothing is guaranteed. However our goal is our customers. And we take measures to ensure they are happy and profit.
We care about the success of Bitcoin and what it offers the world. We are just doing our part to get more people to buy in.
