that is odd, coz that is the same target wallet which received transactions during the hack on the 2nd of Aug

because that is the way to discount the loss by liquidating red longs.
If 72.48mln (120k btc  was the value at the moment of hack the value of the  lost BTC now is 67.92 MLN. If you can find a way of discounting it you may force close of positions in red (longs) so users who had open longs (that is why you keep BTC on the exchange to trade) paid out to the hacker, and now will pay out to BFX by forcing loss in order for them to shrink the loss. Simple. Imagine that you just need to force close another 30 MLN usd in longs and that leaves you with 27.92 mln USD loss which sounds a lot better than 72.5 aint? Looking further 27.92/72.48 = 38.5% of initial loss which represents for now 46.255 Btc instead of 120.000 BTC

I did see Zanes recent post and his statement about how the details can not be revealed but it is not details, I am not asking about hack itself but about future of Bitfinex. Similar value hack put mtgox to the grave, I am just simply asking if it is going be the same, have they learnt anything from previous hacks and losses they have incured, have they put in place FINANCIAL not Software countermeasures. It is easy to believe in your security (is it naive or wise to bet millions on one api key?) but it is a lot harder to put in place something a lot more effective as offsetting funds.
If bitfinex had 120k avr daily volume they were collecting aprox 2k btc a day from fees. If half of that was used for business activity - salaries, audits, consulting, development and another half was reserved for solvency we wouldn't have this drama. Finally if they were hacked 2 times before on smaller scale would they not predict that next hack WILL happen?

all starting from 3 all bfx wallets :)

cmon, if someone had a long there in eth (and it has been quite a few) there opened after hf, or long in btc - there was 98% longs vs shorts in 48h after halving, they will keep substantial amount of BTC to cover margin. It is no surprise that peeps had there 30, 50, 250 BTC stored if they were playing margin game. Try thinking about all of users who just provide swaps. All of that was accessible to the hacker so it got hacked. There is only one chance for BFX to recover any losses if they work closely with other execs and convince them to "arrest" any BTC coming from the hacker but that is less then possible IMHO. When Zane was saying that not all of the BTC were stolen and not most of it makes me think that 120k BTC had been the most of what they had and they will go insolvent. The questions is what will happen with remaining BTC in their possession.    So far it looks like that BFX will be just deducting missing funds from the wallets which got hacked and leaving any wallets untouched by the hacker as they are. That would mean that they do not want to spread the loss across accounts and deduct evenly from each one. That was the approach Poloniex applied some time ago they recovered from. On the other hand every exec should keep haf of their fees stashed away in cold to cover for the event like this. Imaging if BFX was actually saving 50% fees as a cover fund for insolvency events. with avr trading volume 100k BTC a day and avr fees 0.02% it gives 1k btc for the fund a day. 4 months of trading and they would be able to cover this loss.
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:17:22
Bitfinex loss equals 3 years of their net profit based on last quarter volume. With that huge loss I imagine volume will drop if they stay solvent big time, this would mean that they may repay it in 5, 7 10 years - IMHO just not going to happen. You peeps do not realize that they have lost almost all and whatever you now think is left to distribute one way or another is bread crumbs already 
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:34:27
I am deeply sorry to say that I am nearly sure that bfx team discovered first attempts on 26th and invastigated could not find a way came back from offline so hacker came back for last sweep before they patch up.
I truly hope that is not truth but if it is that would undermine all further bfx steps and communication.

on electric-electronic level I do agree but the what you gain here you loose on mechanical components fans they clutter more dust and get bent slowed down by momentum. this elevates the temperature and f-up hardware even more contrary to detailed theory in small aspect is from engineering practice and fixing them 
and to be precise in your theory it is not bringing from cold where resistance is lower but it is shutting it down which induces higher than nominal voltage with opposite direction to sustain current in the circuit and when hot components are resisting more.

that is something I do not understand at all. So there are 2 groups of users, affected and not affected. What you are saying is that affected ones not only been robbed because you could not keep it safe and secondly you want to add to it forced close of the position? Question is will you close positions which are in profit or only the ones which are in red? Secondly can you at least say how many accounts in percentage have been affected ???

all of that is good but what BFX was worth before the hack and what it is now are two different states. Before loosing all as you said there was a value in public believe in BFX security, their software represented potential value to 3rd party partners, They had ASSETS. Now what is left is % of assets then, questionable brand (heard of MTfinex?) and experience of people who had few smaller hack and one wipe out, there are long term liabilities.
If I was to value BFX right now I would say I can take the ownership only if someone pays me with it !!! I could give a thought if the offer was in a range of 35-45 mln USD plus Bitfinex if I disposes all nowadays owners and directors from responsibility.
Only then I could think of investing another 35-45 mln from my own pocket and have a go trying to bring it back to the value of 300-400 mln.
That would mean for example hair cut 15%, BFX coin and 12 month repay plan. This what you have drawn there is only doable with large scale investor and only if existing BFX directors are happy to invest own private money to sustain their project. I would wish this to happen but I live long enough to know that it is NOT going to happen 
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:31:28
well if in signed TandC was wording saying "in the case of lost funds BFX may request users to sell their internal organs to cover the loss" would it be applicable? TandC can not violate Local and international laws 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:52:48
1 saying that they have profitable business is the same as saying they have secure platform, it has been secured until proven diferently and it has been profitable before they lost most of the assets, and created large liability.
2 Personal Identity protection disallows trading db's of peoples personal data makes no value coz it can not be removed from the existing entity without addressing liabilities.
3 I am sorry all of them only meet the criteria of being hacked and still trading none of them can be viewed as GOOD as they will get hacked again, sooner or later.
Your Idea and implications of possible resolution path are great do not get me wrong but only if the loss did not go that far it works perfectly with up to 30% loss, It would be questionable with 30-40% loss. But in this case it is beyond any question that external investment is required to keep Bitfinex afloat in this case scenario, as we do not know the exact percentage value of lost assets it not fully sure it would not work but it is highly impossible.
if we take that conservative evaluation of BFX stands right now as 100 mln gross value with liabilities at 72 mln 
and their annual net profit as 0.02% of BTC volume from last year (let say they live of and pay expenses from fees from other activities as other currencies and margin lending fees) it gives you 10-14 mln USD a year.
It would mean that they would repay losses after 5 years only if they can maintain highest last year volume. I would estimate at least 60% volume drop. so in real you get 4-5.5 mln a year so it will give you 20 years of repayment :)
that is why  it CAN NOT be done without new investment, so the question is:
DO BITFINEX DIRECTORS HAVE ENOUGH MONEY DETERMINATION AND BELIVE in own project to trow in 30-40 mln ????
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:16:11

@_date: 2016-08-05 08:10:32
there is no difference between 10 vaults and 30.000 safe boxes holding CURRENCY. It doesnt even matter it it was one or mixed CURRENCIES. there are 2 points of diversion in this process:
1 Bitfinex stays solvent with some kind of repayment plan, then they can agree with users to socialise the loss in the way it is agreed using one, all currencies etc and is legally ok up until there is agreement on and it is being executed as stated.
2 Bitfinex is inslovent. This means that all assets hold by Bitfinex are subject to liquidation in order to distribute eaqual repayment of residual value of the company to all affected users. That in simple words means we sell everything from chairs, office equipment to all currencies and token held and pay first liquidators, then taxes, then SALARIES to employees Creditors and contractors and in last place users !!! so if there is not a lot left, which is most likely there will be even less to spread among users when it comes to it.

It is a shame that the same approach had not been employed when first hack appeared on 26th and you went into maintenance and came back just to get fully swept

from my experience this kind of strategy never paid a penny back to anyone. Been with bitcoin since beginning as a user most of the fails I have witnessed from internal user side standing. Lost some assets only with Amhash and all in all that was probably breaking even with the profit I have made there. Have seen MTgox failing as just managed to send my BTC day before, Have seen Hashie small stir. Now I have lost some with finex - every time there is a group of kids who think that if they are a bully in the schools yard they will do the same online when another Bitcoin hack happens and they happen to loose their pocket money from parents. From all of them that was just empty words mixed with teenage wishful thinking poured with gangnam style souse.

as Bitgo's key has been auto approving Bitfinex's key signed tx it is fair to say there were only 2 sets of keys one on Bfx hand with sole ability to approve request, executing the withdrawal and users key which could only allegedly freeze wallet. Some have requested post hack before socialization wallet freeze but none was successful. So if we take this all together user had a key which had zero functionality, Bitgo had a key which was just transparent to master BFX's key. There was no multisig, just simple but segregated HOT WALLET

I have spent some time digging yesterday chasing tx after tx I could see that this btc went from BFX at the time of the hack and before known/publicly admitted hack. Then the same bfx BTC where moved from OKcoin (most of) and joint on multiple wallets with other BTC originating from BFX.
There is too much coincidence and timing in this regarding the high value of tx to ignore that assumption

They have a profitable business, 
Wrong they never did, it has been at closed periods of time profitable but it is not and not going be for sure for a long time and most likely ever
and likely hundreds of thousands of AML/KYC'd accounts.. there's value in the business. 
PI protection makes it invaluable, at least you can not sell it at open market may have only black market value. 
But like I said else where, BXC would allow the market to determine their value and people could speculate on both sides of the trade. Lot's of good companies have been hacked in this space, they were just lucky it wasn't at this scale..
examples please?

Out of all possible outcomes this one is probably the best out of only bad ones.
36% means that Bitfinex may stay solvent, all of Bitfinex user been treated with equal loss to opportunities they had trading and trusting this organisation.
BFX coin is not something new (remember Frostcoins anyone????) but if played well may become shares of future platform.
BFX team it is now up to you, so far you have managed to  find a small footstep support and a lot of effort has got to put in future. I think that your users gave you more trust, before the event, and still give after it than you ever deserved. Don't waste it! 
@_date: 2016-08-12 09:13:41
I'm in EU (but going out soon) and have been under impression that US users have special treatment. I think the only vector where BFX is concerned about law suits is US hence they do not want to commit to any single mistake in treating you guys 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:44:30
Zane - at this point only one question is important: Will Bitfinex be solvent after this? 120k BTC is roughly your 2 months fees (only in btc traded volume) OFC that volume may drop if you reopen and drag it to 4-6 months but should you not have some stash saved by time of your trading and knowing that you have been hacked before?
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:04:24
This way BFX would have unknown future long term liability which with this magnitude of loss would be impossible to commit to.
Is so unbelievable that 1 BTC will be worth in 3 years time 2500 USD?
in this case BFX would be under by 100s years of profit - providing 50% of liability in BTC has been paid back 60k BTC x 2500 USD, there would be still 150 mln USD to pay back. No one with at least 2 brain cells would commit to it.

I have seen this with number of failures, hack/insider money lost, fake whales making noise and nothing else happened.
If you are a whale you said you are you had to know your deposit/trading/exchange wallet, share it with us, sign a tx from one of the wallets connected with bitfinex wallets and ONLY after that we can start talking.
I can say I was whale to just for attention seeking, prove it and we will talk money
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:17:59
just make all the folks realize. The loss was close to 90 mln USd, 120k out of 200k BTC bitfinex had. Most of assets were kept in BTC, so they have got stolen 61.5% of strongest asset. So yes they did tap in into other user assets and socialised them but would that by itself move the dammage from 61.% haircut on BTC to 36% hair cut on all assets? From rough estimations It would not. OFC we do not know how much other assets were at the time - what one gets from last order books and swaps provided are only money in use it will not include all the free assets which were just sitting there, never the less there is a possible descrepancy and that is the amount of BFX money put in. All of that are only guesses, I hope in near future BFX will be 100% transparent and they should clearly public the figures at the moment of hack.
Secondly I do agree that bfx in order to survive will have listen and take on board users opinions, there should be a way of voting and making proposals in the end of a day we OWN 36% of BFX - we users, and should be shareholders  with decision and proposal rights. There should be decentralized contracts and voting system put in place which will allow process of communication, target setting and decision making by ALL stake owners. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:59:54

There is nothing you can do, get used to it. Bitcoin gives chances to enrich quicker then normal but exposes you to greater risk as well.

that is what most of did. People do not realise that tokenising the liability that Bitfinex held from the hack created a leveraged market for cryptos backed by the debt itself. I am a part of it. I have withdrawn all the other crypts I had there and opened positions backed by bfx tokens. Any profit from positions is withdrawn elsewhere. I can bet I am not the only one doing it. Bitfinex is balancing on the very fine fiber having 40 lbs in each hand
