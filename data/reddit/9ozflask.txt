We'll have to keep track of purchases and claim realized gains for each transaction. If we were to try and do that with pen and paper it would be a real bummer, but most of us have computers so, no big deal. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:31:42
You read it wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:41:20
well, what is the advantage for the average consumer at this point? I had a bar owning friend ask me about bitcoin and I suggested he accept it right away using one of the very new services that may or may not be totally trustworthy. Its the same service I am using but.... It really is the wild west, in a way. It's still a hard sell unless you have the time to research the subject on your own and are willing to have a certain amount of risk.

Check this out. RE: mining in Nevada... it doesn't mention Federal tax but...
•  Three of the five largest mines in Nevada are foreign-owned. The second largest mine in the world, and the most profitable mine in the world, is owned by Barrick corporation, based in Canada. This single mine will exceed $1 billion in profits in 2012, having reaped $500 million in the second quarter and $313 million in the third quarter of 2012 alone.
•  Barrick pays next to nothing in taxes on the huge windfall profits from the world’s most profitable gold mine—paying a mere 1% on gross production value in taxes to Nevada’s General Fund in 2010, according to the state’s 2010-11 net proceeds of minerals tax (NPOM) bulletin.

Don't forget bitcoin is still difficult to come by. I was interested in it way before I bought my first fraction out of an ATM while in Vancouver, but was afraid to connect my bank account to an exchange or meet some random to make purchase.

Their big come back to print was only 70k issues, on par with with my city's local free paper. I called Barnes and Noble to see if they still had the Bitcoin issue and the clerk said " they just pulled them off and replaced them with the new issue, we no longer have that one." With all that free press surrounding the story they couldn't even sell out.
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:39:34
The way I see it these coins will not be sold at an exchange. They will go for higher than market price due to limited to chances to buy such quantity. FUD will come into play, but it's bitcoin so you're use to it.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:47:51

I found this its from [Foxnews though](  "The government receives 12.5 percent in royalties for onshore oil and gas while the royalties for offshore drilling amount to18.75 percent. For coal, that number is 8 percent for underground mining and 12.5 percent for surface mining. 
For gold, silver, uranium and copper mining: 0 percent"

The article was about legal tender not being accepted without penalty by the IRS to pay your tax burden. I thought it was interesting because the media likes to say things like, " you can't pay your tax with bitcoin, you can only do with that with the USD" (usually with a chuckle)

@_date: 2014-03-12 15:11:31
That is not true for the one in Vancouver. Maybe if you are setting up a wallet, but if you just want to send money to your existing wallet, just scan the QR, insert money, hit send. That's it, well, that and high fees.
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:43:54
I thought you were supposed to buy the same amount each time period. For example, $50 week. That's what I was doing till they went on sale.

So, is Huobi really driving the price? They seem to have the most volume, by a large margin. If this PBoC rumor turns out to be true, it seems buying ops are coming until the US exchanges open and that massive volume returns.

That has been the consensus all along. I hope they are really just "temporarily lost", it would be so good for bitcoin for all the bits to return home.

That would be a nice jump.

Is gold taxed as soon as it is found and weighed? Is there a precedent for "property" that is taxed at creation rather than at the time of the sale? This seems like an odd way to do things and I can imagine several law suits being prepped.

What kind of feedback are you looking for? The story is pretty well formed. If you have other angles on the interviews that would help quite a bit. Generally I would do 2 angles or 2 takes (one close one far)so you have something to cut between. Is there more b-roll? Some the audio is still pretty rough.

The one I used was at Waves Coffee Shop on Howe at Smithe. I am pretty sure it was the only BTC ATM in Vancouver at the time. I did not have to go through the process in your link. Just scanned my wallets QR, inserted $20CAD, got 2 receipts  . It was a really simple and an easy first experience, kinda of exciting but anti-climatic. Had fun watching the price drop all the way back to Seattle. I think process in the video is for a RoboCoin wallet?

Stopping at "the internet" leaves so much out. My first phone calls were with rotary phones, so to me it's almost like stopping at "telephone lines" or "coax cable" television.
