You seem to hit your predictions pretty well off.  When do you think we’ll be out of the bear market and back to $20K?
Do you think $4,000 is the bottom?   
I’m thinking we’ll see a capitulation to $1,200, as that was the last top in the previous bubble cycle.

The price is holding bitcoin’s price back.  Last year it went from 6k to 20k in less than 2 months.  It went from 10k to 20k in less than a week.  
We’re finally in the pre bubble prices, in the accumulation phase.  Once accumulating is over, things should get back to normal and Bitcoin’s price should gradually start going up just how it did last year from January to October.  Nice and slow.

It’s gonna go up, yes; eventually.  Who knows when?  Could be tomorrow could be 2020 halving.  There has been days where Bitcoin has went up 30-40% so it can easily hit 10K tomorrow..  The best suggestions are DCA (dollar cost average) your purchases and don’t invest more than you are willing to lose.  I’d suggest buying now.  We may very well be in the accumulation phase of the bear market.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:12:31

If they add Bitcoin Cash that means millions of users that had bitcoin during the fork will also have the bitcoin cash coinbase owes them.  Those folks will dump it for Bitcoin, why give something to someone that doesn't want it?  It would actually cause Bitcoin's price to go up and bitcoin cash's price to drop
