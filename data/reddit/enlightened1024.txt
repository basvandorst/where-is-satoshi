Would network nodes normally keep these transactions in their memory pools if I broadcast them before going offline?


Years of ignorance to RBF? I mean in its first incarnation it was overwhelmingly considered obvious vandalism. I don't consider this version outright vandalism but it still seems broken from a UX perspective.


Realistically this seems like the only real example save for the extreme few individuals who run personal servers. This strongly implies the fee market isn't something average users are expected to take part in which is inherently centralizing.


If you absolutely have to have a transaction confirmed in the next block it's a realistic possibility that you'll have to do exactly this.

Are the quotes inaccurate? Can you provide details? I'd like to understand your perspective.
@_date: 2015-11-30 17:31:19


They said they'd support BIP101 not necessarily XT.


This doesn't make sense. Bitstamp would hold and trade bitcoins. If coins came to Bitstamp as progeny of the abandoned fork after the fork point they'd presumably be ignored as invalid-- although I suspect if you bothered customer service enough they'd sign a transaction sending them wherever you want on the abandoned fork.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:48:51


I don't think so. Fairly strong consensus as defined by the activation criteria would be achieved. The exchanges will ignore abandoned fork coins. Miners would be economically irrational to keep mining on the abandoned fork much as they would to keep building off an orphaned chain today-- they would certainly not receive the best price for their hashcash. The only catastrophe would be to their own business.

Without more growth they won't succeed as businesses. Without less restrictive block size limits few will take bitcoin seriously as medium of exchange and there will be no growth (assuming they don't pivot away from bitcoin entirely.) Current investment levels in Coinbase and Circle are predicated on there being *much* more adoption and growth.

Using that metaphor is a poor choice and I think unfortunately leads to mass misunderstanding and dismissal/undermining of his valid concern.

He doesn't actually control Bitcoin Core but he probably has the most individual influence over it. If BIP101 is activated the Core maintainers will have to decide if that software continues to follow the Bitcoin chain or not. Even if there's a split it's probably more honorable for the ones who no longer wish to track the Bitcoin chain to fork, in which case Core still lives and Greg et. al. can go on as indicated and develop a new competing currency. Heck, if that currency ends up surpassing canonical Bitcoin then good for them, they will have been right and they would "win" fair and square.


Man, the arrogance is palpable. What's the point of saying something like that even if it's true? That's exactly why this whole thing gets so divisive. If someone turns you off it's extremely hard to start listening to them again. He's certainly not the only one to blame. Mike was guilty of it too and I respect both he and Mike. I think people are really tired of the ego-war given Bitcoin still has so much longer to go for the original vision to be realized.
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:33:52


Do people generally pick the fees? Isn't it wallets that do that?

I think that's a pretty reasonable position. I think Brian both cares strongly about and understands Bitcoin's unique valuable properties but also wants to see it grow as much as possible. I appreciate him taking a public stance like this.

How? To prove it would cancel out how about variables and some quantities balanced on either side of an equation/series of equations.  Why would every node owe every other node a completely offsetting quantity? The description is still far too vague to answer OP.

It would be nice to have a link to the abstracts that were submitted for each discussion. Tough to glean all that much from the titles but what I'm grokking is sounding sort of questionable to me.


Discussing alternate consensus protocols doesn't seem very applicable to trying to scale Bitcoin right now.


Ok, great. Sounds helpful.






Again, sounds really pie-in-the-sky and not immediately relevant.
Really concerned an immediate practical approach to scaling isn't being taken seriously.
On a more positive note, happy to see these on the list:

I agree for many reasons in addition to what you mention. I doubt Satoshi is at all involved in Bitcoin anymore. I think the complex ideas he went venturing into were efforts to refine decision theory and those efforts seem to be dead-ending. Very anxious to see what he decides to think about next.

At the very least the GUI should say something indicating the transaction is reversible by design. But I mean if not much additional support is necessary why wasn't it a requirement for merge?

People aren't saying that about Gavin or Cory who are paid to work on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:28:25


Excuse my butting-in, but I think a big reason we haven't seen more strong support from miners is because the other significant stakeholders haven't definitively said, "we are going to run code which supports BIP101 by X date unless there is a more reasonable alternative." AFAIK Brian/Coinbase is the first to have done this. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the industry reacts in response.
As for developers, I don't think you can make a strong statement about developers in general nor that most work on Core. As for Core, if you own the keys to the club then the club is going to be stocked with those who agree with you.
I'm also highly skeptical of the stated risks given the requirements of BIP101 activation.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:11:23
* What if it can't because I'm not constantly connected to the internet or like most modern computers it goes to sleep because I'm not actively using it?
* Do I set a hard limit on the max fee I'm ever willing to pay or have the wallet nag me when it needs to make a change?
* How does it work in a pathological case where my transaction is constantly being edged out by the competition?
* Won't this result in much more p2p network spam?
I feel like a ton of stuff is being hand-waved here.

BIP101 starts with a hard cap of 8MB and 1GB wouldn't be hit until 2030.
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:04:55


How is that possible though? Couldn't transactions get broadcast which push your transaction out  of the to-be-confirmed queue because the new transactions set a new market floor and leave you needing to retroactively raise your fee?
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:38:53
Codifying "human happiness" sounds great. How do we do that? If that's the only directive and I'm a computer I would logically reach for the most efficient method: incapacitate the humans but keep them on an IV with a dopamine drip. There. The humans are happy. Now I make more paperclips.
This is really a fascinating field of study. I encourage those who are interested to poke around LessWrong and have fun educating themselves on the many ideas concerning this issue.

There's no need for it to be stored for perpetuity if the transaction's outputs have been spent.


payment network.
That's like saying, "Well, you can't compute perfect simulations of known reality with 8GB of RAM so why not stick with 1MB." Increase in block size directly correlates to an increase in utility even if imperfect.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:07:12
It's not a technical question. Why would the minority hashrate continue to mine the abandoned fork if the value of those coins were significantly less than the coins on the majority chain?
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:03:04
I don't think any bitcoin business has been affected by physical server tampering. Most of them are hosted on EC2 anyway. The bigger problem is most of them use bitcoind so they have to have unprotected wallet.dats sitting around. What they really need is better key management and transaction signing software designed for cloud operation.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:01:07
That's the thing I have the hardest time with. Perfect knowledge of the fee market isn't even possible unless you assume clairvoyance is real. Which I guess speaks to the need for something like RBF. But this seems really broken to me and sure to lead to a terrible UX if this is how the fee market is supposed to be managed. Constantly needing to monitor your transactions and retroactively adjust the fees seems unworkable.
@_date: 2015-10-16 19:48:53

Thanks. And also thanks for providing this interface to the conference.
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:24:46
Because of the 75% hashrate threshold no one group can bully any other group into accepting BIP101. The majority of stakeholders will have to be convinced or it's impossible to happen. So saying they support it and running supporting code doesn't mean they're going to magically turn it on and all of their customers are automatically forked from the main chain. By definition, if the fork happens it will be the mainstream. There's really no reason to be fearful of it  or panic.

I don't think the author would even claim that's a complete functional implementation that satisfies at least the first claim I highlighted.


It's not even clear from the white paper if the design satisfies the claims. If it ends up not working you'll look a bit foolish and people will be reluctant to give credit to your future ideas. It really should concern you more than me but that's all I have to say about that.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:53:26


I think what you meant to say is the value of coins existing only on the minority fork would rapidly approach 0. Core could still adopt BIP101. I really think it's in everyone's best interest if Core kept being relevant. We need multiple implementations for checks and balances to work. They also do good work for Bitcoin which shouldn't be ignored or slighted just because there is disagreement with some of their positions. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:11:49
This will be unpopular but I predict they pivot away from bitcoin.

I really don't understand how you can make these claims at this point in time. AFAIK it doesn't exist yet. How can you purport that it solves the problems and is an implementation at all?
Wouldn't more honest language be "attempts to solve" and "aims to be one of the first..."?
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:59:27


But how would it know it needs to send them? It would broadcast multiple transactions with a spectrum of fees? Can you elaborate?


Peter said in this same thread that it was years in the making. I'm not judging it's just not making sense to me.


That's good I guess. I'm trying to be convinced it actually was.


No idea what you're implying here.


I see. This still seems inefficient. Maybe you have to send 10s or 100s of replacements to be successful in confirming in a reasonable time. I guess it gets paid for but it still seems like needless traffic amplification.
@_date: 2015-10-03 19:32:38
Although it's been abysmally described, my understanding is that without it compact SPV proofs aren't possible which means that the bitcoin block chain would need to fully validate any/all sidechains. Please correct and forgive any inaccuracies. I'd love more clarity on the issue if it's possible.
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:41:48


Can you elaborate on that? Do you have a specific concern?

How will this attack manifest itself? Will the squeeze be the result of constrained bandwidth or ECDSA signature verification latency? Or some other variable I'm not seeing?
Are you aware of IBLT/other network coding solutions to block propagation? If block propagation time were made roughly constant irrespective of size does that alter your opinion?
I'm more of the opinion that needing fees to subsidize mining is still a long way off. We'll also need much more adoption for that to become a viable reality anyway and strangling Bitcoin right now is somewhat foolish. I feel like we've already squandered invaluable momentum over the last year and would hate to see it reduced further. I'd like everyone to use Bitcoin-- directly.
Last question-- What specific conservative numbers feel more safe to you?

The right way to handle that isn't to try to hop back onto an abandoned fork. That would be economic suicide. If the mainstream view shifted to thinking they made a mistake for whatever reason the right move is to fork again supporting the new/old rules.

Heh, I know it's a crappy argument but it's already pervasive and there doesn't seem to be any proposals that I've seen that address it-- it's not clear to me how it could be addressed unless there is more risk to an SPV miner than an occasional orphaned block. But how do you more effectively punish such a miner when the act of mining is anonymous by design?


It's interesting but I'm hesitant to label it a solution when it doesn't yet exist. There are still some very thorny non-trivial routing questions and other basic topology issues which are still in the hand-wavy phase.

He seemed to indicate he thought we should move forward with BIP101.
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:38:56
I don't know if I agree. These seem like solutions where there is no real problem. It reminds me of BitPay's unsuccessful activity.
My thoughts:
* **Bitcoin-enabled browser**: You don't need an entirely new browser to enable bitcoin payments. Chrome extension wallets already exist.
* **Mobile micro-payouts service**: This idea isn't very clear but it doesn't seem like a real problem to me. If people have money they can buy cell phone minutes. How common is it for someone with no money to have a lot of cell phone minutes? Is it common enough to merit building this?
* **BTML/IDE**: Maybe this is interesting but how do you monetize this? Sure, greater adoption is a major incentive for Coinbase but this would be a large engineering undertaking and consume significant resources to do well. Is there a demand?
* **Decentralized e-commerce platform**: Never mind people are already working on this but what's it *really* good for but selling contraband? I don't know why a significant portion of eBay users would switch to this platform. I don't know what would make it compelling.
* **Remittance app**: Not very clearly defined. Also-- how does the other end cash out if they need to spend the money in India or South America or wherever you're sending money? Can't they just install the Coinbase wallet if their country is supported? What does the remittance-specific app do above that?
* **P2P data sharing**: BitTorrent is pretty successful and it's free.
* **Reddit but with Bitcoin**: Why are people going to pay to use Reddit? It's already free. I don't think very many people care that its centralized-- at least not enough to make much of a dent in bitcoin adoption.
* **Interest-bearing app**: Why are people going to need bitcoin loans? What about the counterparty risk?
* **Machine-to-machine payments protocol**: It already exists. It's called Bitcoin.
I understand the frustration with lack of adoption but these ideas feel kinda half-baked.
**Edit**: This will be unpopular but I would strongly consider pivoting away from bitcoin if I were them. I like bitcoin but the protocol is being stunted and the public just doesn't seem interested.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:44:25


Huh? How is that a solution to my laptop/phone going into power-saving mode? It would still need to broadcast these transactions.


I'm not saying it should be denied to others it just doesn't seem very useful proportionate to the effort spent on it. Everyone's devices have energy saving modes btw.


AFAIK most wallets hardcode some ratio of fee to transaction size and show the user what it's planning on doing. You can't assume a wallet is always going to be online or that it has an API server to query.


I failed to parse the bolded bit but how exactly does this work? Is the following scenario possible: TX1 pays 0.0001 fee -&gt; TX1' pays 0.0001 + 0.00001 fee. TX1'' now pays 0.0001 + 0.00002. 


Hmm. I'm not sure I'd classify anything that I'm asking about as fine technical details.
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:22:19
A contentious fork can't happen. There needs to be a majority and there would be ample time to see how things were going to go and give you plenty of opportunity to sell your coins if you happened to hold a minority view. Or you could just hold your coins. They'd still presumably be good on the minority fork if you acquire them prefork.
The reason the exchanges are starting to voice support is to signal miners. Miners above all else want to be sure they're mining the most popular / well-priced fork. Individuals buy their bitcoin from exchanges. Therefore, if most exchanges say they will support BIP101 miners need not worry about the market when deciding to adopt BIP101. It will be ready for them.

To be candid: I think Greg Maxwell has ultimate influence over Core and the protocol but to be less inflammatory I'm willing to concede that a very small subset of Core developers share this control. I'm genuinely curious if panel members share this view and if so why do they think it's ok. That's all.
