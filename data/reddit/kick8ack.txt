They lock people away for along time for that! Get rid of them!
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:49:37
I am better off never have to look over my shoulder again. I can make it legally if I apply myself.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:03:48
Oh true didn’t think of that. Yes you could do that to mix. Yes I have learned a lot and I learned to stay on the right side of the law. Prison is not worth it. There are people doing serious time an never coming out don’t want it to be me.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:05:22
2012/2013 - till 2018 Is when they got me
Everything is based on reputation since I was on original sites I was grandfathered into a lot of sites an had stellar reputation so that helped. 
Yes I think the knowledge I have gained from this can be used to build something profitable and legal.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:53:49
1. I’m in halfway house now I’m trying to better myself and get out of here! 
2. I don’t know what wasabi is maybe there was a miss communication. I used bitcoin mixers on dark web an I also used different privacy coins to mix. Komodo, Zcash etc. I also was involved in icos 
3. I got a 24 month sentence Cause I delt in low scheduled substances. I did 17 months in prison now I’m in half way house. Feel free to believe what you want.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:53:35
Thank you ����
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:20:54
Honestly I’m not sure.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:06:02
Using addresses connected to me. 
They aren’t really after customers just vendors in my opinion. I don’t think the feds care about steroids and viagra. But you could potentially get caught. I don’t think your charges would be enough for prison though.
I don’t think you really have much to worry about cause your not a vendor. Even though I do not recommend any illegal activities.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:46:52
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:20:46
Yes I will always be involved in crypto just completely legally now. 
Bitcoin is  I think you should stayed activity involved I’m a firm believer crypto is the future. 
Thanks for commenting.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:44:38
Steroids/Xanax was some imported from China have been doing most of my life unfortunately. Wish I would of put the effort into a real business!
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:16:32
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:13:27
Yes feel free to message me private
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:06:54
I took plea deal. Not wise to take feds to trial in my opinion unless your innocent.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:04:05
It’s ok! I was locked up with the guy who was the biggest fentanyl distributor he was a few doors down! I believe fentanyl is horrible substance he loved doing drugs an hard drugs. He was a very quite person. If you would of met him you would of never guessed.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:33:31
Thank you for the positive comments! No I do not unfortunately! Yes they did!
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:06:18
Not to sure
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:11:56
I want people to know you can get caught using the dark web. Itcan happened even if you think your the best. Yeah I did a few bad opsec practices but there are always things that will slip through cracks. No one is perfect! 
Federal prison is not fun and my record is tarnished. I will have trouble getting jobs for the rest of my life. It’s not worth it in log run. Hopefully a legal job opportunity would come from this evolving cryptocurrency or some other venture! Either way just be safe an smart and don’t mess with the dark web. No money is worth going to prison!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:53:42
Yes I sent him mixed coins he took care of rest. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:09:00
Yes it was fairly recent I got sentenced to 24 months. I dealt low level things like steroids/Xanax. 
Bitcoin was main option at time I’m sure it still is. 
Never did any identity, gun, or stolen stuff.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:41:26
No I actually quit converting to fiat also. They had emails/address from his accounts.
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:47:26
A good chunk. 
Multiple. 
Not sure.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:35:21
Yeah halfway house sucks!! Getting a job, investing properly, starting my own business!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:45:42
Yes it was I also used zcash, Komodos jumblr an other things. I also was big into icos
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:51:27
I believe chainaylsis not 100% on this though.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:54:15
Not federal
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:15:14
Honestly I’m not sure if they have eased up or not. I feel like there still pretty strict. Drugs will always be around and law enforcement will always be fighting hard imo.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:14:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:25:08
I don’t even think the feds or anyone can tell 100% the value in dark transactions. Cause you have privacy coins and side deals that happen also. There’s a big eco system for sure.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:58:50
Yep not worth feds coming
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:47:19
I would send to guy on dark web who had cash. He would send in mail. He could cash out up to 300k at a time instantly if needed. I Also was involved with ICOS
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:27:31
I never owned or developed a darknet website. 
I used a existing
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:58:50
Yes I did work with a lot of pros! I will have to brush up on the story I’m sure I read it a long time ago. 
Yes I do have extreme amounts of knowledge in the industry I even have met a lot of top people in pro bodybuilding! It will all workout I’m a firm believer in staying positive and positive things will come.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:56:50
Haha !
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:25:51
I was tired of looking over my back an living in constant paranoia. I quit. Then they came.
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:30:44
It’s a open plea of 0-41 ? That’s hard to say it will be up to the judge.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:33:21
24 months 
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:40:05
Yes but chain analysis can still trace to some degree. 
The money laundering vendor could cash out up to 300k at a time if needed every week. An if you wanted more you would let him know an he would obtain it.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:37:58
I had no storage of my darknet activities/personal data all I had left was my cryptocurrency. Which the feds took.
Starting over completely but legally
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:29:07
He was the biggest imo
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:37:06
I dealt low level substances. I gave up enough. Feds can do whatever they want. Charge you with whatever they want. They make the rules.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:23:08
Yes bitcoin is definitely freedom, decentralization an a amazing creation. 
No they did not know anything.
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:37:33
No conditions just decided to do a AMA
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:37:58
Yes shipping address can get u caught!!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:34:17
Yes I did give up otherwise it would of been worse situation!
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:06:55
Most likely did chain analysis this was big in my case!
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:57:30
I honestly have no clue
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:00:05
I did quite well on a few
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:35:31
Never sold fentanyl 
I have only consumed personally steroids, mdma, coke, weed very rarely though
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:55:32
There’s a lot especially at federal camps. Inmates can conceal things well. An a lot of CO’s don’t care they just wanna collect check an go home. Some do though an inmates know which ones they are an put up the phones/don’t use when the co’s are around. 
CCA phones were expensive but still around there’s a lot of inmates who have money $$ or are continuing there drug enterprise from inside and don’t care anymore cause there getting serious time! 
Some catch more cases while in prison an extend there stay!
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:27:47
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:21:20
I do not condone what i did but no one died in my case. Nor did I sell high schedule drugs. I do regret my choices and I’m moving on.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:59:47
No problem. I would use a vpn just to encrypt my internet traffic for security purposes other then hiding from feds. I don’t have anything to hide anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:16:07
Not sure % but a lot. There was a lot of white collared stuff at camp also. 
Yes if your case has anything to do being a sex offender you better “check in” go into protective custody if your in higher levels of Security. Some mediums will have chomos, lows have majority. Camps are not allowed cause of public safety factor.  An USP’s they can’t walk the yard at all!
Theres a lot of serious people they are getting a lot of time 10-20 years or life. Some have killings in there case/bodies. Or death with a overdose. 20 to life.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:16:01
Your welcome. 
Wow usually customers don’t get caught. You must of been pretty big. 3 years is to long. Anytime is to long in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:18:58
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:34:50
Yes you could do that an I did buy some weed. Your giving vendors addresses and putting yourself in danger also by buying drugs with btc.
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:28:23
I did keep vendor name for a long time also had other alias’s.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:55:56
You are correct I agree fully on the food epidemic in this country it is horrible. An in some ways just as bad as drugs! Sugar, junk food, an fast food is all poison! 
However I should of never made money off other people’s bad choices it was wrong of me.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:14:58
Yes I agree bitcoin is great for Venezuela. Yes you could live off bitcoin if your really wanted to.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:15:02
That’s a very time consuming topic! Sorry but you will have to research that yourself!
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:01:42
Thank you. Yes there’s tons of theft by employees an theft of food by employees an prisoners. People are profiting off being in prison it’s insane.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:01:39
No hookers I’m happily married. Strip clubs were attended. 
Lots at one point 
I did have 650 bitcoins at one point, I did not forfeit that amount this was earlier in my crypto days before being arrested, I also had lots of ethereum and Tons of other coins at one time. 
I was able to vacation, live pretty free but no money is worth going to prison.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:59:27
Never got close to a vendor and trusted him...gave him addresses that could be linked to me. 
But I’m sure I would of slipped up somewhere else in all honesty there’s no way to be 100% opsec an secure. Just no possible way in my opinion some may disagree but feds got unlimited resources I’f they want you they will get you!
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:39:16
It’s ok!! I was locked up with the other guy Matthew Roberts believe it or not! He was a few cells down from me!
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:02:25
Well I already quit awhile back before they came I never noticed any surveillance.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:22:28
1. Yes I forfeited my cryptocurrency. Give them the codes otherwise they would hit me harder. 
2. It was a genuine site I was on multiple darknet sites.
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:16:00
I did my time and still paying for it. It was a mistake and I have learned from it.
I will never wish prison upon anyone even though there are people who may need it.
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:33:33
I’ll name a few - aeternity, enjin, Monaco, Bancor there was more I can’t remember at moment 
Invest with dirty and get clean
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:34:36
Wouldn’t of mattered I did use some!
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:38:21
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:34:38
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:36:13
I just want to do the right thing in my life now. I was tired of living on the edge of the law. 
I actually quit an made that decision before they came and got me.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:04:27
No I think he just plain got caught unfortunately
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:45:41
Yes most have them
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:27:25
I did use Monero in the early phases an kept in webwallet lost thousand of the coins.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:33:53
24 month sentence
They would of hit me harder
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:16:26
I also mixed. It’s easier to cash out with vendor and not flag bank accounts especially when dealing with huge amounts of crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:00:02
I never sold fentanyl
I did sell Xanax and steroids 
I do regret my choices
@_date: 2019-11-20 21:05:55
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:42:38
Not sure
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:40:27
Wouldn’t of done it at all!
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:43:17
Yeah I could shoulda woulda done a lot of different things. Fact is I fucked up and became a huge steroid/Xanax dealer. 
I still have time to buy an HODL there will always be opportunity!
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:56:40
I was in federal prison. Now I’m in halfway house.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:07:25
I was snitched on
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:08:45
Darknet money laundering vendor got busted an turned me in. I would of got hit a lot harder.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:28:34
It was the right thing to do. 
I’m moving onto a new chapter in my life.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:48:04
I’m big into nutrition, health and fitness. I should not be supporting or selling things that hurt your body.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:04:59
Drug trafficking online, money laundering 
No they did have some other evidence confidential sources, emails etc
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:41:47
No I don’t feel like a criminal I’m actually a good person. What I did was ethically an morally wrong. I wish sometimes I could take it back but I’ll just have to learn an move forward.
Yeah being in a cage is horrible and how we are treated is like a trash animal at times. You just gotta keep fighting through it!
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:38:15
My co defendant got probation
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:26:33
Yes it all ends in the prosecutors/judges hands that’s good your getting the help you need. Keep showing progress it will help. If you end up going to prison you most likely will end in a camp. You will also be able to self surrender if you have any questions feel free to message me private. You will be ok!
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:47:33
There were others who cooperated then him and emails that connected to emails that had details of operations etc. there was a lot.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:39:34
Man good questions! I’ll give you guys a little run down of my life. I feel like you deserve a full AMA!
I started the business when I was 16-17 years old or so believe it or not. I was picked on a TON when I was younger I was a small little dorky dweeb as some would say. I decided to start working out and wanted to show those people. Well I got into steroids... researching them all the time almost completely obsessed in a BAD way. I was completely fascinated by them and all PEDS! So I started figure ways to purchase and sell them to start taking them. I wanted to be big an cool an fit in I hate to say it but that’s the truth. 
By the time of 18 I had a full steroid operation going i started manufacturing them around then. Just started with pills first. Then as I became more knowledgeable I moved into injectables. I perfected the craft over the years. My brand grew very large I believe imo. I also carried peptides/hgh an all PEDS. 
I worked with lots of professional bodybuilders and athletes. Tons of people are on PEDS.
I then discovered dark web an moved into that. I mainly stuck to steroids cause that’s what I knew but saw there was money in some other ventures an got pressured into veering off my normal path.  I regret that fully cause I always stuck to steroids. 
I did get greedy an the lifestyle was crazy. I did get to travel an do a lot of nice things. I bought whatever I wanted. 
I had tons of funny experiences when I was going out eating mdma. I saw people talkin salad/blowing up and had a lot of insane parties at one point if my life. Limo’s drugs an all sorts of bad vices! 
I’m a changed person now. I lived it and did prison time at the end of it.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:16:51
Yep cell searches all the time at CCA. Camp is minimal though but it happens. Best is to keep phone on you they don’t search you much when ur in the facility. They take phones an throw u in the shu. At CCA it wasn’t that serious but federal camp they will ship u an take good time an potentially give u another charge! Some take bribes of course everything is crooked!
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:14:19
Yeah they definitely have ways to catch you! Not worth it in my opinion!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:51:25
I think he was a pioneer! Yes he got life way to much time!! 
Be respectful at all times you will never have a problem!! 
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:19:58
No I just would never want to go to prison again. I can always make more crypto legally and the right way.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:05:01
HELL NO! Disgust me!!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:41:31
I did mix coins but no I got caught cause dark web money launderer got caught an turned in everyone. He was a major player on the darknet! He kept everything on everyone!
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:47:14
Great question YES I know it will!
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:50:20
Sorry 
If they catch you with phone or doing something bad in federal system a lot of times they will throw you in the hole for a few months. Then once your done they will ship you to a new facility cause you may have been deemed a security threat from the phone. Then you will also lose good time you have earned for not getting in trouble.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:54:08
I would invest in different crypto’s an icos. You can tumble coins yourself by using privacy coins or other methods.
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:27:43
Yes marijuana has helped but I don’t think the darkweb has a lot to do about it. I think legalization weed has always been in the works. 
But change is definitely happening but there definitely still prosecuting also.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:26:07
Yeah more problems
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:36:38
No PREA is real sexual assault hotlines etc they treat that very very  seriously. I’m sure it happens an mainly to Consenting individuals that are on the down low. Other then that NO
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:48:56
Most likely sell them
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:45:56
I was extradited all over the country. I spent nights all over the place. I have seen 2 man cells, 6 man cells, 30 people on bunks against a wall in Grady county with two toilets an one shower, I’m in a 8 man room now! Sleeping is horrible.  I’m tired now....
You learn to deal I have been sleeping with ear plugs for over a year an half straight!
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:32:03
Yes I should of never got involved in some of the activities I did. I do think steroids if used responsibly under professional guidance can be used properly and ok. I was big into bodybuilding and working out. I will not put steroids into my body anymore but I will consider TRT from a doctor legally. 
Yes in some part it is the users chose to use. But it’s still wrong morally to make money off some addicts when they may need professional help. 
Yes darkweb can be better but you never know what other criminal activities those darkweb people are doing. I had some morals but some people don’t.
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:32:42
I have a good support network and my wife works extremely hard!
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:58:49

@_date: 2019-11-18 00:46:19
I’m sure u can with some guards
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:19:52
I will be back on today to answer questions.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:07:35
What podcast?
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:04:50
I’m definitely not him. Operation dark gold was named that for a reason though.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:44:26
Yes I mailed to multiple address.
Es. Feds surveilled all and watched all. I actually quit everything way before they started investigating me.. Someone else tried to set me up also but I already quit all activities.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:05:59
���� thank you. Almost at halfway right now which is still basically being locked up!
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:00:10
It cost at CCA 2500-3500 for a touchscreen. 600-1000 for a finger phone. At the camp a few hundred for a phone. There’s so many ways they come in. One cool way I saw was a drone a pack almost hit me in the head!!!! 
People use cash app in prison!! LOL
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:48:22
Hopefully soon HODL
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:22:11
One other person he got probation
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:47:30
I’m going to be working, making money an investing it slowly.
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:48:55
Heard of it probably not though... but honestly no clue!!
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:45:51
I will not get into explaining how or giving advice on anything. I’m never going back.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:11:28
I will verify to a moderator please message me!
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:38:11
Most likely not. Not sure though. I love crypto an everything about it. Just went the wrong way into it unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:29:53
Not sure what happened to him they kept him completely out of everything!
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:37:05
Yes I was satisfied! He was not very versed in crypto though
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:23:29
Bad OPSEC! Got turned in by someone to keep it short!
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:34:20
Thank you ����
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:50:27
I got involved into bitcoin after reading about it in 2012/2013 I thought it was fascinating! It still intrigues me! 
I do not know how many sites are around or what’s being tracked! I’m sure it all is!
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:50:05
Yes I mean it can happen and I’m sure it does. I just never saw it. 
When I was in CCA there was tons of gangs. There are also what you call “cars” this is who you ride with. Where I was there was Muslims, Cleveland, Akron, Pittsburgh, and a few other gangs like heartless felons, bloods etc... 
They wanted me to join a car I did not join an road alone. That was my choice an they said if something pops off I’m on my own. I’m a pretty big guy that works out a lot no one really messed with me. I also hung out with people who workout all day so all gangs stay away from those people. 
Gangs mainly prey on weak people or people who are showing off tons of money. A lot of people like to show boat in prison an act like there rich this creates attention. They also have phones, drugs an whatever you want in there that’s also what gangs go after. If you stay to yourself don’t get involved an workout nothing will happen to you.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:40:58
Waiting for my case to finish in CCA was horrible. Being extradited across country and through multiple jails was rough. Con air is real! 
Once I got to federal camp things were easy. It got extremely boring at time but I did meet a few good guys. Just because you went to prison doesn’t mean your a horrible person. 
Always have respect for everyone and you won’t have a problem. Stand strong. Make sure you workout and take care of your self people respect that. Makes them think your tough an no one will mess with you. 
It definitely has changed me for the better I may be one of the few but If you can get through prison you can get through anything.

@_date: 2019-11-17 17:22:39
Yes I ended up in a federal camp. The camp got old after awhile but after being in a CCA private prison it was like heaven compared to that! 
I’m honestly searching for a job While in halfway house. I will work for a friend after that. Long term I will create my own business and be involved (legally) in crypto currency.

I never owned a dot onion site an never had vendors. 
I was a vendor on a dot onion site
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:46:52
I answered above somewhere. I was sending btc to a vendor I delt with over a long period of time I became comfortable with him and used address that could link to me.  He turned those addresses over to feds who in returned investigated all addresses. I was not operating anymore but they got me from past activities.
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:46:55
No not at all not that much was seized to have a impact.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:23:29
I see your point an those companies have big $ and work with the government. They also are constantly getting sued for deaths and disease. 
People should have the right to do what they want it is there choice. Unfortunately some things are illegal an some are legal. I chose to do the illegal. 
I am big into health + fitness and I should of done something more ethical in the industry by helping people not supplying them with things that could potentially destroy there body.

There’s tons of money flowing in darkness! Not to sure about now a days though! But I’m sure it’s still huge!
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:58:53
I did not know chain analysis did a estimate. I’m honestly not sure it’s pretty big though. 
Chain analysis is still having trouble tracking 100%
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:34:28
Yep ur right about that
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:00:29
I never sold fentanyl or I wouldn’t be getting out!
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:50:44
I have a few business ideas. But first I will obtain regular job and work that whole building my own legitimate business. 
Yes I will always be researching and investing in crypto legally. I look forward to starting over from scratch and building my wealth the proper way. I know it will be all mine an NO one will be able to touch it.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:49:05
Let’s just say I could not keep up with the demand. 
My margins were high cause I got products from China and made them. I was doing it for years before the dark web. 
I lived life to the fullest.
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:02:51
I’m not familiar with pharma-master. But CCE is a serious charge. 
Yes steroids an Xanax are low level charges. But also matters on criminal history an category.
No amount of time in prison is worth it.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:05:39
There were others also. Yes anxiety medication is horrible! I regret becoming involved in it.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:55:52

Initial coin offerings
@_date: 2019-11-17 21:12:44
I agreed to forfeit my crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:59:00
Well I was charged with money laundering. 
Yes you could buy things with bitcoin but it’s easier to buy things with cash or credit. 
It’s useful for limited products/things still in my opinion but it’s definitely growing. 
Best way to cash out crypto is to a exchange , then cash &gt; bank then buy whatever you need.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:58:13
Well the business evolved around darknet so yes. I did have some fiat transactions before dark web since I was involved in the steroid trade for years
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:48:33
1. Answered above 
2. Cashed out some kept tons in different crypto’s was majorly involved in crypto eco system.
3. Both. I did buy some things are darknet.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:53:00
Wow thanks for sharing your story. Yes I’m glad that’s all you got. Prison an being away from family is horrible! So much happens when you gone!
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:25:42
Well there’s chain analysis which can anyalze transactions. Also cashing out huge amounts of money in the form of crypto where did you get the crypto from?
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:07:17
Send him this I would be interested in interview!
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:14:48
Yes I should of but I firmly believe it happened all for a reason. I did better myself and glad I do not have it hanging over my shoulder. Thanks for the kind words. 
Yes I was dealing with a lot of paranoia, anxiousness, depression before they even came from all the years of looking over my shoulder it plays a toll on you.  They had a lot more on me then addresses they showed me there hand to get me to admit it. I knew I was done.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:30:53
Some of the links 
Gotta take a piss test will be back in approx one hour to answer questions!
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:23:21
1. I already destroyed all computers with access to darknet so they did not have any customers. This was awhile back Cause I quit darkweb before they found out about me. No information on customers ended in LE’s hands.
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:12:09
No clue a lot over the years !
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:13:56
Forfeited all private keys/passcodes
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:02:50
Yes very weak opsec! Not sure really there will always be a flaw somewhere !
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:31:35
When I got to the camp it was ok
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:27:54
House 
I admitted fully to what I did. 
Pictures of money, other confidential sources, emails they had info on everything. 
Yeah I got rid of all hard evidence before they even knew who I was. Except for crypto I had in cold storage. They had more then just addresses. 
Sometimes it’s just better to admit guilt and take responsibility and that’s what I did. Some may not agree with it but it was my choice. I was ready to move on in life. 
Remember I sold steroids most of my life way before darkweb was around. An I was tired and ready to give it up. I actually already gave it up and they still came an got me shows that this kind of stuff can haunt you for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:57:48
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:01:50
Yes :( but I will make it back legally
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:15:37
Yes I am never will quit being evolved in crypto! I will never do anything illegal again though!
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:07:41
Kind of came about at the same time! I was around when btc was 100 -200 bucks!
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:07:27
Yes I definitely do not like people tracking me for any reason! I think vpns are great for encrypting your traffic when linked to a WiFi for example or just overall protection of data leaving your device. I think big data will find a way to track you either way though.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:55:19
No my money launder was a major vendor on dark web! The bust happened because of him. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:34:08
I used vpns, tor, tails, pgp and all sorts of encryption techniques and programs.
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:49:46
Not sure he has been a lawyer for a long long time. He’s older. Trial against feds is honestly never recommended unless your innocent and even if your innocent you could still lose.
@_date: 2019-11-18 02:21:18
Yeah I did stop an had enough at one point. But things change quickly.
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:07:59
Ya it’s difficult an there will be mistakes somewhere made. So in long run the more money you make the more problems you have. So it’s just not worth it in long run.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:50:04
No one was in on it but me. 
I was fascinated with steroids for years and decided to venture onto the darkweb.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:50:57
Wow I’m sorry to hear about your loss. Not to sure how you could go about this sorry.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:02:00
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:08:30
Would rather not answer at time 
Not sure prob cashed out in auction
Most likely haven’t checked
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:59:29
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:50:36
Thanks ����
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:42:54
Yes they had that also. 
I’m doing ok ready to get back home. An start rebuilding my life. Halfway house is a total rip of an scam! Most of the system is I could create a whole thread on this topic!! Federal employees stealing an writing in there own hours from the government. So much wasted money from tax payers if people only knew!! Halfway houses making tons off this. It’s all a big SCAM! 
I’m in my 30’s
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:36:28
I was actually locked up with the top fentanyl dealer he was in my pod. I never sold fentanyl tho he got 11 years I believe.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:17:18
I answered this a few times. 
I received a Charge for distribution of drugs online an money laundering enhancement with a few other things.
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:26:39
Yes I will be getting back in purely from investment standpoint
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:18:44
I did stop I actually retired from it completely. When btc was at its highest point I had mills. Yes that’s why I stopped and got out.
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:17:08
Yes that’s the best. They want to see everything you do. Thank you much appreciated
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:32:17
Major dark web money launder got caught gave up everything. Bad opsec on my part he had multiple addresses.
