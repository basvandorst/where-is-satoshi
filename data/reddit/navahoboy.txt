I just accomplished this with the company I work for (small business in middle-america).  The boss has been in business for 40+ years, and is way old school (still uses paper for almost everything!).  Anyway, I was persistent, relentless, and undaunted at every turn and rebuttal.  Educate yourself, become an expert, mitigate all the concerns/risks the owner or manager might feel, and be always positive and excited about bitcoin for business.  I would be happy to talk more with you to troubleshoot some particulars.
Another thing I did that helped: I set up BTC wallets and accounts so that when I got the green light integration could be turnkey.  Better to ask for forgiveness than permission in some cases, especially when there's a huge upside and you're more likely to be praised for initiative and innovative thinking :)  
Last but not least: Start reaching out to potential customers and, if possible, have them lined up and ready to spend their BTC with your business.  The owner will see clear 'demand' and then may come around to all the wonderful advantages BTC has for small businesses.  
GOOD LUCK!

There are a lot of universities in CT, and I would bet that each one of them with any repute, stocked with graduate programmers the likes of which could design BTC, have establishment ties.  ...but I hope not.

Yes, weusecoins is another really great resource, but still leaves one with many questions.  And, I see where you're coming from, but feel your answer doesn't account for the simmering interest level of many potential new adopters who give up, for lack of a better term, along the way.  Am I wrong in thinking that some interested people (those disenchanted with banks, gold &amp; silver noobs, tech fad bandwagon jumpers, small businesses, etc) are too busy to scour reddit and bitcointalk to reach the desired comfort level and knowledge level required to dip their toe in the bitcoin bathwater, so they'd be relieved to learn of a new full-service bitcoin geek-squad to give them a thorough crash course and get them set up in a matter of hours instead of weeks?  I know I wanted such a service when I was starting to check out bitcoin, but maybe I'm the only one...?  If were I able to make ends meet and not scraping the bottom of the barrel every two weeks for gas and groceries, I would have paid for such a service in a heartbeat.  I do appreciate your candid, honest reply.  I hope I can hear from more people in this community and get a wide sampling of reactions.

Krugs's prediction for the internet in 1998: "The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in “Metcalfe’s law”—which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants—becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s."

thanks for your replies. :) address = public key. okay that helps, where does private key come in, and how is it used with the others.

@_date: 2013-04-01 01:12:04
I understand wallet addresses, i think. but, if you could please explain private and public keys, wallet encryption, etc. then I'd be very grateful.  Also, I've heard that 'cloud' wallets are much less secure than a wallet kept on my comp.  If true, it makes sense, but it would seem there's nothing stopping a hacker from grabbing any wallet that is or ever has been in any way connected to the web... cloud-based or otherwise...? I guess I'm not clear on the difference between wallet addresses vs public keys vs private keys. A wallet address, or group of addresses is different than the balance of the wallet holdings itself, right? I can memorize addresses, which make it possible for me to be 'paid', but how can I travel with the contents of my wallet to pay others (sorry if these questions are convoluted)?  Am I understanding this correctly?  Anyway, thank you for putting up with my n00bness.

@_date: 2013-05-07 15:38:31
Thanks for elaborating.  I agree.  It *is* a small group, and though BTC has been catching on like wildfire in recent months, it's still not quite compelling very many people and businesses who would greatly benefit from adopting BTC to actually adopt it.  That's what I'd like to change with this idea, but as points out in his comment, until the UI's and other infrastructure are improved (read: become 'easier'), it's perhaps an idea ahead of its time.

you haven't mentioned anything specific that Krugs is "correct" on, nor have you referenced any of this so-called evidence of which you speak.  I'll admit that your encounters with folks who call themselves libertarian has given you justification in your view of their rigidity, but that's more an indictment of the particular self-proclaimed, masquerading libertarians you encountered, and not of libertarian (classical liberal) philosophy in general. Many of them do suck. But that doesn't make the countervailing lunacy of Keynes/Krugs legitimate in any way.

from me! well, the company I work for accepts BTC and we print anything you want.  Our website is under development, but almost complete!  Can't take orders online just yet (few days away, hopefully), but you can browse a few thousand products and we can accept BTC.  We can take your order over the phone or email and issue your invoice/bill through BitPay.
massappealinc.com &gt;&gt; you may not find stickers and similar products uploaded on the website, but talk with me and I will personally email you a menu of sticker products you're  interested in.  I hope to hear from you soon!

I do not assume that.  I prefer to think that Satoshi is a person or group of cryptographers and computer scientists who're rogue, non-violent assassins who gave us a tool for liberation from the Leviathan.  However, if the stuff about coming from a university in CT is true, then I'm not hopeful that there was ZERO gov't or gov't agency fingering going on.  Still, a conscientious objector might have disobeyed some establishment orders to make a "Super-Future-Money" even more devious than what the Central Banks have foisted upon us, and out came BTC instead.  Kinda like Shostakovich rebelled against Lenin/Stalin by embedding "illegal" folk themes into his compositions without them even realizing it.  Pretty cool.  
But this is all speculation, and an awesome bitcoin mystery.  Whoever/whatever created BTC, it's ours now.  :)

maybe i'm missing something, but couldn't another BTC exchange or payment service step in as a Good Samaritan and serve as proxy to facilitate users getting funds out?

i love you 
i was browsing my recommended vids
i was begging youtube not to suck...

Look, I saw what you wrote. No one is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; rational, but once you step into 'let's-tell-a-massive-lie-just-to-get-people-building-interstellar-defense-infrastructures-that-will-lead-to-econ-growth' territory, then you forfeit ALL your credibility.  to top it off, it's constant broken window fallacy all day and night.  how'd you like it if you're house was in order and i came by and broke your windows, then told you, "I saw you sitting there with nothing to do, just being all selfish in your fine house. Now you have to buy new windows. See? I'm helping the window store owner!" Stimulating the economy one brick at a time.

Krugman is only "worth a read" if you're in need of a good belly-laugh.

thank you. can you tell me what's happening when someone writes "+bitcointip XX.XXBTC verify" in their reply?  n00b question, I know... sorry :)

How can the producers behind the podcast or 'Plan B' be contacted?
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:19:43
please forgive my n00bness as I learn, but does this mean I have to follow up in some way to collect the tip? if a moderator stopped it, why? and what do you mean by my "command"?  
thank you for your patience :)

so many haters.  homeless people need food and warmth. they dont care what's printed on the gear, but will wear it and love it!  this is not about educating the sheep about bitcoin, it's about using the power of bitcoin to help people.  the more initiatives people devise to tie bitcoin with good causes, the more the masses see it as a GREAT thing!  Keep on keeping on, BNB.

I think I see what you're getting at, but the Keynesians' shifting views are less a function of their effort to conduct sound, inductive science, and more a function of them carrying out their marching orders... and no that is not a 'conspiracy theory', the Keynesians are self-professed establishment foot-soldiers and hatchet-men for Central Bank(st)ers. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:07:52
*facepalm*  Bitcoin donations provide the clothing, the homeless people will be notified of that - that the WORLD BITCOIN COMMUNITY provided hundreds of high quality, brand new, warm hoodies for them.  And you think they'll be exploited for printing Bitcoin graphics and info on an otherwise totally boring and blank shirt?  Well, if that's how you feel then Bitcoin is not for you, my friend.

"Bitcoin has no inherent value" &gt;&gt; LMFAO.
This guy writes a great article, plugs the end with this disclaimer... He must not value privacy, autonomy, and global utility.
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:07:44
The assumptions in this article are not clearly stated and preposterous.  The elasticity/deflationary argument is way too easy pickins, so I'll choose to ignore it for the higher hanging fruit.  He assumes that Bitcoin aims to be a centralized currency with no competitors.  Bitcoin was created to stimulate competition in, or provide an "opt-out" of, a completely unhealthy, corrupt, monopolistic currency market (this it does).  This "opt-out" function opens the slues gate for better currencies with better fundamentals than fiats to outcompete the fiats, which are no more valuable than the toilet paper with which I wipe my cruddy ass.
He makes his bias resoundingly clear (as I just did in the prior sentence :) and appears to unknowingly contradict himself referring to bitcoin not as a currency, but as an art (it's both!), and moreover that once the artist dies there can be no more art created by him/her.  While superficially accurate, this does not account for the influence a great artist has on the cultures that adore him/her, nor does it account for the immortalization of certain great artists in the cultural zeitgeist or among his/her contemporaries - some of whom will take what they learned from the master and IMPROVE upon it in subsequent incarnations of the art's form or style.
Maybe I'm being a bit pedantic here, but the point is that bitcoin is not supposed to be the next Gold or PetroDollar AND it's not supposed to be "elastic" more than it's inherent fungibility allows.  It's supposed to be a game-changer.  It's supposed to be individually empowering, liberating, frictionless, and above all, it's supposed to be provably and certainly SCARCE.  
Currency debasement is a millennia-old trick used to insure the power and status of elites against the mobs form whom they steal (by way of currency debasement, among many other means...).  Bitcoin teaches its students that there is a peaceful alternative to this quandary by providing the example and lighting the way for newer and even more robust technologies to emerge in its wake.
...but I'm probably preaching to the choir.  I just can't stand such myopic proclamations from purported, corporate-sponsored "experts".  In summation, the author is a thoughtless tool.   
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:57:05
I like it without the obama logo, gotta keep "think of it as change" tho, bc that's the clincher. bitcoin is the future, no central authority, real people power.

As always, revelatory insights... good watch.

whatever his past, that doesn't mean he isn't an economist now.  I mean, Paul Krugman is economist, for crying out loud.

much appreciated. as more and more 'avg joes' adopt bitcoin, it's important to teach them net security and some hacker-sense... it's great for community and camaraderie.  Thank You.

well, then he doesn't understand it.  because the other two possible reasons anti-bitcoin peeps are vehemently anti-bitcoin - being philosophically corrupt (even if unwittingly so) OR economic illiteracy - are clearly not in play.

Though I do not currently understand much of the technicals you shared at the end of your comment (how you secure your btc activities), I am determined to teach myself or learn from others willing to teach me.  I'm quite a quick study, but I really don't know where to start.  Can you point me in the right direction as to where I might find the proper resources/materials to learn the whats and the hows of your list above?

Krugman thinks we need to dig holes just so we have something to fill back in to create jobs and econ growth... broken window fallacy.  Abject idiocy.

Krugman is a total moron. i have no idea about keiser, but Krugman thought the internet would be no more important to humanity than the fax machine. he thinks the economy is stimulated if we hire men to dig holes and hire more men to fill them back in.
