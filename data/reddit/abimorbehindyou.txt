I agree with you. The chief use case is peer to peer black market transactions. All the rest is hype but holy shit is there money to be made out of other people's enthusiasm.

As others have pointed out that isn't a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is orchestrated while this is a naturally occurring related phenomenon called a Bubble.  
  
Bitcoin has been in Bubbles before. It will sort out its problems or be superceded by superior tech that did. Bubbles don't last forever.

Bitcoins get harder and harder to mine, the total number is capped. This makes it likely that the value will be volatile (as the supply can't meet demand rapidly and price rises inspire speculation and so Bitcoin is prone to bubbles). This could be viewed as a defect but *actually this is good for Bitcoin* as it draws in large numbers of new users who neither understand blockchain nor have a use case for crypto currency specifically. Even if they lose their life savings, they have a wallet, they can make transactions. I propose the tendency of Bitcoin to drive crypto currency adoption through frequent bubbles be called "Satoshi's Lure".

Non HODLER here. Just lurking to watch developments. It is really hard to know what the future holds for bitcoin long term. Short term? It has seen bubbles before, this one is just bigger. It will crash and a lot of HODLERS will not be able to sell as the market turns illiquid.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:27:05
Good plan, good post.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:34:11
The value of any currency is set by the market for it, so if you are investing in currency a key consideration is volume of trading, which indicates liquidity. Any cryptocurrency is vulnerable to a liquidity crisis where sellers can't find buyers at any price. With this in mind, look at transactions charts and you will probably start with BTC and ETH.

Crypto is still driven by name recognition amongst noobs. The people who fuelled this bubble had never heard of Ethereum and BCash marketed itself to them by trying to have a confusingly similar name. That will be true of the next bubble too. The lightning network and segwit will be adopted by the hodlers and miners who remain and Bitcoin will be here next time to lure in new noobs who read about bitcoin when its price increases.

This is either good trolling or a congenital brain defect. Either way I am going to leave you alone now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:28:29
That's not how that works.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:38
But that way lies the madness of fretting every time it falls by 20% in a few hours. It is easier to risk being in at the crash if you know you already got back your initial investment with profits.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:20:18
A crash doesn't happen over years, that's a bear market, a slide, a depression at worst. A crash is when you lose your shirt in a day. A huge swing downwards that sets a record for difference between opening &amp; closing price and makes princes into paupers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:17
Take your original stake plus a bit back now and view the rest as something you will sell before the fall. And then ask yourself how the hell you will know when the fall is coming in advance.

These bubbles are luring more people to familiarise themselves with the tech and drive towards rapid low comission internet based worldwide payments. Anyone who buys at a peak, loses their shirt but retains their wallet is a new user. The use case is the same old one it was at the beginning; peer to peer payment all this hodl stuff just ensures that when most online people are using blockchain as a matter of default, that default will be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:42:48
You launder it. Buy lots of hard to trace fungible goods without sharing personal info. Likely they will exchange them for USD with many different small actors and walk away with it all.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:46:18
If it is exponential then the difference between leaving in everything right now and taking back half is trivial. You have a chance to position yourself for win-win. Take back your initial stake plus a small profit and hodl the rest. Whatever happens you will have made bank.

A complete recoding of the blockchain to make it an AI?

*Wouldn't, but yes indeedy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:13:36
Or lose it all as the price reverts to the marginal cost of mining coins with heavily subsidised electricity!

Satoshi's lure; the inherent volatility of Bitcoin due to ever increasing difficulty.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:52:42
This time it's different.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:39:08
A lot of work has gone into preventing a glut of diamonds actually reaching the market. Bitcoin is currently really volatile. It wasn't invented as a store of value and is actually terrible at being one, the trend has just been up recently so who complains about their store being volatile when it is rocketing up? Bitcoin is a bubble machine right now and it is supposed to be a decentralised transaction system. The primary use case is in fact peer to peer transactions that the mainstream payment system won't process or will report (ie darknet black markets). If it is going to become the future of money it needs to stabilise and become much cheaper to transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:18:44
But it wasn't a switcharoo comment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:19:41
Yup. This could mean we have passed the peak and are on a volatile slide towards the dip, but buying now is reckless. In six months a lot of people will have forgotten about bitcoin and the speculative bubble will be truly done. That'll be a good time to buy. When the volatility has declined and you can strap in for the next of these.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:52:50
This time it's different.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:21:39
You never noticed that it is quiet as the grave whenever a big drop is on but moonposting won't stop whenever the price is rising?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:13:27
Next time it hits the floor I am buying, this shit is a bubble machine. Congratulations to everyone who has realised some gains.

This is completely absurd and the upvotes it has received convinces me this sub has lost its hive mind. In 10 years every currency will be replaced by Bitcoin? There will still be paper and metal currency in circulation in 10 years time. The fucking dollar, yuan, yen, euro, pound, ruble and rupee aren't going away in 10 years. The only thing that will be gone in 10 years is everyone's recollection of this dumb statement.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:54:43
So if I am unable to give a to the penny prediction a statement of the bleeding obvious is rendered invalid?
