Is t that old? Or is this all about them banning bitcoin mining, too?

How come Bitcoin is dropping?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:46:00
What happens after?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:33:47
Let me get into the block chain and see what I can do. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:37:19
Yes, but you’ll lose a lot of money 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:00:49
I’m an asshole 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:23:34
Sorry man couldn’t figure it out 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:27
Keep what you have. Buy more later to average down. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:56:18
I meant from other sellers

Lightning network…

He confirmed that he was hacked lol 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:44:53
Most are really demanding atm. Maybe try doge coin?

Why don’t central banks just buy all the bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:00:59
True. We’ll see, i guess����
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:20:38
Inflation

I think the majority of the HODLRS are selling to get back in at a cheaper price. If this happens or is happening, the floor ain’t gonna be 5k.

@_date: 2018-02-06 13:58:14
Just set a limit buy order at $0.25 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:57:37
I actually think that bitcoin will drop to around 2k
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:32:25
Same here. It’s gonna move fast!
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:47:23
Every-time the price climbs it falls even more. And I don’t think the support levels really apply to bitcoin as they do to stocks. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:41:48
Who knows. We’ll see though ��
