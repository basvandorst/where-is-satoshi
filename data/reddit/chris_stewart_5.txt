So in a non-MAST world we would have to embed the 10 aggregated public keys in the scriptPubKey and take incur *more* of a space cost.
In a MAST world we can just pass the merkle proof, root hash, and the aggregated public key we are providing a signature for? 
I'm guessing for small m of n schemes the proof size is comparable to what 3(ish) public keys would look like which is unfortunate. I guess I haven't run the numbers myself though. 
EDIT: I guess even if the sizes are comparable for small multisig scripts you still get a privacy increase which is a win
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:18:44
So this how I interpret this comment for relevance to bitcoin:
Let's say we have a 3 of 5 multisignature scriptPubKey. We can now aggregate those 5 public keys into 1 public key. However we still need 3 digital signatures in the script to have it evaluate to true. Is this right?
EDIT: 
The space savings, if I understand this correctly, is taking 5*33 = 165(ish) bytes and reducing it down to one 33 byte public key? So about 5% of the space in the case of a 3 of 5 multisig spk?

Just curious, why do you put a premium on decentralization? Isn't censorship resistance the real important feature about Bitcoin? If we had a trade off of losing decentralization while improving scalability and retaining censorship resistance would you take it? 
It seems to me that decentralization is the only way we know how to achieve censorship resistance at the moment, which is why it is critical. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:40:13
Sorry, didn't mean to do that :-). Maybe this is just me, but if we keep emphasizing decentralization then other people (especially new users) will believe that is the most important thing about the network. Not the fact that censorship resistance is what really matters. From my cursory understanding of MimbleWimble, it might achieve censorship resistance without massive decentralization?

I there are two reasons why. 
First off LN directly addresses scaling concerns that almost everyone is talking about right now
Second off LN is pretty much a done deal. We don't have to innovate anymore to get LN to work pretty damn well. Segwit would make the engineering behind lightning much easier, but it is not required. 
Sidechains on the other hand are still an open problem in my mind. I think the work Blockstream is doing in elements works well when we have a *fixed* set of participants in the sidechain. However open sidechains are still an open problem in my mind.

I don't think this is a conspiracy theory per se, just politicking. I think BU is employing a lot of the tactics PHK talks about in the video. BU wants a regime change -- not any technical changes --, just like any political establishment. I came to this realization when Charlie Lee tweeted something like 
"The bizarre thing about segwit is that it would be it is *less* controversial if the block size *wasn't* increased."
There is an obvious solution to this is if segwit fails to activate, we can pull out the code that increases block size and resubmit it as a soft fork that eliminates malleability, creates script versioning, fixing hashing problems etc. However I think that soft fork will fail to activate too, because of who is proposing it, not what it contains.
At the end of the day, I think the only way to solve this is to move to a pseudonymous BIP system where submitters are required to submit under a pseudonym -- to hopefully avoid politicization of the BIP. If the BIP is accepted, the person can reveal their identity if they so choose to claim credit. I think this is the only way to prevent the politicization of upgrades to the system.

I actually think most of the developers for Bitcoin Core are good communicators. However they face a double edge sword when they communicate. 
**It makes them look at authority figures that control bitcoin.**
Most Core developers go out of their way to try have as little influence on Bitcoin as possible *besides* writing code. The more they start writing blog posts, tweeting, speaking at conferences etc. the more they start looking like dictators instead of developers. 
There also is the fact that they are targets for both digital and physical attacks the more influence they wield on Bitcoin. If you were facing that, would you be eager to communicate?

@_date: 2017-03-05 23:59:53


Is this right? I thought by definition we are assuming that the given block is part of the heaviest chain at the time a major version of Bitcoin Core is released. But we are *assuming that everything up until this block is valid*, therefore we need to have this block included in our blockchain from what I understand. 
Now that I think about it, I'm wondering what happens if you are fed an incorrect blockchain by malicious peers that *does not* contain the assumed valid block.

I'm guessing the `assumevalid` flag is causing faster synchronization as it skips script/signature validation for all blocks before a specified block.

@_date: 2017-03-06 02:50:34


I guess the scenario I was thinking of was the adversary was building an invalid blockchain on top of the 'assumed valid block' shipped in Bitcoin Core. However this is possible with checkpoints -- at least we get the guarantee that the attacker has substantial hash power as the checkpoint shipped with core will have a high PoW requirement. 
The more I think about this I fail to see how this is different than checkpoints -- maybe it could be characterized as a 'dynamic checkpoint'. I guess one difference is that there is a single 'dynamic checkpoint' compared to multiple static checkpoints that were shipped in Core previously.

Adam and Greg aren't the kings of Bitcoin as some seem to believe. They can't unilaterally make changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Believe it or not, Core developers are individuals that each hold unique opinions to the scaling debate. It seems that the opinions of most of these individuals coalesce around a certain point of view. Is the logical conclusion to assume that we are all lemmings that mindlessly follow Adam and Greg? Or maybe -- just maybe -- there are serious risks introduced into the system by hard forks.

What if it doesn't consistently happen, what if it only happens once? Does this make it ok? In my opinion, it doesn't. This is *exactly* what happened with Ethereum. It is very easy to look at the circumstances around it to justify the action, but it fundamentally violates the unalienable rights of ethereum users. 


I agree to a certain degree, but any self regulating system has to have a set of fundamental principles (or unalienable rights). These fundamental principles (if they are good) should incentivize everyone to behave in a way that is mutual beneficial to all parties.

Well, this bet can't happen until there is a chain fork, unless you are talking about that weird derivative bitfinex has. 
However once there are two chains, you can most definitely do an atomic swap between those two chains. However the problem is replay attacks. If BTU doesn't implement replay protection I think you can steal the coins locked in escrow on the other chain. 
Here are the steps for an atomic swap: 
1. Ver would create a transaction to  lock up coins on the bitcoin blockchain that can be unlocked with loaded's signature and a preimage of a hash h1 (which only Roger knows) OR unlocked with both Ver's signature and loaded's signature. This is NOT broadcasted yet. 
2. Ver would create a refund transaction to himself with a timelock of 7 days (or whatever you want the amount to be) to refund himself the coins if something goes wrong. He gives this transaction to be signed by loaded Once this transaction is signed, Ver can boadcast the transaction in step 1 as he has a way to redeem his coins if loaded disappears. 
3. Loaded would now create a transaction on the Bitcoin Unlimited blockchain that sends coins to an output that can be  can be spent with revealing the preimage of hash h1 and roger's signature OR spent with both Roger and loaded signature. Loaded DOES NOT broadcast this transaction yet to the BTU blockchain. 
4. Loaded sends a refund transaction to Roger to sign, similar to what Roger did in step 2. After this is signed loaded needs to broadcast the transaction in step 3.
5. Since Roger knows the preimage of hash1 he can unlock the the coins on the Bitcoin unlimited blockchain by creating a digital signature to claim his coins, and revealing the preimage to hash 1. Yay!
6. For Roger to claim the coins on the Bitcoin unlimited blockchain he must reveal the preimage to hash1 -- which is what loaded needs to spend the coins locked on the Bitcoin blockchain. Now loaded can create a digital signature and use the preimage to hash1 to spend coins on the bitcoin blockchain! Yay! 
The part I'm having trouble reasoning about is replay attacks. I think this process might not be safe is without replay protection.

@_date: 2017-03-18 14:20:33


Yeah, it will be a bit of a pain in the ass -- but there is always a cost incurred for privacy. I'm guessing the most BIPs a single person has wrote is ~10. So that is 10 pseudonyms over the course of 8 years which doesn't seem unreasonable. I think this should only be required for full fledged BIPs with working code behind them, and you shouldn't be required to submit underneath as pseudonym if you want to submit a patch to a BIP. 
I just think too many people get fixated on who the author is and ignore the content. As you know better than anyone, Bitcoin is a extremely technical. Therefore it is much easier to vilify the author of a BIP rather than critique the BIP itself.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:09:53


There most certainly are :-). Another example is you can only spend funds if you have the private key associated the public key inside of the script. This, by the current consensus rules, is an unalienable right. I would be pretty ticked off if this wasn't (I'm guessing you would be too). 


Sure, but this does not apply to unalienable rights. Unalienable rights are there to specifically protect minorities against the whims of the majority. For instance, the majority may decide that the minority no longer *deserves* to own coins on their blockchain. If we didn't have the unalienable right I specified above they could very well do that and steal money from the minority. 


You do not want to operate in a financial network that has this property. You will be constantly forced to appeal to the majority if that were the case in fear of having your money confiscated.

Isn't this obvious? If you can 51% attack the bitcoin blockchain, you can obviously 51% attack the sidechain? I'm not sure why this disproportionately affects the sidechain? I think my original statement holds true on having *more* than 51% of the bitcoin blockchain hashing power, while simultaneously ensuring that not a single mining pool has *more* than 50% of the hashing power on the sidechain? Obviously it is *extremely* difficult to make that guarantee though. What am I missing here?

I think a lot of people don't understand the limited amount of people that work on Bitcoin. I think Jeff Garzik estimated there is ~150 people in the world who actually contribute to the various projects in a meaningful manner. This is a $15 Billion dollar currency right now with $100MM in value assigned across those 150 people. We need to get more developers educated in working on the protocol to get the laundry list of things we want accomplished done.

It is, but with the state of POW mining 90% of the hashing power indicates support for ~10 individuals. Is this better?

I think this is a really fair question. From my understanding of MW, it basically cuts out all of Script except for a few operations needed in processing digital signatures -- so all of the 'smart contracting' stuff wouldn't be possible AFAIK. 
But if we can have better scaling, privacy, and fungibility, at the protocol level there is a fairly compelling argument to have mimblewimble as a sidechain -- or at the very least an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:57:52


I don't think this is true, in 2016 we integrated OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. 


I really disagree with this, I think Script upgrades are how we can enhance the usefulness of this system. We've already seen the two op codes I mentioned above unlock a lot of innovation with lightning, why wouldn't integrating more op codes do the same? I'm not saying we should include every half baked idea, but we should definitely thoroughly analyze any proposals.

Bitcoin-s is a library that developers can use to build Bitcoin related applications with. Recently, the Bitcoin community proposed upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol which are collectively referred to as 'segregated witness'. These are pretty extensive upgrades that allow us to fix/alleviate some issues with the protocol (increase in throughput, removes malleability, allows for upgrades to the programming language in Bitcoin etc). We need more libraries to finish implementing segwit so wallet developers can start using these more efficient transaction types in their wallet software. This is one example of a library finishing it's implementation of segregated witness.
Hope that helps.

It's a really good question -- and I think the answer is no formal measurement. There are two forms of measurement AFAICT
1. Measurements that are easily spoofable (node count)
2. Measurements that are extremely hard to spoof (POW)
Logically, you would want to choose a measurement that is hard to spoof. However if that measurement is too hard it limits the amount of people that can participate in the 'voting' process. What is even more insidious about using PoW to determine consensus is that the 10 people I mentioned above are controlled by like 5 people (ASIC manufacturers). Fabricating ASICs is extremely hard -- meaning that is a highly specialized industry that can be done by only a few people. But just because something is highly specialized I don't think that means those people should decide consensus rules of bitcoin.
As with everything in life, the answer lies somewhere in the murky middle.

Also, from what I understand, if we enable segwit, it makes it *impossible* to use the covert (invisible) form of ASICBOOST. This is more than likely why segwit has been met with so much animosity.

This is fairly rushed. The idea of BIP148 is less than 2 months old. Here is shaolinfry's first post about the issue on the mailing list: 


I agree with Greg when he says this is a feature, not a flaw. We don't want our money to change quickly. There may be awesome updates that would make bitcoin even more awesome than it already is -- but there is *more* updates would destroy bitcoin's value. We are dealing with a $20B system here. We should be cautious updating bitcoin the same way aerospace engineers are conservative with updating rocket systems. 
Almost paradoxically, bitcoin is *all* about trust. You need to *trust* that everyone is a *mutually distrusting party* -- which is shown by running your own node software. If we start deploying changes that disrupt the 24/7 payment network I think we will lose some of that trust.

We *need to be very* careful about saying things like this. Users can decide to confiscate money from people as well (i.e. Ethereum). We want principled money, not mob rule. Bitcoin gives you a set of unalienable rights -- consensus rules. This is why I fundamentally support the idea of soft forks -- they *restrict* what can be done in the system -- keeping the old invariants of the system.


admittedly I have been following this stuff from afar, but I still haven't seen how this is going to be done without causing network chaos. 
Some more food for thought, and something that bothers me, is can't this UASF mechanism be used for hard forks as well? I like the fact that hard forks are hard to execute, I don't know if I like the idea that they would become easier to execute via the mob.

This really underscores the value of Bitcoin to me. While people *can* isolate businesses from the legacy financial system, they *cannot* freeze people from making bitcoin transactions. 
Something I do worry about is the *entire* legacy financial system colluding to isolate bitcoin exchanges. That is, they will not process their business because of the stigma around bitcoin. 
From my understanding, this is how they stopped online gambling in the United States. The [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]( targeted financial institutions to keep people from gambling online, *not* the gambling sites themselves. They knew the gambling sites will keep popping up -- however the financial institutions were mainstays. 
I think we might see something like this happen to bitcoin. We all know transacting in bitcoin is "easy" once you have it, but getting a hold of bitcoin is a pain in the ass. If financial institutions start blacklisting exchanges, it will become even harder for the average joe to get a hold of bitcoin. This might be enough to keep bitcoin from ever gaining widespread adoption.

If I shipped a customer of mine a product, but then we *reverse* that payment, how the heck am I going to get my customer to repay me again? Obviously the customer might be good actor, but when you are running a business you can't always count on that. 
If we start rolling back the blockchain this puts us on the level of paypal, visa etc except much slower and inefficient. I'm interested in principled payment networks/money -- not lobbying for rollbacks/hard forks.

I see comments in this thread saying "Lol good luck" or that the government is going to have a hard time doing this.
They aren't.
Bitcoin is not private by default right now. We *need* to address fungibility of bitcoin soon. As we grow, I think merging in privacy enhancing code is going to get *much* more controversial. It might be the first time we see state actors seriously influencing bitcoin. 
I'm hopeful we can get a permanent fix into the protocol before our market cap grows even more.

sipa had a comment in wizards about how CA is actually a *bad* idea to put on the bitcoin mainchain as it allows free loading for people. It would essentially pass the validation costs to bitcoin node operators. 
I guess that is a long way of asking, can we *exclude* CA functionality if we *include* CT functionality?

Here is my attempt: 
Turing complete languages (like the ones in Ethereum) are *computationally equivalent* to programming languages like we have in Bitcoin. 
Computationally equivalent is just a fancy way of saying they can compute the exact same thing. 
This *does not* take things into account like developer experience, or blockchain specific limitations (consensus rules). 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:27:20
It is more than just *power* -- it is also about profit. ASICBOOST is a cash cow for certain set of miners. They will *never* support segwit as it reduces their profitability by 20-30%.

This is *only* for payment finality. They *cannot* take anything they want. When you run your own node you are given other invariants about the network. One of those is 21M coin limit, another is a person cannot spend another person's coins unless they can provide a valid digital signature for the script. 


I agree with this sentiment for the current miners on the network, but what if a government starts mining bitcoin with the sole purpose of destroying bitcoin? Do we implicitly trust those miners too? The sole purpose of their operation is *destroying* the value bitcoin.

This may be the primary difference in views that we have. In my opinion we need to create a rock solid side-to-main peg. It appears that you want to do that *and* create a rock solid side-to-side peg.
It is my view that if we can create the side-to-main peg we can let people do whatever crazy innovations they want between their sidechains. Perhaps they will even use their sidechain as an anchor for another sidechain (dangerous?).


I'm not sure I'm convinced that it is *inherent* to our scheme. It may be just inherent to a certain set of security parameters. If we allowed a WT for every s:block I believe this concern would go away. I know Sztorc's initial idea for drivechain's was to make theft's obvious -- but I think theft would still be *very* obvious if there was a theft when WT's are occurring on every s:block. That is because consensus would diverge between the sidechain and the SHOMs. Now what we should do in that case is a very good question -- do we ring up the mainchain miners and tell them to start censoring certain headers? That would be a very unfortunate solution in my opinion. But I also don't know if I have a better answer to it -- especially if the attacker is extremely wealthy in terms of m:bitcoin.


It is a good idea to put a website together, you have a lot of information to share and it might get overwhelming to put all of it on the dev mailing list!
EDIT: 
I really do believe atomic swaps and side-to-side pegs are equivalent. At the end of the day both s1:bitcoin and s2:bitcoin are worthless unless you can redeem them for m:bitcoin. You might be able to make the case that there is a slight variance in *quality* of the sidechain based on
* Tx fees
* Number of m:bitcoin backing the sidechain
* prolific supporters of the sidechain
However I don't believe we should be encouraging people to use a s:token *as the reserve currency* for another sidechain. In my opinion that is what you insulating with side-to-side pegs. How do determine if a sidechain is not operating at fractional reserves then? It would be difficult in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:13:36
I'm actually wondering this myself. The author of the post elaborates on why side-to-side pegs could be exploited -- but why would you have a side-to-side peg in the first place? 
Atomic swaps can completely replace side-to-side pegs in my opinion -- assuming that both chains are pegged to the bitcoin blockchain. 
The author elaborates on driveproofs a little more [here]( He also provides a new scheme for a peg called proof of mainstake in that blog post. Here is what he thinks is weak about driveproofs: 


I'm still trying to understand what he means here and also trying to parse his new proposal. What are your thoughts on his criticism?


I don't necessarily agree with this -- we shouldn't publish software to the wider community that has weak security properties. Would you recommend using SHA1 because using a hash function is better than no hash function at all?
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:56:49
Couldn't we just concatenate the last two block headers then use the SHA256(prev1-header || prev2-header)? Or would this degrade security in some way that I do not understand? 
EDIT: Since the prevBlockHash is included in the block hash, this probably doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:53:49
Thanks! For some reason ZmnSCPxj doesn't get the credit he deserves on the mailing list with his ideas -- I'm the only one to have replied to him -- even if their are flaws in his proposals they certainly well thought out and deserve more scrutiny. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:37:16
As far as I can tell this analysis is correct. 
In the scheme that I was imagining -- where withdrawls were allowed *every* s:block -- miners could effectively start the withdrawl process immediately when they find a s:block with blind merge mining. 
In my naive scheme I thought this would mean that an attacker would have to overcome the previous 287 s:blocks BMM fees. 
This leads to two scenarios though
1. The s:miner(s) in the previous 287 blocks withdrew all of their s:bitcoin to m:bitcoin. This means they have no incentive to bid against an attacker as they have nothing to lose if the sidechain is attacked -- other than their m:bitcoin possibly being devalued. 
2. The s:miner(s) in the previous 287 blocks only withdrew enough to replenish their BMM fee. This could mean they still have a s:bitcoin. An attack can be levied as you specified above in this case. 
In this analysis you do not appear to credit the fact that m:bitcoin will be devalued if this attack is levied against a sidechain. While the attacker may have more bitcoin at the end of the day, at what cost did it come at? I find it highly unlikely that a sidechain will be attacked, have it's reserves stolen, have those m:bitcoin sent to an exchange, and sold without extreme degradation in price of m:bitcoin.
From your website


I concede that the scenario you laid out above -- where a miner can 51% attack the bitcoin blockchain -- is much more unlikely, and costly, than an attacker attacking a sidechain to steal the reserves via BMM.
Overall it seems like we need a method to keep stakes from being censored. I'm going to think about how we can accomplish this over the next few days. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:47:45
Think about it a little bit like segwit -- we didn't get rid of transaction formats *before* segwit. It just is highly encouraged to use as it is cheaper, unlocks new functionality etc. You can use pre segwit transactions though. If we were to *remove* pre segwit transactions that would ~~require a hard fork.~~ soft fork. 
Remember, a soft fork adds a new rule to the consensus rule set. A hard fork *removes* a rule from the consensus rule set. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:18:45

For what this is worth, [I think you should read about using OP_WITHDRAWPROOFVERIFY]( and see what you think about that instead of using Paul's voting scheme. 
This would allow us to prove that a WT occurred in a side:block. It also allows us to prove that side:miners extended the blockchain containing the WT by 1008 blocks. This gives us closer properties to proof of work.
EDIT: 
[Make sure to read this post as well about sidechain headers on mainchain (SHOM)]( They key insight from the author is: 


@_date: 2017-09-12 14:38:43
I agree drivechains are unlikely in Sztorc's original incarnation. However you should follow the sidechain discussion the mailing list. We've been talking about using [OP_WITHDRAWPROOFVERIFY]( along with SHIM (sidechain headers in mainchain) to preserve ownership properties of a coin across blockchains. Pretty interesting stuff.  When we combine this with Paul's blind merge mining concept I think we might have something that is workable.

A tweet from Barry Silbert. I do believe Barry is altruistic. 
However, Barry has to realize the community has already started to fracture with the Bitcoin Cash fork. S2X will continue to divide the community. Segwit already gives us a doubling of capacity on the network which hasn't even been close to being exhausted. 
We should wait until segwit's capacity increase is met for a hard fork. I believe by then we will have realized the lightning network and possibly have viable open interoperable blockchains (sidechains) with bitcoin. 
EDIT: 
And let's be honest, Barry says "he has no control" but if he sent out a tweet saying he does not support S2x anymore this fork would be gone faster than water in the sahara desert.

Very interesting. I'm going to copy and paste the abstract: 


loops and recursion, designed to be used for crypto-currencies and block-
chain applications.  It aims to improve upon existing crypto-currency lan-
guages, such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum’s EVM, while avoiding some
of  the  problems  they  face.   Simplicity  comes  with  formal  denotational
semantics defined in Coq, a popular, general purpose software proof as-
sistant.   Simplicity  also  includes  operational  semantics  that  are  defined
with  an  abstract  machine  that  we  call  the  Bit  Machine.   The  Bit  Ma-
chine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time
resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs.  Owing to its Turing
incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used
to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to
execution.  While Turing incomplete, Simplicity can express any finitary
function, which we believe is enough to build useful “smart contracts” for
blockchain applications.
This is a major step in the right direction for 'smart' contracting languages. Notice how Russell emphasizes we can give  proofs about our contracts to avoid logical errors in the program. This gives us higher security guarantees and also lets us reason about the correctness -- along with the performance if I understand the Bit Machine correctly -- about our contracts.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:06:07
Yes. I think his language proposes to use 'native' MAST. That means that every logical branch that is *not* executed in the Simplicity program will be pruned. That means wallet providers won't have to implement their own MAST implementations. They will just need to use a simplicity compiler.

You can prove that the software is written correctly. This isn't trivial though to do this and takes a lot of human power to achieve this. 
In software engineering there are two things you are trying to get right:
Software Validation - did we build the right thing?
Software Verification - did we build the thing right?
Here is what Russell is trying to achieve with this language proposal (software validation):
* Create an expressive language that provides users with the tools needed
to build novel programs and smart contracts.
* Enable static analysis that provides useful upper bounds on the amount
of computation required.
* Minimize  bandwidth  and  storage  requirements  and  enhance  privacy  by
removing unused code at redemption time.
* Maintain Bitcoin’s design of self-contained transactions whereby programs
do not have access to any information outside the transaction.
* Provide  formal  semantics  that  facilitate  easy  reasoning  about  programs
using existing off-the-shelf proof-assistant software
Verification is *proving* we implemented the thing correctly. For instance Russell talks in his paper about *verifying* the SHA256 implementation is correct.
Another fancy word used is [*static analysis*]( That means having a program look at your smart contract *without running it*. Hopefully this catches bugs earlier in the development cycle. It is a language design choice of Simplicity to facilitate this. A typical static analysis tool is a compiler that checks types of a program to make sure you aren't passing a String where an Integer is required etc.

To echo what this guy is saying, one not so obvious problem is the ability to *prove* that you voted for a candidate. This allows a very wealthy candidate to purchase votes, and I can go back to that candidate and *prove* that I voted for that candidate and receive my money. A great thing about paper ballots is you cannot prove that you voted for a candidate, but you can reasonably assume that your vote was counted.

Your statement is a little unclear to me. This is like comparing apples and oranges. 


I'm assuming you are talking about payment channels. With payment channels, having to transmit the extra data related to CT shouldn't be a problem. However validating/storing this data at Layer 1 is a problem as that needs to be done by 5,000 different machines distributed across the globe.

You seem to think that every innovation will work out. There will be some innovations that work on paper, that work in controlled testing, but just don't work in practice. Litecoin can take that risk -- and assuming it doesn't get blown up we can move it into Bitcoin. 
I'm actually interested in seeing how sidechains would work on Litecoin before we integrate them into Bitcoin. Now that they have Segwit they can integrate OP_WITHDRAWPROOFVERIFY/OP_REORGPROOFVERIFY into Script.

Segwit enables the lightning network, which will increase the scalability of the network by orders of magnitude. IMO most transactions will happen on the lightning network in the future. Segwit also increases the block size to ~2MB -- which gives us some leeway until various lightning network teams finish their proposals. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:38:32
BIP148 risks a chain split as well. I support Bitcoin *as is* over risking a chain split via BIP148. 
BarryCoin represents a hard fork -- which I don't support -- someone had a great post (whalepanda?) about horse trading which I thought applied to BarryCoin. Hard forks are dangerous and violate previous invariants the protocol promised us which really undermines what I think is valuable about the bitcoin protocol. Again, I support Bitcoin *as is* over BarryCoin. I would support a UASF (not necessarily BIP148) over switching to BarryCoin. 
Overall I am against hard forks that don't fix protocol security vulnerabilities. I think we need to give protocol developers a little more time to figure out how to *safely* deploy a soft fork with out wide miner support. Just because we want to figure out how to do it safely *does not* mean we want to give control of the protocol to a wealthy individuals such as Barry, or miners such as Jihan.  
 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:59:24
Don't mistake the desire for *safely* upgrading the protocol for complacency. I think most of the dev community support the idea of a UASF and despise the possibility of covert (invisible usage) of ASICBOOST on the network. 
We just want to get this new type of protocol upgrade right since there is a $40B currency at stake.

I personally wonder how much of this stuff is just miscommunication between the two sides. The other day we had a pretty significant moment in my opinion. We had our first bilingual BIP proposal (english/mandarin).
Reading through Bitmain's statement is a little painful -- but I wonder how much of that is because of the language barrier. Perhaps some ideas get lost in translation? It seems that they haven't understood that it is pretty much impossible to scale something like a blockchain to serve the masses *while retaining strong censorship resistance*. It would be interesting to ask them what they think the most valuable property of the bitcoin blockchain is -- maybe they don't value censorship resistance which would explain their position. 
It seems like the well has been poisoned on segwit, but I am hoping we can still reach out too Chinese miners and have future protocol upgrades activated via BIP9. Examples: Scripting enhacements, Sidechain/Drivechains, privacy/fungibility etc. Hopefully we see more BIP proposals that are bilingual to help with this.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:37:00
If Bitmain decides to hard fork (and takes their hashing power with them), and BIP148 activates with ~40% of the network's hashing power, the legacy chain (non segwit chain) will more than likely be reorged onto the BIP148 chain. This is because BIP148 is a soft fork.

I don't doubt Peter's users want cheap transaction. This is sort of a meaningless truism. Of course everyone wants cheap transactions. They also want more money in their bank account and a 6 pack.
Does that mean those things are possible though *without* sacrifices? In this case we are trading the censorship resistance of the network for these cheap transactions. 
We all know there is an unbounded need for cheap/free transactions in the world. That doesn't mean it is *actually* feasible without sacrificing things.

I think most of the same principles apply for "normal" users of Lightning. Obviously if you are transacting small amounts, it might not be worth the hassle. If HTLCs grow in size people are going to want to think about these things though.
