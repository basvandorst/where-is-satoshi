You guys REALLY need to look up "black swan event" just because it happened once it does not mean it will happen again, this coin has been trending downwards for LITERALLY MONTHS, get out now before you lose more.

Why is it so hard to see that bitcoin is on a downward trend? if you truly believed in bitcoin you'd sell then buy at a lower price to have more, but no you're all cowards who "HODL" because that's all you know how to do if you know it's going to go back up and it's going down why not sell and then buy more at a lower price? Answer me that one simple question.

Funny how people say "DER CARTELL IS MANIPULATIN' MUH BITCOIN" when it goes down but never complain when it goes up.

Does this guy just "forget" that 6 months ago bitcoin was $15K+??? I mean I guess it's ok if you're mining bitcoin, but if you're buying it you'd have lost out on quite a bit. Not FUD btw just a realistic look on this self proclaimed CEO of binance.

Where's the proof you paid for that with bitcoin?

Most of this is peer to peer if it was actually in the billions to external sources I.E one of the few (failing) vab companies trying to bring in new customers or the odd mom and pop store then it would be a different story, stop shilling this memecoin.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:47:37
And it'll be out of buisness within a year, stop shilling this bitmeme.

Right now I'm emulating what bitcoin is doing by burning my FIAT pay packet who needs money anyway?

So... your big reveal is that news companies have a narrative and that they share scripts to save money on writers? WOW how can you not know this? the way they covered the election campaign should have opened everyone's eyes.

This is the worst argument I've heard all year electricity was never a factor in my book the increase in graphic card prices though IS, when you willingly increase the price of Graphics cards so much that it's not only noticeable to the manufacturers, but to the WIDER MARKET AS WELL, that is truly selfish.

Oh nice, you should see if you can get them for $7 rather than the $20 they were priced at yesterday... no wait that's bitcoin haha I get confused.

I don't understand why you are all so upset everything here is correct YTD bitcoin has lost over 80% of it's value, and thanks to negative press and high profile scam artists (BITCONNEEEEEEEEECT) like Carlos, it's percieved negatively by many people, including editors on wikipedia, the """"UNBIASED"""" online dictionary.
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:51:39
So, let me get this straight, just because someone has a different opinion than you or got burned and is doing their damnedest to make sure other people get out before it's too late you think their trolls? People have reason to hate bitcoin be that personal or professional, I personally don't like the way it's made ransomeware more popular or cost me a pretty penny when I upgraded my graphics card. I'm not totally blind to it's positives a decentralized online hub sounds like a good idea, and one of these days I may even eat my own words and buy a coin, but untill that day comes I would urge caution I've had people try to get me into link, litecoin btconnect and BTC , thank god I erred on the side of caution otherwise I'd have lost alot of money in September.

Yeah you're totally right this 82+% drop is totally FUD and not reality. There isn't a rolleyes large enough for me in the reddit database and not enough room to ASCII one that would fit adequately the amount of disgust at your naivety.
GOOD DAY SIR
Le tip hat xDDD
