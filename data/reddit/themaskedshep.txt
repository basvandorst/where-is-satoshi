Trading on the exchange is different than transferring coins between wallets. Fees don't really matter.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:57
For me the difference between short and long term gains is 10%. It has dropped more than 10%. If I had timed it right, selling and buying back would have absolutely been more profitable. I don't trust my timing and gdax not to crash thus I didn't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:22:26
Haha yeah I'm waiting for that message too. Are you talking bitcoin though? Price was never much below 1k this year
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:54
I'm not saying that and I'm not mud slinging. I pointed this out because I think more people donated as a result of those comments rather than what Roger said. What Roger said really wasn't bad although I do some how people interpreted his comment as saying Andreas didn't believe in bitcoin because he didn't invest.

I have felt like OP at times, especially when browsing on my phone. It's much easier to click through 10 meme posts than spend 10 minutes reading an in-depth technnical post. If you want quality content, it there. Seek it out and ignore/downvote what you don't like.

To be fair breaking the big numbers like 10k got bitcoin a lot of media coverage. It won't get any for breaking 100. I think the effort more needs to be put in educating people that they can buy fractional coins.

I personally disklike Roger, but if we're bring honest with ourselves, that seemed pretty clear which is which from the video. I understand people think it's confusing, but if you see bitcoin cash and bitcoin core listed, people should be willing to look up both terms if they are unsure. If they aren't willing to put in a very minimal effort, they shouldn't put money in.
Is it wrong of Australia to call their currency dollars because the United States does as well?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:16:00
Ha you're right. Not sure what I was thinking (not enough sleep/coffee). That being said the math is easy and there is a certain point at which holding for long term tax gains is not beneficial.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:41:56
Coinbase.com is like a store to buy bitcoins. GDAX is an actual bitcoin exchange, owned by Coinbase, to buy and sell bitcoins. On GDAX, only one party of the trade pays a fee. So you just need to be the one not paying the fee. It's called post only mode. What's actually happening here is the person who completes the trade pays the fee. So if you place a trade, saying I want to buy a btc for 20k, I'll come along and say that's a great deal and will sell it to you. Because I'm the one completing the trade, I pay the fee.
I think you need to fund your GDAX account via a transfer through coinbase so you either need to leave some cash on GDAX or not be in a rush to buy.
It's not as simple as buying on coinbase, so you should read up on market orders and limit orders and stuff like that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:32:54

That is a widely misleading statement. It depends on when you bought. On top of that investments are not soley based on ROI. You should be considering risk, ease of management, liquidity etc.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:26:36
No, this is just flat wrong. Why would it affect twice? Only 1 order is placed. Coinbase purchases on your behalf and transfers money to you when you're payment clears. Also, if you place an order it doesn't impact price. Price is the last trade price. Buying at market price as you do on Coinbase has no impact.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:23:21
I'm impressed. What's this originally from?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:32:00
Agreed. It reduces risk but also limits potential gains

Lucky in the sense of timing but smart in the sense of taking profits and considering your options.
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:14:10
Sure with small amounts, but your statement and ignorance of how investing works is highly detrimental to someone who's investing a large amount or has others depending on them for financial support.
Also others coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last few years to which I'm sure you'll reply about stability, longevity, security etc. So it's either there are other things to consider besides ROI or your statement is incorrect. Take your pick.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:10:21

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:56
To be fair it was with like 20 bucks of 20k. Not so much now...
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:49:23
Just one point of clarification and I read yesterday on here. Buying on coinbase doesn't create a transaction as coinbase just says you own a little bit of their massive stack. It does create a transaction if you try to move the coins to your own wallet.
This is why people say not your keys, not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:46:23
Maybe he just wants to stick it to his dad when it goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:44:19
Not really. If he doesn't have 3500 cash now, then yes he did. If he was planning to buy bitcoin from an exchange anyways, it's a win-win. He gets coins and his dad gets out. Just requires budgeting knowing he'll have an expense next year, just like any other bill.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:57
There's other (and probably more effective) ways to change the world through crypto that doesn't involve holding. But then again people on reddit would shit on you saying you don't believe in it

It shouldn't matter. 5% is 5%. Investment should be relative to wealth. If it's not, you are gambling, not investing. If you can't handle a 5% swing, bitcoin is not for you.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:10:04
I agree and downvoted. Can't really believe someone could believe this, but you're right newbies may minsunderstand. We have an obligation to educate new people if we want bitcoin to grow.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:11:44
That's because bitcoin fees are not based on the amount you send, but instead how much data you take up in the block. Oh and the fact that coinbase doesn't give much flexibility.
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:40:22

Not sure what your asking. I was asking op to clarify "news is coming". Maybe he is referring to Segwit, maybe not. Also I tend to think the average investor/user doesn't understand Segwit or give a shit about it. I could be wrong and think it will be good for bitcoin long term, but don't think it will help the price. What will is no instability of the fork

I didn't see his predictions so I can't comment. But the lines he drew are meaningful. With that triangle shape, you assume price will continue to bounce in that range, but a break of it is typically a bullish sign. Http://
I know a lot of people think technical analysis is bullshit. I think people who say that think if it's not right 100 percent of the time, it's garbage and need to do research. It's certainly better than saying no one knows how price movement works because that's just not true. What do you think those black boxes at big banks are using to trade?

@_date: 2017-08-29 21:56:35
You are correct, but most wallet software only send enough inputs to cover the transaction and the remainder is your change. You don't send the full balance of your wallet. Just a point of clarification for others reading this. The change address is also a different address in the same wallet if you're using a deterministic wallet. 
General advise to others: create a hot wallet for spending and fund it with cold storage.

Good answer. What confuses me is that people think TA is some made up magic. You can easily go check a chart and see support and resistance is a thing.

Won't that mean we just pay ridiculously high fees to make up for the mining reward? We'll all be dead by the time the last coin is mined, but won't that disincentive users?

Most noobs probably view it as a get rich quick scheme. This is based on the level of understanding for many questions I've seen here. Given the age bracket of many people here, 2 years could be a long time to hold especially when everyone says it doubles every 8 months.

Referring to him as this person as if he's some unknown demonstrates that you have no clue how finance works. He's one of the most important names in the space.

@_date: 2017-09-24 20:24:26
Ha it's incorrect and misleading to newbies. Your comment (which you deleted) make it sound like there was some enlightened message we were all missing rather than the fact that we don't just turn a blind eye to something that was very inaacurate. This is why your comment is at the bottom and comments correcting it are at the top.

While i got some on the dip, we do a disservice to new people telling them to always just buy and it will automatically go up. True, long term it has done so historically, but for 2 years (2014 to 2016) price droped below and stayed below 600.
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:58:47
This makes no sense...

Because it's 3 years away. A lot of hurdles to pass before than.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:26:16
But bitcoin exchanges are different than ICOs. The dip was in regards to banning bitcoin, not ICOs.

You're right those things matter more. Aside from volume, nothing is easily measured in the list. My main point was price along is useless. For example, ripple has 100,000,000 coins or something like that. So one would expect it to scale at a price less than bitcoin.

There is more price volatility risk, but also an operational security risk that you must absolutely understand before investing.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:18:05
everyone is telling you it's so risky. It's probably good advice but they are overlooking the obvious. Put in a small amount and give trading a try.  See for yourself if you think it's practical. You can trade .01 btc on gdax with no fees. That shouldn't be a risk for anyone here. If it is, you shouldn't be in crypto.

Looks like your question was answered. I'd also caution that unless you understand what a chain split is and the risks of it, don't invest for a month or so. I won't get into what that means here, but literally every other post for the past 6 months discusses it and I think there are some stickies as well.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:20:45
You're right it's risky and telling newbies not to do it is good advice, but you don't need to beat professional investors, you can ride in their wake. You can trade simple support and resistance. You won't get in or out as fast as them, but you emulate them.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:26:25
I don't mean any offense by this comment,  but trading is not a get rich quick scheme. It does take some math, but it takes time and dedication to develop your strategy and implement it. Not wanting to take the time to do this simple math doesn't bode well.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:56:27
Not sure if sarcastic or not. I don't actually do it because I don't have all day to sit in front of a chart, but I don't think it's as impossible as people say. I think most here don't know anything about technical analysis and are here for the ride because they think it's a get rich quick scheme, thus you have a negative bias towards trading.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:47:02

If you want to long term invest, why do you need charts? Buy and forget about it.

What do you mean $70-80? Are there prizes to solve it?

Why everyday with tx fees so high. Does once a week make more sense?

Are you associated with this or sharing something you found interesting? Just wondering.

Haha comparing these with the r/btc posts is the definition of hyperbolic.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:22:50
Cool. Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:34:53
Haha I know your post is in jest, but he's gonna blow a breaker real quick

This is great, thanks!
1. Using Mycelium, I've never seen a spot to specify a change address. Will the money return to my existing wallet (I know it's not good practice)? I don't want to loose coins.
2. Coinbase QR scanner leaves off the first 8 characters of public addresses. Is there something special about these characters that make them not needed? Will the address still receive the funds?

What language are the code examples in?

You're asking this in a sub that is mostly dedicated to bitcoin speculation. You're going to get huge bias here. That being said buy!

Thanks. Can you wipe the device from Trezor's chrome plugin?
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:06:21
Cool well congrats on the project. Also reread your reply :)

Thank you. So helpful! One more for you! What does it mean to sweep a wallet vs just adding a private key to an app?
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:59:58
Cool, buys you lunch. I bought a gaming pc, but found I don't really play ever. Might as well put the hardware to use.

Most of those posts are people in debt that need help with basic budgeting. Not the best crypto investors.

Time to start a bitcoin casino!

Try tweeting him.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:07:07
Commenting because I am also interested. Wish I could help answer.

Thanks.  Sorry total noob. So over the year I'll have 52 addresses? Can one offline key even generate that many addresses?
