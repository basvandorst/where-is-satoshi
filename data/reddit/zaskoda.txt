Only because failing banks were injected with cash by the government.

Of course a Journalist should dig deeper. I think you guys are being a bit more snarky here than is really justified. Flip it around for a second - what decent journalist would **ignore** Reddit as a potential lead generator? Where else could OP even go to find a comparable trove of resources? Hopefully OP isn't such a "lazy dumb fuck" as to forgo actually doing journalism. However, that has nothing - at all - to do with how unique and useful Reddit can be for a journalist. I get it, we're a whole Internet full of people who are tired of crap misinformation and would love to see a tool that actually gave us a useful and semi-accurate world view. Reddit is a den of trolls, bla bla bla. But I think took a swing here and missed entirely. OP would be a fool to ignore Reddit.

I feel like it's clear to see how Kenneth Berke and Tom Parker are trying to prevent Ryan Hamlin and Jon Baugher from succeeding with Posibit. The Washington State LCB and the director of licensing and regulation chime in at the end and basically say that having BTC involved in the exchange reduces crime and risk. It's all pretty inspiring TBQH.

This. It terrifies me that it's even on her radar. This means it's going to be subject to some kind of ridiculous regulation under her administration, I'm sure of it.

Oh... I guess I was wrong.

"Current speculation says miners in China are dumping coins to cover losses from their tanking stock market."
This totally makes sense given my limited scope of knowledge. I have come to believe that the historic gold spike was largely due to China. It would stand to reason both that many were left holding and that those left holding would also be players in the current crashing market. It would be fantastic to see any evidence to support this. Suddenly a lot more BTC is available on the market. The lower the price goes, the more value sellers absorb if they try to dump their holdings. At some point it has to grind to a halt. It seems with all of those holdings freed up and put back into the market, should we then expect to see a more active market place in general?

In a vague and tangential way, I think believe the same basic thing as OP. If you haven't seen it already, I'd recommend checking out [Ethereum]( You might also find that the 2007 classic [The Machine is US]( touches on this same idea that we're part of "the" machine. I believe strongly that people want to [participate]( in the machine. I often see all of us as a single rather confused mind. I think more and more people are beginning to think this way sometimes. I suspect more and more people will think this way more often in the relatively near future.

Put crap into the machine, get crap out of the machine... All people have some potential.

This is what we were wondering. So we'll need to check the exchange rate at the time of exchange for every transaction through the year. This sounds like software someone could already be working on??

Unfortunately, I think I **just** realized how I wish I had focused this question. I think what I'm asking is more about, "can I run my business using bitcoin INSTEAD of a bank? and if not (I assume not), just how close can I get?" Does this help re-frame the original question any? Is it possible to start a company, do business, pay taxes, and never involve a bank?

In this case, the business may not really be all that "valuable"... It's really more of a side hobby / tinker kind of thing. Thus, **because** it's low risk, we might consider seeing what it's like to run with BTC. It's not hard to find articles about how to **accept** Bitcoin. What I'm looking for is how you would properly track and report your activity if you wanted to use BTC is the currency you build your business on. Also, it would be nice if we **accepted** USD and immediately turned them into BTC. The IRS virtual currency guide is a great link, thank you. I'll try digging into that and seeing if it helps.

Bitpayroll and Bitwage sound very interesting. The roadmap we're talking about starts as a services company (like web design, but not exactly that) and then later we'll have a physical product for market. The real key thing here is the idea of keeping the books "in BTC" rather than USD. However, when and how do we properly calculate things such as the value of purchases through the year for write offs? Is this fundamentally just not possible with out legal system?

During crypto-winter, I read his book Mastering Ethereum and went to see him speak twice. I don't know of a better speaker in the space. I also deeply appreciate his approach to inclusion.

I do not believe that 20% of people know about Bitcoin. Get out more.

Same. I was short on some bills this month and reluctant sold a little. Price went up immediately after. It gave me sadness.
