if the tether / bitfinex / bittrex scam blow up now too..holy shit this will be a bloody day
i see btc unter $5k
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:22
300k will be reached today. everyone wants to sell  so they need to send the btc to exchange (more transactions). this will be like a rolling snowball

enjoy your slow, high fee coin ;)

pump and dump a top 3 coin. ok
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:16:10
just some bs thats flocking around for years now...schedueled for 2018 or so now, but will delayed further and further as usual
guess why everyone is dropping out of btc ($40 transaction fee with 300k unconfirmed transactions) (dropped from 20k down to 15k  and keeps dropping) and switch to bch and so on?

nothing wrong about $40 fees for a $100 transaction. right?

@_date: 2017-08-02 17:52:59
how was it my fault? the time to sell was perfect, i knew the coin is being inflated thats why i wanted to sell early...but the site went down :/
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:53:48
