Can anyone else check what does the Android MtGox app say about the balance? As stated previously: "It lets me in, and it says my balance is 1.3 BTC. My actual balance was ~8.5 yesterday when the site was still up."
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:40:49
that's not very nice, i look like shit, man, and still, you can trust me!
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:18:24
yeah, because it's common knowledge that torturing magically creates money AND bitcoins.

I'd like to see an official press release instead of these f'ing tweets which contradict with the recently-found gox wallets full of BTC
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:18:47
yeah thats why they captured like 3-4 people of the hundreds of dealers and tens of thousands of users, right?
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:37:16
Can Mark be forced to explain what were weekend's huge BTC movements from those old Gox wallets, given the fact the moved amount was bigger than they should have according to their theft claims?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:00:48
if I had such a fucking invasive jerk of a journalist on my back, I would have said the same thing even if I weren't involved, just to make her look fucking ridiculous once people find out the actual truth.
@_date: 2014-05-07 08:39:05
well shame on them and their overpriced designer products.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:29:07
We did it.  Mark has been removed from office, and the administrator has taken over MtGox. This is incredible news because that means all servers and equipment are now under control of the court, and Mark can no longer touch them. This will greatly help the ongoing investigation.  Rest assured that the reason why this happened was because of the unrelenting work of the community, reporting on suspected bitcoins under Mark’s control, and bringing forward all illicit actions done by him.  We had very brave people who came forward, and as a result, the supervisor/administrator got the full picture. The insecure source code, $500 million debt (and many other things we cannot disclose at this point), made it impossible for MtGox to reopen to begin with.  There is no way a restart would have ever been able to make back our money.  Civil rehabilitation would have involved re-using the code that lead to our coins being stolen.  As a result the 200k bitcoins that were found would have been potentially put at risk again, or kept hostage.  Besides that it could also have let to our bitcoins being used to fund it, instead of going back to their rightful owners.  At least now we can be sure that bankruptcy proceedings will follow shortly, and that we can look forward to seeing those 200k bitcoins returned to us.  That means we expect to see 20% of everyone’s bitcoin/money recovered.  
We predict the actual bankruptcy proceeding to take about 1 to 1.5 years (civil rehab would have taken a similar amount of time). Many people contacted us, asking to join our lawsuit so they can be registered as creditors.  We are now checking if this is the best option for you, or if it is better to directly file as a creditor yourself.  At this time you do not have to take any action yet.  We will send an update about this soon.  Either way we will do everything possible from our end to have the bitcoins paid out in actual bitcoins, instead of having them converted to another currency.  We cannot guarantee it will happen, but we will try our very best with the administrator and the court.

Dear MtGox Customers,
As there is a lot of speculation regarding MtGox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.
Furthermore I would like to kindly ask that people refrain from asking questions to our staff: they have been instructed not to give any response or information. Please visit this page for further announcements and updates.

lots of times it took around 45 minutes for me, not just recently. in other cases, it goes out in 5 minutes.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:07:18
some might have been stolen with malleability, but not all 750K
then again, it's all just speculation, we still don't have an official press release or anything like that.
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:34:07
dunno man, i never used them, so wouldnt know the vendor situation. all i know is, the peeps are using it are happy with it, they did not like to go meet some shady people in alleys to get their low-end shit. i visited the forums and from there it seems pretty fucking easy to research if a vendor is legit or not, so i guess stupid people are getting scammed. but i dont think the admins are running a con; they are earning millions just from the commission. anyone who keeps any funds on any darknet site longer than a few hours is dumb anyway. i guess if someone is going to get scammed big time they will be the vendors who have to keep bigger funds there, and can suffer from a withdrawal freeze.

But does anyone know how/where can one join the lawsuit?
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:59:59
but then again, some people said it must be more serious than that, because a guy who moves hundreds of kilograms of drugs for months, won't leave fingerprints most likely.
maybe he was high on something :) or used one of the thinner latex gloves which you can actually leave a fingerprint in! even the iphone could read the fingerprints in some of these crappy gloves.

@_date: 2014-04-28 14:57:26
i was really curious about that too, so tried to do some research
according to some sources on darknet forums, he
-left some fingerprints on some of the DVD cases he packaged drugs into
-this was matched against the dutch fingerprint database, where he was in the system because of some arrest/police case in the past
-he announced on one of his dark market pages (i think) that he is going to be in "vacation mode" as he's flying to the US
none of the above is confirmed, but seems like a good theory. also, amateurish to leave fingerprints if you're into illegal stuff, and announcing where you going, especially if it's the land of the free... dumb.
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:06:53
hope mtgoxrecovery.com gonna react to this as well

Fun fact: just logged in to mtgox through the Android client. It lets me in, and it says my balance is 1.3 BTC. My actual balance was ~8.5 yesterday when the site was still up.

The security of bitcoin? What are you talking about? You can have the BEST unbreakable encryption ever, but if you leave the fucking password next to it, the encrypted info will be stolen. That does not mean it was not the best encryption.
Gox security has nothing to do with BTC security.

Man, I'm blaming myself for being greedy, not anyone else, believe me. When I invested SOME (not all!!!) of my savings to BTC, I was prepared for the risks. Every moneymaking opportunity comes with a risk, that's investing 101.
