To all the Bitcoin true believers in this thread and sub: You owe it to yourselves to investigate the possibility that the value of bitcoin has peaked, and that the peak value was created fraudulently.
Bitcoin has a real value. It might be a lot less than you've considered. 
Whether crypto is a bubble about to burst completely, or the market is simply entering a bearish period, you should factor the substantial risk into your investment strategy. Blind HODLing is not a good strategy in my opinion.

Dense with accuracy.

My point is that crypto isn't a magic market, and no one is seriously suggesting it is. Hodling crypto is betting against fiat, plain and simple.

You need to look at a broader picture. If crypto continues to grow to its full potential, fiat will lose value. People holding fiat will lose to those hodling crypto. Possibly.

No, the government creates inflation by deliberately increasing the money supply. This encourages people to spend rather than save, and allows companies to reduce real pay without the drama of having to be honest about it.

Debt always goes up in real value. Unless you're paying a rate of interest lower than inflation.

Not true. If an economy grows but the money supply is not increased, then money becomes more valuable. This is deflation, the opposite of inflation.
