To trade on Finex you need to invest 10k $ or deposit coins of that worth (new rule).
But lately everyone seems to be bitching about Tether and prophesying its fall(if Tether fails it may destroy Finex) so maybe Binance is a better option.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:55:10
i recommend you buy this dip and not worry much about Tether
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:43:31
Exactly new money is not what is coming to finex....
Dis be a message from tha overlords
"2017 was a spectacular year for Bitfinex. We have seen our most optimistic forecasts exceeded and the new year will continue this trend with the addition of numerous high-quality digital assets, new fiat trading pairs, an even faster trading engine, and the launch of Ethfinex.
However, this extreme growth has not come without challenges. In fact, one month ago we decided to temporarily curtail new account registration in a move designed to preserve the trading, support, and verification experiences of our existing, long-term user base.
Today we are pleased to announce the reopening of Bitfinex to new accounts. However, please take note of the new requirements outlined below.
New Account Requirements
Bitfinex is a global liquidity source with a focus on serving professional traders and regional exchanges. We suggest that traders who are new to cryptocurrency trading try another, more straightforward platform first and return to Bitfinex later.
To that end, and to allow us to maintain focus on our core customer base, all accounts created after January 1st, 2018, will have a new activation equity requirement. New accounts will need to deposit fiat or crypto to achieve minimum account equity of 10,000 USD equivalent before they can trade or offer funding. After reaching this minimum, an account becomes fully activated (Note that after this initial activation, account equity is allowed to drop below this activation threshold without consequence).
Existing accounts will not be affected by these changes. This change only affects new accounts.
Thank you,
Bitfinex Management"

can you look further then 15min charts? perhaps a week or two in advance?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:37:56
I may be wrong, so recheck what im saying. I'm fairly new in all this BUT
Tether is being issued by Bitfinex so if Tether falls for some reason it could bring down Bitfinex too. If Bitfinex decides to shut down you'll likely lose all your coins on it and it will create cause problems in the market.
However, all may not be so bad.
Bitfinex is printing shit ton of Tethers lately but even so the whole Tether market is worth 1.6BIL which is not a lot and Finex ??should?? have that reserve of money??
EDIT - don't wanna create FUD but printing "money" like Finex is doing is surely concerning
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:52:39
time will tell
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:23:03
best topic ever, explains all
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:11:42
This last 9 hour dip has to be artificial... there is no reason for it, no FUD or anything
someone is trying to lower the price brutally
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:47:26
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:20:01
if you repeat what you've read on the internet and never use your brain.... then yes, its pretty easy xd
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:30:32
wth is happening on Finex on 11500 price? whale fight?
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:02:27
can you repeat that question?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:02:11
i should also warn you that Binance has its own coin too - Binance coin. However, how does it affect the market, i don't know.
It seems you can't get away from all that. Your best bet is to keep your coins on your wallet when you are not trading
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:14:24
damn, you guys are easy to convince xD
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:23
This seems to be the end of the dip
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:47:31
eh every trend has to turn and this sure as fuak looks to be a turning point... althought nothing is ever 100%
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:38:41
is it still active?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:09:08
You want him to not get his money until mid 2018.?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:41:07
why not Bitfinex? i see Euros avoiding it, can someone explain why?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:28
aaaaand it ended...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:15:37
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:43
the dip is over
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:41:14
gtfo babun
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:12:37
god damnit, even god, an omnipotent being, took rest on the 7th day.
let the fuking coin rest
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:49
1000 buywall on bitfinex on 14k, yep this is it
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:52:08
i fuking hope that this small dip that is happening now is mini correction
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:51
of course nothing is 100% but from 12.7k to 14.2k in less then half an hour.
by observing yesterdays patterns i would say its over. now will be a slow rise to 16k
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:54
afterall this i have a feeling that IOTA was the target, not BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:59
i thought that 3 hours ago and i was wrong xD
no sleep today
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:18:36
we are in a descending triangle for 6 months but people still think a new bull run is around the corner...
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:42:31
sadly that news was a year old
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:16:05
its not plumming because of that.... whos writing this shit articles?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:48:15
do not buy now, do not buy at this "ATH".... when will you fuking learn....
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:56:06
500? expect a 1-1.5k dip... it has been just rising without a correction, look at the 3, 6, 12 hour charts.
don't FOMO
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:56:43
at least you are doing the right stuff. many sold and now is the worse time to sell. we might not go back to ATH anytime soon but we could see 12-13k in february, better to sell then if you must then now
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:00:15
lol.... you know orders can be cancelled?
whales do this all the time, you think there is a wall but they just cancel it and manipulate you...
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:19:52
i'm so immune to FUD now, this shit is working reverse on me. i might buy more now cuz of shit articles like this
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:57:08
erm that is irrelevant, you should watch for Finex and perhapds GDAX walls
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:00:38
that is why i put "", but thank you captain obvious
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:11:42
i guess not :) we humans are so predictable
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:01:00
just a month ago everyone was swearing they would buy in BTC if there would just be some grand dip... now they all chicken out xD
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:46:09
you'll see it in less then an hour....
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:45:03
For two hours nothing basicly moved... i guess we could see a slow rise for a few hundred
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:43:23
ok, what the FUD is this now?!
correction or retesting of the bottom?
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:50:27
what? there is news from Japan?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:53:19
what i mean is wait a few hours for it to drop, for it to have a correction
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:36:33
last couple of weeks
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:33:14
Wth is this? 
I just started doing stuff with bitcoins and i signed in with coinbase. I didnt know any better. So many people are angry and disappointed and so many comments about them not paying out.
How do i move my bitcoins out of there and where to? what trading sites are reliable? Bitfinex?
Can i move the coins from coinbase to my hardware wallet without any fees?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:21:09
lol price at Bitfinex
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:39:36
hey! if FUDsters can have fake news, we might as well start the positive fake news
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:59:11
the working week is coming and everyone thinks that it could go lower;  or retesting of the bottom. Retesting the bottom is not an unusual thing
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:58:11
look at last 3 years... same story always.
THIS IS A SALE! if you can see further then a week or two
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:12:34
omg more FUD!!
now the price gonna plummet another 300$
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:46:35
thats more like then anything....people think its just gonna be a straight ride to 10k or 15k
small scale corrections need to happen, specially in times like this
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:26:24
One persona that shaked up the whole world. 
All hail the king!
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:28:20
1 trillion? that was almost hit when BTC was 20k
2.5trillion is more realistic if BTC hits 50k
