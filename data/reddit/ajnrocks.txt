Is there any good/secure/not horribly difficult way to do that using a trezor?

Well, it was fun while it lasted... I wish you all the best, but the complete and total elimination of the main function of the app and replacing it with additional analytics changes the entire target market.  I am sad to see you go, and if you ever bring back the spare change functionality then I would hope that you let us know.  If there is another app that has this same functionality then I hope someone lets me know, but until then I will have to reconsider my options.  
We had some good times together and I suggested that many of my friends use your app due to its unique capabilities, but I just can't agree with removing the main functionality of an app in its entirety and replacing it with a service in which you just offer analytics.

I'm gonna have to agree with you.  Eliminating their entire previous functionality and switching to an analytics based platform seems like a bold and questionable move.  I really enjoyed the randomness of the "spare change" functionality in addition to a regularly scheduled deposit.  This is very disappointing to me and I will most likely abandon the platform due to this change.

I figured it had something to do with the sheer volume of transactions as of late. how is the priority of a transaction determined, and how does the transaction fee factor into that, because I am sure that even 0 fee transactions end up getting confirmed eventually.

it is in 50BTC's "Process" so I am pretty sure limbo.  now the trick is getting them from limbo to the pending transaction stage...
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:05:56
i know that feel, hopefully 50btc will get their shit together, but until then, i remain a bitcoin peasant.

I know that the transaction fee is less than recommended, but I have done transactions before with the same fee.  in fact I did one with .01 btc and a .0001 btc transaction fee not 3 minutes before this one.

I honestly have never really used it, so I can't really say.  I have always used the Multibit wallet software, and I mine primarily with Slush's pool, I only use 50BTC and BTCGuild as backups, which is why I was so surprised that I randomly had 30 extra bitcoins...

i submitted several payout request on october 28, and i have seen none of it.  I think they just froze the payout system when they learned about the hack.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:22:10
I have been using multibit, and it just does flat fees, with a minimum of .0001 btc, should I switch to a different client? I am open to change, and the only real reason I use multibit is because it was the first one I saw.

Would you happen to know why my transaction decided to be 10 times the number of bytes of some of my previous ones?  I thought I knew a lot about bitcoin and then something like this comes up and slaps me in the face.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:14:42
Is there any way to tell how large a transaction will be before sending it so that I could change the fee to meet the required amount?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:36:59
how long should it take to get an email?
@_date: 2013-10-28 06:57:02
we shall see if I can ever actually get it into my private wallet...
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:10:58
so basically, from what I can tell, 50BTC has kind of gone AWOL?
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:38:56
I had noticed that this one transaction is absurdly large in size in bytes(compared to my other transactions)
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:58:11
Hmmm. Thanks so much for the information, I guess I still have a lot to learn about the actual inner workings of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:03:06
meh, no sense in dwelling on the past, move forward and learn from your losses.
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:24:23
but from what I have seen, there hasn't been any word as to how this will be resolved, and apparently this has been a problem since the 18th...
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:49:06
there is no resolution, you can try contacting support, but in the meantime, i think it is safe to say that any outstanding balance is looooong gone
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:20:07
who knows? i tried a similar thing about a month ago, just a few days after the attack.  we can only hope.
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:16:18
hmm, so i guess i will have to wait and see...
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:06:13
Finally got some confirmations, but thanks for the input.  I have a feeling ill be spending a bit of time over the next week or so actually learning about the tech behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:31:40
50BTC got hacked and shit went down back in October, so you should notice that you can't successfully cash out of 50BTC (the transactions stay as "pending")  Also, their support is useless, they most likely will never respond.
source: i have had 3 transactions in "pending" since October, when the hacking actually happened
