Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.
'Early adopters' profit at the expense of new buyers. When the early adopters cash out, the new buyers are left with nothing, unless they can find new buyers themselves. Eventually you have to run out of new buyers, because there's a finite number of people - such is the undoing of all pyramid schemes.

Hardly anyone acquired Bitcoin 5 years ago, and many of those people lost their Bitcoins through thefts and scams (i.e. 2011 MtGox hack, Pirateat40's ponzi scheme, Bitcoinica, Tradehill, literally hundreds of other major thefts) - or through merely forgetting them and deleting files/throwing out old drives.
Hell, the vast majority of Bitcoiners didn't buy in until 2013.
If you mean you intend to 'hold' for 5 years starting from now or a year ago, then that's just your personal hope supported by no facts whatsoever.


[The transaction volume speaks for itself](


"Should" - Ah, a variation of the now well-worn 'cheap coin' spiel. If it 'should' have happened, then it would have already happened, but it hasn't; so what does that tell you? And tell me, why haven't you been buying more? ..Could it be that you've bought so much that you're out of cash? If so, then you're not alone, but don't expect to find any more buyers.


I can use Google Wallet and Paypal to send money for free, instantly. To use Bitcoin, you need to pay exchange fees, 'ATM' fees of 10-20%+, escrow fees, exchange rate spread etc.
