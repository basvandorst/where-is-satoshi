So you americans are preparing to invade russia for real? You foresaw this hack 15 years ago when you started building bases next to russian borders. So wise, such future teller.

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie."

this is how any investor should view the value of btc before investing
IS CORRECT
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:19:04
I invested $8 000 to BTC which is all the money I had. Bought most at 620, some at 800 and some at 1000. 
I do not regret and I hope BTC drops even more so I can still buy a lot.
I never regretted a single penny and the more we fall, the more excited I get.

The truth is that hardly any POW altcoin can compete with BTC in POW. That's why there's POS. Economically and existencially. But I assume this article says POS = POW. Partly, I guess? Afterall, it is filled with exaggeration.

Important relationships between blocks are completely omitted. And adding a crane next to it does not explain it, you are still using strange tech language and not approximating by a real-life example. This is just a painted and twisted ugly hardcore explanation.
