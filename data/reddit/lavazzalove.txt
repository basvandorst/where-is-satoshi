"Round the world and home again
That's the sailor's way
Faster, faster, faster faster
There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing
Is it raining, is it snowing
Is a hurricane a-blowing
Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Are the fires of Hell a-glowing
Is the grisly reaper mowing
Yes, the danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing"

If you read or listen to recent interviews with Ari Paul, he says there has been tremendous interest from institutions and family businesses. Few are buying regularly and they're signing new large clients frequently. I know it's counter-intuitive, but maybe there are larger holders who are unloading and keeping the price relatively low to have these larger clients feel like they're buying low.
Also, articles like these prove that the top 1% are buying

$9,500 is about a 5% rise from the current price. I think it will hit it today, the market sentiment is positive right now.

Bought a little bit just now. Hope you fellow comrades will follow as well. This is a great price opportunity based on the recent movement toward $12k.

What a glorious sight to wake up to! Delta app price notifications are also a bonus. :) 
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:43:12
Based on last Monday's 15% daily movement, it will most likely climb to $8,500-$8,800 in a very short span of time. Last week it took less than 10 minutes to go from $6,500 to $7,400.

I started in January, so it's not a large amount yet. The dips to around $6k and $7k in February and March are profitable, the rest is still in the red (for now I hope)
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:12:37
There have been at least 3-4 instances when the price jumped a few hundred dollars around 1pm EST on Sundays. This was when the price had a positive movement in the prior days. I guess it didn't happen today or has not happened yet...

"Generally speaking, a bull market happens when prices rise by 20 percent, usually after a drop of 20 percent and before a 20 percent decline. Since they are difficult to predict, bull markets can typically only be recognized once they’ve happened."

True. Take my own and everybody else's comments with a grain of salt. My comment was based on prior movement I noticed in the past.  I don't day trade, I'm in it for the long haul. Been adding to my Bitcoin position every week with an exit plan sometime after mid 2020s.

Loving this price movement the last few days. January-April 12 felt like a test of our collective patience. Can't imagine what it was like in those years when the price didn't move for 8-10 months.

You would only get it when you try to login (assuming you uncheck the "remember this device for 30 days" option). I recommend having that option unchecked even if you have possession of the computer. It's good to have that layer of security.

Why not DCA into a position while it's at $3,300-$3,400? You may not catch the bottom at the right moment.
