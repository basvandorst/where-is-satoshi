I understand the point, but I wouldn't give it a full endorsement. Granted they make spectacularly "safe" bets based on their modeling, and they're pros at modeling. But, we will see in the future as we have seen in the past that this only makes for more drastic consequences when they're wrong. And, they will eventually be wrong. So, let's not get all "100% correct" up in here  because motherfuckers tryna retire are still rebounding from 2k8.

Yeah, but can you really say that you've learned enough about both systems to make a judgment? Most PhD economists are going to spend seven long years mastering their knowledge at a University and 98% will still tell you they have a lifetime left to learn, but you've figured it out in a couple weeks? If you favor Bitcoin due to its simplicity, maybe it's because you don't have a grasp on the *why* the current system is so complex.

OP is a giraffe amongst zebras. I really like the concept of bitcoin but its anarcho-proponents need to take a larger look at its operation and its vulnerabilities. Your saving grace of a digital currency is not directly regulated but rather regulated tangentially. 
Its a public ledger (great), amended virtually (ok), by computers (ok), powered by regulated power companies (not as ok). It requires independent verification (great), through network affiliates (great), sent over regulated network service providers (not as ok). Transactions are verifiable proofs (great), which are processed by multiple independent parties (great), but no single party must gain a majority of the network processing power (not as ok).
You operate your little digital fantasy at the acquiescence of the government. I don't understand why people blindly look away from the obvious risks. Your currency can be powered down. On the other hand it can be powered up. Any digital currency that requires processing power and a network of unverifiable operators can be easily co-opted by a government that can make extreme amounts of processing power readily available. So, unless your going to start de-crypting message that are transferred via courier pigeon regulation is inevitable. It's impossible for an operation to be impervious to regulation when it sits atop a regulated infrastructure.

Ummm, no. No its not. As a former criminal defense attorney, prosecutors generally do a pretty good job of putting all the tangential puzzle pieces together to let the jury put that last one in there. Jurys are so dumb, they really only need to catch a person who has used a Tor browser. Toss in an expert to explain what a Tor browser is "commonly" used for, and bam! Ohh, here are some kiddie porn charges too. 
Caveat: A jury in silicon valley is likely knowledgeable enough to still see reasonable doubt in something like that. Not so in South Dakota.

@_date: 2017-10-23 20:42:10


Your forgetting that aside from the average so-cal satanic daycare ritual, blood is usually used for life-saving purposes. Also, blood cannot be manufactured, it must come from donors. Blood only has a shelf life of more than a month. this makes the national supply of blood very sensitive to fluctuations in supply. Clearly, there is a need for as much donation as possible. **Hopefully they're accepting blood from anyone willing to give it.**
The reward of having a surplus blood supply outweighs the risk of transmitting HIV via accepting blood from homosexual males.

@_date: 2017-10-23 20:26:10
No, about 99.3% - 99.7%. 
EDIT: I'm fairly confident I know where you're going with this, but I suggest that you think it through and keep in mind the overall purpose of donating blood.

If we're just passing blood around without testing it, then yes your concerns are valid. But, if we screen for HIV, and the HIV screens have the same success rate, then why are you concerned?

Bitcoin is losing its power as a currency, because of this internal bullshit. The power of this tech is its ability to reach the peasant farmers of the southern hemisphere with relative ease. If their neighbor is able to transact in minutes with litecoin what it takes them hours to do in Bitcoin, you better believe they're moving to litecoin. Ineffective scaling will fuck this all up. 
Conversely, try explaining a hard-fork to your Dad and then explain how it is somehow supposed to keep its value with two different Bitcoins running around. 
I have a feeling most of the new money coming in has no idea of the perils ahead with scaling, and when they learn what's at stake well . . .

This was my first time getting back in since Gox. I'm sorry, I was hurt before and didn't want to get hurt again. To be fair, it is a negligible amount, but this has taught me two things 1) I love BTC (both as an asset and currency); and 2) I'll be doing this again, so it'll be time to move real money to a real exchange.

$1598! So, when is this pullback going to happen? I can't place conditional sell orders in Coinbase, so I'm frantically checking prices every 30 minutes waiting for the shoe to drop. Don't get me wrong, I typically HODL, but this is clearly a time to turn some Bitcoin into more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:46:06
So the spread between Coinbase and Bitfinex is only $40 at the time I type this. Coinbase seems to be closing in. Is this because people are ambivalent about BFX's condition, or just ignorant of it? Or, is Bitfinex somehow staving off disaster?
