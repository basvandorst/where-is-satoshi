damn, I think I'm gonna need to give up and go to bed. Good luck man! sounds like you passed me up!

When we get the private key, is it obvious that it's the key, or is it something where we have to just try it to find out?
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:52:15
damn! you got past the numbers?? I'm still stuck!
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:17:46
I don't think you properly solved hints one and two. Each clue helps you solve 1 puzzle. did you get locked yet? (you'll know what I mean if you did)
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:32:42
you're making it too easy with the links! haha
I have no idea what to do with these numbers though...

nope, nothing's mangled. Some of us have gotten past that part
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:21:44
is it a thing, or a place?...I'm looking at a definite location, but maybe I'm wrong...is it supposed to feel like i'm in School? lol

I think you're gonna beat me, but I'm catching up!!

Wallet LOOTED! ;)
Thanks btcfun!! that was great!
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:45:48
Damn, you're right...those QR codes don't scan...
But definitely fun! Great job btcfun!
Edit: Nevermind! Got them!
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:20:00
post clue 3 so he has some challenge! ;)
Edit: Thanks!

I got to a FileTea page but it says file not found...am I searching in the wrong place?
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:04:46
Shoot...I have no idea what to do with the next locked step. I've checked everything I can think of

OK! Here's the rundown of the solve if anyone wants to know:
Step 1: you click the link and get a tumblr image of a QR code. When you scan the code, you see a bitcoin address with the balance amount. You need to have the address on hand for the end of clue 7 to verify you have the correct solution. I took the QR code into photoshop and played with the colors (specifically, I adjusted the "Levels"). When you do this, you find the text "goo.gl".
Step 2: I noticed that the title of the Tumblr image was the string of letters and numbers, "gcvk69". Anyone familiar with shortened URLs will notice that the format is usually something like "goo.gl/gcvk69" so I tried that web address. It brought me to a JPG of a security lock. I got stuck here...I researched hiding text in images and saw that you could hide zip files and other stuff too, but I was working on seeing if there was any stenography hidden in the image when the next clue went up.
Step 3: When I saw the clue about filetypes, the first thing I did was try changing the file extension to .zip (I still had it in my head from my research in the last step) and it worked! The file uncompressed a .wav audio file!
Step 4: Since the last piece of the puzzle hid audio in an image file, and since the .wav file sounded like random squeels, the first thing I looked up was hiding images in an audio file. I saw an article about doing it on lifehacker.com, so I downloaded the free program they linked to (I can't remember what it was called) and sure enough there was an image hidden there. They were 2 QR codes, but they weren't scanning as is. So I brought them into photoshop, made sure they were square, adjusted the contrast so they were clear, and tried scanning again...still no luck. Then I noticed that something looked a little off on them. Comparing them to other QR codes, it looked like the colors on these were inverted! (QR codes always have black squares in the corners...these ones were white, so that was why I thought to invert them). Sure enough they scanned and gave me 2 numbers!
Step 5: I was stuck on these for a long time. I don't have the numbers on me right now, but they were something like "0.018.........." and "-9.189...........". I tried using the numbers as lat and longitude in Google, but it was in the middle of the ocean. I tried adding, subtracting, etc. Couldn't figure this one out until btcfun posted the clue with the link to the definition of the word "reciprocal". In mathematics, reciprocal means to invert a fraction. So, I did 1 divided by 0.018...... and 1 divided by -9.189....... and I wrote the new numbers down (I tried a lot of other things too, but I leave those out for simplicity). At this point I still had no idea if I was right or what to do with them.
Step 6: A couple other participants had mentioned geocaching, which is going to locations of GPS coordinates, so I was guessing that I was looking for a location. Using the new reciprocal numbers, instead of the ocean, these were leading to a specific place, The London College of the Arts:   I still didn't know what to do with this info or if it was correct
Step 7: Once btcfun said brainwallet passphrase, I went to brainwallet.org and entered the passphrase "University of the Arts London: London College of Communications". The bitcoin address that showed up with that passphrase matched the address from the QR code in step 1, so I went to my wallet and added the privatekey that brainwallet gave me and voilla!! I had access to the funds!
Hope that helps!

I'll give a full rundown...tomorrow. I stayed up super late because this was really fun, but I have to sleep now!
or btcfun or blockchainsaw can feel free to give the rundown if they'd like!

I'm still relatively new to bitcoin - if we have the address and passkey (which I don't yet), how do we access the funds? I have a wallet set up in armory on my computer
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:52:22
I didn't get any unicode in mine. I'm not sure if mine is wrong or yours
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:11:38
I have a location, but I'm not sure how to format it...It's case sensitive right? And when I enter the correct passphrase on brain wallet, the address should match the address from the QR in the first clue?
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:41:36
I should be typing in the right answer into brainwallet then...not sure why the correct address isn't showing up
