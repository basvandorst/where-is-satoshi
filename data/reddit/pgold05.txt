I hear ya, GBTC, the one investment somehow outperforming bitcoin.
This year is so insane, today especially, unreal. 
Fidelity, the Real ultimate exchange it seems

I mean, its probably not people buying ripple, but large institutions.

Just an FYI, GBTC is trading at over a 100% premium, I just sold a bit because that's ridiculous, im expecting it to drop some, and bitcoin to rise (as GBTC is usually a good future predictor) 
Edit, called it.

Bit of hope for people who are scared.
I sold some bitcoin (actually GBTC) the all time high and the rest during the bull trap a week or so later. I left that in fiat/stocks for quite a while, until today. With stocks tanking and GBTC approaching the levels equal to or even lower, before it went to the moon I placed a few buys that triggered this morning...and I am already up quite a bit. 
Now, I'm not Nostradamus, and I expect some volatility the next few days, but I am feeling ok about buying back in and barring any catastrophic news, I expect to make a nice return over the next month or 2.

Sure, but there is literally no other option for me at the moment to buy bitcoin in a roth IRA. Besides that premium is likely to go up before it goes down, as it gets bigger as people become bullish on bitcoin. 
Not like i'm going to hold this forever mind you.

I'm not worried about coming soon, once some are actually available I can re-evaluate. the volatility of bitcoin its-self is a much bigger factor

Because its all in my roth IRA and completly 100% tax free! I can sell/buy it whenever I want without worrying about the IRS. 
Also, anyone interested in bitcoin should keep an eye on GBTC, when the premium gets super high (90% or higher) you should consider selling some bitcoin, it's a super easy way to see how inflated public interest is/how big the mania is.
