Bud, you just got rekt pretty bad, looks like they gave you a list of the real world uses and you're just repeating your talking point "tell me the uses" two people told you the uses and one of them explained it to you chemically.
Pun intended: You're clearly out of your element. Take the loss and delete your stupid 3 month old trolling account.

I think the impact overall is not too relevant. It's just a case where it's not like Bitcoin is a viable substitute or alternative.
No one investing in like US Treasuries is going to say "The safest investment on earth just got 1% riskier...lets move our money to the riskiest investment on Earth" 
You're two extreme ends of the spectrum.

Coinbase doesnt pay fees, only GDAX does, coinbase used to.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:53:47
Coinbase is an example, used to have "no fees" then they did. 
Shouldn't hide that fact from new people. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:59:42
Whats the refutation to that though? 
You don't literally fix the old models of things, you make a brand new model based on the old one. 
Seems he's right, and I keep thinking the same thing... The Crypto we'll end up adopting likely hasn't been invested yet.
It's easier to design new code than change the old code, because you need like 2 million people to agree to the changes. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:32:55
Fuck, you should care. They're just subsidizing fees and hiding them from people. The fees are happening and they'll eventually have to stop doing that.

Uh... dude read that better. 
He's right, tha'ts actually much worse than most bitcoin debit cards...you paid $29 to buy the card, you pay $48 annually, you pay $2.00 to use it at an ATM.
Then you pay the actual Bitcoin blockchain fee to spend the money with high priority. 
Dude you didn't spend 0.66c as a fee, lol, you buying that beer cost over $4 extra in fees. LOL
YOU ARE A FOOL!

You can't count the fact you sold the miners as a profit from mining. 
If you bought a machine for a factory, that made widgets, and you were making money of the widgets...then you sold the machine... that doesn't affect your widget break even point. 
And it's totally independent from the price of widgets. 
People think you're lying because there's no way you own a business if you make a mistake that simplistic.

Someone squatted on it in case it caught on and people wanted it I guess. 
Could be used for disinformation

You acknowledge output consolidation to avoid change, but you don't acknowledge there IS change because it's an output?
That's about right though, 20% in cases with it, but not all cases have it at all, so it nets out around 8%
I'm not sure why you don't acknowledge you're wrong and just fix it, its as if you understand enough to know you're wrong but are just refusing to correct it.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:44:48
You're using the wrong charts.
It looks you're taking the price and matching it to total outputs
Gotta take 
 [ 
and 
 [ 
multiply them together.
If you want to account for things like merged transaction fees and block optimizes, you add about 7-8% right now, but less as you go backwards. But this will get you plus or minus 8% of the real value.
Your number is about 800% too high because you're not excluding coins that were inputs but were not sent
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:05:49
That's the approximate rate since in the current halving.
The lost movement for fee optimization is a function of the original block sizes, it'll be around 7-8% for this time period and decline as it approaches the next halving. 
The sections people are pointingh out you're wrong in are covered in 2.2.1 to 2.2.4 and 3.1.3 
A simpler version is covered here:
the sections on change avoidance. The graph under consolitation showing fee consolidation resulting in a 7% adjustment there from 82 to 89% when you are at 25+ inputs. 
There's a video on it here too
But since you won't answer anyone....where does YOUR assumption the output = spent come from? That's wrong, where'd you get the idea from originally?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:51:47
So you added the inflation to the expenses...
Why didn't you add it to your pay?
You'd now on average make $3.50 per years and have expenses of $1.75
But your debt is still $10.

You just choose a point you liked, what justifies this?
