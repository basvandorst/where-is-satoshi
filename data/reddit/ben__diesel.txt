Lol pizzagate revolves around a supposed DNC pedophilia ring HQ'd in a pizza place, not the dude who ordered a pizza for a shit load of btc

Well this past months been the only real dip. The rest of the years been pretty stable. So no, not a whole lot lol
edit: After the crash... Of course I wasnt implying a 20k rocket to a 6k hole was stable. But it has been steady for over 3/4's of a year now. There's no disputing that.

I get all my buy alerts from this sub. When I see crash memes on my front page, I put in buys. The rest of the year I forget I even have money in crypto.

Thats cute, but what moron would back out after an 85% net loss in market price? You can either take a chance at another 15% loss (unlikely it hits 0), or aimlessly wait for it to bounce back up.
Im not at all worried because Id never put all my eggs in a single basket.

For anybody who came here just to troll people...
From the highest price point this year, to now, the price has had a  ~82% dip in price. That's assuming you fucked up and bought at $20k lol. 
At this point, taking another 18% hit and watching BTC self destruct all the way to 0 would be a walk in the park compared to selling and praying it doesnt come back up. So good luck fear mongering anybody who made it this far into selling lol.

Where would you suggest somebody put their money right now aside from literal gold, foreign currencies, or real estate, in order to keep its value safe?
[The DOW is down 700 points]( from this morning alone. National debt is expected to skyrocket at speeds we've never experienced within the next 8 years. Right now nothing is safe.

I was obviously referring to the people who bought in at the price I mentioned above, but that's a good point. 
I'm a financial masochist so I'm okay with my wallet being humiliated and pulled apart.
