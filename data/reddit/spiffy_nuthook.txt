Id say scanning a QR code is just as easy as swiping a debit cart. 
I do understand the consumer protection issue. This is a big hurdle and I make no claims to know how to fix it. I just see the good that can come from this. 
Every day you hear horror stories about the big banks and how they are ruining the economy. Not to mention, the internet is where a lot of our future purchasing is going to be done. It is already going that way now. What would be so wrong about having a currency born a bred on the internet, by the internet and for the internet. All of your financial data when you swipe your card is going down an internet connection anyway. 
I think that cutting out the middleman that has his hands in your pockets is going to be a better and better looking thing for more and more people coming up in the future. Will it happen tomorrow? Next week? Hell, next year? No. But I do think it is possible to happen in the near-ish future. We just have to seize the opportunity and put the work in to make it happen.

Found the site FAQ burried in Bucky's page. 
Would probably be best to show this up front on the site. Credits are used for posting items to the shop to sell.
From the FAQ-


@_date: 2014-06-17 02:46:57
So far, this is legit, if not a case of slightly misleading advertising. Sites faq was on Bucky's page. There it states that the credits are used for being able to post on the shop/trade sections of the website as a seller/trader. I received 25 credits, the equivalent of what it would cost in BTC to purchase as many would be .0125. 
Im not mad, don't get me wrong. I still intend to use the site and the free credits are appreciated. I would just say, try to stick that FAQ in plain sight. Maybe stick it at the bottom along with an about us and all that jazz you usually see. That is usually the first place I look when Im lost on a site. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:43:07
Yep. And will unfortunately still be lost once the government gets their hand on Bitcoin to "Keep this kind of thing from happening again." This is just the excuse they were waiting for. Now they have two powerful chips to negotiate with. A large amount of BTC seized from an illegal drug running ring, and a message of risk from the collapse of MtGox. I predict they pounce and throw BTC through a regulatory guillotine in a week or less. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:21:28
Like I said, I don't claim to know how to fix the consumer protection aspect of it. I just say don't let that get you down. I'm sure someone smarter than I will be able to come up with the answer to that particular problem. 
I know you see a lot of bullish, overly optimistic types on this sub, but really I do think there is a lot to be optimistic about. I also like to try to keep a relatively even head thinking about this topic too. I mean, we are having this conversation because the price dropped rapidly, so obviously there is some work to be done. I just kinda want to be here doing some of that work to help get something I believe in off the ground. 
Edit:Words and typos. Also, quoting a statistic I wasn't sure about.

Unfortunately, Most of Europe, Asia and America are not at the point where they will lose faith in their respective governments because of an internet issue such as bitcoin. I mean, look at the leaked info about the NSA. Where are the protests, the riots in the streets, the toppled governments? If the people don't care about that big of an issue, why would they care about "magic internet money"? Maybe if everyone used bitcoin as they did cash, then yea. But right now you have to look at the realistic side of things. Bitcoin is still technically a niche. Sure, there may be millions of people using it right now, but that is small in comparison to the voting public that watches the news and only hears that bitcoin is used by "nerds" and drug dealers. The government controls what the people who voted them in know. If they want the populace to think that bitcoin is a joke, you had better be damned sure they will make that populace think it is a joke. How many Joe Blows off the street do you that are willing to actually delve into the world of bitcoin enough to pull the wool from their eyes?
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:58:11
I dont know. It just seems kind of shady to me walking up to a bank teller with account info that I don't actually own. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:00:44
Well that was helpful... I wasn't looking for reasons not to get into Bitcoin. i KNOW I want to, but need advice on where I can best buy in without getting screwed. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:12:07
Here ya go! Site looks interesting. Gonna have to give it a more indepth browse.

As much as I would like to see it unregulated, even after all of this, I fear you are right. This is the Fed's excuse to say "We must put the hammer down on it." The fed gets to look like the hero who saved everyones money and bitcoin gets relegated to obscurity after the incentive dries up. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:52:51
MOON that spells Bitcoin. laws yes.

Now, now. That isn't a problem. It is a FEATURE. The radiation pre-cooks your food and offers free birth control! 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:50:05
And that is where we come in. We as a community not only have the ability to explain and help interested parties learn the ways of Bitcoin, but also we have the ability to change how it works. All of these problems we are seeing I don't believe are a fundamental problem with Bitcoin. All of this is stuff that can be fixed with enough effort. 
We can teach people to learn how to use Bitcoin. After you know what you are doing, it becomes a lot less daunting a task to use Bitcoin for everyday things. PR man. It all comes down to the PR. And that, I feel, is our job. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:29:26
Also, not being able to be regulated does not mean that they cannot do some major damage to what we built here.

Wrong sub. Try @_date: 2014-02-28 21:00:42
Or they could just keep banks from trading them for USD or whatever other local currency. Then the actual money value plummets or does not exist at all. After that, it is relegated to a few online places of business and is shunted back to where it was a few years ago, i.e- no actual value, only used by hobbyists and other people who don't want to be seen buying something. It would set everything back. Immensely. They could also keep anyone who is "illegally" (read: against regulations) dealing in BTC from being able to do BTC related transactions at their bank. They could shut down sites (they do that all the time. They are quite good at it unless your name starts with pirate and ends in bay.) all the lovely things big government likes to do to the internet. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:30:42
They don't need to. They just need to break trust in it. No need to regulate something no one uses. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:59:34
To "Things I Don't Know 1"- I think that they are not going outright and banning it because the banks have yet to see Bitcoin as too big of a threat. If the banks were to do anything to endanger bitcoin, I would think it would be by colluding together to control a large amount of the mining operations amongst the existing large scale banks so that they would theoretically have semi-centralized control over BTC. If they could do it right, there would then be no incentive to destroy BTC, at least I don't think so. I think if they ever did grab a non minority share of mining power among the large banks, profit opportunities would be too large to destroy BTC. There would be money to make with it, and banks do love their money. 
Just my extremely limited take on things. I'm probably wrong for, like, eighty different reasons I'm sure someone will point out. Actually kinda curious about the plausibility of this scenario. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:52:41
 or startbitcoin.com or  Also, so GPUs are not the best for mining. I think it was Nvidia I saw mentioned but I cant be sure. It is one of the major brand GPUs that is not all that efficient at it. Also, I would still maybe suggest pooled mining and a dedicated ASIC device because of the shear difficulty level of the mining process now. Some of these mining pools are operating in the 100 Thash/s range, so yea, supercomputer territory again...
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:54:08
Not such a large chunk of coin, no. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:34:36
I keep a paper copy of my Keypass master password locked up in my safe. It is the only copy besides the one in my brain, so i know that if I forget it, it is two key turns away from me. Also, you can't break into a safe from the internet, so unless someone breaks into my house and manages to break into a 400 lb solid steel safe, I feel my stuff is pretty safe. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:04:09
Tell me about. Granted, I almost traded with them at around 5 USD per BTC, so I kinda missed out at first, but now Im not so torn up.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:03:45
Really, anything you buy is simply priced at what the market will bear out. I mean, even with all of the bitching about gas prices, do you ever see a gas station with empty pumps all day every day? No. People are buying it, so as much as it huts, it is obviously a price the market is willing to take. 
I would also say that most of the news hasn't been bad. We as a community have just succumed to what everyone who watches or reads the news succumbs to. We see a negative headline and that fact registers more heavily with us than a positive one. Sure, 1 or 2 Goxs happens. But those one or two setbacks are small in comparison to the good news that is happening. Every day new people are adopting Bitcoin. Millionaires are paying attention to it. The news is good. Don't let the human compulsion to weigh bad news heavier than good news get you down. 
I say just grab on and enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:34:07
What you would be looking for is probably a seperate mining device. Problem is, to get that kind of power you are looking at thousands and thousands of dollars in computer hardware and other goodies like that. So, long answer short, no, there is not. Just remember, it takes money to make money, no such thing as a free lunch... you get the idea. You could try pooled mining, but again you will be looking at small, small payouts unless you have a pentagon level super computer laying around somewhere.

Is there a link to a transcript by any chance? What was the talk. Im on a shitty throttled mobile connection and I can't watch videos. If you know what it is from I might be able to find a transcript or something.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:57:39
I mean, other than memory, what would you suggest? If you want to take it that way, then the only thing that is ever standing between someone and all of my information is either a few keystrokes at a computer or the right drill bit or whatever. I mean, it gets a bit crazy at this point. Either you have a password you can remember easily and have that get broken into so that all of your passwords are compromised, or you keep everything under 2fa and risk losing one or both parts of that and then you are screwed. Information security is crazy. Anything you do, there is someone who is already thirty steps ahead of you trying to nullify your preparedness. 
Edit: Also, bitcoin fortune is over estimating things a bit. I don't think zero is a fortune in anyones book. lol 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:24:22
Ok. Now, I use auto generated passwords for everything I do online and off, so I know I should be good on that. What would you suggest I can do further? Is there a site that has info or anything like that on it. I intend to do a little of both long term storage and immediate spending. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:50:34
Thats if they have a web developer who is going to be doing the update. If you've ever worked at a mismanaged office, you should know that people are really stupid and the wrong people get set on the wrong jobs. Also, in a sinking ship, the job of sending out an SOS might go to someone other than the ships coms officer. Better hope there is a note on how to send one if you don't know how to work the equipment.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:07:55
No. Maybe the wrong wording. I want to buy bitcoin. I want to buy my bitcoin with as minimal risk as possible. I know there is going to be risk. I am willing to accept said risk. I just want to try to minimize it. What, my funny friend, is so silly about that?
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:17:34
While I certainly agree that mass adoption is far from guaranteed, it is certainly a likely possibility with time. Many different places are accepting bitcoin, it is in the news. People who would have never heard of this before are hearing about it now. All we need to do as a community to see mass adoption is pull out all the PR stops. We need to combat the nay-sayers tooth and nail on this. If you don't look at Bitcoin ideologically, then look at it from a profit standpoint. Mass adoption means mass profit for the early adopters. We are still technically getting in on this at the ground floor. We might be up a story or two, but there is still more room to go up than there is to go down, but the only way you go up is to climb. Falling is easy, climbing is not. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:43:52
I saw that. It makes me feel a bit... put off. I don't know why. Have you done this before? How much, if any, extra delay was there for you to get the coins?
