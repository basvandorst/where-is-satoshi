But that 1 in 20 is most likely working/studying a STEM field not the owner of a corner shop.

We can't predict the 3 body problem analytically but we can predict it numerically with arbitrary precision

You can just write 1.500 x 10^3 if you want 4 significant numbers. In fact it's even better because using regular notation there's no way to write 1500 with only 2 significant figures

The total assets is way off too lmao

These price predictions are a great source of random numbers.

Right but the header includes a merckle root based on the hash of those transactions, so you still have to hash the data.

Great. We either design the system so it can't be manipulated or it's useless anyway. You can't just rely on nobody attempting to influence your system. It has to be designed to work despite that. Getting butthurt about it is just a waste of time, we should be focusing on how to prevent these things from happening.

We can just make a bot that posts a random number every now and then so they don't have to

It won't kill you but you won't like what happens

I don't mean it'll have negative physical effects, but that it's not a regular psychedelic like the normal mushrooms, it's basically a guaranteed bad trip.

Yeah but that quote is still valid. He just couldn't see past bitcoins new age tech anarchy vibe.

Not even 99.991?? /s but yeah agreed that it's not a loss.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:51:02
Surely you can see not all wins are equal...
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:25:33
But you didn't win as much as you could've.

You lost out on an opportunity to x10 your money. It would be like interviewing for a $1mil/year job and not getting it. Sure you didn't lose anything but you squandered a great opportunity.

Well I'm sorry you have a moral objection to viewing things quantitatively, good luck with that.
