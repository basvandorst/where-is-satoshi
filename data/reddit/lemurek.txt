There might be one decent strategy. It depends on how much you've invested. Say you bought 10 bitcoins, and losing 40k due to the slide isn't that appealing to you. Say you'd need to work for a year to put that amount of money aside. That's quite some time to invest in recovery!
It's simple, do what everybody here does - become a bitcoin advocate. Write blog posts, spread the knowledge, diffuse any anti-bitcoin narratives (quite a lot of work to be done in the ecology area), share the good news and generally stay positive. Ideally have your friends which are also invested do the same thing. Also go with the flow and look for the right moment to attack. With some luck that could generate some upward trend.
Now is the tricky part - don't fool yourself, you know it's not working, you are just selling the idea. The moment you've convinced everybody around you and your grandma wants some of that coin you were dealing, bail.

Or at very least introduce the concept 'proof of work' to the government :D

It's actually much worse that. The output of energy is limited technologically and geographically, so y creating a useless demand, bitcoin is actually increasing the price of energy and putting out of market other consumers which cannot afford increased electricity costs. Since it's happening mostly in poor countries let's think who could those be? Local companies, that barely make ends meet that can no longer pay their bills? "Yay, bitcoin! Let's make world greener by burning all the coal as soon as possible. Evolution, baby!". 
Yes, bitcoin could actually be good for growth, but that would require certain regulations in countries, which usually don't have enough technological capacity. Governments should simply regulate mining rigs and force them onto renewables, to stimulate that market MATERIALLY. But it's not realistic to assume it will actually happen. Until then, bitcoin it's just another cancer on our planets organism.

The big benefit of walls is that once they are built, their maintenance cost is minimal, easily less than 5% of original investment. With bitcoin you need to keep spending more and more (proportionally to the size of network). You don't provide real value arguments, but just rationalizations. No single institution would allow for such a waste, as it would be inefficient, but somehow we agree to pay the horrendous cost for the distribution as if it was actually providing some material value. 
And I think you've answered what that value is already in the article. Loose quote "if there was no value, people would not be buying into it.". Reminds me of tulips ;)

Soo... following the numbers:
Gold 475 M GJ to mine 192 B$ worth of gold 
BTC 183 M GJ to mine 4 B $ worth (?) of Bitcoins
Sorry bitcoin, you lost. With gold! 
But bitcoin fanatics don't do maths, they hodl (and love to see stuff burning) !

Sorry to disappoint you, you might have understood that from other replies, but there is no exit

Cool, sounds exciting! I'll be definitely watching the stream. Why einsteinium? On paper it looks like one of the most modern and well managed currencies.

Actually there's one trivial reason to do so. If you are close to 50% of hashpower, if you are lucky enough to mine a block unexpectedly early, say after 8 minutes, you could propagate it only locally and give yourself a heads-up for mining of the next one, which if everything goes well gives you a good chance of getting another one, and another one. 
If you attempt this kind of block-chaining attack, it's much easier to coordinate and push for it if you don't add extra transactions. 
Interestingly it's not the first time Ant pool did it. One example I noticed myself was quite blatant and somehow no-one was talking about it. Just check who mined last 3 blocks of 25BTC rewards, any how many of them were empty... :D

As long as the event is transparent and done for scientific purposes I do not have any particular concerns, but:
* active, community driven, with clear vision
* transparent road map
* they have already released their LN implementation to public
 
And yeah, as I said, it's just on paper. I'm not very familiar with the coin. This thread is actually the first time it got my attention.

So what's the target of such attack? 
1 Past? Double spending! You own the coin, spend it all, then overwrite the spendings to get the coins back. Could do on small chains, but it's not realistic on larger ones and the economics probably don't make sense.
2 Current? Control! You stall the transactions by accepting only high feed ones. Fairly easy to execute, but difficult to make real impact, probably doesn't add up economically as well. 
3 Future? Hijacking! You mine blocks ahead and effectively take control over the chain having a surplus of pre-mined blocks? It's tempting, but quite hard to execute. That's the only real attack and gives options to freely double-spend and control, but are you really prepared to execute it?

Soon, it's gonna be 10 BTC ;)

Copernicus understood it. 500 years ago. He was the same guy that proposed that earth might be circling the sun rather than the other way round. Some people still don't get it.

Problem is, that bitcoin is only good as speculative asset, and one, which constantly burns cash just to, by design, sustain it's illusory worth. Hot potato anybody?

And you are correct to say that Bitcoin is mostly a belief system, i.e. an ideology. And as any other ideology it's not rational, it doesn't bend to reason and therefor flourishes most naturally in echo chambers. 
However I gotta tell you if you are interested in knowledge you should actively look for opposing points of view, because that's the only way to learn ;)

After the halving 1800 bitcoins is going to get mined every day - these has to be shared across whole mining spectrum. And despite of what some geniuses claim - increased difficulty per btc won't translate to increase of the price.
We have all heard that btc is one of the race to 0 situations. In case of halving this will appear to be race to zero from the bottom case. Assuming that most of the mining is made for profit, the hashpower will adjust pushing the least effective miners off the market. This has some unpleasant consequences to the 'distrubition of hash power' but that's probably another topic. 
So the market will balance itself out around some average usd/kWh factor which until next halving is expected to be raising slowly due to improvements in technology. 
And now coming back to solar power - as I expect the 'average' mining efficiency to be fairly stable, solar power mining should also be fairly reliable. Solar isn't the cheapest source of energy, so if you were mining for profit you'd probably go bankrupt pretty quickly. But as additional source of income it should put some steady source of profit in the pocket. I wonder what will be the number in 0.??$ / kWh in your case.
