Fundamentals of BTC were a decentralized currency which was kept honest and transparant through the use of miners. Ow, and everybody could and should mine.
Instead we are left with a currency that has scandal after scandal (really, mt.gox wont be the last), which is highly centralized (a plan to bail out mt.gox because people lose trust in the system if they wont?! It sounds like the 2009 bank bail outs all over again) and which is run by miners who have to use specialized hardware.
The common end-user cant mine anymore and is actually encouraged to use 3rd party services and 3rd party wallets because the blockchain has become enormous.

How can you use an exchange if you dont keep money there? ELI5 please.
Theft of 6% of all bitcoins in existence is relevant, if you want to hear it or not. I would say it is even more (close to 15%) because a significant part of all coins is 'lost' already.
The theft puts a dent in the trust in bitcoin. Fiat money is insured (if your bank gets hacked or something you wont lose your savings) but BTC is lost forever.
The current situation leaves us with a rescue plan to save mt.gox to regain trust? Really? It is the 'too big to fail' stuff of 2009 all over again. How can a cryptocurrency battle the evil fiat banks if we mimic their tactics?
The state of bitcoin is pathetic at the moment and nowhere like the vision of bitcoin when it was launched.
Centralized exchanges have become to big, mining can only be done with specialized hardware and vulnerabilities in the protocol or implementations of the protocol lead to a lot of coins being stolen. As the value rises even more, more and more efforts will be made to hack or exploit the protocol or individual exchanges. Mt.gox wasnt the first debacle and wont be the last.

I mined with my HD5870 in the past. I recently tried again but stopped because the payout threshold is so high I would have to mine for weeks before I reached the lowest payout. The reason miners sell their mined coins instead of holding them is because of the significant investment they had to make to start mining in the first place. This initial investment barrier was not a fundamental of Bitcoin!
Point is, bitcoin is technology. Technology gets obsolete. No exceptions.  Technology already catched up with BTC in the form of ASICS and vulnerabilities in protocols or implementations thereof. 
Sentiment on this subreddit is already to never trust a 3rd party with your coins. This sentiment will really hurt the development of BTC (or any crypto whatsoever) in the long run.
What we are seeing is that BTC starts mimicking fiat money more and more. We have fractional reserve exchanges, 3rd party wallets, bail-outs for the sake of gaining trust. 
It is nowhere near the 'fundamentals of bitcoin' and when those are abandoned it really loses a lot of value.

Bitcoin is in its core a technology, a protocol. An innovative way to do transactions.
The technology has been translated into a commodity called Bitcoin that now is used as a currency. This translation has problems, like big blockchains, long conformation times and vulnerabilities to ASIC's.
All technology has something in common; it becomes obsolete. It needs to reinvent itself and to be improved over time. Bitcoin can not improve itself, because the protocol is firm in place and some fundamentals cant be changed.
Litecoin for example is in many aspects a better technology than Bitcoin, but will also get overtaken by newer, better, protocols.
Maybe bitcoin will transform the internet, or the way we trade just like search engines and social media changed the internet. But it is Altavista and Friendster you are thinking about, not Google and Facebook.

As long as people can not exchange fiat for btc, Bitcoin will not succeed. If anything, this story and the other 100 stories about exchanges failing and ppl losing money is the exact reason why BTC will not succeed.
Financial systems are built around trust, and trusting btc is really hard for the general public because of stories like these.

Thats not a really good analogy because torrents are 'free'. You dont need to deposit money on the Pirate Bay to use it.
I think a better analogy would be online poker. Pokerstars, Full Tilt Poker, and Cereus were borderline illegally accepting US players. Government shut it down and seized funds. Players on FTP and Cereus lost all their money, an Pokerstars pulled out of the US.
Online poker in the US is not dead, but nowhere near the volume it had before the shutdown. Some players are playing now on small, untrustworthy sites with little funds.

I disagree, because we are talking about technology here, not some sort of social equilibrium. The development of technology in order to make money is something that has never stopped so I think it is safe to extrapolate it.
Mining BTC will be a rat race where more and more people will drop out off, because the investment required will go up and up. It is very hard to police or control a system like that.

Main issue for me tho was the speed with which this was fixed. It was fixed REALLY fast which essentially saved bitcoin, but also proved the centralization of the bitcoin network.
*Large mining pools running version 0.8.0 were asked to switch back to version 0.7, to create a single block chain compatible with all bitcoin software.* 
If more than 10 people were involved in 'fixing' the problem I would be genuinely surprised.
Bitcoin has its merits, but isnt nearly the decentralized, undeniable, unalterable currency it claims to be.
@_date: 2013-05-09 14:22:44
To the people?
If you put Gavin, Mark Kapales, Slush and 1 other pool operator in one room, you got Bitcoin in 1 room. That is it. Those people can decide what BTC will become. Not the people.
The people werent asked what to do when the chain split occurred in March. It just got fixed and it got fixed fast. Why did it get fixed fast? Because you only need to reach out to a handful of people.
The idea that people have that Bitcoin is decentralized is completely lost on me. Maybe I am mistaken, but please explain it to me then, instead of just downvoting.
Regarding the wealthy elite, BTC is the same thing. I saw a post here lately where someone determined that Satoshi alone has 10% of all coins in circulation. There must be a lot more of those 0.0001% guys.

I am talking about the scenario that turdovski described: "If BTC succeeds, people won't need to exchange into fiat as all trade will be done in coins."
No fiat, just BTC. A "no fiat, just gold and silver" would be the same actually. Can you imagine the clusterfuck that would happen if gold and silver became the only legal tender again?
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:04:02
Everyone traded in coins? Do you mean a BTC economy, where you get paid in btc, pay your rent in btc and buy your groceries in BTC?
This is something that will never happen. It SHOULDNT happen, because it means that at this moment, there are people controlling huge amounts of the future world currency. Bilderberg^2.
Bitcointalk loses its shit if someone launches a coin that is premined. Imagine btc as world currency, it would be the ultimate example of premined currency then. It is intrinsic unfair.
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:12:57
It is just funny that people hate fiat and financial institutions so much that they are actually ok with switching to a currency with 1 exchange that controls 50%+ of the market and where there are several individuals that possess 5%+ of total amount of currency. All because they think they can keep it honest with their HD7950 in crossfire.
Adoption of BTC to surpass national currencies would be a dystopian nightmare.

Yes, buying bitcoins for $100-200 a piece is exactly the same as joining a social network for free to keep in touch with friends.

If you want to make BTC a success, you should really stop making it sound like a pyramid scheme. That goes for a lot of ppl in this community btw.

Forgot to add the most plausable scenario:
Something better than BTC comes along, myspace/facebook etc. Technology develops fast, it is almost inconceivable that BTC can not be improved. In fact, LiteCoin is already an improvement over BTC. BTC has the momentum of being the first, but that will wear off over time.
Only when BTC will be used for the purposes it was ment to be used for we will see where the limits of the system are.

What it does is creating a hive mind. Reddit for example is really toxic community when it comes to discussing things. You can only say, or discuss things that fall within a quite limited frame what the majority agrees on. If you exit that frame, you will get downvoted and your voice silenced. 
For example if you are anti-btc, you stand no chance in People will downvote you and your posts will disappear. It is no fun to try to participate in discussions where the guys you are debating with have a censor button. This is not the case on a regular forum where every post is equal, leaving more room for discussion and debate.
Rewarding posts with money, or karma for that matter makes posts unequal. Are they better, or are they just reinforcing the position that the majority of readers already held?

I recovered my BTC yesterday, all 3 of them, and started thinking about what to do with them. Especially stuff that I wouldnt be able to do with my own fiat money.
The only thing I could come up with what would be really cool to do was to easily spend money on virtual content on the internet and mobile applications. Something that is barely represented now in the Bitcoin economy.

BTC protocol could be compromised which can result in BTC;s being copied. Hence endless printing of BTC and nobody would buy or accept BTC anymore.
Governments could try to shut exchanges down and/or forbid banks to do business with said exchanges. Getting money into BTC would become insanely hard and unacceptable for general public. Prices would plummet but not to zero.
ASIC's can take control of the blockchain and send mining BTC's to insanely high difficulty. They could stop mining/go on strike/ whatever, bringing BTC transactions to an halt.
General public can turn their back on BTC because of media attention to illegal use of BTC or illegal data in blockchain. Having, or trading in BTC becomes a taboo and prices would plummet but not to zero.
There is a LOT that can go wrong with BTC. It is an experiment, nothing more.
@_date: 2013-08-06 17:05:23

It is intrinsic unfair. Imagine that the government declares that from now on, the new currency will be sea shells.
You say, "ok, lets do it" and you head to the beach. When you arrive there, you see not only thousands of people sifting the sand for shells, but you discover that some people actually have been harvesting those shells for the past 5 year!
But all that is ok, because the early adopters have a shop where you can buy shell's for $200 a piece?
Come on. It is a dystopian picture, and I really dont get it why so many people in the bitcoin community are pursuing it.
Bitcoin has its merits, and can find its place in the world economy but it will never replace the usd or the euro, because when that happens, we are fucked.

This is a non-issue because very soon, there will be no longer people mining away on their itty bitty pc's. BTC mining will become an industry that requires a huge startup cost. I wont be surprised if GPU mining will become completely obsolete before 2014.
Because in its very core, bitcoin isnt money but it is a protocol, a technology.
Technologies get outdated and for bitcoin this means there will be either a better coin available, or newer technologies will make the mining protocol obsolete.
People are hesitant to switch over to newer coins because btc has momentum right now, but better, improved coins are already available. Dont be fooled by thinking that btc will be the next big thing. Maybe cryptocurrency is the next big thing, but that is not necessarily bitcoin.
In my opinion mining is a huge reason why btc isnt the coin to ultimately make it. Satoshi envisioned a system where the general public could keep the integrity of the system by mining and controlling the block chain. However, due to how the protocol is set up, the general public is less and less capable of controlling the blockchain. 
Where in the past everybody could mine on their cpu, nowadays the chain is controlled by GPU miners, and only ATI GPU that is.
In the very near future, gpu mining will become obsolete just like cpu mining when asics take over. This is huge, because it means that in order to mine btc, you actually have to buy dedicated hardware for that. To participate in btc like Satoshi envisioned will require a (huge) investment in hardware.
BTC mining will become the realm of professionals, and control of the blockchain will lie with a few 100 who can control and switch off BTC whenever they want. What is stopping a malevolent group of asic miners to pull the plug on their asics for a week and watch the entire btc transaction chain come to a grinding halt? difficulties will be so insane that even a 10.000 gpu mining community wont be able to compensate. The btc community will be forced to mine at like 1 block/hour until the next difficulty adjustment comes.
No need to ddos the exchanges anymore if you can control the system from the inside.
TLDR: ASICS will make the btc mining community MUCH smaller and more prone to abuse and exploitation.

People keep talking about the miners. The miners will keep the system honest etc, but there are no miners, only mining pools. Pool operators have all the power. Maybe individual ASIC operators will also have some power, but certainly not the random btc user who does some background mining.
And Kapales has a lot of power. If MtGox goes down for 1 hour, BTC will lose significant value.

Ok, lets make it 10.000 users, 1.000.000 speculators but the inventor himself still holds 10% of all coins. I don't care.
Point is, nobody knows, it is all unexplored territory. Stuff like, *the value will be a multiple of the rise in adoption figures.* are huge red flags. It is exactly how a pyramid scheme sounds.
Nobody knows how big bitcoin is, how big it will be and how long it lasts. If people tell you they know, they are lying and probably have an agenda you don't know about.
Fact is that BTC will only get as big as the amount of USD pumped in it. Every USD your coins go up are USD that someone spend to buy his own coins.
That means that current BTC-holders have a huge incentive to get more people on board. Posts like these are especially convincing for people to go apeshit and invest more money in BTC than they can afford to lose.
It is probably also why posts negative about BTC are heavily downvoted, and only pro BTC statements end up high on the frontpage. Especially reddit with its upvote/downvote system is not a platform where you can participate in balanced discussions.

Shutting down the exchanges will devaluate BTC overnight. Governments CAN control the value of BTC. Yes, due to the setup they can never control the network or eradicate it, but they can control the value. If buying and selling BTC cant be done anymore on an open and easy accessible marketplace the attention (and thus value) will drop.
