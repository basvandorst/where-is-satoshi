caps lock?

It is something that needs considered. I imagine the most likely solution will be a few years of transition where people are presented with both currencies, and then the local is phased out, much like in the UK when they stopped selling meat etc in lbs (pounds) and started selling in Kilos. No one was quite sure if they were being ripped off. However over time most people just adopted the new weight system.
 So long there is no exponential growth people should have time to be able to understand the value of the currency. If people start seeing prices of things, and wages etc plummeting in number value, it will lead to much confusion and mistrust I would imagine. A gradual change will make adoption much smoother.

It is gone, but you know this. Keep crying though and perhaps you will get a donation or two. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:18:36
lol, I am pretty sure I won't have as many fingers in different pies as you, but yes I work.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:13:00
Oh you deleted everything.  was the OP 
@_date: 2014-01-04 11:01:50
That is a pretty graph. You should feel proud.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:31:11
Ha great response to spam xD
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:23:30
Because I bought in again.
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:54:36
Your pricing indicates a total lack of integrity.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:35:32
 is your wallet? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:47:06
Personally I don't care who owns how many bitcoins. The Bitcoin system as a protocol is here to stay, it is certainly where the financial system will be heading whether they like it or not. One world government, one world religion, one world currency. Sure there maybe some major swing away from Bitcoin at some point, although personally I doubt that, but seriously could you imagine a world now where crypto-currencies do not exist. 
Bitcoin as a protocol is significantly more than a pet project. It is a manifestation of peoples desire to move away from an inherently flawed financial system. People are tired of being controlled.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:04:30
Your name suits.
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:44:21
The only time you should be charging that much is if you are clean room repairing. Not software repair.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:06:23
Sent and email to UMESH BAGHEL as per the administrative contact for the IP address you say stole your bitcoins. Hopefully He/She can help soon.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:00:39
Yes I think there needs to be something in the protocol that increases fees automatically depending on the pool size that mined it.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:36:34
Pretty sure the big boys will be doing this anyway, but it is also our responsibility to spread the message.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:52:29
I like milli and micro bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:52:52
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:49:27
The Internet is quite successful.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:28:31
A fair bit of what to be honest.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:19:05
nm, 
You should probably put something on one of those pages indicating you can pay with bitcoin. Looks like another bitcoin product merchant that does not actually take bitcoin. And as a client of shopify maybe nudge them to display price in btc also on your site. Anyway, good luck, looks nice, might after one myself soon, and seems very good value.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:39:17
So is there a definite solution to this other than a complete split? Is that even a possibility? Some sort of change in protocol to introduce diminishing returns perhaps?
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:32:26
What points have you debated already?
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:15:29
I love irony.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:49:54
You missed an opportunity here, I will let you work it out.
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:21:31

We allow customers to receive **moeny** to their accounts....
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:07:15
Bitcoins are infinitesimally divisible. If half the bitcoins in existence are destroyed the other half will basically double in value.
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:29:32
xD yeah was a bit of fun. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:16:20


Then show the TRANSACTIONS.
Of course you can't, because you are full of shit.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:01:23
Oh you will be happy to know I just sent your Indian fellow contact for that IP address an email pointing him to this thread and your account. Perhaps he can help you.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:47:14
2FA does not protect your wallet, it protects access to your wallet. You apply 2FA in conjunction with a third party to allow limited access to the copy of your wallet that they have. If you can show them through other means, email, phone etc, that it is your wallet, they can again allow you access to your wallet.
Your wallet protects your private key. If you 2FA access to an online wallet, then access is more secure, however the wallet is still the wallet. If you have an old copy of the wallet lying around like in an email account, or even if your current 2FA wallet provider are compromised, it does not matter what you do with your current wallet, your private key can still be gained from the other more vulnerable wallet.
Your wallet will always be password protected, however if your computer is compromised, and the password is not unique, and has been gained by an attacker, then the hacker has access to your private key, and therefore your entire wallet.
Brute force attacks on wallets could be possible if you use a ridiculously small password, however for the most part this is not the way your private key will likely be compromised.
If you lost your phone, then the wallet would still be available, as ultimately it is not encrypted with the 2FA code. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:33:16
Agreed, one of the reason for adoption is the decentralisation. 
The protocol needs changed to prevent this.
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:55:43
The whole independents producing episodic content will be the second biggest market rise in 2014 hopefully. Good work. Bitcoin will definitely help this market. Sorry I cannot contribute. Have an upvote despite your misleading title. 
The world is changing, people are tired of being controlled. However there are far too many 'donate' buttons on that site. I would suggest nothing until watched, if people like, ask then, otherwise you will push people away.
PS I didn't watch it....I just like the idea. I will watch later, and trust me if it is good I will profess.
 to help folk.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:29:54
No correlation at all between that transaction and the IP address. Nice try though.
@_date: 2014-01-03 13:51:47
Always happy to upvote tails of woe so people do not make the same mistakes. If Bitcoin does go mainstream there is going to be an awful lot of those 21 million coins being lost due to basic errors like this.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:13:07
You need to make this very clear at the start of your site. At the moment it does not do this. Check your analytics, I imagine most visitors do not spend more than 10 seconds at your site before leaving. Very few will be watching that video. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:10:50
If the system you were using when you created the wallet was compromised and has been connected to the internet at some point then it makes no difference what you do with that USB stick if your wallet and password were copied.
If you want to be proper paranoid then don't even have a disabled wireless device on the PC you create the wallet with. NSA/Other bad folk apparently might back doors everywhere including potentially in firmware/hardware. Oh and never connect it to the internet again. You will probably be ok then.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:00:41
Use a file explorer on Phone/SD card, might be lurking somewhere. Good luck.
Try it on a remote device if possible just in case it does still exist, would hate for you to wipe it installing something else.
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:39:53
Dude, that is a picture you will be showing your grandkids. Of course they will not appreciate the significance anymore than our generation relates to those old recolourised WW2 pics. 
Keep. This picture means a lot.
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:53:36
Does not matter now, my job here is done, this thread is already buried. My time well spent.
@_date: 2014-01-04 13:23:57
This is why you need an offline wallet. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:21:23
 run this after installing on a different drive or partition to the one you are trying to recover before handing over £2k for this bloke to try it, as that is essentially all he will do. There are many other pieces of software that will also do the same. 
PS, it is free and from the same team that brings you CCleaner and Defraggler.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:05:26
Yeah perhaps I did...there are many scammers around here. Show the transactions. You still got control of the wallet? I will send you $2000 if you promise to send it back. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:24:54


I would see if I accidentally held shift too long or too soon before a known upper case character, cannot think what else to try. At least you have a fairly good idea of the character sets that were used. That will certainly help brute force. 
Perhaps you have a dodgy key somewhere that was not actually entered? Wrongly entering the same key twice accidentally in a password field is not that easy.
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:57:56
Hah, xD very good :)
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:15:03
Lets see how quickly you can work them out?
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:03:19
@_date: 2014-01-03 13:09:21
I hope that this will not be the case, and that local currencies are phased out of commerce for Bitcoin. Usage of bitcoins directly will further promote adoption of the currency.
My only problem with showing in bitcoin is that for micro-transactions decimal placement will be a potential vector for ripping people off.
uBTC/mBTC adoption should help resolve this to an extent. I think people in general are less likely to confuse 1000/10000 uBTC than 0.001/0.01 BTC as they are more familiar with those numbers and usage of them.
Edit: Zeros, see!!
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:02:32
Which wallet were you using, possibly something in documentation that would indicate location it would of been stored?
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:10:06
That is a little presumptuous, if you whois your IP do you think the admin contact on that is responsible for what you do on the internet? Of course if the transaction you posted does contain your IP address, and you are falsely accusing someone of theft publicly on the internet then it might won't work out so well for you. If all you say is true, then it will not hurt to speak with him.
Glad to help though. Good luck, I am off to bed :)
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:38:29
Probably because the first thing people read on your site is this:


Which means dick to most people. Too many big words not saying anything clearly. Common mistake. 
In fact I still have no idea what you actually do at a glance and I understand this stuff. You promoting my public key or something? I can do that myself, why should I use you? WTF service do you actually offer? If you lost someone who understands the system imagine how flummoxed a slightly less informed member of the public will be.
Edit - just to further my point, from the first line of your OP here.


Still no idea.
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:06:27
Probably, but that really depends on wtf you are asking.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:41:33
Nice to see the fuse did it's job :S
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:24:13
Nice idea, hopefully you will not all get wet :)
@_date: 2014-01-03 13:53:45
Yeah that does seem snobbish, very much so, however did you actually read all of the OP? He/She was not moaning about losing coins, but highlighting basic errors. Enjoy your downvotes.
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:22:42
Tbf should be renamed Hmm having a quick check they seem to have cleaned that place up a little, but still very little serious discussion.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:46:16
That is the wallet the transaction shows was debited. Of course suspiciously it was also credited with the exact same amount just a 5 minutes before.
Ok there is no way to know whether you scamming tbh, so let me try and be helpful just on the slight chance you are telling the truth.
You got away luckily. You learned a cheap lesson. If what you said is true, and there was a deposit to your wallet and then an immediate withdrawal like that, then your PC is very likely infected with remote monitoring software, aka virus, whatever.
Totally wipe your system and reinstall. Don't store any bitcoins you cannot afford to lose online, there are far too many ways to lose them. Please feel free to PM for further advice on this issue.
