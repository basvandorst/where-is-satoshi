How did you gain a couple percent if you met in the middle of your price and his, which you say was lower?
Do you mean his was more expensive? Cause then that makes sense.

I make a small contribution every 2 weeks
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:38:22
No, he said he gained a couple percent. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:20:06
One step ahead of the game

It is meant to be sorta disrespectful

Hopefully payfair picks up some steam and has prices near market level soon. They plan to add btc soon. It will be easy for noobs to get in. No waiting a week for money, no kyc, no having to enter all your bank details.

Probably all those bcash shills on Twitter

Commenting so I can remember to pm you when I get some investment money, I'm all over this btc strip club

But he said he would if he could

It averages 3% per year, so usually you can do 1.03^t  where t=years

Hope you are still in high school. You need to read up on the interstate systems. Yeah private companies did some of the construction, but how do you think it was planned? Sometimes people had to be kicked out of homes for the roads, do you think private companies should have that authority? Having private companies plan roads would be a nightmare. You would have crazy zoning problems. You wanna pay some monthly fees to use certain roadways, but then you gotta pay different fees for competitors roadways?

Lol, so just build the road on top of power and water lines, and over land not suitable. In fact if it wasn't for the government we could probably harvest our farts for energy and piss a drinkable fluid that provides us with all nutrients.

What is what when you are not bearish or bullish? Thinking price will stagnate. If there is not a term already, I suggest slothish.

Checked out of curiosity. Nord goes through coin payments. I used that a few years back and it was hassle free. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 05:04:20
Yeah, wouldn't exactly call anything about this positive. It just wasn't absolutely terrible, like them claiming to not get it and having to fight for weeks to get a refund.
Story is payment didn't even work-&gt; have to contact them for refund-&gt;wind up losing a few bucks.

Public health care and free college for all. What Bern wants to do. So is it only socialism when you do it in America?

Seems like coinbase listing bcash has a correlation with the start of the bear market. The listing was a disaster and scared off lots of investors, also reeked of insider trading. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:28:48
also, you can tell by the way it is obviously shopped 
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:42:03
'yes, is this Mr Fargo? I checked my account and there is a mysterious 5000 dollars in there, this is an outrage!

Cause a week is a month and an hour a day, when your reaching just pushes it further away
