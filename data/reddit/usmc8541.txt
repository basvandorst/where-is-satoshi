I remember all these dumb people defending pirate40 years ago on bitcointalk. I refuse to believe people are dumb enough to believe this garbage. Even respectable members of the community will defend them or be neutral (we don't know all the facts yet!) because they will speak at these shitty conferences for money paid for by these scum fucks. Money makes people go crazy...

Où est mon argent! 
Haha just kidding, I left Mtgox when the feds took away dwolla. I know a lot of people blame you but I'm sure the US Government has lots to do with what happened.

High fees? Slow? Who has lower fees than coinbase? Who has faster ACH transfers?

I agree. He recommends using a VPN for Bitcoin instead of tor. That is terrible advice, we know these VPN providers log and monitor all traffic in and out. Private Internet Access might as well be run out of Fort Meade. 
Tor is the best option we have right now, and I2P as well. It also goes without saying don't use web wallets....

You need to have some working code to merge and that is the hard part. Making btc anonymous is not so simple.

Where do you find the time to make so many accounts? It is pretty hard to automate opening accounts no?
