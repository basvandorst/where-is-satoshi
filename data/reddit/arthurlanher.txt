Pretty sure he's just going to wait for mass adoption and buy stuff with Bitcoin directly instead of converting it to fiat.

Well, it's actually pretty complicated, but if you want to understand what lightning is, I recommend the white paper. I started getting it as soon as the first few pages.
I stress that you should not read or watch anything anyone else made. Do not trust Bitcoin fans nor Bitcoin Cash's. Trust yourself.

Interesting. Try not to postpone it too much, though. Since you're a beginner, I think a short overview may help you to better grasp the white paper. 
May I ask what was the *thing* that "converted" you?

It's a cryptocurrency. When we see mass adoption, atomic swaps through flash/lightning channels will be ready for use with most of the popular cryptos.
I mean, that's my plan at least. If you don't intend on buying stuff, what are you going to do?
(If you're pointing out that it sounds like he's going to buy *stuff* as in drugs and shit, nevermind this. I interpreted your comment as a jab at how it's currently quite difficult to buy everyday stuff with Bitcoin)

Well, that's what compounding growth means. Think about it like a bacteria that goes through mitosis every day; it'll take us a very long time to even notice it's growing, but once it reaches critical mass...
Also, I won't be just waiting. I'll be actively trying to make every restaurant in my campus accept crypto.
One could also argue that if I waited a year from 1993 and checked email adoption, I wouldn't see incredible results.

Holy f. 
Guys, grab some snacks and watch this. 
This is history. He compared it with 1992 webmail services and it is exactly how it feels. That meeting, that room, the people in it and the questions they had felt early-internets-like.
(He could've answered a few questions a little bit more directly, especially to people that old and that tech illiterate, but he is old too and no one is perfect.)
He did a damned good job.

Because people keep saying this sub is "censored" and the mods are "fascists" etc.

I get sad whenever I see an ironic comment bring downvoted. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:15:00
I posted here to make sure the new guys saw it. I think I'll post  the Bitcoin girl classic here in a few days.
And it was obviously going to be cringey. Did you see Siraj rapping about cryptocurrencies? Geeks are kind of intrinsically cringeworthy.

It's sung by a very pretty girl, btw.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:02:01
Btw, she's got her own YouTube channel: 
With some interviews, vlogs and more music videos.
And she's a pretty smart girl. I see her as the female Andreas Antonopoulos.

Based on our downvs and upvotes, I assume people don't like BCC. But yeah I just checked a few different exchanges and it seems they don't agree on what to call it as well. I'm curious as to what Roger V. thinks about this, but he probably wants it to be cashed BTC...

I get sadder when I get downvoted for sharing when I get said.

What does bitconnect have to do with this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:11:48
It shot over 56k on the MercadoBitcoin exchange.

The same moment the client was launched for testnet, anyone could simply change the flag that signals whether to connect to mainnet or testnet and run it with real money.
