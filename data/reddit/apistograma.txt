Anybody can win the lottery. That doesn't make it a good investment.

Yep. People boast about what they made, but shut up about their loses. This creates a very biased perception. In the end, this will only end in a lot of people being quiet and ashamed

Crypto and BMWs are just a message, something to remind him about KNAWLEDGE. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:12
Lol. Now it seems that the Fed, the BCE, and every relevant central bank is socialist now. Next thing I'll hear is that Rockefeller and Soros  were/are socialists
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:26:39
That's what a steady rate of 2% annual inflation does. And what any modern economy needs to stay afloat. What will happen when there's no more to mine?

Was satire, and I guess it worked too well

Of all the people that never existed, John and Becky are the ones that most never existed.

It was a joke, but it seems to have crossed Poe's law.

On the other hand, if BTC crashes next week, you're gonna be very happy to never have invested.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:49:23
It's not about the money man. Why are you so materialistic? It was all about blockchain, and how it made us better people in the end.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:30:25
Yep. Protip: If something promises to make you rich, but you don't know how it works, don't invest. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:17:37
So fiat is bad because it has fees. But BTC is good because it has even more fees?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:22:15






Of course, I know plenty of women called Becky that don't know basic PC stuff but at the same time they are invested in crypto and net neutrality news.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:44:49
The fact that you made money doesn't change that you didn't know at all how the market worked.


Also, the fact that you believed that some country would index their currency to a high risk asset that is called a "coin" tells me that you don't have any idea.
I'm glad you made some money, but you must be aware that you put your assets in danger while you invested in crypto. You couldn't predict it couldn't crash three months ago.

Dude your link contains malware according to avast
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:55:23
And do you think that posts like yours are going to help smart investors, or make people jump into it without knowing what they're getting into?
Do you have a personal interest in making people buy BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:58:55
Don't you think spreading memes goes against what you claim to do, then?
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:21:59
I see that you're missing the question every time, so I won't continue discussing with you
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:01:18
That's a stupid answer. If you don't know when to short, you can lose a lot of money. Claiming it's a bubble is not the same as claiming you know when it will burst
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:48:30
That's one of the best non-answers I've ever heard. Have you thought about trying a politician career rather than amateur investor?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:58:59
I appreciate that you're so civil about it. Hope I wasn't rude. What it seems to me is that you're mixing your hopes with the positive social effect of crypto, that I'm personally not seeing for now, with the financial wiseness of investing in crypto.
What it bothers me is that unlike other high risk assets, many people don't know the inherent risks and nature of it, thinking that it's safer for being a currency (that it's being stored rather than used for purchases thus not very liquid btw).
Anyway, it seems like you know its dangerous nature. Hope I haven't offended you
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:09
You're deluding yourself if you think you're in control. For all we know, next week the US, the EU or the Chinese government could issue a new regulation regarding crypto that could make the market plummet.

I'd notice the CPU and GPU usage, but good luck to anyone who wants to mine on my g4560 and 1050ti lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:02:56
And a coin in a rollercoaster is the way to get them into? You clearly don't know the risks if you believe the common man should invest here
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:58:08
I noticed. He pasted the shorting answer for at least 6 times.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:27:09
You can loose a lot of money shorting too. The point is that nobody knows when it would happen, at least not the usual investor that can't read the market properly, change it by sheer volume or have privileged information.
What's amazing is that so many people have jumped into a very high risk and volatile investment because:
-You can make money with your pc. 
-Value has been increasing so far 
-The "it's a real currency" meme
There's way too many people with no expertise on markets that will be burnt, and reddit is not helping them understand what are the risks of crypto. Just read some of the comments of this thread to see that many of those people should never invest on something this risky. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:14:54
Then why are you making bitcoin evangelism then? I've never seen any high risk investment other than crypto treated this way in the past.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:10:00
Non-asnwers again. Do you think this is something that an amateur investor can manage?
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:59:46
Doesn't work like that. If this is how you invest, you shouldn't work with bitcoin.
