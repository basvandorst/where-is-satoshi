Thanks for your comment. I haven't directly used anybodys image for the Satoshi figure but taken inspiration from dffierent characteristics.
I think it would be silly to message someone and say can I have permission to use your smile? Or your blazer jacket style? Or could I use your hairstyle?
Saying that I have already sent it to Nick and Dorian is unavailable for comment.
Going forward, if the overall design is based on a real person then I will be seeking permission. However, I am to sponsor community designed characters for the majority of them.

Hi everybody,
I just wanted to drop by and share with you my new Vinyl Toy range and with that my first crowdfunding campaign for the first character in line - SATOSHI NAKAMOTO.
A lot of work has gone into this and I really do hope that you do enjoy it even if you are unable to support this campaign. I welcome you to follow us on our social media accounts and to check us in the future as we release more characters. 
I won't babble on for days here as the project page covers most aspects but I will be on hand through reddit or any social media platform to talk and answer any questions you may have.
Just for the record - I do understand that you can't use Cryptocurrency to support via Kickstarter which is a big shame and hopefully one day that will change. In the future, our shop will be fully integrated with crypto payments but for now please don't let that put you off supporting Blocko.
Thank You
