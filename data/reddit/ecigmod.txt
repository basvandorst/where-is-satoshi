Awesome little home in the mountains!  As a Canadian who lived in Thailand for 10 years, I can say you're definitely making the right decision.  Best of luck!

We're in the burbs near the airport.  We still have a house there and visit it every winter =)
The political situation is a mess there (why we returned) but it will eventually quiet down, we hope.  Still a great place to live.
Be prepared to do a Visa run every 90 days.  I'd recommend a class-B business visa.  PM me if you need help with that.

I work online.
Visa's are a HUGE pain.  Best to start off with a multiple entry 1 year tourist visa.  Then either come back to Canada and get another one or get a business class B visa.  These cost around $400.
With any of them you'll need to visit Singapore, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia or another place every 90 days if you want to stay in Thailand.  No way around it other than to get married.  Which coincidentally is exactly what I did, but only after 7 years of exiting every 90 days.  So you'll definitely need some Bitcoins to pay for the frequent visa runs ;)

Uhm maybe but I had a grenade go off about 100m from where I was standing with a group of friends one night out at a club on Silom Soi 4.  This was during the red/yellow chaos in 2010.  Nobody was injured but it sure ended the night pretty fast.  Also numerous other dangerous situations involving guns and/or stupidity over these last few years of unrest.  
The Thais do a great job of keeping the chaos out of the 'tourist' areas but when you are actually living in the culture you find yourself going to these areas less and less.  The point is, when protests and civil unrest are 'normal' so are incidents of civilian injuries and deaths.  This is exactly why I left Thailand.
