Playing devil's advocate: what if he's doing this to minimize the damage it'll do to the market? If there was irrefutable proof, it could crash the price. Drawing out the reveal could prevent a flash crash. It also gives Bitcoin a ton of press right before the halvening.
I'm pretty sure it's bullshit, but there's legitimate reasons why he'd draw this out.

I'm the troll for pointing out a basic logical fallacy? Most people awake at X time live in Y area, therefore Satoshi must not be Australian?
1. Most P are Q.
2. Therefore, Q must be P.
It doesn't even matter since it's clear now that Wright is a fraud, but this line of argument is just wrong. Nice ad hominem for good measure, though...

TIL I'm statistically insignificant.

There are certainly more people who match the timezone than night owls in other timezones, but that says absolutely nothing about whether Wright could be Satoshi or not. If I didn't have a job in the morning, I wouldn't go to bed before 2 am, and I had roommates who wouldn't go to bed before 4 am in college. I've known fifty-year-old engineers who say their best code is written after 2 am. I find it totally plausible that Satoshi went to bed around sunrise every morning.
It's more like saying, "There aren't as many black computer scientists, therefore Satoshi couldn't be black." The racism doesn't make it any more fallacious than your statement.

Sorry, but this is meaningless. There's plenty of engineers who keep very unconventional hours and work well into the night.
