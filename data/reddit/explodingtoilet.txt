I can understand concern over a potentially late refund, but you come off as a giant entitled douche. You didn't express understanding or compassion in any fashion and even made clear threats of posting on reddit as if you expected instant compliance with your demands.

I was able to purchase mine through fancy.com.

If you use an android phone, Mycelium is one of the easiest to use wallets that I have come across.

It depends on what you mean by "too late."
The price to get a whole bitcoin is pretty high (as is the concern of most of my friends) but you can purchase any infinitesimally small fraction of bitcoin and still make the same percent return (or, let's be fair, loss) as you would have with a full bitcoin.
My friend has taken the plunge by setting up weekly purchases on Coinbase of $100 and is already up over 50% since a month or so ago. He has in the neighborhood of .05-.1 BTC, but just because he doesn't have a solid 1 or 2 doesn't mean that he isn't still doing well.
So, it is too late? Maybe if you were expecting to make 100k overnight, but not if you just want to invest and make a long term investment.
Personally, I say go for it, but be realistic and not a dreamer. Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme.

Where can i trade my bcash for btc? I've been meaning to do it but i don't know of a reasonably safe place to do it anymore. Last place i traded currency was on cryptsy and seems that i dodged a bullet on that one.

I hodl because all I know is buy high and sell low.

They way LocalTill works is you deposit into their bank account and then they deposit it into the bitfloor account. 
I already deposited into their account and then they say that they won't process my check.

I'm going to upvote you because you were right. Though, I also choose to ignore your last bit there. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:30:16
Would I go to my bank or to Boa to put a stop on said check? I'm probably going to do that after work today.

Updated the listing to have a link to a version with a Key Loop. It is the exact same model but has a loop that will accommodate most kinds of key rings and chains (or at least the ones I had available in my place).

It takes almost no time at all really BUT DO NOT SCREW UP THE PROCESS. I and many others have screwed up the process and found that neither bitfloor nor LocalTill were there to help us. Their customer service is amazingly shitty.

Nope, still waiting...

I agree. Though I am a supporter of Obama, I fear that this would turn off super Republicans.

I've updated the pictures in the shop to show what it might look like with a QR code placed in the back. I tried it out and it works really well too.
I haven't tried sealing the code with any kind of epoxy yet as I am still not quite sure which of my addresses that I want to put in there.
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:45:51
Not thick at all...I just lacked the forethought to put my own address in there as an example. Ran out of good daylight for picture taking too.
Edit: I've updated the photos so there is an example of a QR coded address.

Weird...I deposited some cash to bitfloor 5 hours ago and the money still hasn't shown up on my account yet.
edit: I'm not exactly panicking or anything, I just thought this was going to go faster due to everyone's testimonials.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:57:05
Oh wow! You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:30:57
No, you are correct. They've locked in the price and you should get one bitcoin for the price you paid. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:43:36
Already working on it! I won't be able to have a nice test print for it like this for a good couple of weeks though.
I may just throw on a loop of some sort and be done with it. It shouldn't be that difficult.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:35:25
Most times it takes less than an hour, but a couple unlucky people get to wait a significantly longer amount of time. 
Sadly, I am one of those people. 13 hours and counting.

[Product Link!] (
There is also a link inside the actual product listing that leads you to the model that has the actual loop on it. I didn't want to remove the vanilla coin model in case someone didn't want the loop on it.

I quit using coinbase as my place of business. My first attempt at purchasing from them and I get this...sucks. 
Now if only my bitfloor transfer would go through. 7 hours and counting. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:15:09
Gonna upvote you because we should never discourage noob questions. I would tip you instead...but I lack bitcoins lol.

I have heard from a number of former homeless and shelter volunteers that, if you really want to help, don't give any money and don't give any food. You should instead direct them to the nearest shelter and/or job training site. There they will get food, shelter, and job training. Three things they can actually use and will be put to their future. 
I personally carry a couple cards with the address of both listed on it.

There are bitcoin trinketsyou can obtain on shapeways. This one ( is supposed to do something pretty close to what you mentioned.

I live in California if that is relevant at all. I guess I'll just update this to how long it took me to get my funds. Might give a little disclaimer to anyone that might want to consider bitfloor.
