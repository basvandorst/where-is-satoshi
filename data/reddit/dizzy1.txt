I believe that tainted coins usually refers to stolen coins from a hack. But sometimes people just don't want coins connected to them for whatever reason.

Give the difficulty time to adjust? It changes every 2016 blocks and using the data from the last 2016 blocks, sets the difficulty to take about 2 weeks.

Do you even read? He said ltc.

If you can, keep an image of it for analysis. There is a botnet that uses tor for communication and mining. Would be great to take it down or at least to way to identify it.

I've heard people saying the announcement was to scare the competition and that the earliest that bfl will have these things is 2013. But as the principle of bit coin goes, if 51+% don't like asics then they can just change the hashing function used in bitcoin and then all those expensive asics are worthless. At least fpgas and gpus can be repurposed, but not asics.

First good article about bitcoin that I've read in a while.

a GPU is an asic, just a different type.

Its an encoded priv key with no history to it, right? with this pub key

You may have some luck if the unencrypted wallet hasn't been overwritten. There is a python script that searches a disk image or disk for keys the you could try.

If you don't get help here post in the hardware subforum of bitcointalk

Hashing power. Which is only the top 4 pools. But you would want more like 80% to be sure.

Is device 0 your CPU or gpu?

"Finite about"

It wasn't made by me. Not like I can prove that though.
@_date: 2012-07-18 23:47:50
Its true!

It seems the attacker got in through a compromised email server and reset the root pass on the machine holding wallet.

CPU mining is not worth the wear and tear on the CPU.

Generate it on players gpus. Like 1/100 cycles goes to generation.

There's a large fee on it. And not much in their PayPal account atm but the admin is usually responsive.

I would definitely buy one if I had the money. If you still have them in a month pm me please.

Usually the rule is to leave one core open for the gpu miner. But even 30mh/s would only get you $0.13 a day.
@_date: 2012-08-31 19:10:13
What is this? And why should I care?
@_date: 2012-06-16 05:45:21
I'd say earlier. 
@_date: 2011-08-08 08:44:30
Wire transfers are cheaper at that price. I think.

ROBOT HOUSE!!!

Thanks. Interesting to see so many people selling at the bottom.

Canada would be nice too.

A paper wallet is just a representation of an Bitcoin (ecdsa) private key. This is the key that allows you to sign transactions that can be accepted into the blockchain. Usually it is encoded as a qr (quick response) code so it can be easily copied to a phone and have the bitcoins moved elsewhere.

What about Java?

If the wallet was backed up before you encrypted it, then that could be used to access your funds if the keys in it are the ones with your funds on them. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:04:56
Did they have wallet encryption way back when?

I believe Bitcoin-qt sends it to a different address by default. But even if it doesn't, having a recent backup never hurt anyone.
