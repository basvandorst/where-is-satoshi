You say “ELI5“, but are you even older than 5 asking these kinds of questions?
If you can‘t even do the most basic math, you should probably stay far away from any kind of investing.

Buy more with “profit“? What does that mean?

Talking out of your ass != analysis

Try doing two google searches for Bitcoin using the daterange command with 12/1/2013-12/31/2013 and 12/1/2017-12/31/2017.
Compare the amount of results you get.

The lambos are parked in the garages of the people who sold you your BTC. And they're payed for by your USD.

Are you having a stroke?

For every possible outcome you‘ll find someone “predicting“ it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:01:40
I think that‘s a “yes“

The quotes above are lessons learned by many investors over the course of their careers. Why are you so eager to dismiss them as bs instead of using the wisdom other people acquired the hard way and are willing to pass on to you?

Value evaluations.
If you think it‘ll drop, why would you not sell (even at a loss)?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:34:56
Welp.. it just went down

You must be a special kind of unaware of what‘s happening if you‘re telling a person defending the “don‘t invest more than you can afford to lose“ mentality in regards to a highly speculative investment vehicle that they‘re “easily manipulated“.
