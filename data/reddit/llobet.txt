Gosh thanks! That looks promising, have you used it?

We were trying to sell some of the bitcoin we had in electrum. We made a coinbase account. We then sent the money from electrum to coinbase, and I think the following day a much smaller amount appeared than what we sent. 
Thanks for your help.

Kind people. Is there any better way to just sell bitcoin for USD???
I think we are hating coinbase now.

Thanks, feeling like an old idiot at the moment.

Ok. Your asking about the address we got from coinbase? We used the "btc wallet" and clicked the little information icon and sent it to that address.  Is that what you mean? 
Thanks for helping

Oh gosh.  We are on Electrum and not sure where to find it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:00:47
Oh gosh. I guess we just screwed up .... bad.

Too confused. Are asking our son for help too. It sounds like we've screwed up royally with the fees not being set right? How were we supposed to know? None of the walk through videos explained that step. Where was I supposed to glean this from? Thanks for your help though.

We are using Electrum and sent the amount to coinbase. We thought it would appear in coinbase minus some amount, but not most of it. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:55:00
Oh no. Is that what we did?!?
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:03:11
Ok. Thanks, will try and figure this out this afternoon. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:17:16
Ok. Just paranoid. Obviously we have scattered a chunk of our bitcoin to the ether and not wanting to loose more.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:19:15
Honestly, am nervous about posting the wallet address. Not sure how it works yet, and posting it to the world might be even stupider (?) Can you walk us through it any other way?

This was the first time we tried to sell, we've just been accumulating bitcoin. Thought we should finally cash out some with the recent run up. Not sure how umpteenth we've used it though. Thanks!

Gosh thanks, will try and work on it in the morning again.
