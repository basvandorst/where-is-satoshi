From what I remember (not bothering to go back to look at the charts to correct my memories so might be a little off):
I was watching the price that morning and it cruised past $14k, 15, 16 over the course of a couple hours or something.  So it had good momentum, and then all of a sudden kicked into overdrive.  17 was gone, then 18, then 19+, all in maybe 30 minutes, and then Coinbase was down for about 30 minutes.  When it came back, the price was back to the 17k range.
I suppose someone tried to buy A LOT and there simply wasn't anyone planning to sell that much on Coinbase at that time.  Sell orders can't be created instantly.  So maybe Coinbase crashed from load, but I think it is more plausible that they shut it down on purpose to preserve order (and their credibility!).  Over the course of the 30 minute shutdown some traders were able to get more sell orders in place to restore a reasonable amount of Bitcoin supply.

I mean they are pretty consistent in not wanting to tax the same money twice.

More like they went with a half baked address extension scheme (NAT).  Said scheme uses the TCP/UDP port as an address component and has resulted in 15 years (so far) of shitty UPnP, port forwarding, and general stifling of what the Internet should be--true peer to peer transfer of data.

It is NIIT, not NIT.  Might save someone from the one extra search that I had to do. :)

I would sell more to keep the price down for you but my sell limit is $50k per week.
