Thanks, he already has many bitcoins waiting for him!
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:27:16
He is going to have many bitcoins waiting for him - it is great as he can't spend them on rubbish and he has to learn how to use them! :p
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:48:04
Thank you! :) you too! 
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:35:56
He will be loved! I am sure he will do great!

@_date: 2019-01-20 21:36:05
Thank you!!
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:39:27
I hope so, then we can use it to buy him a car ��
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:10:10
Any more information? ��
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:32:46
I want to see more!!
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:28:09
Haha, its actually such a great idea, he has to learn how to use it then :p

@_date: 2019-01-06 10:26:09
It has not been announced by forbes yet!
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:37:20
Thank you! It means so much :)
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:25:37
He has having a bitcoin savings account!
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:09:42
It has just been a stressful few weeks and this makes me feel better than there is a long term plan for his life :) 
Someone else last week posted something similar with no context and it blew up, I thought my son deserves the same chance :) bit of a copy cat I guess - sorry everyone!

Bitcoin wallet - 3KvB5LgnCQL9AUPgjqbaxyL3EcXLmmTtSx (created a new wallet for the savings account from previously using coinbase pro as it was much more secure)
If you are donating please do not go wild - just a few Satoshi's means so much! :)
When he is 18 all I want for him is a good chance at a good University / College
Everyone deserves a chance

Can anyone reccommend a mining pool?
@_date: 2018-12-30 20:13:35
Very informative, thank you I am checking them all out now! What do you use for your wallet though as a lot of people are telling me that blockchain is not very good! :/ 
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:51:51
I will have a look!
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:10:36
That all sounds good depending on its cyber security - I am open to trying anything to be honest depending on if it's safe. I am just trying to get into it - only problem is that its hard to buy items using BTC so I would only want to put 20% away as I have bills/debts/direct debits to pay constantly. 
I am going to check it out tonight anyway, thank you for the information, have a happy new year tomorrow!

I agree with you mostly! But the world is set up in a certain way where this is still a few years away and the banks/government will not give up control anytime soon. Japan's bank is releasing their own cyrpto currency now. Once I get settled in life as I am only 23, with a car, my new born baby son and a home for him to live, then it will be all about freedom! I would love nothing more than that. Cypto mavericks, privacy, free trade, no copyrights, freedom of the internet and piracy. 
I hope you are right and it ends up how you want it too! Life's just not that fair when human greed is involved :/ good luck to you though, I respect you for it

I do not trade stocks as I do not gamble. I want to see them rise and ride the wave! Hopefully use their services too :) we all want to make a little money though, and everyone wants to take it.. 
I love the idea, and it was too expensive last year, but now it is reasonably priced for me :) 
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:50:48
I agree! But I need alternatives
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:37:55
Is that coinbase pro now?
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:55:04
Fair point sir! And I was saying it is a load of trash to be honest, the more fun and easier the app normally means more commission for them.
I asked for advice at the end, the previous bit was just a bit of context, I like BTC, I just do not have a lot of money so I cannot use it for its intended use. But I want to stay on top of 2019 trends and maybe start solo mining too! :) i got 3 jobs and work my ass off for minimum wage.. i am not letting daft stock brokers take my money..
