Then you miss my point entirely, not surprising.
While I don’t believe all taxes are justified, there are countless services that form the foundation of our society, and they are not free to execute. You can’t be expected to pick and choose what services/programs you endorse without undermining the core concepts of democracy. Don’t like the system, vote to change it, because simply abandoning the principles behind taxation simply because you don’t approve of it is cowardice.

How does the “free market” know about accountability if they are able to privatize their profits while socializing their losses?
Nevermind the repeated bailouts on the back of the taxpayers.

At current difficulty, I get about .001 deposited every 3 days. Lately that’s been over $15. Multiply that by 10, because 30 days in a month, and what do you get?

I live in Missouri, and electricity is dirt cheap. Also, even if it did cost $50 a month to power, I’m getting over $150 deposited into my wallet each month at current value.
$100 a month passive income, while I won’t get rich, will cover all Christmas gifts for the family every 12 months.

Agreed. This thread has been nothing but people trying to convince me I won’t make my money back, when I’m already 1/3 of the way there in 1 month.

Monthly return outweighs expense of running the miner by a ridiculous margin. It basically costs as much to run my office computer (1 of 5, I’m a nerd) as it does my miner.

.001 every 3 days at 1.3ghz. The reality of my situation doesn’t require your acceptance to be true.

Slush Pool, but why the hell are you so concerned. Even if I was fooling myself (which my monthly income from pooled mining has repeatedly proved otherwise), how are you affected in any way?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:15:43
I don’t know why so many people are critical of mining.

Just as a slight correction, my utilities aren’t subsidized. They simply take my usage over the last year, split it into 12, and that’s what I pay over the next year each month. Any overage/underages for this year are simply incorporated into the next years calculation.

I bought it for less than $500, and it makes me more than $150 per month at current BTC value. 
So yes, it is profitable, especially as it costs less to run than most other appliances I own.
Edit: MOST other appliances I own

I have an Antminer S5 running in my garage. While I don’t plan on being able to “strike it rich”, I’ve made over $150 this month with current BTC value. 
Electricity is dirt cheap where I live, so I can run this thing extremely cheap as I’m on a flat rate with my utility company based on my yearly usage history.
Furthermore, as I mine more, not only will the amount of coin I collect grow, but so will the value of what I already have collected. With those aggregate factors, I don’t believe it’s ever too late to get into mining.

I have no faith in any “free market” that allows banks to be bailed out by the government (taxpayers) for dishonest and ignorant financial practices. Don’t be so self-righteous as to claim you know the mindset of others enough to speak for them.

So the fire department should be able to “voluntarily” choose whether they put out your burning house.
