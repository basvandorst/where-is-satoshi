NASA doesn’t take hitchhikers either, so you better figure something out.

It's apparently a 2014 quote. What 2014 quotes on crypto are relevant on 2018. They have no context or frame of reference unless they had a crystal ball.

"as a store of value"

What’s wrong with the big short?

Hmm so is he saying we still haven't had a true correction and this is a false floor?

They pegged it at .2 on Coinbase, it doesn't matter how long they did it, it was in order to help BCH and hurt BTC. Yes the whole name war is stupid on the part of BCH trying to hinder BTC and help themselves.

I was indifferent until the inside trade job and complete fuckery with price pegging. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:19:01
I think it's being done improperly at times, but I think that BTC has do defend itself and cast a shadow over BCH, because BCH (at this point) seems to be piggybacking the 'good' name of BTC and fucking people over with the insider trading and fuckery that happened. I mean Coinbase price pegged BCH to BTC. That is telling. That kind of shit is bad for the future of all crypto. BCH is causing crypto to continue to receive a negative view.

Influx of cash created a higher demand for bitcoin, a lot of that cash got pulled out over the last 48H. Still based on something.

The companies lobbied for deregulation, took advantage of said deregulation. The government allows corporations/lobbyists to write laws. 
Pretty equal in the who is more corrupt / retarded department.

It’s almost as if the anti regulation circlejerk will be the downfall of bitcoin.

As conservative / libertarian as much of the BTC community is I would expect 5 dudes to be littered with bullets

We have a significant Vietnamese population, but I guess stereotypes are there for a reason for somethings. 
These men and ladies play pretty loosely with their money than I do and clearly have extra cash wearing designer everywhere.

I live in flyover land and I'm so confused where all these rich asians come from, live, and what they do. Like I never see them around town, just at the casino.

Another reply to me says the problem with LN is the centralization if transaction history. Can you elaborate?

I agree but I don’t see why a problem would arise with 10k + transfers 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:52:00
I see lots of FUD around LN, esp from the BCH folks. What is the reality of the situation. I even saw a post claiming 30% tx fail rate. 
What kind of fee structure are we looking at on day 1 of implementation? Is anyone fighting implementation within the node community? Will it be or cause another fork?

I've seen a lot of fucking racist shit out of BTC and BCH commentors, but goddamn. At least I've never seen BTC shilled on fucking Infowars. I've not touched BCH and now never will. Fucking scumbags.

It’s sad really how dumb these people are. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:57:05
I mean at one point I had over 10k and then I cashed out with about 6.5
I call a 3.5k missed opportunity but abuse 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:13:55
Well I mean obviously I'm not taking them seriously as they have a vested interest in failure / FUD of LN, but I'm just looking for a counter to what I've seen.
