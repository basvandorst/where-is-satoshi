Leasing and a loan on a capital purchase is essentially the same thing.  Especially in terms of cash flow.  In both there is payment representing the amortization, plus some cost of financing.  
Buy a 50,000 car on  5 year loan and sell it at year 3.  Guess what, it's about the same total outlay as leasing that 50,000 car for 3 years.
And what does it matter why people acquire the cars they do, or if they have a justification at all.  It doesn't change the fact that they do.  My building and neighborhood is not extravagant, but half the cars in the garage are worth 40k-150k USD - today.  Unless I'm living among secret millionaires, these aren't cash purchases.

Money in your actual wallet / mattress / safe / vault gives you what?  Absolute dicksquat.
Money in a bank account is a loan to the bank to use for their schemes, and they sprinkle you a cookie crumb.
Ask your bank what their LTD is.
0.25% for your checking? 1.25% for your high interest checking?Congrats.
People will readily offer you more than that for a loan be it in Bitcoin or dogecoin or trumpcoin

Complete horseshit.  In Europe, cars are generally much higher priced than in the US.  On top of that, white collar payscale is lower than in the US.
All car websites include payment calculator.
When a Golf R costs 70,000USD out the door, you think people are paying that in cash?

Noone is stealing from you. 
Giving up a fraction of your earnings is a necessary and fundamental payment for the innumerable systems and processes that enabled it in the first place.  
It's an exchange probably as old as neanderthals trading food for sex.
Tax amendments and reform is a continuous issue.  If you don't like certain aspects of it, take it up with lawmakers and representatives as part of your Civic duty.  
Of all your options as a citizen, merely screaming theft and murder is the least productive of them all.  I'm sure there are some guinea jungle tribes who might be receptive to ideas of starting a new system from scratch.

Hi friend, America bashing is really popular on reddit, but I'd like to give you a few factual reminders, especially as it pertains to France.
**I hope you realize that taxation is a bit more sophisticated than a min/max tabl**  
Based on the progressive tax bracket, a single individual earning 60k USD will owe federal taxes of ~13% in the USA, compared to 19% in France, and 120k USD at 20% in USA, compared to 28% in France.  On top of that, sales taxes in USA are about half.  
You can add typical deductions to it, mandatory social contribution, etc, etc, but simply put, a working professional will be taxed more in France than in the US.  Indisputably.
On top of that, the earning potential for most professionals are higher in the US than in France (and most of Europe).  I would know, I employ and manage a bunch of them in France.
**Reread and compare against the quality of "higher education"**
The US is a laggard at primary level education, behind many european and asian states.  It is the undisputed leader at the university level.  How do you want to compare?  by quantity of scientific or peer-reviewed publications?  nobel laureates?  leaders in medicine, tech, law, finance, etc? award recipients of global professional associations?  or simply compare the waiting list of those internationals wanting to get into stanford, mit, harvard, cal, etc, vs ifp or ecole polytechnique?  pick your poison
there are more desirable, prestigious higher academic institutions in the US than anywhere else in the world
you are absolutely right - there are pros and cons to both countries.  (to all countries, for that matter.).   i harbor no unfounded nationalism to the US.  i wasnt born there.  and in fact i left, by choice, for many years now.
but facts are facts.  personal earnings and quality of education.... highest in america.  hope you learned something.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:40:52
i dont dispute most of this.  
the defense spending and foreign policy is ridiculous.  
the tax codes are absurdly complex.  
"oil companies" subsidies and leniency - dont fully agree with this, as theres far more depth to it than when people use big bad oil as an easy target.  look at other major organizations across other industries... its a big business issue, and not an oil-issue


..but anyway, despite all of that, on a per-dollar basis, americans are getting extremely good value for their money

when you're a 1-day old baby theyre not going to pull you from the hospital delivery room bassinet and let you fend for your citizenship until you apply for naturalization.
your k12 education wasnt free.  youre using the internet developed by the government.  youre on a computer or a laptop engineered by people educated in the united states.  the business and economic infrastructure allowed companies to be founded that enabled 1 way or another every single thing you touch or see right now.
feel free to revoke your citizenship if you dont like the contract tho

Depends - what's your reference point?
Take a common field like computer science.  A typical mid career programmer in the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Germany, whatever, earns about 50-80% gross salary of an American.  For the take home, it's even less.  Then calculate the tuition of a school like...Georgia tech, and do the maths.
My team in France (not CS field) earns just about 75% of their equivalent in the the US.  The costs born to company is also higher.  And their cost of living (Paris) is much higher.
For medicine , my US medical+vision premiums were &lt;1000 USD annually.  And even with 2 standard surgeries, all the associated medicine, deductible, and other associated out of pockets, my total expenditure weren't much more than that.
Where I am now (not France), the mandatory medical contribution is over 3000 USD (employer pays another equivalent amount to govt) while the over "quality" of care is broadly similar, the access to care is less.  In the sense of hours and availability and waiting.  Hence I pay for private medical plan on top of that.....
There's lots more to it too.  Like tons.  But to simplify it - unskilled/underemployed laborers will enjoy a better financial life "here" (or most of Europe).  Most career folks like accountants on up will enjoy a better financial life in the US.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:32:54
It's a good question.  And it's easy to answer.  Tax rates are applied on basis of brackets.  The percentage apply onto TO that bracket.
Take this example: 0-15k USD at 10%, 15k-50k at 20%. 
If one earns 40k gross, one is not taxed 40k * 0.20 = 8%
the first 15k is taxed at 10% (=1.5k), and the *remainder* (40k-15k=25k) is taxed at 20% (=5k).  
in total that individual is taxed at 6.5k out of 40k of earnings, giving an **effective** tax rate of 16.25%.
there are tons more factor that goes into this -- reductions (deductions or credits) based on family size, other incentives such as buying electric cars, or leniency if you took a blood bath on the stock market, etc.  
but by and large, US personal taxes are very low compared to other prominent, wealthy countries.

holy fuck, its like im talking to a 12 year old basement-dwelling edgelord discovering anarchism for the first time.
a *social contract* is an agreement in a civil society defining the roles and terms of each.  you inherit it.  dont like it?  vote on change.    not the age of voting?  tough titty - your daddy and grand daddy and grandgranddaddy agreed on that at some time in the past.
**oh, you want to use the *common law* definition of a *"CONTRACT"*?** well, guess how that works? it requires trust in an established system of enforcement...like, you know, with courthouses and other apparatuses supported by taxes.
other wise your 'contract' is as good as toilet paper.
