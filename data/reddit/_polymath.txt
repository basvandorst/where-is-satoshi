I don't understand how you could not see this from the get go. Any service where I have to wait to give you my money is pretty trashy in my opinion. 
This is what happens when you don't hire the right people in order to scale. Outstanding tickets, slow service, and excuses for their "machine learning algorithms".
I appreciate them standing up to the IRS—but this is no longer a cool start up project where they can kick their feet up and chill.
COINBASE: DROP THE FUCKING SANDWICH AND COKE, HIRE PEOPLE AND GET TO FUCKING WORK.

No. No it is not hard. I work in IT. It is not like pro football. For Software engineering you might have a point. Handling tickets and database planning? I can do that in my sleep. The grunt work should be delegated. Stop playing with machine learning and fucking hire people because you are too greedy to individually vet users. Gemini could have capitalized except they actually don't do either.
They got comfortable too quickly with a global concept they didn't adequately prepare for. Always think globally when it comes to money...I don't understand why this wasn't understood by them from day one. That team should span the globe. In the thousands or at least striving to do so, aggressively.

Nothing. It's slow as shit like the rest of em.

Gemini is garbage. I submitted my docs to them over a month ago. No response.
These exchanges are terrible and have no idea what they are doing other than being a data collections agency.

I have no problem with regulation. Keeps the panic sellers from introducing volatility. There is a reason the day trading rule exists. I hope it all gets regulated. Would mean better exchanges, an arguably fairer market, and less ignorance/uninformed massive purchases. Good!

It's just Conbase being conbase as per usual

Don't make excuses for a company that wants to keep all of their money neglecting to plan pre-emptively for a global economy shift.
They should have anticipated this traffic. I'm an IT guy myself—they have no fucking excuse. Period.
