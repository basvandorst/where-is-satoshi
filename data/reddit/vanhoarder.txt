I don't think this community will be spending their bitcoins on this idea: 
Most of the people here bought for &gt;$500 &gt;$600 &gt;$700 &gt;$800 &gt;$900 and even &gt;$1000 per bitcoin , so right now most of them have unrealized loses and when donating they would have proper loses. 
Also , lets be for real here a sec, this community isn't "known" for being -nice- , organized or even charitable , so IMO you shouldn't get any sportsman excited about it before actually having some commitment from some "rich bitcoiners" willing to donate $2000 each.  Also do you EVEN KNOW how expensive it is to get a UFC aproval ? There is a legal process, and once that is accepted , you have to pay them a fee and then you have to pay the "right to be a sponsor", which depending on your "companY" , in this case bitcoin isnt one , but depending how they decide what this is , it can go from -$80.000 to $150.000  USD . Now do you think this community is really willing to donate that amount? I seriously doubt you could even reach 10k.

This sucks, I am glad I took most of my money out of bitfinex but I still have near 17k there...    
Can someone from Bitfinex please explain what this is all about? Should I be changing passwords and stuff?

It isnt hard to short lol? Every single exchange offers btc shorting, you can even cdf short it with leverage, which is exactly what i and a bunch of other traders started doing a week ago when the trend was clear.
