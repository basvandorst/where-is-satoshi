So much bullshit. Have you ever read even one academic paper on currencies? There is always only a belive into a system. No backup even if it's backed by gold, it will still be backed by the belive into the intrinsic value of gold. 
Yes the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies is connected to the innovative system it is working with but fiat money given by a goverment with it's own economy and produced goods with a real value have so many reasons to belive in it, that you can't even compare it to bitcoin.

So 2 of the last 5 steps are about price stability, ecpecting that market share will rise because of that. In conclusion that means, because of the limited supply it has to go up in price what would be kinda the opposite of price stability looking at the last prices rises
