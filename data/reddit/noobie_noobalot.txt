No the point of the meme was to make a smug comparison between Bitcoin and Fiat but they did a piss poor job because of reasons already stated.

At least I can spend my monoploy shit anywhere I want.
You don't see posts on here like "OMG LOOK EVERYONE THEY ACCEPT DOLLARS!!!", Or look at this "Insert picture of a store with a dollar sign outside here."

Lol, not a good advert for crypto when crazy people post stories like this...

Hahahahaha, digital gold. Fuck me. It's doesn't mean shit if it's not being spent you Wally. Everyone just sitting on it and waiting will do fuck all for it's legitimacy. Smdh.
Well it's been fun man but I didn't realize I was talking to a space cadet. Keep hodling.

I constantly travel for work, all over the world. South America a lot and Central Europe quite a bit, I'm from Scotland so I stop over to visit family on return trips, my wallet is filled with different currencies that I don't struggle to get rid of anywhere I've traveled.
As for evading gold, I didn't evade anything because the only mention of gold was your nonsense about Bitcoin being digital gold, I never once claimed to use it as a currency. You've suddenly pulled that shit out of your ass and are like "YoU DiDn'T ReFutE My pOiNt".
Dude, use your bitcoin to but some tin foil and make a lovely little had for your paranoid economic collapse future of yours. Have fun.

The smugness of the crypto community really is beyond measure. 
Pretty sure it costs fees to buy, exchange and withdraw my crypto and didn't the founder of Quadriga just die and lock up millions of dollars worth of crypto currency? At least my money in the bank is insured.

Okay then, you're wrong on point one. I've used Euros and dollars in the UK. Believe me, don't believe me, I don't give a fuck. I've done it, they accept them, end of. 
Again, Bitcoin needs mass adoption and to actually be moved around like currency to become anything other that a speculators wet dream. It might be all of those things you claim but it's also pointless sitting in people digital wallets doing nothing, it's also much more difficult to understand and work with, which are huge negative factors for many countries in the world, basically right now and for the foreseeable future it's digital fairy money that sounds shady as fuck to almost anyone that's not tech savvy. 
Everything you said after digital gold is basically rambling so I'm gonna ignore that.

Let's be honest, he's not paying tax on his earning, if he's even making anything from this.. That's the thing with crypto currency, It's unregulated and when in situations like OPS he's rented a random location near a cheap power source and probably has it under a fake name/company so he can bail if he needs to before the IRS catch up to him. Crypto is shady af.

So now you're backtracking, do you think banks should be charitable organization? 
Fees are fees miniscule or not, a fee was paid on the acquisition of your crypto. You just paid on the front end whereas with a bank I pay at an ATM on the off chance I use one but seeing as I have a debit card cash is basically pointless I'm rarely at an ATM and even then my bank pays me the fees back.
So to reiterate, you think it's cool that miners and exchanges charge fees because they're not charitable organization but banks can't because *reasons* also we're talking ATM fees that are easily avoidable and in a lot of cases are paid back. So as I stated, the meme is stupid and way off the mark as you're still paying fees even for crypto.
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:31:27
Miniscule is still more than zero. You should really take the L on this one.
Also from coinbabes own website;
"Digital Currency Conversions
With a Digital Currency Conversion, you can accomplish in a single transaction what would otherwise require two separate transactions. For example, you could directly convert Bitcoin to Ethereum (a Digital Currency Conversion), or you could sell Bitcoin and then purchase Ethereum (a Digital Currency Sale followed by a Digital Currency Purchase). 
Coinbase charges a Spread of one percent (1.00%) for Digital Currency Conversions. However, the actual Spread may be higher or lower due to market fluctuations in the price of Digital Currencies on Coinbase Pro between the time we quote a price and the time when the order executes. We do not charge a separate Coinbase Fee for Digital Currency Conversions."
1% is higher than 0%

Everyone should be anti brexit. That was a disastrous decision based on bigotry and lies.

The crypto fees are dependant on the amount you're transferring or coverting, so a set dollar fee from the atm is better than the potential huge fee I might pay on transferring/converting large amounts of crypto.
Did you jump on the crypto band wagon last week? You honestly sound like you have no idea what you're talking about.
Also my bank pays my ATM fees back at the end of the month so really I'm paying more in crypto fees than I do to use the ATMs, in the rare cases that I actually carry cash.
@_date: 2019-03-18 11:03:06
If you don't see how me pointing out that crypto having fees associated with them is relevant to this meme then I can't help you buddy.

I can literally spend dollars in any country in the world, same with British pounds. I've never had an issue getting rid of them, even in rural areas of certain countries. Good luck getting Bitcoin spent in Cape Town, Tijuana, Plymouth or Bruges and most of you fuckers are just sitting on it hoping it'll take about jump up to 20k, good luck if it's not being used as an actual currency.

I've said it before but the smugness of the crypto community really is beyond measure.

Downfall of the EU? Ya, okay mate. Whatever helps you sleep at night. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:45:48
If I walk into most places in the world and I ask whether they want Euro, pounds, dollars, gold or a constantly fluctuating internet based digital currency. I'm going to struggle to be taken seriously on the last one. Bitcoin is volatile and fragile and Fiat isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

I'm confused, your description matches both Trump and Clinton  I'll assume because of the "You lost" you're talking about Hillary but sitting there thinking Trump is somehow less corrupt is sad and hilarious.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:23:58
You could have just said, "I'm a cunt" it wouldn't taken less characters.
