If everyone adopted Segwit would it be more than a 40% discount?

I’ve been hearing 18 months in the forums and Reddit. Is it closer? Why is everyone so aggressive in this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:09
I don’t know, Lightning network is 18 months away, we have got to do something. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:15:06
Actually no, I do not own any Bcash, I sold them as soon as I got them. I joined the bitcoin community right after the Mt. Gox incident. I support the idea behind the Lightning Network. I think if bitcoin is to become a world currency it needs to be able scale and that’s exactly what LN will do. I’ve just heard on Twitter and Reddit that it’s supposedly 18 months out! But I’d prefer it gets here ASAP with proper testing of course. I’m sorry if I offended anyone for sounding like a Bcash troll.

;-; for some of us Gemini is the best option because gdax isn’t Support in our state :(

Who runs this or is this decentralized? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:26:39
Is there a website that tracks how fast subreddits grow? I'd be kinda interesting to see how fast it grows overtime. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:42:34
Good Luck My Dude!
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:39:23
Wouldn't it technically be a hard fork because bitcoin split into two?
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:43:02
Remindme! 14 Days "What happened to all of that bitcoin?"
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:08:42
Did you find anything on it?
@_date: 2017-04-09 19:11:34
I'm afraid I can't give the information out regarding the chargebacks. Still working through some of the legal stuff
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:22:52
Working on a platform for instantly buying bitcoin with limited verification. Set to launch sometime in August. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:46:07
Did you use Segwit or Legacy?
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:26:45
They are overwhelmed with new users. Most exchanges picked up one million users over the course of a week! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:11:27
There is a risk for chargebacks so they raise the price. Maybe look into bitquick.co or wallofcoins.com. They are bank deposits with a decent rate. You can get a lot of coins without showing an ID. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:58:21
Do you have a wallet Address for it?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:12:58
Where did you hear that?
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:38:38
8/8 would recommend...I cry everytime
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:39:26
I guess your best option is to start checking every e-wallet maybe google bitcoin wallet options in 2011
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:26:57
I have not personally but I know a couple of friends who have boughten from there. I even have a friend who sells at wallofcoins you deposit the cash and upload the receipt. They have a team verify the receipt is legitimate and then they inform the seller to release the coins. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:16:57
Do you have a gmail email account? You may be able to look through your archived emails to find the website. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:48:43
Those are probably your only options. You are to much of a risk to sellers. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:38:40
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:32:02
Good Luck otherwise do whatever it takes to get into hotmail
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:08:52
OH NO! He is trying to use logic!!! Ahhhhhhhhhh!
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:06:57
Xcoins or Bitstamps
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:48:11
Good Read! The thing you have to understand is not everyone here is capable of "critical thinking"
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:28:10
Hey! Did you hear that Germany's Biggest Food Delivery now accepts bitcoin?!?  
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:41:15
Where can I buy this shirt?
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:46:46
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:34:33
Why don't you tell me what bitcoin is (I've been in the game three years) 
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:32:31
He's playing dumb! We can see through you! 
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:46:45
Three Cheers for the man who fixed our markets!
