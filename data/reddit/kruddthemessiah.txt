There is no such place
you can ask for a refund and it can happen instantly but the fraud protection that exists and the bank to bank transactions take 1-2 days to appear on your account .
Pay with cash/paypal if its such an issue and you need an instant refund.

A nepali who has never posted before on reddit and just got bitcoins from a client becoming a "proud new owner " but knows all about buttcoiners and volatility - r/thathappened.
Your story is 100% bullshit
Nepal has such bad internet and electricity  you need to get money in the form of bitcoin to host a web server , but the internet and electricity works well enough so you can make a clients website and upload it for them .
Also having your money in the form of bitcoin which cannot buy you nearly anything in nepal except maybe some international webhosting is a much better deal then getting the money sent to you using western union where you can say keep half in the form of local currency and use the rest to buy buttcoins.
Also theres like 2 stores in nepal on coinmap makes using bitcoin over WU a much better option

Most people in this thread are , you are saying you want them to use bitcoin so bitcoin is better promoted - thus making you money .
