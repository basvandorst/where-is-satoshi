It's interesting that the more negativity you read, the better it actually is for bitcoin.  The market speaks for itself so clearly there is an overall bullish attitude, but if no one had anything negative to say, there would be no upside left.

I wonder how much their net worth has decreased in the last few months, anyone have any guesses?

Apparently they are creating a stablecoin for WhatsApp payments between users.  This is just a guess but it seems like they're allowing you to swap this coin for dollars at any time but it's something you'd have no problem keeping as its own currency since it's pegged to the dollar.  Kind of like swapping Amazon gift cards or something.  An amazon gift card is essentially cash just like this would be.  Facebook would probably need to hold a shitload of crypto to pull this off but this is of course completely centralized and wouldn't be mined.

How do you see that happening, you think people will commonly exchange money in WhatsApp or will it also be something else?

I think the main problem is spamming.

Wonder what the margin requirement will be.  The value at the moment is about $36,000 (5 bitcoins) and it's pretty hard to believe that the CME would allow a lot of leverage on that considering the extreme volatility.  $36k initial margin is very high for a futures contract.

Who decides to start a new forked coin?  If consensus is required by the entire development community, where online and how is that done?

I bought 10 btc at around $120 and it mooned immediately.  Shoulda kept em.

The ironic part is that if no one wants to spend their bitcoins, it devalues the whole idea.  We need transactions that aren’t just for speculation.

Thanks, I’ve read that it’s tied to your private key, it just seems like there is no way to actually confirm this until you transfer to a different wallet.

How can you tell if you've been credited with Bitcoin Gold if electrum doesn't display it?  How do you transfer only the altcoin to another wallet?

Who asks you if you're selling any bitcoin right now?  My guess is that it's either a neophyte who knows nothing about it or someone who wants to buy it from you.  No one is selling, it's a pretty fascinating bubble we're in.  It will eventually burst but who's to say it won't pop until it hits $100,000?  There's no way to know.

Dorian Nakamoto claims to have zero involvement, which seems unlikely to me.  Nick or Hal could have randomly picked his name out of the phone book but you’d think they would have picked some fake name, not the name of a real person who lives close by.  The odds of it being a coincidence (this guy just happens to have the same name and lives by Hal) are basically zero in my opinion.  I think the simplest theory is that all 3 of them started it but why they decided to use only Satoshi’s name may remain a mystery.

Nick Szabo is obviously Satoshi.

As I understand it, new bitcoins are mined everyday, right?  If so, why do people say the supply is fixed?

Thanks, is there a specific reason for the number 21 million?
