Because other than Avalon, who were very sold out, when BFL first offered preorders, nobody else was offering one. And BFL seemed somewhat legitimate at the time because they had existing FPGA miners.

By the usual news.com.au standards, that's not a bad article...

A single precision floating point value has 6 significant figures so I'd say it scans the QRCode, which gives it text, then converts that text to a single precision floating point number type, which it then uses.

I'm not going to link to them directly, but there's another Usenet indexer that doesn't think Bitcoin is too hard.
@_date: 2012-02-22 13:53:27
If they're for interesting and/or amusing things, I really don't mind.
@_date: 2012-11-10 12:45:02
Oh, but it's a *blog*, that's not reliable enough :P
@_date: 2011-10-22 06:55:09
So now they can waste it as it devalues? :P

Hey look, let's have 10 subreddits about the same thing.

1) Fork bitcoin source code
2) s/Bitcoin/WhatEverTheHellElseCoin/g
3) Mine it to hell
4) Wait for exchange to open
5) Sell off entire lot of coins
6) Profit (not even a "..." in sight :P)

This isn't a rainbow table.

Most graphics cards will still run at PCI-E 1x. Either get a riser with a x16 socket on the top or cut the end off it so it covers the first lot of pins.

Well yeah, but then it's just a frontend for an online wallet if you don't. And we *all* know how secure and safe online wallets are, right?

And if the majority of people don't care, it'll be downvoted and you won't see it.

But, if they're shipping it physically and have a tracking number then you won't automatically win the PayPal claim.

I'm not trolling. I have 30BTC in my wallet now, and I sent $25 to the Diaspora project back in the Kickstarter days - and it doesn't even have a properly working prototype yet. In the meantime, Google+ has come out, so the "not facebook" market seems rather well supplied.
Or are you denying that the BTC is devaluing? $3 is a lot lower than the $10 it was not so long ago.

I've just had a look through the iOS developer guidelines - the only one I can see that may pose an issue is: (the initial block chain download running Bitcoin on the N900 gets it rather warm...)
13.2: "Apps that rapidly drain the device's battery or generate excessive heat will be rejected"
That, and this: but just don't include inbuilt links to Silk Road :P
22.3 "Apps that solicit, promote, or encourage criminal or clearly reckless behavior will be rejected"
@_date: 2011-08-20 05:11:15
It's not a serious proposal, it was just a calculation to show quite how much computing power is behind Bitcoin...

Banned from a business's facebook page for posting something they don't like? What did you expect to happen? :)

Ahh, but so say the people who bought in at $30 just before the first price crash. They may have thought they were stupid then, but had they held on for a while...

Symbian isn't safe, because you didn't compile the version of it on your phone yourself. Also, you need to read the source code of everything on your machine :)

0BTC in that address, so it doesn't look like it.

100 000 (a hundred thousand) minus an order of magnitude = 10 000. There's more people than that in this subreddit!

Yep, mining an entire block. Without a mining pool.
(or in a few more years: "wow, remember back when you used to get more from the block itself than the transaction fees" :P)
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:16:47
AFAIK (and if I'm wrong, someone please correct me):
Bit-Pay / Coinlab / the other payment processors could fairly easily refuse to do business with VPN companies at the cost of some very bad publicity.
But in order to actually stop the VPN companies accepting Bitcoin themselves, either *all* of the mining pools would need to agree not to put transactions to the VPNs into blocks, or &gt;51% of the Bitcoin nodes would need to agree not to treat such transactions as valid?
(and neither of them is going to happen, because I'm sure there's an overlap between groups :) )
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:17:11
Bitcoin users not affected? :P
@_date: 2013-04-20 11:58:07


How would you make this so, while keeping the system decentralised and anonymous?
@_date: 2013-05-01 10:36:25
Ahh, but if you can't trust the people who compile binary blobs, how can you trust these people to verify it was compiled from the public source?
