I am down with that. Any amount if we use escrow.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:47:23
I am amazed that this is up for debate. This is 100% bullshit story, no scammer waits on a sure deal.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:03:10
Bye Bye...GTFO! (those listed, not you you :D ) 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:29:41
I know what it takes. Exactly the same fucking thing they got. A fucking budget to advertise, to lobby, to make some fucking noise about it. There are millionaires here more that I have ever seen elsewhere, but sill there is nothing done about marketing, about some income to the developer, about some bonuses for new ideas,  about some incentives to attract debuggers so testing are finished faster....They got Roger with very large pockets. We do as well, if we combine...but we don't :D
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:06:59
Upvoted. I make many small payments everyday, and using Bitpay is outrageous. They somehow take another $10-$14 fee ON TOP of the miner's fee.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:25:20
LOL, what the actual fuck :)))))))))))))))
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:11:29
That is not what I asked. I am paying for some shit service let's say, and the vendor has changed his mind and wants to refund me and cut me ofo, of his service. Then, the only way to be refunded is through that virtual card. Can that card, take the money back?
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:46:07
Answer: No one can take your shit anymore....if that is not incentive, than you haven't lived enough...
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:28:47
LOL what a crappy story!!! you didn't even give a fuck...just put it out there :)))))))))))))))....so I suppose we should feel bad for all those fuckers that they won't get the chance to invest, because their stupid friends was to retard to understand how the tech works and pay the correct transfer fee :)))))))))
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:30:32
5-50% for 100k in the next year...not bad!!
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:21:18
People who knows where to get the info from and still miss informed deserve their outcome...you are talking about mass adoption, not forcing your ideology upon others.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:42:29
I don't trade shit. I bough a shit 4 times already and none confirmed...got ambushed with transactions every time...I am just about to have one confirmation to buy the stupid thing I am waiting for...YOU ARE RUINING BITCOIN FOR ME!!! I don't even care I bought it 4 times :)))))
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:08:10
If by poor you mean if I see a 25k sitting around... I am taking it, no matter whom I'm fighting, then yes I am.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:03:06
Brother, I hope you don't write for a living.. this setup story to prove a transfer fee point, failed to transmit any feeling positive or not. If was just a crappy story...there is no brigading, there is no community, I don't give a fuck about any of subreddits...it was just me, calling out a bulshit story, with no substance whatsoever!!
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:01:17
Don't worry, you lost it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:38:20
Finally some great news!!! Get the fuckers out of sucking the people's power!!!

Duuhh!! Silly me :D
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:16:26
I would SOOO love some bank giving me a loan...any loan...fuck even $100. LOL...I gues that is why we are not allowed in civilized countries :D....I mean the bank is giving you money...free money!!! BETER than the fucking airdrops... Why in the world are you paying the bank back? What are they gonna do?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:27:27
Good!! Newcomers are ruining bitcoin for me. I don't give a fuck about the value, I just want people not ruining bitcoin for me. Stay the fuck out if you complain about a $20 or $100 or $1000 fee for the only thing on this planet NO ONE can take from you!
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:39:09
LOL, I was sarcastic. Your transfer was instant, just not instantly confirmed...sometimes it takes days if there is intense activity on the network. You have the money, just can't do shit with them until it's confirmed. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:47:28
wait what? what the fuck??? this gets better and better...can't make this shit up :)))))))))))) Can't wait for all these to stop hopefully in a month or so, and sell them to the highest bidder 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:00:52
I'll give it to you, if you promise you'll give back
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:32:07
LOL, what?
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:27:52
Yeah yeah, I know...us in a third world country don't give a fuck about your countries either...
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:54:39
I'll buy it. Do you take PayPal? :D
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:42:42
Can't beat this answer :D
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:18:18
Yes, now it's the time....and stay the fuck away...all you new comers are ruining bitcoin for me...
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:25:18
LOL, thank you for your future money. Also great formula of becoming a millionaire. have $100, get 100 times x100 and that's it. Don't know how I missed this.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:00:02
I will manage getting the coins, you manage getting your currency out of your country.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:43:14
:D I won't even comment on this. USA much? I think Roger doesn't even have usa citizenship. Also misled hmmm... I personally like a good con when I see one :))))))))). I keep my bch stash that I got for free specially as a hedge against Roger's actions. Problem solved (for me :D)
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:45:39
I'm down. Where do I sign?
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:52:18
LOL, the fuck was that!!???
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:41:11
Different people have used this guy. I have been following him. Seems legit to me, thinking of contacting him soon.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:38:24
Don't hold it against me..I just need just a little bit of you to sit the fuck down..I am just about to get confirmed with one of the 4 transactions...I just the need the one but hey....like I said, you are ruining bitcoin for me.... chill or something!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:31:42
I have my jets cooled. And yes, I thought you're advertising (actually I still think that)....but seeing that you consider my situation an isolated case makes me think you are just a bad advertiser...
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:32:36
LOL, what? How come I am poor all of a sudden?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:09:02
LOL, upvote this shit, well written! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:34:03
I was talking about your new friends investors that would have not invested having your bad experience (according to your crappy story). Every time a try to use this shit like a currency, the price jumps and I get thousands of transaction over mine, coming from all the newcomers fearing they are missing the launch. Leave bitcoin the fuck alone. You are ruining bitcoin for me!!!
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:33:28
FUCK YEAH!!! You are excused!
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:33:55
What the fuck? Get you head out of your ass!!! and google before making a fool out of yourself!! Look around in Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria.

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:34:06
LOL, Loved the manipulation there...Smart girl but....LOL WT actual fuck? Does this shit still works... like...I'm not saying that you're stupid, BUT....do you always choose to start an argument that way? No serious person will ever treat you for real...and the analogy? Really? American cars? and cars that are successful only in USA? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:26:06
I don't make distinctions. If there's fucking, I don't care where you're from :D
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:35:20
I will buy this coin....all the Balkans probably :D
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:27:28

@_date: 2018-01-08 14:23:15
Websites do not matter. Everybody that is in the space now, is already informed. Mass adoption means old school advertising, because old school has not adopted yet....or wait for the fuckers to die :)))) So..tv channels, land line phone calls /s :)))) and the good old lobbying around politicians, because regulation is starting to be aggressive compared to adoption (100% my view only)
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:13:04
I can keep them safe for you...for a fee of course.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:19:58
Yes, I have heard from multiple sources that coinbase has lost a large amount of eth

@_date: 2018-01-06 00:38:22
I see you keep making that assumption..what do you mean by protecting someone?
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:58:48
at the payment link, add after invoice(s) "-noscript" and hit ENTER .. And not dead, but dying.

@_date: 2019-07-17 20:42:51

@_date: 2018-01-05 20:44:26
A few weeks after? Who the fuck waits that long to steal from an address constantly checked. You have to have some balls to sit and wait for a much bigger chunk.

@_date: 2018-01-09 22:32:29
I cannot afford that. People is so stupid Roger's plan might just work. Getting some change from a shit coin is not enough of incentive for me. PEOPLE FOLLOW BCAHS EVEN AFTER an informed opinion....!!!
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:43:49
LOL, what??? :))))))))))))) what in the world?? :))))) they'll also what??? :)))) the fuck is wrong with you people...my question stands: the fuck are they gonna do. The most I would allow is to let them ask me nicely for the money back. :))))))))))))
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:28:44
fuckem. I can sell you those at half price. but money upfront (yes scam)
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:12:34
no way someone can sit on that amount for that long. I call the story bullshit!!!
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:38:33
let me rephrase. there are no legit sellers on gift cards, with discounts. the legit sellers will not give discounts, but trade on a premium rate, meaning, not only that you dont get discount, but you pay a higher price/rate
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:24:22
that guy did just that. this was is a scammer
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:07:41

Dude, I can afford and am willing to pay any fee...I cannot afford bitcoin not working...People I buy shit from don't take shit coins. Outside cryptospace there is just bitcoin....You jokers thinking any coin can buy shit, have been around to much these forums. Outside this space other coins have ZERO value. Not talking about 2-3 dark markets spaces that are starting to accept alternatives...

@_date: 2018-01-06 15:06:39
What if I am being refunded for whatever reason. Can the virtual card take the money back after a payment is sent/processed?
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:51:44

@_date: 2019-07-18 18:01:15

@_date: 2019-07-17 14:07:35
definitely scam
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:39:37
I have no sympathy for your problem. A real alpha, next warren buffet would not cry for his mama, but take actions, matter into his hand. Fucking ego on you with your fucking millions. Try pee standing, see how it feels for a change.

@_date: 2019-07-18 18:02:41
personal advice: sell drugs via dark web, and get paid in bitcoin. I assume at 16 you know a dealer or two.

@_date: 2018-01-05 22:54:03
Not everything is about the money...it's just a cool story, a nice possible scam idea, but a bullshit story nonetheless. We are not talking about 1 dolar....Your extreme analogy makes is so inaccurate. It's not 1 dollar. No matter how rich you are from scamming, 25 k buys you a nice apartment, not just a sandwich...
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:42:11

Fuck, don't listen to these guys. If she left because you had the balls to follow your instinct, she does not deserve a strong character. If she things a man in her life should be someone she can keep in check, just to preserve the present wealth, and not taking any risks, then this is what she's gonna get...a lemon. Chill...buy some of it back in, and go live your life, start over, it's worth it.

of course one retard hoping to have his life changed. this is how a poorly scenario makes money, and then the fucking scammer thinks he's any good. people like you, encouraging stupid scams. I love a good scam, but this is retarded, and you sir, are a clown for hoping to get free money.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:43:24

@_date: 2019-07-17 18:01:59
you heard people not being able to withdraw and you ask me why do I say that? are you retard? what are you thinking, that is not gonna happen to you? that those guys did something to deserve their money being seized?

@_date: 2019-07-29 05:35:31

Same here...simply cannot move large amounts without a test.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:45:22
that's the spirit ms millionaire. you see, money isnt anything, being the best trader in the world also means shit, when you have to call your mom when violence starts. Testosterone is a hell of a substance, you lack entirely of. Next time you yell how great are you and how many millions, think for a moment people like me, just waiting around the corner to take your lunch money. Lucky for you, you are just a poor fuck (for my standards) with a too bigger ego.
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:03:03

yeah...this happened to me as well...learned my lesson...never buy id from dark net, the fuckers sold them to 100 persons before you. Chances are ... well...you know...
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:33:37
and you are not smart enough to pull such a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:18:51
oh, ffs!
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:36:17
Same fucking boat. Also, I got such a nice fucking number, it'll just ruin my bag :D:D
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:27:48
give me your id front and back and 3 days, then you come back here after you find out about the damage I caused, and tell the world about issues  blown out of proportion.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:25
fire up a joint, chill, open a bottle of wine and enjoy the show...all the coins are dropping, just consolidation, and some big guys(aka cunts) looking to scam noobs...

Hey, if bitcoin increases blocksize, what is happening with bch? Wouldn't it be just the same?
Edit: and yes, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, and yes, today I it is the first time that I started to worry about fees, cause I make lots of small transactions every day....but hey, I am willing to pay the price every now and then...I consider it support...Edit 2: My question is serious. I mean...would bch be destroyed if a few developers decided to increase this block size? I love to have bch around cause they were free and it's a nice way to not care when Roger is being stupid...but if the only thing that keeps bch alive is a developer decision to increase it...which might seem possible considering the pressure they get...this might make me REALY rethink my portfolio.

If I were you I would not make a living from profiling...I don't know what got you so mad you shithad, but your reply put a smile on my face...masturbates too much? I just watched your history replies LOL...you are dealing with some serious anger issues my friend...go get some pussies....you made it, you are the only millionaire in the space, you made it, only your coins got valued...now take some steps into loosing that anger man...you know .. take your own profile advise or take mine...just relax somehow...and trump? why the fuck do I care about trump??? you think all countries are fixed into watching American dramas?

@_date: 2017-12-25 03:32:54
Push the tabs, there is something called advance or something, were you are able to copy the address
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:30:16
you're welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:02:39
Hire some guys on bikes. You order a crypto biker. A guy on a bike comes and takes the money and delivers the packet to the exchange. Done...also mail the fucking paper if you need to....if the war is that big...fuck it, go to the exchange's entrance by  yourself and deposit it...a bag of cash....
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:37:06
LOL FUCK YEAAH!!!... I'm with you brother!!! Wait, what???? :))))))
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:17:17
For me, when I have chosen copy, I remember now it was the address. What it wasn't intuitive for me, was the fact that I didn't see the actual address, and I ignored the copy part, since I am used to manual select and memorize the last digits...so that was my confusion...but definitely, the copy tab got me to copy the btc add.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:44:27
you're missing roger
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:01:19
Cool gift. Lucky man
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:57:34
he is
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:51:54
Every fucking thing!
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:40:45
It' s not intuitive, it took me a few minutes to figure it out, but for sure I had the same problem, and for sure I pressed a tab that allowed me to copy the address. Just can't remember exactly how, since I don't have the window in front to see..
EDIT: Also I read the amount has to be bigger than $100 now. I paid before this policy...only about $75
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:46:15
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:41:25
And what if I end up being the only stupid fuck around here that listens to you, and the rest of the world doesn't care, and I miss a good entry point? How can you give such terrible advise? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:01:03
No. Yes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:17:30
LOL, wait, what? Can I please borrow your magic ball? 
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:02:01
nice scam. hope you get some retards.
@_date: 2019-07-24 10:58:11
chill, you know to little to have someone explain everything in short notice. understand that you havent lost the btc, if you have the 12/24 words. If you had a password, that is called the 25 word. You will need to play with setup (when restoring) until you are given the option the put that password.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:20:13
Fuck that. I care. The only reason I have EVERYTHING in bitcoin is because of decentralization.
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:27:31
and the company is...?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:25:35
I would rather say ALSO the stock market, as in cumulative

@_date: 2017-12-25 14:33:05
dude, hurry up, you fucked up on your title index page. It's just an "a"...hurry up and modify it, otherwise you will scam shit for today!!
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:41:07
oh, ffs! again: you want profit, you risk.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:48:57
leave the guy alone, don't start his trend again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:18
I am having the same weird vibe. If there was an in fight between btc and bch one should rise against the other.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:27:47
which wallet you use for those 2?
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:04:05

@_date: 2017-12-28 17:37:24
:))))) :)))))))))) :)))))))))))))))))))))) bitcoin was drug money for 5 years....just because USA and some media guys said so. Can you imagine front line news about monero financing terrorism with no option to follow the trail? :)))))) Let me see what serious money would follow....I think pseudo anonymity it's the best we can hope for, until these fuckers wake up...and they will

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:58:47
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:36:00
right, cause you never thought at the scenario where bitcoin is being left alone just because it's traceable. You expect governments to be ok with monero? LOL. If monero gets to much attention it's the first to exit :)))
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:35:37

Yes, equihash
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:04:14
No, cause is broken. You said 12 k
edit: Or are you assuming a future "I was right" based on the thing that it will drop another 2 k in the next days...because...crystal ball...right?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:29:56

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:04:10
LOL, what? A bit stoned right now...and not my native language....wtf are you talking about? are you talking about me in particular...htf is a trader? I don't give a flying fuck about trading. Before hand? Did I say it will not get lower? I said relax...I am talking from experience...relaxing is much better than being a cunt? don't you agree mister big guy?
edit: I have been relaxing when it dropped from 1200 to 200 and stood there for 2 years...so yeah...my experience of relaxing and not carrying about some f looking to spread FUD is the best advise I can give...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:18
Agreed...people jumping ships now, will jump of the bridges later.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:12:33
I was sarcastic about the uber bike...I already did the mail the money thing...works ok.... My country (3rd world) is using localbitcoins almost exclusively. So, if it comes to it, if there is a need, there is someone to fulfill that need.
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:21:58
YES! (on so many levels)
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:05:18
why not? and does it seem that I agree with that stupid shit you just said. are we talking about another etf or are we talking about this one and the 03.11 limit? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:50:33
Something the OP doesn't mention is he wants a fix that will not erase his wallet. He does not have access to his seed.
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:21:03
That is something I can agree with. But up or down 10% for me at least, is no news. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:53:39
So you were expecting people here to tell you the only result in buying bitcoin is wealth increase....
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:15:34
This. Is there an official statement?
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:10:29
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:58:37
It depends on the strain...yours definitely is good shit.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:46:35
Mother of God...I admit I am drunk as fuck, but I read your comment 3 times and I still get you recommend using a new one.
EDIT: There you go, I get it now. My bad.
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:56:01
Calling it something different with minor tweaks makes it just that...something different.
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:12:50
What is the way?
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:05:10
There are 2 options. Either you are blocked, you can check on your username's profile how many persons blocked you (if any). Or that person had the ad active only for trusted traders, which you are not.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:52:54
Answer: All the intelligent people :D
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:14:34
Dear bitcoin adresss,
Please send me some bitcoin!
Or....the same way you would request a bank account to send you some money :D
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:56:34
I think wanting to stay under the radar will get you markups, there is no magic way...
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:10:05
right...cyclical fundamentals...I forgot about those. LOL. What the actual fuck?
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:49:28
This. I think next is localbitcoins. It's the equivalent of a real ban. There is never gonna be a bitcoin withdrawal option. But if they do come back just as they were, with no limits whatsoever, that would be a much bigger news than etf, and the price will go up.
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:05:11
Thanks God with of few of you that can read charts ... better than crystal ball..
It's such a simple outcome, you need no education for this: if ETF is approved the price goes up, if it isn't it goes down. Nothing will move in any direction until that result.
EDIT: grammar ... I think
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:41:04
lol, educate yourself.
EDIT: ok, small tip: there is no down the road. 03.11 is the limit
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:09:00
Oh, sorry...your argument/explanation now makes total sense. I didn't understand. /s
Pro TIP: invest that money in education, it will help you much more in the long run, and you won't care about price fluctuation ;)
EDIT:  Ok, ok...let me actually answer this: THERE IS NO CHANCE IN HELL bitcoin price will flop!!!
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:40:30
no, I don't mother f!!! stop trying to manipulate to getting me to agree with stupid shits!!! They were able to get a good job on Blockstream as a result of making a name in this business by developing bitcoin. Like I said, this is their only incentives. To make a name in this domain, so they can make a good living. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! It's pretty stupid to assume the bitcoin developers should earn money on their second job as auto mechanics..."don't you think"???
And people complain about Roger because he is a f'tard that most probable didn't see the inside of a school. I mean being a bully with lots of money does not always guarantee success..."don't you think"???
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:51:43
Fingers crossed, this is the last year for EU.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:35:01
LOL, wait...what? instead of a factory reset you recommend buying a new ledger? You should really stop replying shit!!
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:48:14
neah...there are too many eu countries that complain already...tooo many...all it's needed is a simple election of someone that promises them out of eu control and a better living, or a referendum...and these are things that cannot be postponed. You can see this is already happening...personally I believe this is the last year they will have any real input/decision.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:18:11
Agreed and upvoted!!!
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:59:42
That is sad news. I ordered 4 types of drugs and lots of alcohol. I had my freak on scheduled for 11th.

what friend? I don't give a F about that guy's money. just stating the obvious...if a kraken's customer lost money because of cloudbleed, a service used by kraken, then it's kraken's fault.
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:03:20
I hope this is sarcasm, otherwise you soo stoopid
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:16:30
you know why you don't think? don't make me repeat.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:09:40
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:18:59
nothing kraken could have done is not the same with not kraken's fault...I hope you with me on this one ;)
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:22:01
It's called being a cunt
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:38:39
you stoopid!!1 who the f is we? Mixing mandatory payments into this is THE worst thing that can happen. Chill a minute and think at the ramification of your proposal.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:30:19
I hope people don't concentrate too much over this and forget all the things Coinbase did over the years against bitcoin. They were cancer long before this move.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:49:14
you soo stoopid
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:51:11
you really stoopid....

I must be gettin' old. I cannot do this every weekend. I choose one type and stick with it. With alcohol, anything goes :D

Piece of shit....just before the etf decision...
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:37:59
lol, not kraken's fault? wtf??? at most kraken should take it up with cloudbleed, but if a kraken's customer lost money due to poor choice of service on kraken's side, it's kraken fucking fault....
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:10:49
me? no...don't be stupid ;)
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:13:26
the war is won, you are just slow to process the outcome.
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:34:17
I am afraid reasoning at that point is not an option, and you'd be much better having access to your bitcoin than to risk them not believing the technical part. You do not want the robbers think you'd rather lie to them to keep the bitcoins and not your fingers...you know the drill...from the movies bro...
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:53:59
trezor, no doubt
@_date: 2019-03-04 13:08:35
trezor, no doubt.

I will need everything I have no matter the result. But mostly I expect rejection and that needs to be neutralized with lots of "good stuff"
@_date: 2017-03-06 11:08:03
of course...now that you mentioned that they have to work also for some money, because..you know...the f'ers eat...the nerve on them...now everything makes sense....so they do earn money on their second job?!!? thanks for enlightening me
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:41:03
yeap, I was one of them. also bought at 20k
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:04:08

da fuck are you talking about. We are the older generation.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:07:30

The war was won on "then they fight you", in 2017. I dont give a fuck about this community or any religion. I am just well informed. Some people process the outcome slower. Or if you really want me to rephrase, we will win the war, it's inevitable, there is no possible other outcome. The win became inevitable in 2017. Now, it's just action-reaction unfolding.
@_date: 2019-03-04 13:37:18
the fuck with your laptops bro, the people that will come after you will definitely know you have bitcoins, and then it's just a matter of how much munition you have for your AK 47's
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:55:20
@_date: 2019-03-31 12:03:47
Doesn't history teach us anything? We will never teach older generations new tech, especially at this rate. We are the older generation. This is how things work. The first generation that gets the tech is the oldest.
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:44:50
Do your own research, you talk a lot, but you are missing important facts. You are taking about a time line. That is not important. You are talking about mass adoption but the ones that understand the tech, already benefit the freedom the mass will have in 100 years. I am talking about only one possible outcome. The war started in 2017, muscles were flexed.
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:27:19
Where do you live?
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:02:25
Taking care of your wealth and be the only one with power over it, is important business. if you do not have a few hours to educate yourself, banks will still be around ... you know, for the sheeple.

Coinbase is a bad actor, has been for a long time. If you like the freedom bitcoin gives you, you should consider NOT using Coinbase
@_date: 2019-03-15 23:15:16
You get shit...sorry...I was born in a 3rd world country. When the rules of that place were not good for me, guess what...Your incapacity to move in places where bitcoin can easily be exchanged (if that's your biggest problem) is not bitcoin's fault. You are a slave, you were offered financial independence. All you have to do is "get all that" If you can't profit now, it's because you get shit...
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:26:39
lol, no
@_date: 2019-03-01 12:25:52
1)good but always cautious.
2)low entry point that gives the fuckers who woke up later a second chance
4)If you ask that question you don't really need the answer.  lots of info out there.
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:14:35
...maybe re-read my last comment. if you understand what bitcoin is, and what it does, not just from tech point of view, you can benefit the freedom NOW...those who don't adopt early, will benefit it later. you seem to read a lot and understand shit, just like you did with my last comment.

They are here, now. you are taking about commodity, not freedom. Freedom is here, NOW. You are looking for business to accept bitcoin directly...that is commodity. Be the only one in charge of your wealth ... that is freedom.

@_date: 2019-08-18 09:53:03
agreed. but there are people with long list that will come to my help, they just copy paste it here (give it a few hours). But here goes. I will list the FIRST shit CB did. This one is well forgotten. If you dont like Roger's bitcoin dot com being used to sell bcash, if you dont like that type of scam, you shouldnt like CB either. When you think about Coinbase, you should not imagine a copmany. It is a term mentioned in the whitepapaer. The same thing blockchain do info did (which had a serious propaganda...there was a time when everyone that mentioned blockhain, was thinking about that stupid company).

You might love to be advised by smart people, but you and your gold cheering shit, belong to the past, and quite frankly the only way to get rid of dumb asses like you, is for you to die...you know along with all the dinosaurs. knowledge, at this point in your life, won't help you. You already failed ;)

just retarded... life failed you, I am sorry...of course that was just an example that was meant to show you your analytic thinking puts tags on people with minimum (if none) info, considering your reality is everyone else's. what if I needed btc to be purchased anonymous (you know, for drugs), and the only way to get that was using payment methods that come with premium rate? What if I was not from NK but still took an online job that was paid in amazon gift card? What if I am not from NK, but still from a country that is unbanked, or limited by USA restrictions, and still cannot use regular exchanges?
@_date: 2019-02-17 05:55:41
Haha I know for a fact you shitfaces traders on lbc, are using identities to open bank accounts. You actually fuckers ask for pictures in the exact same format you need to open the bank accounts. I had control over a new identity. I had verification with 4 traders until one of them actually proceed to to trade. After a week debit cards from all over the places were being sent to the ID's address.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:07:43

@_date: 2019-02-17 07:07:23
I know what you meant...where is the explanation? Blubbering words just for the sake of reply?  Your statement was speculation. I for one if I state that the greatest function for bitcoin is non seizability or store of value, or whatever other real function bitcoin has, I'd be able to back my statement. Where the fuck is your explanation?
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:56:43
I'll let you have final word. We already established in other comments you have so little going on in your life now, if this brings you pleasure, who am I to take that away from you?

This is the point where you're either insane or haven't done your research. I am not comfortable with people having a say in what I do with my money, where I am allowed to spend it and for what. I am not comfortable with people having the option to seize all my shit if they find a way to.. but hey, that's just me
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:27:46
What if I live in NK, and to get some money I took some online jobs, and because I cannot use a bank account, I was paid in amazon gift cards, and because amazon does not send to my country, and no regular exchange would accept them for btc, I had to used P2P exchange and accept a premium rate, wich is only normal for payment methods such as paypal and gift cards?

how it's possible? hmm...I keep getting shit fiat, and for me it's a too big of a risk keeping that shit. so every time I get fiat I change it immediately to btc no matter the price/rate.
@_date: 2019-02-04 02:14:02

first day I read about it was $1200, bought a fuckload, all my money. Next $200 came. Took loans from every banks that allowed me to walk in (with the intend of never paying back), sold house, car and bought btc (few months after discovering btc). I never had a doubt, nor did I ever expected it to rise. It took me a few months to understand what btc meant for the world. I am just sorry I wasn't in earlier, that is my only regret.
@_date: 2019-02-16 14:16:53

I only do great moves. I sold 1 house and 3 apartments, cars, and went all in when btc was 200. I bought every fucking time no matter the price. Come back when you start browsing catalogs for private jets shopping, then maybe I'll accept your advice.

Not selling anything. Having the value combined on all bitcoin's babies is the best option...I think. At the moment btc is down, bch is up, combined, the value is the same as before. So...lazy it is...I don't even know how to claim them.

it's nothing technical. If you're a sane person you'd never sell btc to fiat ... assuming you did your research and understand bitcoin and more important understand fiat.

how does it fell to win the clown of the year award?  of course, that award is well known only in small circles... we see you going back and forth with your comments in the reddit community,  maybe you get some acknowledgement...well if that is your end goal, then you are doing a great job. No need for you to shill, the award is yours. Good job.  Next step, convincing your mom to let you cross the street by yourself....yes, we understand your handicap and at 35 yr old one should be allowed to function by his own, but don't blame it on your mom, she only wants what's best for you.

@_date: 2018-02-11 20:25:06
I had to read it twice, I give you that. I don't know what you mean by 100% crypto, but yes. I use sometimes cash for shits I don't really need, but you were suggesting to move back in forth my wealth, and that's not gonna happen. And again with the whales conspiracy. I am in all the whales clubs, at least the good ones. There is no single entity here. Different people, different interests, different groups. You are suggesting again, being a whale gives you the means to manipulate the price, but you always find another whale, with a different agenda, and you got yourself a nice war, you weren't ready for. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 12:47:07

because you are either retarded, or trolling.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:32:22

@_date: 2018-02-04 10:01:16
Lol, I just saw I have responded to your post. You are the same stupid fuck. I had a good laugh at you post. At least I know you're not stupid, you just want to buy cheaper. But common, it's like you're not even trying.
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:46:59
I am 100% in btc not crypto. I also kept all the coins from the forks ... but I don't count those as anything. Everything else you wrote is pure shit, and I counter - argument(?ed) above already. You are just too slow to understand. There is no single entity. Trying to manipulate the market is pure gabling (even as a whale), because you will always find another group with a different agenda. It's a whale on whale war, not a whale on you $100 investor war.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:17:23
Let's also talk about your logic. By definition, having some coins makes you not a shill? Mouth very absent? I though I was clear about bets, when I proposed a bet I was gonna win and you pleasantly refused. Just because you actually said the words, it doesn't mean my refusal wasn't implied. And just for fun, will you take that bet (the one you proposed) by consulting not a forum with americans majority, but a forum with majority from my country, a place where trust in everything that can be seized is ZERO. So, here we go, I will take that bet for a poll targeted for my country. The same question apply: Would you rather invest in bitcoin or...everything/anything else I think we can put after "or"
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:38:15
LOL, you are the one to talk :))))
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:44:00
It's like gambling, yes, but at your own casino...you know you're gonna win :))))
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:57:54
I have one question. Why would this time be different? If the history shows bitcoin recovers, and there is no reason for this time to be different, the only mistake would be not being able (not affording) to hold(or dl if you like). This being said I felt like a sucker when btc tanked after mt gox hack..it really doesn't feel that way now.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:51:10
lol...wait, what? I thought you are kidding...no way you're that stupid, right?
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:34:57
Dude, don't prepare for anything. You do not belong here. Go make some stupid fiat you can part on, first, then come back when you understand that you invest in crypto only what you can afford to loose.

Are you serious....is this low? :)))))))))))))))))))))))))

you were suppose to reply with a joke of some sort. the fuck you put so much passion in that shit. let me tell you a secret. that entire fork (abc+sv) with all the advertising, websites, twiter and everywhere you'll see that fork mentioned, is handled by 10 persons. yeah...you know them all...they do an ok job in maintaining the illusion that the fork is alive with a comunity behind. no...they're 10 persons with soooo many accounts in management. you won't find an 11th person, I promise you. that's it...10...maybe 7....no sane person would be active in that shit. Anyone who has that fork (still?) it's because the coins were free. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:41
excellent post? some stupid fucks around here, I'm telling you. You mean you don't understand that bitfinex has to hide the connection between crypto and the money flow, from the banks, because...well..I thought it's obvious, but you fucktards don't understand banks wont allow bitfinex to use their service. Therefore they have to hide through different corporations, different continents, different offshores and whatnot. Easiest way in the world? Are you fucking kidding me? It's THE HARDEST, especially when the prove of fiat might lead to bitifnex demise. If the banks knew or found out the money source, then and only then you can say for sure that money is GONE...they have that power...so...please, o please, don't ask bitfinex to prove anything if they say it's tricky...they know better than you how to cheat on the banks....What did Friedman LLP find?....Exactly that...they wanted prove of ownership of those so many corporation holding the fiat in those banks. Most probably bitfinex tried to explain that being to meticulous might lead to the end of their business. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:05:05

my guess, you Americans have traded your privacy/freedom for comfort/convenience. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:10:11
I value fiat just as much as I value your opinion. I ditched that shit long time ago, and never looked back. For me to ever go in government bills, is not an option. And to answer your question, no one got rich by doing that shit on bitcoin. You always have the impression that you are killing it, just until it takes off and you are left assfucked.

fair enough. I will back up. to answer your question, because I have experienced first hand power abuse, and freedom infringement, and when I see blind people still believing governments and banks are here to rescue, it makes me feel sick to my stomach.

hey, I am a whale, and also in the best whale clubs out there. you are full of shit. there was/is no conspiracy regarding your statement. The only conspiracy here, is you fuckers wanting to buy cheaper. But you are getting weaker my brother, you tried to make me understand?? LOL

It was a hype, it was fomo, it crashed, and it will get there again (it really doesn't matter the time frame). The only argument I see so far on al the trolls brigade is that this time is different because mainstream, and if that is their only weapon, then we have a bright future ahead of us.

@_date: 2018-02-09 10:43:43
These guys saw value in 2 different projects that took over the world. To call their statement retarded, without further explanation, makes you...you know...that word you like so much.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:06:23
no, slow guy, not everyone, but again, not your fault. Bitcoin has so many features it might be a smart idea to read about some of the tech.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:10:00
Now, these are some strong arguments. How the fuck is it responsible to invest in something that you expect it do be a total loss? Am I missing something?

In my country, you are not allowed to sell anything for cash (unless is under a small amount). So, If I want to buy or sell something significant, I have to use the banks.

@_date: 2018-02-11 11:05:19
Your kids will blame you for not taking a change TODAY! They will laugh at you for not putting $100 bucks for each of them and give them the bits when they're grown. I am all in since $200 and I am telling you, there is no way I'll sell my bits at $20k. Fuck that I kept every single coin from every single fork/airdrop
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:57:10
I see you keep making statements as you have insider info. Prove that shit, or make a bet or something. But pure speculation just because you are a sorry fuck that sold at a loss and want to buy in cheaper, makes you a shill/troll...and not a good one I might add.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:38:38
What a pathetic fucked up troll. The mainstream theory again? no more grater fools? May I see the studies please? Is the cleaning lady teaching you economics?

I said myself I would go to crypto in a market crash? When the fuck did I say that? I went all in crypto with no crash whatsoever. And by all in...fucker...I mean all in...LOONG time ago. As for your bet. I have another one. Bet you literally any bet (ANY..10? LOL ANY), if you find a person in the Cyprus stock market crash that recovered their money (even if he waited). Also the same bet applies for someone that invested in bitcoin...with all the fucking crashes and volatility, and waited (let's say 2 years), and is not happy about their returns....You see stupid...you keep saying that no one wants to loose 50% over night, by investing in bitcoin, but bitcoin recovers (EVERY time...don't go about this time is different), all is needed is patience...while a good crash regarding stocks, we have history of never recovering...now...those smart investors, are as stupid as you to not know the real facts, or no one is stupid here, and you are just a cunt for trying to manipulate to buy cheaper?

:D Don't be stupid, they tried to keep me in, but couldn't handle me, so here I am insulting shills. I don't care about disagreement, and indeed I tend to have a colorful vocabulary, because growing up I couldn't afford fancy schools, and learnt American English from tv, from the movies...blame the movie scripts I learnt from. If it bothered you, my bad, I retract every insult. All day I met shills like you with the crypto risk/volatility argument, yet you guys pleasantly forgot stock markets that never recovered. Also gonna take a wild guess saying your ignorance about how people think, about profiling, and knowing nothing outside your courtyard is pining you on the USA map :D...

Dude, you are delusional. gone mainstream? Just because many have heard, it has nothing to do with mainstream. Did you bother to read comments about bitcoin elsewhere besides reddit? People have heard, but understanding what bitcoin is?? we are many years away. What they did hear was great gains, and on the next bull run, they will hop in (still without knowing what bitcoin really is). You have lots of "too" in your comment with no real arguments....just lots of too this, too that, like "the American experts". OP says you comment make sense, but I read it 3 times and still don't know what you are talking about. Long pattern that's been going on for years, yet, this time is different? you think btc price went fro 1 k to 19k involving general public buying a few hundreds worth of btc? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:07:53

@_date: 2018-02-10 19:41:57
In my country, you are not allowed to sell anything for cash (unless is under a small amount). So, If I want to buy or sell something significant, I have to use the banks.

WTF? Didn't I just say my take in all this. I come from places governments and banks are not allies but enemies. It's not hard for me to imagine the need to hide the money from banks, inside the banks. A meticulous audit could ruin their business, if the banks find out they hold billions for bitfinex...

you're welcome. define pretty mainstream. you are genuine stupid if you say a bictoin episode in bbt is pretty mainstream (with ! lol) ). Mainstream is when people understand what bitcoin is, not when they hear about it. Yes we know, you want to buy in cheaper. You are not an ass, an ass is someone that is rude and that's it. I am an ass... you are a troll, a shill, you are a person that hides their true intentions, that manipulates, that is trying to harm this space. You know we all can see you post history, right?

:)))) I accept that some whales want to pump and some want to dump, pump and dump will be here forever. What you are trying to promote is that all the whales are in the same boat. You couldn't be more wrong (if you weren't a troll cunt). Different people with different interests. This is exactly why banks couldn't manage to kill btc...they will never be all of them on the same boat. so basically, some sell, some buy, some put walls up, some down...there is never a sure thing it will go down or up...you promote 5k out of your as, based on a dream to buy lower. CUNT

some stupid fuck right there.. didn't have to look much. So...I am going to make a wild gues and say american (with a). Just because everybody heard about it, and so so oohh, so very few bought in...I don't think you even imagine how small that number is....like I was saying, just because of that, the next time there is a bull run, all the money that waits on the side lines together with all the people that got from the media  1700% return will jump in...that will make the present ATH a joke...

I keep talking as you are not a believer? Did you read anything I said, it's the second time you are trying to manipulate this discussion by putting words in my mouth. Can you please re-read the part where I say you are trying to manipulate to buy cheaper? You are a believer, also a cunt for not admitting your true intentions are to create panic, fud. For me a shill is someone that is hiding their true intentions by making  false "educated" affirmations. Also, thanks for the suggestion, it's time for a joint...

sorry, can't help you there, I actually looked for what payza meant, I thought you were trolling. I try not to use 3rd party services, I usually sell directly to cash to not use banks, and when I buy something significant, I have a small condition: the seller must accept btc directly. He can go and sell my bits or do whatever the fuck he wants, but I try not to use third party services that might have a say regarding my wealth.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:25:19

Yes you are. Different persons, different interests. A democratic country that will ban bitcoin will risk not being elected the next round, also will fall behind on that country's development. Some countries might try to ban bitcoin while other are embracing it. There is no single entity here, there no single bad mafia, People can move to places they feel it's in their best interests. If China cannot ban bitcoin, no one can.

@_date: 2018-02-05 11:47:58
Balkans holdl!!  This being said, this fucker: is all about creating fud, wanting to go lower, you can see his history post, his constantly promoting dooms day. Don't worry, real adopters that understand tech, don't give a fuck about this price manipulation. It might take till the end of the year to recover, but we have a really bright future ahead of us. Slowly (unfortunately very slowly) people is starting to hear about bitcoin, and the ones that understand, are starting to buy. The fuckers promoting already mainstream are either retarded, or have never left their mother's basement not to mention, visit other countries (usually americans)
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:46:27
Hey, I don't point finger. I understand you sold at a loss, and now you are a sorry fuck that wants to get in cheaper. You are trying to fud....hey, that's fine also...the only problem is...you are very bad at it, you should change professions, this is not for you. It's like you are not even trying.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:42:54
You have an once in a life time opportunity for a wealth change. You can grab some of these little fuckers called bitcoins (while they're cheap and non advertised) and save them for when the masters values them enough that you feel comfortable (with your new wealth) to part with them.

sucks when you are forced (by law) to keep your money in a bank, but the bank gets to decide what you are allowed to do with it. Happened to me a few long years back. Moved EVERYTHING to crypto that second!!!

@_date: 2018-02-05 20:59:35
you have a low IQ dude. Read it again. I said you are retarded for thinking everyone treats btc like a toy trade. Not because you treat it. You implied everyone is in it for gains. I am in it to escape government. I transferred all my wealth in btc when people now only dream they would have, and I witnessed half of it going away and I didn't blink...it still felt soo soo good, no one could have a say about my wealth. Since then I didn't touch fiat nor I ever will, as long as there's an alternative to that shit you are proud running after.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:06:39
cars yes, bitcoin no..not for another 3-5 years or so...but we all know you are just a fucked up troll.

Hey, there was a time these little fuckers were worth pennies and if you would have had the perspective, a small investment would have given you the gains you say you missed. Just because it feels like you are late to the party now, it doesn't mean it will seem that way 5 years for now.
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:03:47
some sorry fucks with new accounts are brigading again. One new shill account posts, and other shills create fud. This happens every now and then when they feel they can manipulate e few hundreds down... 
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:07:20
That was what I was trying to say. I read comments these past few weeks on blogs and other forums not dealing exclusively with crypto. It makes me feel sick to my stomach, the amount of misinformation spread out there.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:51:43
expensive lesson. you could have traded eth directly for btc...but my guess is, you also wanted a little btc dip, and it back fired.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:13:02
you don't hedge bitcoin...bitcoin hedges you
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:52:39
I seem that way, don't I? Wow, what a great profiler...You understood shit from all of this...pro tip: quit your current shilling job, you are the worst I've seen these days. Some of you have at least the skills to keep a conversation alive. You came out with the final argument. I must be sorry for not selling...But hey, we started all this with you promoting 5k because of all those stupid reasons I have contradicted. Why pick on my sorry ass? Isn't the discussion about that anymore?
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:45:42
Again with the greatest country? now you're just stupid. I know you're just sayin...don't worry, it's not your fault.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:19:38
It's so easy to cherry pick analogies. So because of the terrorism fear, we should renounce our freedom, so we are better protected. I hope to god there are not many people like you, or at least, not young generations...or we are doomed!
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:22:25
sure...not you, for believing in that TA shit working on btc.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:19:28
and now I'm educated...yes...from...not in. hey being a peasant will never be an impediment to enjoying coke and pussy ;). being stupid however...
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:19:33
It's still bitcoin, of course. What else is it? It's bitcoin being traded off chain. It seems that way, only to you, because you have hidden agenda. Otherwise what is it? what are the coins on LN? eth? bcash?
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:30:53
lol, yes
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:33:04
you do know you are part of the retards, correct?
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:49:26
LOL, was just smoking a joint, and thinking, I need much better shit, to digest this.
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:35:21
yeah...not the best sub to try that...people here provided some answers in comments, you can literally write a book.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:23:50
I'm sure you do, big fan...btw, are we talking about the same BTC, expensive af, you know...the one you cry after, every night to sleep, biting your fingers nails, for missing the boat.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:21:32
no and no. it will get back to the sender's wallet if it's not processed by miners
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:23:00
lol. agreed
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:50:53
It depends. If the coins are civilized they will ask: hello sir, are you my master? Are you the master coins?  If the owner says no, go away coins, you are lost...then the'll go back to you. So....finger crossed
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:45:06
you don't understand the reason for high fees? it's to compensate halvings, so the network is secured and no miners run to other shitcoins.
LN usefulness: micropayments, or for people that cant afford on chain transactions. Already explained, you already knew. no need to change anyone's mind. Everyone use whatever fits their needs. You remember 80-90% all of bitcoin that will ever be in circulation, is already in our hands, you know, the ones you try to fuck over, by damaging nodes decentralization, or just as worst, making the network less secure, by cutting the hashpower.
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:39:14
dude...always important where you put it.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:52:28
I apologize for my English. :)))))
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:41:30
right...for a while...until your (yes, this is when you use "your") "some great alternatives" you invested in, kick in. :)))
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:28:28
no one
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:08:07
reading and processing not your best skill, is it? Fast confirmations - higher fees. When it was not an emergency, I waited. Exclusive is the best. It seems to me everyone wants to get on board with this exclusive train. Now, we have LN for the poor, on chain transactions for the  wealthy, and on chain for moving large amounts. How can this get any better?
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:27:28
and the clown of the year award goes to
@_date: 2019-05-25 04:07:21
I did exactly that
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:14:13
da fuck did I just read????
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:42:20
LOL, FFS, I was reading through comments and I thought I was the only one :)))))
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:35:05
yes, this
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:08:54
ohh...feels like 2017...FFS, it's too early...
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:47:48
this, right here.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:46:47
You are a bit retard...never said being poor equals being stupid. I said being poor (needing low fees) and being stupid (not able to learn how to use LN), is a problem. And here we go, with the alternatives: more efficient. astroturfing at its best ladies and gentlemen.
EDIT: also do you expect all of us, who keep 80-90% of all the bitcoin that will ever be in circulation, to put our wealth in danger, for the sake of the the people can't aford to wait? Just because I am rich, means I do not matter? Does it also mean the poor's problems are more important than mine?
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:35:28
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:26:53
refresh. reddit has some issues.
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:12:39
dude, irony is, you cant speak your own language. :)))))
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:57:28
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:08:57
nope...you stupid again...it was suppose to show how stupid you are. the moment I saw POS, I understood where you come from. next bitcoin will always be bitcoin, and... just because you use "foreseeable future" a lot, shows your hope for next bitcoin, at least in an "unforeseeable future"
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:13:48
If you feel LN does not work well for you, because it is not developed according to your requirements, wait a few years for development, BUT DO NOT PUT IN DANGER the rest of wealth, by centralizing the nodes, or making the network less secure, because miners moved to other alts, once halvings kick in.
EDIT: YOU ARE FUCKING ASTROTURFING, not wrong. you know what you are doing. You know what you've been commenting this entire time, you know your agenda. SHUT TU FUCK UP! If you are not in control using LN then tell me who else takes decisions for you, you retard? WHO ELSE??????
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:42:32
Astroturfing right here...so the fees problem..let me guess. bigger blocks? Bitcoin has never been better, and when it was needed to pay $50 to send a transaction I fucking did it. Because you know what? It feels fucking great to be the only one in control. in 2017 I paid many tens of small transactions $10-$20 with $50 fee. When I felt I could wait, I paid less...MU FUCKING CHOICE!!
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:11:35
right...the better question is, do you understand POW?
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:53:07
so, your beef and hidden agenda is with blockstream. but, no...no astroturfing here. I believe you together with all those bchash retards, push the idea that LN is private company (outside entity).
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:47:47
dude, FFS, you should have stayed in school. being a king with almost 2 btc, will not help stupidity. it's you that's stupid, because its tokenomics(? lol) are so strong, no coin will ever take it over. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:23:21
DUDE, wake the fuck up. IT is here, IT has been for many years. IT has been working from the day 1.  I don't give a fuck about alternative financial system. IT IS FUCKING HERE, for whomever want to use it. No need to disable anything, no need to rush anyone, no need to force involve anyone. Whomever wants it, IT is here!!! Ready to use, 24/7. Now, if you cant handle volatility, higher fees from time to time, DO NO ADOPT EARLY!!! Wait for 10-20 years to be stable, then explain to your kids why you were asleep the entire time revolution took place.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:02:13
no, because what he asks for and what you think he asks for, are not the same thing.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:29:17
wow, over 1 btc...now I understand :))))))
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:25:00
my stupid what?
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:01:22
I've been in that place. 2017 was the year I got my dick sucked so hard, by the ones making fun of that strategy.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:25:55
lol, thank you, I thought I was the only one seeing this retard pushing agendas.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:59:12
wait...you guys actually keep that shitcoin? that is not just for show? how stupid are you guys? I mean, yeah... it's one thing to scam people, but to actually invest yourselves in that? :( I lost all my respect I had for you. I love a good scam, but you guys are plain stupid...what a disappointment...
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:35:48
Price you have to pay for being 10 years late to the party.  I would like my wealth to be secured first.  I would like the wealth of my kinds to be secured. I would like a good fee market 10 years from now, so the network is secured just as it is now, if not better. Being poor and stupid is a problem. If you are poor and care about fee damaging your transactions, learn how to use fucking LN. Can't do that? the current financial system you are using is just fine for you. Wait 10-20 years until it fits your requirement.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:00:25
lol, this
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:28:48
dude, where the fck did you get your knowledge from?
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:02:09
bro, I am afraid I have some bad news for you :( ... you stupid...again with all the retards hating on missing the boat, hoping for the next bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:31:55
because blockchain, bitcoin, lambada, DUH!!
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:39:11
have some btc, and then look at retards how they try to fuck up with your wealth, then come back and be the bigger man.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:59:44
BTC has never changed. Some retards, do want that though...LN is no middle man, unless you are stupid, or didn't care to learn about...Don't like LN, want on chain transactions? Manage your transactions, pay higher fees when it's urgent, wait when it's not. Higher fees to compensate for the halvings, ARE A FUTURE, you twat, not a bug needed to be fixed.
EDIT: lots of grammar
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:34:39
that entire sub is really something.
