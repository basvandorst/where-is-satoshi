Well, it's still a crazy idea. :-)  I may be forced to do it, but there are special circumstances involving a trade war affecting where I live.

You need the cash for emergencies and expenses.  Don't box yourself into a corner by putting everything into a single asset class.

That is because the IRS specifically allows that for primary-residence real estate in the tax code.

And while you're there, eat at Sushicat.  
They used to take Bitcoin in 2014, not sure if they still do.  (Some news sites mention both as recently as last month, but they're in Estonian, so I can't read them.)

In all fairness, the contents of my refrigerator are worth more than Twitter.
The stock market hasn't caught up to reality yet, though.

Meaning there was a problem that could make a generated key vulnerable, or meaning "the formatting was a little off so I adjusted the layout"?

Almost anywhere, I would imagine.  You got suckered by SEO and shills.  The exchange I use only robs me of about 3% between fees and an intentionally unfair exchange rate, not 33%.

So?  I bought some BTC over a year ago.  Now I can use it to buy 3X as much as when I paid for it.

Which is absolutely meaningless, because . . .


. . . the decisions made by these "local courthouse or administration"s are what ultimately have the force of law, no matter whether your silly "blockchain" has a "hash" on it that "verifies" your "ownership claim".

is this the same course that is on youtube, starting with   ?

Do a fucking search in this sub, it's been discussed repeatedly.  The Venezuelan police have announced that the use of Bitcoin is illegal, arrested several bitcoin mining company execs, and confiscated their equipment (so that the police can run the miners themselves).
Every post of yours that I've seen is negative.  You're either a troll or so terminally depressed that you can't function normally.

I am wondering if Ethereum has any chance.  I don't think so, but it was the only altcoin that had any real purpose other than "we still haven't taken off so you can be rich by giving the preminers all of your money!"

$7 actually.  I predict that my comment will be outdated any second now, however.
