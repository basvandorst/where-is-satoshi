This all depends on when you got in. If you got your bitcoins for (virtually) nothing by mining or getting in real early, you wouldn't really care if it goes back to $100 since you got them for $4. You can zoom out and look at the graph and at all the fucks you don't give. 
If you got in last week and investerd $5000 which is now $4000 you might feel very differently about this and want to get out because you're losing real money versus the 'no money' the early bitcoin people are losing.

Bitcoin isn't outlawed in China, banks are prohibited to deal in them but citizens are still allowed to buy and sell.


Dutch Rabobank didn't outlaw bitcoin, there was a brief period of time on November 20th when transactions to exchanges from Rabobank didn't work for large amounts. That issue has been resolved in the same day and people are perfectly capable of buying bitcoins with their Rabobank account. 
You'd do wise to read up on facts before you post bullshit.

Then the exchange buys. What tach is saying that for every seller, there's a buyer, otherwise the seller wouldn't be a seller. 
What abdada most likely tried to say with his 'more sellers than buyers' was that there is more supply than there is demand at the moment, which semantically is something different, though we all got the idea.
