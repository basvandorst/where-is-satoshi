It can affect adults too, however the adult form of botulism is usually from ingestion of preformed botulinum toxin rather than direct bacterial colonization in the gut with subsequent toxin production. Botulinum toxin blocks neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction and results in flaccid paralysis (low muscle tone rather than rigid muscles; floppy baby). You die from diaphragm paralysis and respiratory failure if you don't get to a hospital. If you do and condition recognized in time, survival odds are pretty good. You can also take that same botulinum toxin and inject it into muscle underlying wrinkles on your face. That muscle is then paralyzed, relaxes (becomes flaccid), and the overlying skin smooths out. This is marketed as botox.

Does this mean that you think blockchains can't or shouldn't scale to theses levels at the protocol layer if feasible, say with newer technologies? Also I have a question about LN and maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept, but from my understanding lightning seems like it would only be useful for a niche subset of transactions. From what I've read you have to lock up your BTC in a contract and are distributed an equal value of tokens in a side chain. You then transact with these tokens and the final balance is settled once on the main chain.  So let's say I put in 1 BTC to open up a channel with Amazon. I only want to make one transaction now with them which would make opening up and closing a channel for 1 transaction expensive given the fees on the main chain. The other option then is to hold my BTC in the contract for an extended period of time until I make enough transactions for it to make sense to have opened the channel in the first place. Thus I need to plan ahead and estimate a budget for future transactions with companies that use this particular sidechain. This seems like an unnatural way to use currency for me and I worry about opportunity cost of leaving my money in this contract when I could be utilizing it elsewhere. I also think this structure would lead to for example Amazon, Walmart, EBAY, lots of companies using one hub rather than customers having to make this type of estimation with multiple different contracts. This seems like a centralization risk. Could you point out what I'm missing conceptually here? Thanks.

To be fair a lot are or were enthusiasts that disagree with recent changes in direction of development. Many still hold positions even if they disagree with the rationality of the current price or the direction of the project because the crypto wide speculative bubble currently has no bearings in rationality or utility for now, and a hedge approach is likely a prudent one if your bullish on the space in general. That said, I would argue against the prescribed path in this post of burying your head in the sand. Yelling FUD at everyone with an opposing view is a surefire way to not learn anything. Fielding opposing viewpoints in general discourse is healthy for the community. There's a lot of innovation going on in this space. It's still nascent. Living life in an echo chamber will undoubtedly be disadvantageous in all walks of life do to the willful information asymmetry you impose upon yourself.

I've heard of depression and anxiety described as "time relationship disorders". Anxious states result in over fixation on uncontrollable future events, depression on uncontrollable past events. One key factor to happiness is the ability to keep a healthy, majority focus on the present.

I think the DAO format would be great for charities. Tokenize contributions and directly fund groups that submit proposals, elected leadership, open books, less points of access for leeching middlemen. I also think this construct will be revolutionary for trade organizations and unions. This is all assuming the contracts are well audited prior to funding ;).

If they wanted that transaction to be confirmed within an hour or so, they'd have to pay about $5 in transaction fees, so I'd doubt that would be useful for them.

No. There's a reason why no banks will do business with them. There's a reason they haven't provided a real audit since the hack and offered up that hand wave bullshit "proof" of solvency rather than a standard audit. [Signaling theory]( can point you in the right direction on that one. When an entity poses this much systemic risk to the ecosystem they should most definitely be considered insolvent until definitively proven otherwise. You're telling a cryptocurrency community to blindly place trust in a shady, unchecked, unregulated fractional reserve bank with zero transparency. You've really lost bearings on where the fuck you're at or this place really spun out from where it once was.

I'll bite on the snowflakes. Which generation grew up in the post war economic boom created by their parents sacrifice against tyranny, rebelled in their teens because they wanted to get high, still were able to obtain an education and buy a house when their buzz wore off without sacrificing years of indentured servitude, traded their youthful liberalism for greed and systematically chipped away at every good thing they ever accomplished for society, allowed themselves to be completely indoctrinated by the television and tooled for moneyed interests, and then bitch about how soft the children they raised are when they question why they're so content with being fucking locusts? First American generation to exit with a worse society for their children. Congrats, snowflakes. 
Edit: Thanks for the gold! They say society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in. The Boomers chopped down their parent's trees, smoked the leaves, sold the lumber to Reagan, and let the banks poison the soil. Now they ridicule their children as they swelter in the sun. Go ahead call me a snowflake.

K. The article talks about the entire space. "Bitcoin" to everyone outside of this community is an umbrella term for all cryptocurrencies. I assumed you read the article and were addressing its points, but I guess you were addressing a literal interpretation of the 6 word title.

Conflating Bitcoin potential with platform crypto potential. Look at the financial instruments that are feasible now with things like DAI and CDP loans, or what sweet bridge is working on to reduce costs of capital and increase liquidity to all facets of supply chains. For instance tokenizing the deed to your house and wrapping it a home equity loan smart contract @ 0% interest. If you fail to repay at term deed is auctioned via smart contract. No need to rent the capital from a usury agent. Of course diversify your investments but some or multiple iterations of crypto will massively alter the way the economy functions in the future and trying to compare it to gold valuations is grossly myopic.

If you take the ETH hard fork as a historic example, ETH split to ETH and ETC last year. ETH peri fork went from ~$20 down to around ~$10, ETC less than that. Today ETH is ~$200, ETC ~$15. The dynamics around the Bitcoin fork are different so who knows how it will play out. I would definitely want to hold my private keys and have the choice of what I want to do with the potential value created in the forked chain. Why let coinbase make that decision for you and keep any potential value on the forked chain?

Is there trademark on Bitcoin? If not it will probably end up like Ethereum where both ETH/ETC use the ethereum name (along with numerous scams). I agree with you about the inevitability of the hard fork. I think the healthiest thing for Bitcoin is to move past this stalemate so that development can continue without big blockers/little blockers actively sabotaging eachother's attempts to scale. If that means two competing implementations on separate chains than that's still better for the Bitcoin ecosystem than the 3 years sunk into the scaling debate. Can use Ethereum's contentious fork as a model. Short term loss around the fork, continued unimpeded development and rebound in the longterm. Let the best chain win
