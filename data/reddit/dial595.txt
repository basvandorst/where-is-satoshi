aaw man i miss those days. darknet drug markets has gone to shit...
@_date: 2016-11-28 08:42:40
yeah but there are also vendors from the beginning of SR1 who are still there. so there have to be a way and the vendors caught are mostly caught by shitty opsec i guess

haha for real I wouldnt have cared anymore my  friend.
I missed so much opportunities in crypto already, so I stopped caring. Else I needed to kill myself out of selfhate. I had a dozen BTC back when the price was like 12$ and I spent all of them on Silkroad1. And thats not even my most stupid missed opportunity in Cryptoworld =D For some people like me its just not ment to get rich with it.
anyways I still earned a little bit, so I am not mad at all...

for real! I just thought about searching through my comments to a month ago, at the 20k peak, when0 I got downvoted to hell because I said, i am gonna buy when  the bubble bursts and the price is below 5k again :P
aah schadenfreude, my only pleasure in life
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:38:01
Yep but in my case, if I was wrong i would have lost nothing while they bought at peak
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:39:23
when you need cash in reallife u sell some
every other time buy and hold.
except u want to go into daytrading but thats only effective with huge investments und pretty risky imho
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:43:01
lul you think THIS was the real dip? its gonna fall back under 3000$ at least
