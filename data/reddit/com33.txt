Because to "the real world", ONLY Coinbase.com matters.   This isnt an announcement for Traders, who have no problem finding a platform to trade on with low fees.

Id rather not cash out $500, only to pay taxes on it, if the $500 will not help my life significantly. 
Taxes, some people would rather defer them to the next year.  They will need confidence that the 20% gain will sustain though.

Sounds like you are confused. Converting to fiat = taxes if you received gains. Performing any transaction via btc = taxes if you received any gains. This has always been the case and nothing changed  with the recent irs ruling. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:25:43
The same reason merchants accept credit cards. The end result is converting to fiat regardless of transaction medium selected. Period. Re bonus is that people may have btc sitting in their wallet yet do not own a credit card or cash in the bank. The vendor misses out on a potential customer.
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:31:30
Yes and yes.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:55:01

IRS recent ruling changes nothing. You had to track and report gains regardless.
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:17:36
Your post makes no fucking logical sense. Paying for services in bitcoin is no different than paying for them in cash, and vice versa. Same can be said for merchants and stores accepting btc. It's simply another fund. Someone could have 2k in bitcoin but 1.99 in their personal checking. That's why options are good 
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:02:55
Especially when the new irs rules changed nothing.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:44:01

@_date: 2014-03-26 03:54:23
Once again, this ruling has no bearing on how btc was reported and taxed (capital gains). Morning has changed.

@_date: 2014-07-02 23:57:05
Doesnt affect me  - because the price would be the same regardless if I use my Debit Card or Amex card. Amazon for example, can charge whatever they wish, I live in NYC where there is no Walmart and 99.9% of the time its much cheaper anyway.  Also, everything that I purchase comes with a guarantee via Amex. Even if the shady vendor doesn't accept a return Amex will. The same protection applies for all online purchases. Not worth the risk paying and tracking cash.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:36:16

@_date: 2014-02-08 22:56:39
"of being honest..." 
And you being ignorant.  Its funny how we see people complain when BTC goes up and the transaction cancelled.  What about when BTC tanks?  Crickets.
I get it. You are upset because you lost potential, yet unrealized gain as a result of the delay or cancellation. You did not lose ~$100. 
Coinbase has to protect itself from both financial and legal liability. It can refuse to do business with anyone it so desires if it feels the transaction may not be made with legally obtained funds by people with whom it can legally conduct business.
If you are unhappy with the delay, and that's enough of a transgression for you not to use Coinbase again, then that's your decision to make. However, this can happen with anyone as automated and needfully paranoid as Coinbase.
You also need to get over the mindset of day trading with bit coins. Stop trying to day trade with Bitcoin. Coinbases system isnt designed for this function. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:49:15
You had to track and pay taxes on them before the ruling, and after. Nothing changed at all.

@_date: 2014-03-28 03:05:13
and bitcoins were taxed the same way last week, 4 weeks ago, 6 months ago. Nothing changed with the irs ruling. Capital gains taxes applies to any asset - what makes you think btc would be any different? Nothing changed. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:19:05
1) it's not easy
2) not even close. Especially when you factor in change wallets, backups, encryption and local storage. 
3) big name stores accepting bitcoin allows for existing btc owners another place to spend. 
4) big name stores accepting btc improve the credibility of virtual currency.
5) big name stores accepting btc help adopt new users and increase the conscience in the virtual currency
6) quit being a fucking dick

The borrower converted it to cash or purchased something with it. he doesn't care what happens to btc after it was lent to him. The lender does.

We hear "crickets" when orders are cancelled right before bitcoin tanks.  I guess it stems from ignorance. People not understanding that they are dealing with volatile virtual currency and the exchanges have to design around that.

Tldr; nothing changed. Before the ruling we had to track each purchase and pay taxes on capital gains. After the ruling, the same applies.

If you've earned any profit on bitcoin you have to pay taxes on that profit every time you spend it. That's the prob. I also don't know of any retailers offering significant discounts for using btc

I think so, thank you

If it's not there, I'm sure I'll have the option to move it away. I'm not worried about a tiny amount of money. Again the risks are far bigger offline than hypothetical scenarios that cans happen online.

This isn't a issue of quality. Mods are there to to control that. They are automatically banning all quality posts as well. It's also a fallacy to assume that posts are coming from r/bitcoin subscribers.

Confirmation bias. Market had a great year in 2014, which is the end result of just about every "strategy" by amateurs and professionals alike. Unfortunately confirms all of their strategy via "confirmation bias".

That it's virtually impossible to understand how it's taxed. I haven't filed yet because of that. None of the tax preparers I called had a clue.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:51:33
Playing by the books - Selling now and rebuying lower is a taxable event if profits are made plus fees, is that why people would rather hold?

Go take a look. The front page has material that is exposing truths. Not "doing harm".

The attacker will not know that's possible. Which is the point. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:11:17
I'm confused with this one.
A mobile phone would be much less secure due to:
1. icloud / google backups which can be compromised should you're account get hacked.
2. Google/Apple knowing you run the software to begin with.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:26:30
People who are holding: why? We know the value is dropping over the next few days, doesn't it make sense to sell now then buy agajn in a few weeks? Or are you trying to avoid a taxable situation by realizing gains?

Either way you are holding a potential large number of money on your phone. People don't walk around with banks normally, so it's a risk.
