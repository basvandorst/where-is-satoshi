Please explain what that means?

Value is more than monetary assessment.  If the price drops to zero on a house, it can still provide more value that Bitcoin at a zero dollar valuation.  That is why is cannot be compared directly.

You can't compare it to assets with tangible value. That said, there will be a new crypto standard at some point, and Bitcoin is the only crypto positioned to be the standard.

You can’t. That wouldn’t be considered tangible.  
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:10:20
Okay, but that doesn't mean tangible goods like shelter, food, and clothing do not have value.

Not sure how it happened, but now when my wife wants coffee, she asks for covfefe.

Doesn't the Dollar have massive adoption, but consistently losing value?

My point is that dates can be cherrypicked to support the narrative
Edit: Especially since Bitcoin is historically volatile.

No.  Because it highlights the desired growth.  If they used Dec 15th, an opposite story could be told.

Do you recommend Ranch or Bleu Cheese?
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:57:39
Which game?  I feel like I'd like to know the score right now.

It has to be somewhat about making money as it wouldnt make sense to replace money with a volatile currency.   Downvote me all you'd like, but it's not going to be a replacement until it is stable and widely accepted.

I’ve lost hard earned money on hookers and booze. It’ll happen.
