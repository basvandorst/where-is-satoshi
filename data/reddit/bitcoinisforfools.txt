That makes no sense, why would the hash rate stabilize?
Every miner is already running at a loss, except for one KnCMiner which isnt even released yet (and that will still take about half a year just to break even at the current price)

Please give a link to these calculations.
I have looked at the calculators, and even the very latest mining machines are unprofitable when you factor in their cost to purchase. Every one, except the KnC miner I mention has a break even time of 'infinite' - in other words, never.
The hash rate will not 'stabilize' if the price doesn't rise, it will fall as miners stop mining due to financial losses.

What's awesome about breaking even? You don't gain anything.
I calculated that over the lifespan of the KnCMiner Neptune, you would only make ~$2800 - a ~24% p.a. return for MEMBERS price, or 18.3% p.a. for standard price.
Note: this assumes no delivery delays, no fall in price of Bitcoin, and immediately running it from the day it is expected to be delivered, 24 hours every day without interruption.
All other miners don't break even - even ones slated for delivery in September.
Where are you getting this 30% figure from? The difficulty increment on my calculator on that site is set automatically at 12.76%.
As for 'bigger miners get it cheaper', I have used the special price for the KnC miner and not the standard price.
All batches of the latest CoinTerra TerraMiner IV are listed as 'infinite days' - in other words, won't break even at current price

Another misconception about this I read, and should quickly counter:
Someone said that if the hash rate is lower, then it becomes cheaper to mine. Before the difficulty retarget, the opposite is true - it becomes even less profitable to mine, causing a vicious cycle.
Example: Say the hash rate suddenly halves (just an example). The difficulty is the same though, so you have to expend double the time/electricity to get the same reward you were getting before.
So if people were already losing money, and that's why they stopped mining, then it becomes even more unprofitable for anyone who continues to mine.
And who's going to donate money or time to getting Bitcoin over the 2016-block hurdle to the next retarget? Most miners are serious business now, and care more about their financial interests than the interests of Bit coin. They might just switch to an altcoin that allows for SHA-256

So what?
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:42:28
Im talking about about what will happen in the future when Bitcoin mining becomes completely unprofitable and Bitcoin miners stop mining.
Every miner has a limit - they might continue mining and making losses for a month, but what about 6 months? Unless you think the price is going to jump up anytime soon, then this is a serious existential threat to Bitcoin. And theres no reason to believe the price will jump up either.

Have you actually used the calculators though? I doubt you have.
If you don't believe me that all miners are unprofitable, I recommend you search 'bitcoin mining calculator' and click the **third** link, because it shows you all the latest and best bitcoin mining machines and their profitability in detail with all the relevant factors included.
The best miner has an income of 1.2% of purchase price per day, but will take 129 days to break even. All others are 'infinity days'. This assumes an electricity cost of the US average of $0.1165/KwH
EDIT: BTW before I calculated the price at which there is break even ever at all, even with the best miner. This price is $335-$385/BTC.

No, I'm talking about sometime probably within the next few months, when every miner has been operating at a loss for several months.
Miners are already operating at a loss, and I mean every single damn one. Only one type of mining machine, which hasn't been released yet, will recoup its cost at the current price.
If Bitcoin stays at the current price, or falls further, its highly likely miners will start turning off their machines, thus reducing the network hash rate.
