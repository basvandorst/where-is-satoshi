Reasoning?

The market doesn't "prove" you right any more than dice do.
Things are too complex and dependent upon unforseeable external variables. 
If you're going to roll dice, it's better to do it at a bargain, assuming risk of the entire dice game going to hell isn't especially high.

Gotcha. Though I do want to add that money in savings accounts moves all of the time, as banks loan it out to businesses and individuals. It's why savings account accrue interest. I don't know what the actual velocity there is, but for that reason, I imagine it's much higher than gold's.

You seem to be assuming the odds of insolvency are equal to the odds of solvency by default. 
But you might also give a 90% chance Mtgox is insolvent, and only a 10% chance that it is solvent, in which case your investment is quite a bad one indeed. Or vice versa, in which case you'd almost be crazy not to make the bet. 
How did you decide the probabilities?

Don't know why you're getting downvoted. Anyone who's ever tried to pick a lock can attest. The lock is mostly there so that your house doesn't look easier to break into than your neighbors.

So you just break a window. Again, security theater.

You don't need to prove malice to sue for libel.

You probably do if you've ever shopped at Goodwill.

If that's true, I imaging you must be a billionaire by now. If not, what's keeping you? All you have to do is make the right decision each time.

Much of their reason for accepting btc is idealogical/speculative. So I doubt they'll drop it unless it becomes apparent that the coin is going to slowly devalue over time. Which isn't a thing that can ever be apparent because the instant it becomes apparent it devalues very fast over time. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:04:29
Right, which is the problem. You don't actually know that the odds of solvency are above 25%.
Your craziness wouldn't be decided by the reasoning you outlined earlier, it would be decided by how you are determining the odds of solvency.

Not that journalists actually have a strict legal duty of care, but like anyone else they are not allowed to print libelous material. Which is why tabloids often get successfully sued.

Most of the people selling around here don't go &gt; 5% market . . .
But in any case, it's a simple cost benefit analysis. Is the added price worth the decrease in security risk and approval wait time? I should think so. Yeah, you're paying more, but it's for a better service.

In what way is "if you expect ROI and profit" flat out wrong? 
If the odds of something are low, you should not expect it.

I really like it when the tinfoil hat brigade makes falsifiable claims.

Most legal briefings aren't freely available on government websites, you need to pay them some transaction fee for a copy of a legal document. There is a browser plugin people can install to automatically upload to archive.org any court documents they download (benefit for the user being that the plugin will also let them know if the document they're about to pay for is already available for free on archive.org). So, it's not all that weird that this is an archive.org link.

The point isn't their view of bitcoin. The point is their view of what the government thinks of bitcoin.

Again, if ROI is dependent on hitting it during a profitable time, and if the chances of hitting it during a profitable time are low, then the chances of ROI are low. And since the chances of an ROI are low, they should not expect an ROI.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:07:41
I feel like you just made most of this up. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:02:12
I see I see. Interesting. So what evil conspiratorial reasons do you think the government has for expressing positive views of bitcoin in these senate hearings? 
Do you think it's all misdirection while they secretly undermine the system?
And most importantly, how does all of this relate to the 9/11 attacks? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:11:54
Yes. Obviously no one is going to write an article claiming the government is going to try to kill bitcoin on the same day that it says "bitcoin looks pretty cool, actually."
Posted because I think it's important to keep a historical record of how right and wrong people have been about which things in regard to bitcoin.  
And by important, I mostly mean entertaining. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:07:53
You mean he changed his mind and said the government and fed are not actually that actively over bearing and conspiratorial?

Suspicion is not sufficient evidence for abuse. So I think they'd be fine. If it was the NSA, they made a very plausible case that it wasn't, and that's pretty much all they need to keep on keepin' on.
