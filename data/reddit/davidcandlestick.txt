More importantly asdfaoeu, the role of an exchange is not to allow easy arbitrage with other exchanges. The role of an exchange is to allow trade, and the discovery of a "fair" price.
I think both roles are fullfilled with discrete double auctions, better than the current system.

Right Ikinoki, but untill then we might want to limit volatility.

Would love to hear everyone's suggestions on how they would manipulate the bitcoin price, and their favorite conspiracy theory of who could be behind it.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:41:50
Ideally the queue would be large enough to allow for everyone who wanted to add their trade. Everyone gets a single trade as do bots.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:25:22
If I can do price discovery without the arbitrage, then I don't care about arbitrage.
OK I can also get more technical if you want. Take a look at the link below. On p.6 in the middle they cite an article [21] that shows that "for their zero-intelligence agents (see below) the expected eﬃciency of a call market is higher than that of a continuous double auction, and is is easy to verify that this will be the case for other trader behaviors as well."
Call market = Discrete Double Auction. My understanding is that efficiency means finding the price that maximises the benefit to all traders, and discrete double auctions are better than continuous, which is what we currently have. That would means I can do better/truer price discovery with discrete double auctions than with continuous markets. But I am not an economist.

If malicious traders can add any trade they want then you don't know which trades are real so I would extend 1. to:
1. VWAP can be poor metric, and the list of trades on the tape, can be fictitious.
Large stock exchanges are successful, that does not mean they would not be better of with coarse grained trading. Large stock exchanges sometimes have to handle 5,000 quotes/second for a single stock. [ The load there I think is not on order matching, but on the network.
Coarse grained markets need less infrastructure, and thus are more robust (look at Nanex's explanation of the flash crash as an example of what can go wrong: 
Coarse-grained trading eliminates activity near the best bid and ask that does not contribute to the purpose of an exchange: price discovery.
So the question is back to you: Why do you think we need continuous trading markets?

You made my day, thank you so much! This beats the people that were saying about a month ago that the price is going to skyrocket because of chinese interest. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:14:28
A) The bulk of the micro-trades that cause lag are at slightly different levels. You could accept prices at a coarse scale, say only at 0.1 increments, but all I need is two levels and I can send many trades:
Say the market is $150 bid - $151 ask, I can send buy and sell at 150.2, buy and sell at 150.1, buy and sell at 150.2 etc
B) Users dont buy their own order, users create two accounts BobAcct1 and BobAcct2 and trade between those accounts back and forth, that belong to them.
In practise a malicious user could create 100s of accounts on different exchanges and:
1. trade between own accounts on each exchange
2. by making transfers of BTC and cash outside the exchanges
3. by doing normal profit making trades between own accounts and third parties on the exchanges.
4. constantly add new accounts and shut of his older accounts
When potentially tens of millions of profit are involved (last week the market cap of bitcoin went from 2.6 bln USD to 1bln USD) this operation is not hard to set up, and would make detection difficult.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:35:28
Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:30:00
Sounds like before Apr 17 when you did not have funds the order would still show up on your open orders list. It does not say it would show up in the order book.
If it showed up in the orderbook and someone traded with the order, then MtGox themselves would have to pony up the funds which would have been difficult.
The change sounds like a good thing because less processing time is wasted on unfunded orders. I dont think lag will improve significantly because of this minor improvement in processing time.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:22:18
I am not a developer but I think you could hold an auction every minute or 30 seconds and still have all the advantages of the discrete double auction.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:33:17
I think there are other issues besides lag due to bad infrastructure. Take a look at (shameless self-promotion)

Not sure what delayed-execution platform means, do you mean the over the counter markets like  ?
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:44:47
I agree, only the price can be fictional, but I can choose the timing of those trades. If I want to get a low VWAP then I sell stock down to that point (shameless self-promotion: here is how many shares you need approximately:  ), and then print a large trade (or several) like 10,000 BTC.

Hi runeks. I dont have lag data from 4/9-4/10, but I found this image for the lag during the crash. I am not sure you can trust the website where I got it from, but here it is: 
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:57:31
True, if you need to sell right away, this market would not help you, but when would you need to sell immediately? Remember if you want to liquidate a large portfolio say 100K BTC, it will take a long time because you dont want to push the price down so you have to liquidate over a larger period.

Adoption is a hard issue to address. I don't know if a discrete double auction exchange would have many traders.
I don't understand why you think people would make bad trades on a discrete double auction, can you explain?
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:18:49
If manipulation adds volatility to the currency, it makes it harder for people to adopt it: Do you want you salary to be paid in a currency that has weekly 100% swings? Your mortgage? Your kids tuition?
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:00:12
Wouldn't they have to clear trades as well, so MtGox would have to send their clients BTCs to btc-e and btc-e would have to wire money?
Plus in the stock market this is monitored enforced by the SEC. Who would enforce it here? The exchanges would be splitting the commissions so they might not want to cooperate.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:37:37
Cause lag so that sellers can't enter, then send buy orders to clear the book, then lower the lag, and paint the tape at the new level, so that everyone believes the new price.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:30:23
Thank you!

For me amount of trades/min, extra transaction costs are temporary solutions. Discrete trading fixes problems at a deeper level.
@_date: 2013-05-15 06:38:21
They are reducing supply of dollars buying bitcoins, so the price should go down.

Last week's trading exposed several problems with the exchanges, not just infrastructure. Here is how I would deal with infrastructure along with a couple of other problems:
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:13:33
Arbitrage between the price of BTC in one exchange and the price of BTC in another exchange? Why does an exchange have to go out of its way to permit arbitrage? The goal of the exchange is to help the BTC community discover what the fair price for 1 BTC is.
You point with the retail processor is certainly valid.
Retail Bitcoin exchangers can do what FX exchangers have been doing. A small retail exchanger, but also banks take a snapshot of the FX price in the morning and then use that for the whole day, so they take on the FX risk.
If they dont want the risk, they can do what coinbase did to me last week. They can announce to their customers that they will get the price of Bitcoin on Monday at 12:00 UTC.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:38:26
Each exchange could hold its own discrete auction, and each exchange would choose the time for it. They could choose the same time if they wanted.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:13:37
Continuous exchange: ContEx, Discrete: DiscEx.
List of trades:
12:00  100000 BTC trade at $101 on DiscEx, 
12:01 10 BTC trade $100.10 on ContEx, 
12:02 0.001 BTC trade at $99.00 on ContEx, 
12:04 1 BTC trades at $98 on ContEx, 
Would you put an order to sell at 99 on DiscEx at 12:05?
My point is that which exchange give the "right" price depends on volume and on time.
More importantly, with DiscEx and ContEx you have the same thing as before, just a list of trades, and you have tro decide how to trade.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:50:10
Not sure why it would take O(log(M)) rotsor. A trade &gt;90% of the time gets executed at the first 10 best bids or offers, so you dont have to search through the book.

That is a good question oep4, if all orders from the DDA exchanges are cleared together or separately at each exchange. The same question applies to continuous markets as well, when on MtGox the offer is $109 and on btc-e the bid $110 should they trade against each other?
The quick answer is that the amount of coordination and infrastructure required renders it impractical.
The long answer is that I think the US stock exchanges had the same issue and introduced a series of changes called Reg NMS ( to create effectively a single exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:25:39
Because at DDA you know you are not gamed/tricked by someone like Bob who is painting the tape, or trying to cause lag so that the best bid and offer that you see on your screen are not actual, but are from 10 minutes ago.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:23:11
Your take is very interesting. I agree that if you send your order early you are at a disadvantage vs someone who choses as late as possible. But everyone has the option of trading late in the bidding cycle so everyone is treated equally.
A cool down period after bidding might be a good idea. Like in the continuous case you definitely need to escrow funds from the time the order is submitted to the time the trades are announced.
Even if all traders get stacked to the end of the period, it is different than continuous trading because the book and quotes are not available at the time you do the trade. So you can't play all the games that depend on knowing the book before you send the order. My goal is to eliminate these games, which are not productive.
Do you have a reference for a source that describes "many weaknesses in the real time world of the web" That would be a cool read!

Yesterday I proposed discrete trading to eliminate high frequency trading and some of the ways people maniputate the price of bitcoins: 
You say: "the speed at which you could trade [is] very important to the user". Can you elaborate on "important". Important for what?
