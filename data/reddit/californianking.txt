@_date: 2019-07-21 09:17:55
Sounds like a indian ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2019-07-22 08:40:57
I'm genuinly confused why the hell they thought they could rob a BTC atm.. It . has very little cash, and why tf were they armed? What is it gonna do, resist?
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:49:52
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:08:57

@_date: 2019-10-28 07:08:40
That's where you are wrong. It is the classic pile of bullshit pattern.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:13:53
Nice try Indian scammer. Ffs stop using kindly. Do your own research why trying to scam people.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:52:18
Found that out the hard way.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:54:39
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:27:24
There should be
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:49:24
You do realize this is a scam right? The fact that people with broken English are talking about how good it is makes it even fishier.
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:10:36
Lol true
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:51:17
Considering converting my eth to bitcoin

@_date: 2019-06-23 09:10:06
4.35 in Palo Alto...
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:30:22
Only invest what you can afford to lose. Just HODL it. You got a lot of FOMO but man up and buy it that’s what I did.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:16:23
Ok non-bitcoin bro
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:40:27
Looks like a ponzu scheme.. no offense but the name, and photos/vids of Thailand make me wanna run 
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:50:55

Selling at 50miion.  stole some kids and sold them and bought bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:20:09
No? They keep changing names. Read more in r/scams
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:17:28
Someone could have hacked your account ?
@_date: 2019-02-16 08:07:44
Totally doesn’t look like a badly done phishing scam...
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:37:51
It’s in the common scams thing. The names are different but it’s the same scam.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:58:03
The best thing to do is say, what bitcoins if there are no records.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:58:24
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:55:49
K xD
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:28:54
I wish we could be bros.. sadly no where near the 1 mark.. I’d be lucky to hit .1.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:53:58
So you got like .000035 cents? That totally was worth it xD!
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:14:53
Sounds like a “money mule” or a form of fake check scam. You lose the money and they give you nothing.
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:17:57
Definitely pay taxes... I don’t hold and crypto at all and never will. I would like the record to state that.. nice try IRS

@_date: 2019-01-30 00:28:18
Ok.. I thought it might start rallying in 2019 slightly and do a large bull  rally in 2020.
@_date: 2019-01-30 20:49:15
Don’t sell your kidney. It will cause long term problems for you. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:05:43
That’s a pyramid scheme at best and a scam at worst.
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:47:35
A exchange or a bitcoin atm.
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:58:00
I would just not give it to them or sell it to them for a profit, if they can't get my password (which is 64 characters long) they sure as hell can't take them!
@_date: 2019-01-30 05:37:06
Ok. Thank you!!
@_date: 2019-01-30 08:24:21
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:12:03
Ok. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:25:01
I’ve heard that Tether (USDT) stays at around $1.
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:29:34
Ohh ok
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:40:46
Why don’t you trust them anymore? I’m thinking of buying crypto there ..
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:44:38
It’s a scam.
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:29:14
Alt coins are even riskier. They lose 90-95% of their Value from the ATH bitcoin and ETH loses 80-85% look st the charts. There are shitcoins for a reson.
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:28:31
Up or down?
@_date: 2019-01-30 08:42:43
So you want me to send you Bitcoin and you send me 2xs as much...
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:43:59
That sucks. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:29:01
How about when people are fearful be greedy and when people are greedy be fearful.
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:58:40
Don’t mine bitcoin, if you want to mine something, mine Monero or another coin that favors a AMD gpu and then trade it into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-16 06:53:07
Nice try scammer
