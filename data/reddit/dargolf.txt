Oh.. hey! I've been known to fuck myself.

I stopped reading here. You joined during a bubble and are now afraid that the price won't ever go up again.

And that's why you should always look if the site is https, the bar is green and the name of the company is in the green bar.

Looks a lot like Switzerland, Austria or Southern Germany!

Moon confirmed.

Yes.. I wanted to point out that a price of $100 per mBTC would be a nice thing for me.

They do have an exchange risk though. IMO the fee is fair.

Fiat is just one of the brands I'd never buy.. still funny though.

AWESOME! Didn't know that. Too bad they are only partners with the bad pizzerias where I live.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:59:44
Oh its only $1 per mBTC? Why not a hundred.

For bitcoin, yes. You should use your GPU to mine some scrypt-based coins.

Last week I sent a friend 0.5BTC and accidentally chose no transaction fee. We were scared that it won't go through at all, but after 9.5 hours it was confirmed.
So basically, if you're not in a hurry at all, just include no fee :).

I made the same bet with a friend, only that we bet 1 BTC if we go &gt;1000$ and 1000$ if we're &lt;1000$ and the deadline was christmas. I lost the bet :(

This is the most fluent and buttery web app I've ever seen.

That's not a great idea. Think further in the future, we want to replace fiat, so making it dependent on it would be a step backwards.
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:39:31
I don't think so. There would be too many billionaires in the world in terms of fiat.
@_date: 2013-10-14 11:18:38
only that gox is not an indicator. 136.29$  is way more interesting

Did you print that raspberry pi case too? I want that so hard.
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:46:02
Nah, that will settle over time. It was the same when the Euro became our currency, everyone was thinking and calculating in the old currencies for a while, until we got used to it.
