the main source of the bitcoin sell off is coming from china and the other asian markets.  
A correction is way overdue.  its either this, go sideways for another month, or go up more and crash even harder.

We're just getting started.  It will continue down in the next few days.  Every time we've had a large bull run its gone down around 25% afterwards.  And this is one of the biggest runs yet.

It doesn't force you use to Authy, it will just be annoying and spam a message recommending to use it every time you log on.  But you can still use normal 2FA where they text you a code if you want.  
If you're going by fees, customer support, reliability, then pretty much everywhere else is better than coinbase.

Thats really interesting.  I missed the altcoin explosion and from looking at the graphs I always thought they went up at the same time.  So the strategy is buy a bunch of altcoins, then when one gets pumped sell it and put the profits into another altcoin that hasn't been pumped yet?

While its not as secure as google authenticator I was under the impression its still 2FA.  Anyway its up to you, but I would recommend anything over coinbase.  If anything goes wrong when buying from them you'll be screwed.  When I tried to buy bitcoin after I changed my online bank password a few months earlier they added the btc to my account, then froze my account so I couldn't use it, then sold it back to themselves a week later at a 20% loss, then charged me 500$ on my debit card to cover the difference.  I send many messages to the support staff but there is no way to contact them.  You put in a claim and they never answer it, just send you automated messages.  In the meantime I looked up how to contact them only to find hundreds of horror stories of the terrible experiences from other people.  Do some google searches and you'll see what I mean.  I'll happily risk another Authy breach before I ever use coinbase again.

gemini is much better in every way
