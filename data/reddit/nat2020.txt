+1  If you need help to choose which one to implement first:  Pick Bitstamp. ;)
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:14:13
Option when I sign. Three different buttons for signing. 
I went with clearsign.
Found this, which explains a bit:

Tried again mistyping last 2 letters in first row. Still works. Three letters generates an error though...

Just back in from a short walk where I found this in a shop:  Reminded me of u guys. :) 
But I don't understand the part about going back though???

I think it's a wonderful idea. 
In fact I've found the most effective way to open the mind of someone that have their preconceived notion of what Bitcoin is and definitely what it is used for... is to give them some!
I've only used paper wallets, until now, that I've loaded with some fractions of coins and handed them out - which is quite a hassle - but good fun.
I've just signed up for changetip, waiting for the coins to come through then I'll go tipping in the subs that i frequent. 
However I think that the amount of tip is less important. If I'd never heard of / not well informed of bitcoin I'll probably be just as intrigued by $0.25 as I would by $5 and would want to learn more.

Actually I still think I need this. 
I do not know what reporting requirements IRS impose on businesses in the US.  
But since I don't live in the US, that's a bit beside the point. ;)

I wonder... freebird
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:34:37
Actually I tried to. 
But fortunately I was too late to the party so my verfication never made it through before the whole Gox-implosion.
Went with bitstamp instead and happy that I did.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:38:54
Actually Bitstamp does if you want to be able to use SEPA transfers.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:09:55
Yes, this is needed as well, and that's the was easy to supply - I just exported the transactions from Bitstamp. 
But I still need to prove I am in ownership of the asset (So I haven't spent it).
Same as the requirement of bank statements every year to see that I haven't embezzled the money I guess.
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:17:34
This is sufficient, as I need to prove at the end of (fiscal) year I owned it.  Same as statements from the banks. Done same date every year. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:08:48
It's actual proof that I'm after. Not just wallet screenshot/print summary, as that could (easily) be forged. 
I'm using an Offline Armory as wallet, and multiple keys for multiple wallets. 
However only one wallet is needed proof for (still multiple keys though) - The other wallet is my personal and no need to provide proof for.
Maybe easiest way is to make a transaction of total amount back to a single address in the same wallet so I only need to sign one message?
Ah, interesting aspect of the lower bound. For now It's sufficient to prove that I own what I bought. The same "problem" exists for traditional bank accounts. I could open a account and deposit fiat and not tell about it. Same as for additional bitcoins...  
Thanks for the great post btw. Will tip as soon as I can refill my changetip balance;)

Thanks again, as promised, here's a free lunch @_date: 2014-06-27 12:24:34
Good point on the contents of the message. 
I'll need my accountant to pick something random. Or include something that makes it abundantly clear that it's my BTCs and can't be reused by someone sinister.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:24:18
Nope. Didn't come back...
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:20:03
Hi, just finishing this and just about to sign my message when I realize there are three methods for signing: Bare, Base64 and Clearsign. 
I understand Bare if for backward compat..
Any thought on which one I should choose? 
Which one is easiest to verify (I.e. which one has the most tools available / most implemented). 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:48:44
Thanks for your reply. Found the other tx that spent the same amount, it was (and still is) in the mempool (my guess because of to low fee). So only this tx got commited to the block. So I guess it's not spent (on the blockchain) but in the mempool (which was what I saw when I posted the link)  Well, I guess there's a good use-case for this. Just can't see it now. The Tx was withdrawals from Bittrex and the another tx in the mempool was created 2 min after,  
Any idea what would cause this? I must say I'm a bit curious...
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:29:26
Ah I see. Thanks

"Q: Where is Magic available?
Anywhere in the US."
You got me excited there for a while... :/
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:53:16
Thanks, I used a Bitcoin core node + c-lightning  + lightning-charged  and Wordpress plugin: WooCommerce Lightning Gateway. Pretty straight forward. Thinking about writing a little howto if I can find the time..
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:52:44
Thanks, something like "Bitcoin Accepted Here" signs before you reach checkout?  
Nice site, bookmarked it! Need all good LN resources I can find - thanks! 
Checking in to why it didn't work. Guessing that the channel ran dry (out of funds) perhaps...
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:22:57
Ah, didn't get any notice that this thread was updated. Yes! I have sent some 1000 satoshis both ways, great for testing! Thanks for keeping that service! I'll hold the postcards!
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:18:36
I just saw that your order went through - Thanks!  - I'll send one extra so that you'll get one each and don't have to share. ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:33:49
Thanks, it's the default for medium to try to embed links. I'll see if I can get it to show the link only..
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:31:07
Yep, Full node on a AWS EC2-instance. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:57:25
Interesting idea, quite a different kind of project though? (I don't sell any digital assets at the moment)... Maybe I should?
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:52:56
Thanks, I will :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:56:07
For LN it's a good idea to run it on testnet (or regtest even) first as you're going to need to pay some fees to test it... (To open channels) 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:38:02
Oh, my stock of postcards are going to be depleated in the rate you're ordering ;) Shall I send them now? ;)
