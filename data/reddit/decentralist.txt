Bitcoin was open source, other people wanted to make changes to it, made their own cryptocurrencies.
It's like: why does OpenSuse or Gentoo or Debian or CentOS or RedHat or Ubuntu exist? Because linux is open source and other people wanted to do things differently than the original project.
We could see something like Darkcoin winning out over Bitcoin eventually, because that developer took Bitcoin, and worked on it for a year. Bitcoin is quite outdated in terms of top of the line crypto engineering.
But it has network effect so it's here to stay for awhile.

It's actually GENIUS.
It's absolutely a function of sidechaining bitcoin. I've never seen this done by such a big company, but Reddit did start accepting BTC for donations in 2010-11 so it makes sense a youthful upstart would over a large corp.
The great thing is, is they're attempting to use side chains properly.
The said they raised money in a previous round, with that money, you essentially create a reserve for your new tokens.
With these tokens they're opting to distribute on regulated opt-in model and I'm guessing they'll do the smart thing and give what they estimate and give to the most active users, and then if something is left over, do another stimulus round.
So these tokens will be backed by bitcoin.
As a cryptocurrency enthusiast, I only see the as a GREAT thing! There's no way this is a bad thing. Bitcoin wasn't supposed to be vernacular, just like HTTP and SMTP.
Things like Gmail and Firefox are vernacular. I can't wait. This could be what cryptocurrency has been waiting for. A large scale proof-of-concept of sidechain tech!

I think he meant "speculative vehicle" instead of investment.
Hopefully bitcoin functions as regular deflationary currency, giving you rates like savings accounts over time for holding. Nothing wrong with that.
But having tons of skin in the game waiting for the whole thing to "click" means we have no real mechanism for identifying what the real value of bitcoin is.
Sure the price is the real value, but the extra volatility due to these speculators is quite annoying for everyday users.

Except crypto-anarchy is a form of anarcho-capitalism, at least that's how the cipher punks in the 90s saw it and how many in the space want it to become.
I have no doubt blockchain tech could be created to enable better and trustless voting systems, but once people have economic freedom and power, they won't want political power disenfranchising them again (like the current system)
Besides, I wouldn't worry about the close ties. Anarcho-Capitalism is a supersystem. One that simply requires everyone have the ability to own resources and require explicit contracts before being made to do something.
It can still have voluntary socialism and voluntary syndicalism. Just like today's state capitalism has co-ops, communes, and syndicates now.
Ancap superstructure versus Statecap superstructure differences only matter in terms of war and debt. As in, Ancaps want the elimination of war and debt. All forms of other oppression should be solved thereafter. We don't want perfect, we just want a rational system without charismatic dictators making 100,000s people die for national concepts.

I agree, but as far as the price goes, it's an innacurate measurement infected by speculation.
I have no doubt that when bitcoin will become massively adopted it will be worth what is logical (21 million divided by [70 trillion]( or something crazy like that)

A currency needs to be a fungible proxy.
Fungible defined as divisible and exchangeable between itself.
And Proxy defined as a medium/store for value, to be conducive to trade and investment.
So what people are saying, is that when cash is guilty/marked/differentiated, it fails to meet the bolded of the definition:


This is not true. Some money is guilty or all money is guilty. My guess is that if we pressed this logic out, the government would say only some money is guilty, therefore, the entire money base is not fungible with itself.
Hope that helps. It's still fungible if all of the money is guilty, just not a very good proxy, and hence, a poor money to use.

Good points.
The harder the traditional payment networks and currencies become, the more likely cryptocurrencies will replace that need.

Exactly, until cryptocurrency, the entire financial system was based on trust.
Now a sliver of it (crypto-based transactions with no third parties) is based on trustless computer science hashing.
The next innovation we're seeing is proof-of-reserves, which I would argue, still has an element of trust involved.
Imagine a future where you DON'T have to trust anyone due to our systems and organizations being designed that way.

I can understand your point, but I think you're failing to truly appreciate what systems like these could do.
And you know what.... let's back up. This is Bitcoin is a trustless network, which still has trust in peer to peer transactions, but is a trustless network for the transaction history.
I feel like you're trying to say it's an all of nothing game, or maybe that's what you thought I meant?
I simply mean using p2p security network to verify timestamp servers /nerdtalk.
This is already applicable to currency, which IMO is only the beginning.
If this scares you or threatens your idea of what society is, why are you even here. More than half of us here WANT a new financial system built with trustless network.
Because bankers can't be trusted with the power the hold. Not because of them personally but because:


If you can't concede that point at least (that bankers hold too much power to be trusted) than we'll never agree on this.

The problem with socialism, is socialists, who usually elevate some god king who usually uses the unlimited power they want to give them to create a political elite and kill of undesirables.
Communist leaders called them useful idiots: 
And you can't blame the alt right for mixing up orators who use socialist jargon for control, and those who really believe the message.
All of that said I agree with you, a true socialist WOULD give the printed money to the poorest. After they paid themselves, their cohorts, their cohorts' cohorts, their bodyguards, the bodyguards to the mint (that's important), and to the propagandists and intelligentsia of course!!!!
Don't think too many at will be friendly to the ideas of collectivism or equality. Equality has always been the rallying cry of the poor, and the tool or the rich against the middle class. And as far as collectivism goes, take one good look at Venezuela and ask yourself if equality without trustless networks is possible.
Trustless networks give both individualism and collectivism a real chance without all the human corruption known to be part and parcel with centralization of governance.

Bitcoin is unique, and even so many people today use currency to make money.
Arbitrage is one huge market. Say a trader holds Bitcoin, they can buy and sell on multiple exchanges, profiting off the differential. This gives everyone a valuable service though, by equalizing the exchanges.
Another way is more of a hedge against inflation, where people hold a strong currency, when their country is maintaining a weak one, then, maybe they can profit after the differential is greater.
But you're 100% right. Bitcoin is first and foremost a currency, but that's what opens the doors to profit ventures like trading, arbitrage, and the regular selling of services!

I agree, trust is important. But let's not ALLOW people to abuse it through design, rather than by giving trust to an antiquated system that makes billions misleading people with loans and mortgages, and buys off politicians.
There's a point where trust shouldn't be given. I would put that bar at financial services. They NEED to be trustless. Through a system like the blockchain. As much as possible.
You won't be able to convince me that I should trust my bankers. Maybe I could. But I'd rather support this new paradigm.

Because the tech behind it allows for Darkcoin and other anonymous currency. If attacked bitcoin would adopt altcoin anon measures OR people would switch to a better anon coin.


I don't care at all. As long as they don't have minting power they either spend or save. Assuming this happens, 100 years + after and if they DON'T innovate in the economy (ie make returns) then that moneys will be distributed more evenly.


I will concede they could destroy a coin by investing in it though. That would require a lot of money, and it may not work if they can't buy up the sells other investors are cashing out. It would take A LOT of money. And then because the tech is open source and available, people would switch to BitShares or Darkcoin lol.


You're heads in the right place. Thank you for keeping vigilant. But I would just remember that behind bitcoin is an **open source technical solution to a complex computer science problem that allows any capable programmer the ability to create incorruptible money (to a point)

Just updating you because I got a Remind Me regarding this.
Considering you were absolutely right about 1 month being too short of a time period. I'm setting the next period for 3 months. I highly doubt they'll raise rates in that time period, or ever really.

Just an update. So the FED claims June, and they removed the word patient from the statement released.
I'm still cynical, look at the effects that removing the word patient had!
But sure, I doubt they'll renege on their guidance right? Well look at this: 
My guess is that they may in fact raise rates, but everybody thought QE would be over and we're now at QE4. 5 years into a recovery, which is quite long historically.
Anyway, we'll know for sure in May, but I'm still highly skeptical of your optimism regarding this.

people being jerks... yes bitcoin could implement this, though it would take a lot of effort, and bitcoin prides itself on being stable over experimental.
First it would need to implement the masternode network, which is just a fancy way of allowing people to DAC/Sidechain the network as "special" nodes.
Bitcoin could modify:
* Whether or not these nodes receive an incentive. Darkcoin currently rewards a percentage of the block rewards to the masternodes, further growing this new layer of the network.
* What these nodes do. InstantX and DarkSend are simply complicated network commands that require a dedicated group of nodes. For DarkSend, it's encryption/mixing, for InstantX, it's validating proof for a network fee.
In my opinion, this IS bitcoin 2.0. Not some company from Silicon Valley, but a super hardworking dev team, which has a philosophy of "pushing new developments to the limit!"
What's darkcoin known for? X11, Dark Gravity Wave, DarkSend, InstantX, Sporking, Masternode Networks, and plenty more developments I'm sure.
Bitcoin 2.0 was always about pushing the technology. Bitcoin was pseudonymous, and scalable. Darkcoin is simply Evan Duffield, changing every paradigm Bitcoin was.
* Anonymous Dev -&gt; Public Facing Dev
* Stability is Key -&gt; New and Important Features are key
* Scalability -&gt; Experimental
* Pseudonymous -&gt; Anonymous
Oh and everything is optional, and he just ported the bitcoin core recently in the last two weeks, we were usuing litecoin.
Think of Bitcoin as Darkcoin on steroids. I don't think it matters whether or not Bitcoin adopted any of it's changes. The reality is in addition to bitcoin, you get to use this beast of a coin too. Bitcoin+

I guarantee they won't raise rates. I will bet you anything, or even better, will just make a gentlemen's wager with you (a bet of nothing but honor).

That's the last year. Every single economic fundemental that tells you things are either good or bad is giving horrible signals, but the S&amp;P is untethered as you can see so most people, and most media, is going to be bullish near the end, which is coming soon.

Most countries, if not all, operate on a completely floating  interest rate against other fiat currencies.
In other words, no fractional reserve banking. That is a system that was ended in the 70s with Nixon.
Central Banks do hold assets, but most of those assets are leveraged financial instruments, IOUs to some leveraged debt, and other fiat currencies.
Hardly a system comparative to having each note redeemable to gold and a fixed or floated rate...

Well then bitcoin mixers/tumblers, which are centralized solutions that may not prove secure enough for you.
Dark Wallet is promising in that they're trying to create a market of anonymous individuals who can initiate coinjoin with you.
But all that said, if you're looking for a truly anonymous cryptocurrency, darkcoin has a decentralized onion style encryption mixing service designed right into the coin, which will get the job done.
Bitcoin will be the popular green lit currency. You WILL be banned from services when you go against the ruling regime's precepts. As we can clearly see from this article.
At least anoncoins will be safe from this BS. I'm not saying ditch Bitcoin. I'm saying recognize the different coins for their specializations.

I have a few masternodes. 2000 Darkcoin locked up in my wallet that incentivize's me to hold, and save for coins for more masternodes.
Evan is a brilliant developer. [He's one an award for his work]( created X11 (still adopted by many new coins), and has taken darkcoin to a somewhat decent idea in January 2014, into a powerhouse of innovation.
Darksend, an optional built in mixing platform that uses a decentralized node service, which rewards full nodes.
Instant X, optional instant transactions, also using this 2nd tier decentralized node network.
And now a name change, which given Evan's accomplishments, makes me think DASH can compete with bitcoin. Protocols stagnate, and I personally think DASH having a public dev unlike Bitcoin's Satoshi helps development and direction.
Owners of projects help the projects.

[Scandinavia - the Utopia that Never Was](
TLDR: Norway has a shit ton of oil, all Scandinavian countries are running huge deficits and are using NIRP (Negative Interest Rates) to fund their high public spending.
The problem with socialism, is that it lacks basic notions of economics. 
You say free healthcare but I would say a health care system that "regulates" it's input to control its spending.
You say superior standard of living and I would say temporary privilege based on oil, money printing, being European during the Dollar's reign, and having a hard working peoples living in the region.
I'm not going to get into it with you and I won't defend any other modern health system either. They're all socialist, as that word literally means "third path", and is as close to fascism as you can get without calling a spade a spade.

It's definitely still vulnerable due to it's small size (51% normal nodes), but the anonymity feature is secure as masternodes require 1000 darkcoin to create. So the government would have to buy up pretty much all of the supply. Over 20% of the coin supply is locked up in masternodes, which acts both as a deflationary force and a way to protect against just that, bad players.


Like investing in companies, I invest in teams, and I assure you, if you look into what Evan has done in the last year (Darkcoin is only about a year old) he's done a great deal for not just the coin, but for crypto as a whole.
Unfortunately, there's so many coins, I can't say it's the best one. But it's the best I know of save Bitcoin (due to size/popularity) due to anonymity and instant transactions.
I definitely recommend you check it out. If you check their charts,  you'll notice Darkcoin is one of the few coins that goes against the general market tendencies sometimes, suggesting it does have solid investment, and not just pump and dumpers. Take it from me: I've TRIED bringing the price down below 0.01 to buy a few more thousand, but I doubt it's going back down to that level for a while.
Thanks for being open minded. Some people are very hostile to alt coins, which is odd considering we should all be crypto currency proponents and not just "virtual currency" fans and bitcoin proponents. I love altcoins. It's competition that allows bitcoin to potentially adopt more useful tech, by giving other devs a chance to create their own babies. Evan just wanted a better bitcoin for himself: one that was anonymous and instant, and he did it. I'm sure it's not the only coin with either feature, but those two are live and working and the masternodes are an interesting monetary instrument that makes the market different.

Anything can be regulated to death. Bitcoin is a decentralized and open source cryptocoin with plenty of copy cats and newer siblings.
Bitcoin may become mainstream and crappy, but that only paves the way for something like Darkcoin, which is anonymous so there's that.
Have fun regulating an obscure and anonymous coin that has value lol.
