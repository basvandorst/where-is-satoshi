Wait let me get this straight. You transferred $600 or so, and you're upset about getting charged $5? That seems a little unreasonable

Is Bitfinex going to refund you? 50 btc isn't a small amount. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:34:44
that's about $85M, according to Google. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:59:44
True, absolutely. But even if Bitcoin drops to $200, that's $31M. Point is, somebody made some serious fucking bank

Here's hoping for compensation

Don't live there anymore, but for the average American, the only thing you can do is see Iranians as humans, see their government as evil, and be very careful to separate the two. It's very common for Americans to sort of think of Iranians as bad because their Government is bad, but the truth is Iranians are not very thrilled about the way their country is ran either. The average Iranian just wants to have the same freedoms westerners have, and for the isolation to end. 
Eventually, I think, things will change. Iranians already see much more western influence and freedoms than they did even just 10 years ago. Things are changing fast, and as the new generations start to take over, and younger, more liberal Imams take over the clergy, Iran becomes more free. It won't happen soon, but one day in our lifetime, the Ayatollah will be gone.

As an Iranian, you are absolutely correct, but that doesn't change the fact the the Ayatollah and the rule of Imams is horrifyingly backwards and repressive.

Lmao yeah, something like that, except it fluctuates. Some years will be like a 7, and others it's like a 3 or 4. There's a lot of push and pull, and the Ayatollah has a lot of opposition in government.
