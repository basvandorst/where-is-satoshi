They have a presence, I believe they own the naming rights to the Oakland Athletics stadium. O.co They aren't as major as Amazon, Newegg, or Tiger Direct. But they are reputable enough that people can trust purchasing from them.

Convinced my girlfriend to buy an Android instead of iPhone she was wanting because of their Bitcoin stance. She doesn't own Bitcoin, but she likes the idea and supports it, so the impact that their decision brings is being heard! STAY AWAY FROM APPLE! Also I was on the market for getting a Macbook because I do programming. Definitely think I'll stick it out on a high-end Ubuntu device, rather.

The issue with your friends having trouble scanning the QR code on his phone, is because he was moving his phone back and forth. When scanning a QR code, just hold it still. The app just needs to analyze the image and moving it around screws it up. As you saw, once he stopped moving the phone it took in half a second.

Holding, even buying. This is exactly what Bitcoin is about, taking control away from the government. Price is going down because Chinese government is trying to kill off Bitcoin, this was predicted! Governments don't want Bitcoin because it takes the power away from them! Fight back!

Their are no bitcoin credit cards processors yet, so don't relate bitcoin to credit cards. Bitcoin is like paying with cash, period. A consumer gets the same protection as if they paid with cash. Bitcoin is a currency.

If this happens, we need business owners to let us know so we can protest!

Like in any other situation, you have to not be an idiot and prepare yourself before hand.

So, essentially this is a non-story in terms of hurt towards Bitcoin compared to other currencies. Because it's just as illegal to buy USD as it is to buy BTC in Iceland?
But if I was an Icelandic, I think it is time to shake up parliament, or congress, or whatever they have over there. ...political office.

You need to educate yourself.
Internet freedom means that corporations can not hide behind closed door deals. Bitcoin transactions not being anonymous IS Internet freedom.

They linked to their Bitcoin info page as a useful page for peoples homepage. aka. every time someone launches their web browser, the words Bitcoin are present on the screen ingraining the brand into their brains.

Stay away from Bitcoins.

Bitcoin was made to take the power out of Governments hands with currency.
Gov't of China has a lot of stake in USD.
Bitcoin will somewhat replace all currencies, such as USD. This is bad for governments, especially China whom are banking on being the biggest economy and currently holds exponential amounts of US debt...why mess up a good thing going for them?
This shows that the people have power. China doesn't want the people to have power, why do you think they put a firewall on the Internet?
Don't sell, BUY! This is the future. Unless you always want to live in a police state where the gov't controls not only you, but the money you spend, and what you can spend it on.
Don't be a puppet.
Money controls everything. Corporations currently control the gov't because they have their circlejerk of politicians who can print money at a whim behind closed doors. That can't happen with Bitcon. Tables will be turned. People will have the money, people will control the politicians. People will finally have true freedom, and control the gov't.

You're afraid of the exchanges?
How do you expect to buy gold, silver, EUR, or any other currency? The exchanges have to cover their asses, sure Bitcoin can be traded anonymously, but the exchanges want to know who you are so they don't get scammed. They're a business, they have to be accountable for themselves.
It's as anonymous as the person selling it wants it to be.
