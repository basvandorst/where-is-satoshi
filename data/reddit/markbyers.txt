This is wrong. Some bitcoin transactions are reversible, others are not. Most are not at the moment because the mainstream clients currently don't support reversible transactions. But the technology to do it is there and if there is sufficient demand for it (perhaps soon?) then the implementation will come.
Perhaps you should take a break from bitcoin for now, and come back in a few years when the implementation is finished, it is more mainstream, and more easily accessible to ordinary people. Bitcoin is still in very early stages right now so not all the infrastructure is in place yet. But it has already matured a lot considing how short a life time the currency has had so far.

The sales have to be used to pay for all the expenses for the flights and all the salaries for the people employeed by the company. Until the suppliers and employees accept bitcoin, the income has to be converted to fiat to pay these people.

Businesses offering services will exist, yes.
Online wallets so that grandma doesn't have to worry about making backups of her private keys. Maybe one day bitcoin banks will appear and make loans in bitcoin. Insurance companies might insure your bitcoins against theft.
If people want those services (and are willing to pay for them) then they will appear.


And you don't have to!
If you don't think those companies will give you value then don't use them. Nobody is forcing you to put your money in an online wallet. Nobody is forcing you to get insurance.

That would be really nice. :-)
But do you think they will lower their fees fast enough? If they wait until many people have already moved over it might be too late to get them back again with reduced fees.

I would guess that all the core Bitcoins developers are heavily invested in bitcoin. They therefore have a considerable incentive to make it successful, because this will make their investment more valuable.

Dogecoin will soon have lower inflation than bitcoin.

Yeah, the banks are really the big problem here. It would be good if someone could find a way to transfer money reliably to other people without having to go through the banks.
Oh wait...

Shibes don't dislike any group of people, and especially not our bitcoin grandfathers. Everyone is welcomed into the dogecoin community regardless of background.
Despite our differences, we are all in this together.

Not everyone will use the blockchain though. In the future most transactions will be off-chain. 


Really? Why do you think that it is nonsensical?
People who still use fiat currencies are currently not using the blockchain (obviously) and they are fine with that. If they are in a store and offered the choice of paying fiat with visa or buying with bitcoin off-chain, and the bit-coin off-chain is 2% cheaper then they will probably choose bitcoin. Assuming of course that it's just as easy (or easier) to use, that they feel that it's secure, etc...
They most likely won't care whether their transaction is stored on the blockchain or not.

Bitcoin has twice the subscriber base as dogecoin.
For a post to receive so many upvotes there must have been some that either voted it up or else didn't vote it down. If there is over 51% support for bitcoin it should in theory be possible for the supporters to collective downvote whatever they want.

Maybe because you don't read downvoted comments?

Perhaps a bit misleading to take a quote of Peter Schiff saying how bitcoin replicates gold, because he later says that he thinks that it doesn't. Out of context it seems like he is endorsing it.

It might be free for you, but it's not completely free. Somebody has to pay for it.

Mining will be done where electricity is cheapest.
That's not necessarily the same place where they make miners.
If you make a miner and run it yourself, but your electricity is very expensive, then you lose money for sure. If you buy a miner and have free electricity then you can convert that free electricity into money, and perhaps make a profit. Therefore people who have free electricity get more value from running a miner than those that produce them can. Both parties can benefit from the trade.
Of course this assumes that the company is legitimate, and that the miner is delivered on time, etc...

You don't need to look at past numbers to see that. You only need to look at the protocol. One day 100% of miner revenue will come from transaction fees, and 0% from mining new bitcoins, and we already know roughly what date that will be.
The mining for bitcoins is just a bootstrap to get the initial wealth distributed as fairly as possible.

There is no cap on the number of coins - the same number of coins will be added every year. However there is a cap on the *rate of monetary inflation*, which will soon be 5% and will get slightly closer to 0% each year.
If you include the effect of lost coins, then dogecoin will eventually be deflationary after many years but that is not the way it is perceived by most people. It will be interesting to see what happens.

The Bitcoin protocol is also designed to allow for a third option. It just isn't fully implemented yet.

I would like to see cryptocurrency added to the dictionary. Bitcoin is just one implementation of a cryptocurrency. Even if bitcoin fails the cryptocurrency technology will live on. It cannot be uninvented.

It was just a small typo in the title. Should be "bitcoin" instead of "shoes". Easy mistake to make since the keys are right next to each other.

I posted what I thought was a reasonable rebuttal to his claim with a link to a source, and it got no replies and got downvoted.


Yes, if you deliberately ignore the rational arguments and downvote them, then you can safely say all bitcoin users have no rational arguments.
