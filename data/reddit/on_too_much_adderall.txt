I'm just going to keep all my btc but delete Coinbase and not look at it for awhile, I think.

I have coinbase on my phone because I like seeing the value of my money go up and knowing how much I've "made" (I put made in quotation marks because yes, I understand that technically I haven't made anything because I haven't liquidated it.) 
I also love their instant buy with a debit card feature - every time I think it'll go up i can buy a little more immediately.
i have about $700 worth of crypto now and about $300 of it is in electrum, the rest is in my coinbase wallets and pretty evenly split between btc, litecoin and ethereum. I understand everyone says it's not "safe" to keep coins on there, but to be perfectly honest I think it's fine to keep the amount I have on it. I've got 2 factor authentication enabled and in addition to that, I have an email verification set up so i must click the link to confirm in addition to the sms authentication.
so i wouldn't say coinbase is for noobs...just that its convenient. it's for lazy people maybe... people like me, who are too busy and/or lazy to send coins to their other wallet all the time. But I don't think that using coinbase means youre a crypto noob or that you don't know what you're doing 
also I'd like to point out to many commenters on here that gdax and coinbase are literally the same thing.

Omg, I didn't know this. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:40:10
Thank you! This makes sense. All the articles I read explained that this was happening but not why they were doing it. 
Sounds to me like it will have little to no impact long term, but the news just blew it up.

I was afraid that the scare over it would cause the price to go down, but really it doesn't seem to be. The media made it out to be a much bigger deal than it really is, I guess!

Spotify? Lol!
I figured this "Spoofy" thing was just some weird propaganda, but thought I'd ask.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:15:46
Do you have a source for this? I wouldn't be surprised if you're correct, but everything i have found as of yet indicates it did actually happen.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:22:20
You bring up a good point here. I personally don't think bitcoin will be "washed away" necessarily by the other currencies, but some of its competitors, namely Ethereum in my eyes, are very promising. I own some ETH and also some LTC for these reasons. :)

I'm a girl, i own bitcoin and I'm the one trying to get all my dude friends to adopt it so this thread makes me laugh

Investopedia defines intrinsic value as:


This definition is a bit confusing. I interpret intrinsic value as an **actual usefulness** of something and a reason to invest in it **beyond** the mere observation that its value is going up. For bitcoin this would be the fact that the blockchain is a (relatively) new technology that resolves several issues. 
* It provides a solution to people's growing distrust in banks and in the government by introducing a decentralized aspect to currency exchange. 
* It is inherently scarce (meaning it was designed with a specific limit of how much of it can exist) which eliminates the possibility of issues such as hyperinflation (occurs when governments print more money to make up for a loss of value.) This, I believe, makes it fundamentally more stable *in the long run* than traditional forms of currency despite its manic fluctuations in the current moment.
* Because of its growing acceptance as both a store of value and as a currency, it has inherent value. This is in contrast to the tulips*, which weren't a particularly valued commodity, nor were they used as currency or long term store of value. people simply bought them to sell them later and cash out when they saw the price begin to rise. 
thus we can say they did not have inherent value like Bitcoin does.
*note: other commenters have pointed out to me that tulip mania didn't actually happen. this comment is assuming it did, but after doing some more research I've learned that the facts are iffy and there's a good chance it didnt.

Cool, thank you! I am checking this out :) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:25:12
Whoa, TIL. Good find! :)

I'm just telling people my investments so they can know what happened to me; mainly the fact that it's never too late to jump on the BTC train if they see value in it, was the point i was trying to convey. 
People lose out on this awesome opportunity because there's always someone who's going to say "nah don't waste your money, it's at its peak now." Those people, in my opinion, don't know what they are talking about. Or at least they don't understand the real reasons bitcoin is a very real investment to make. I'm just trying to make people more aware of that issue by sharing this anecdote. People can interpret it how they choose.

No dude, I said I'm a girl. 
And I also meant that you posted several mean comments on THIS thread, not accusing you of naysaying other posts. 
It sounds like you really just want to pick a fight with a random stranger, man. Try some positivity in your life. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:04:24
L M A O.
talking money with people who don't understand the struggle is like getting job interview advice from a trust fund baby. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:16:28
yes, i explained in the post why i only bought that much, if you read the whole thing. i'm quite broke right now and $75 is a lot of money to me. 
i actually have quite a bit more money in bitcoin at the moment than i do in USD, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:19:21
Yep, you're right! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:01:30
Lol. I always tell everybody when it hits ath too. YOU GUYSSSS BITCOIN JUST HIT 7K OMGGGGG everybody thinks i'm either fucking nuts or just way too excited about the fact that ive made $125. 
But the thing is - it's not about making a quick buck. I COULD sell my coins now and keep the $200. Plus my eth and ltc, i have about $25 worth of those each too.
Or i could hodl them, which is what I'm doing :)
I truly believe this technology is going to entirely reshape the way people pay for stuff in not just the future but in the VERY near future. Like, the next couple of years. Additionally: the fact that there is a hard coded cap at 21m btc that can ever be mined fascinates me. It's like, think of how much more the dollar would be worth if only $21 million could ever exist at all. People are becoming increasingly frustrated with banks, and i feel like a decentralized p2p method of exchanging currency is where society is ultimately going to shift toward, as a mainstream thing.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:58:39
Yes, this is what i plan to do. i buy coins from coinbase, i love that it's instant now, and you don't have to wait for them to be deposited anymore! So I think I'm going to stop waiting for it to dip down low and just put a tiny little bit of money in it like every week or so no matter what the current btc price is. :)

this is very real, and a reason i decided to finally invest in bitcoin. 
i learned of it my first year outta high school. It must have been late 2011-early 2012. My college friends used to fuck around on the silk road and they mentioned something about "bitcoin" when it was worth, if i recall correctly, less than a dollar a coin. 
I didn't pay any attention to it because i was caught up in my own drama, and also, these were the same kids that I walked in on after they'd split a bottle of robitussin. They fed me my first mushrooms. I ran from angry security guards with them on many occasions. I loved them to death, but they got me into some STUPID shit. So when they told me there was this new thing called "bitcoin" and it was money on the internet you can buy drugs with, my first thought was "of COURSE you weirdos fucking figured out a new way to buy drugs. Hahaha. Losers." They explained it to me but it didn't entirely make  sense, and i figured i'd just buy drugs from dealers because well i fucking knew how to already, and that was that. I forgot about it.
I started following it for real in 2013. I actually dont remember why. I remember seeing something about it maybe, thinking it was cool that this thing was still around and that hey it's actually worth quite a bit now like $15? wasn't it like a few cents before? I told people about it and they were like "isn't that illegal?" the few that knew anything about it at all were like "Don't waste your money, it's topped out".and so I didn't buy any for those reasons, then i forgot about it again.
finally in 2017 people are talking about it again and i'm like oh cool, hey bitcoin is back - but i still didn't actually take the initiative and buy any until august and EVEN THEN people were telling me it was "too late." Congrats to u for buying some now, it's NEVER too late at all with bitcoin is what seems to be the case. :)

LOL i realized this was the same naysayer that was talking shit on my other comment. It's like dude, go away, hahahaha
