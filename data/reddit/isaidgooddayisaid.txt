I think he means ATH = all time high, so the top white line from ath has broken through, which I guess is usually a positive sign, though it doesn't always work out that way.  
So 50/50 chance price moves up or down.  It's like predicting next weeks weather, you know it will be cloudy or sunny you just know it.

That too. That is when I first heard about bitcoin when it reached 200 and I was like whatever then months later i heard it went to 1000. Totally missed the train. :(  
Man if it does go crazy like last time who knows what will happen. So many more people know about bitcoin now and it's so much easier to buy. That is what put me off back then.  *(the community was smaller and the exchanges looked shady)
@_date: 2016-04-18 07:02:15
I've never used the exchange you listed but sites I have used like Coinbase and Circle work like banks (though they don't ask for pictures or ID, they do ask for other information). So of course you have to  provide personal information when signing up to transfer money in and out to buy and sell bitcoins. You can't open a bank account without proper identification. The exchanges have to comply with regulations. Anyway I wouldn't trust money on a exchange that didn't comply or have insurance to cover losses.

This is not true. It was gradually rising months before and even tripled in value ( 5 - 16 dollars) and tested supports and then started gradually rising again then after halving went really crazy.

I agree. This discussion has grown dull and boring. I think the market is reflecting that right now. I really don't care which route bitcoin takes for scaling as long as the price becomes more stable. 
I'm proud of bitcoin because it is still working and because the FUD has less and less of an effect on price stability. I think the people that buy and use bitcoin out number the people who are making this a big deal by a huge margin now. They simply don't visit the forums and Reddit to talk about bitcoin. They don't know who any of these people are. Bitcoin is growing up.

I have a suggestion. Media blitz, with volatility increasing and big things happening in the bitcoin space this would be a perfect time to start a massive ad campaign.

Common sense regulation would be just regulating the on and off ramps, the crypto to cash part.  Treat exchanges like casinos and treat crypto like the chips in a casino. I don't think they are keeping track of every old lady who pulls a slot machine lever in Vegas, they are only concerned with her total winnings after she cashes out her chips. The new asset class should resemble a W-2G form. Though, a better idea would be for the exchanges and businesses to deduct taxes every time you transfer or trade out. The exchanges are already keeping track of every trade and have more data than the end user in some cases. Not to mention are making money hand over fist and could easily automate accounting and regulatory things into their software. I guess what I'm trying to say is the regulation should be centralized. Hell I'm sure many would be happy paying a slightly higher tax if it all fell on the exchanges.

But bitcoin will change for the good or bad in our eyes because bitcoin is growing and as it grows new talent and voices who have not chosen a side will emerge and they will out number the old voices.

Why do you assume there will always be more sellers than buyers?
 The reason it went from $200 to 20k is because sellers started disappearing. Some sellers panic sold and then bought back at higher prices. The move from $200 to $3000 alone had smaller panic spikes in volume as time went on. Many times it jumped up on hardly any volume at all. The first move up from $200 to $500 had more volume than the second move up from $500 to $1000 and it even had more volume than the move from $1,000 to $3,000.
I remember people complaining about how volume was decreasing but the price kept rising. They couldn't wrap their heads around it.
@_date: 2015-08-24 01:37:38
Quick raise network fee on that transaction before it's too late! In Android bitcoin wallet you can raise it to 0.001 so it gets confirmed within 10 mins by clicking the transaction in right hand corner.

He sent it with no fee. There is a reason for confirmations. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 02:16:30

Hard to predict. Depends on news and other factors, but the charts show it continues to bounce off 220 range. I think its a repeat of what happened last time (Gox) it was this low. Hard to say for sure though. Of course any bad news or good news can change that in a heart beat.

Why downvote me? WTF  His transaction could take days/weeks or longer to confirm or worse if he doesn't raise network fee.
@_date: 2015-08-24 03:07:45
I've had transactions stuck for a long, long time before with a low fee. I've never sent or received one without a fee before, but by reading posts of others who have it don't look pretty. But it might confirm in that time frame. Depends on miners and transaction backlog. I think some ignore the lower amounts because of spam.

Supply and demand.
Supply: Inflation will be cut in half pretty soon by the bitcoin reward halving (1 year) and the following halving (5 years) should cut it down to around 2 percent. Large investors entering and leaving can also change the supply. 
Demand:Mostly dependent on if bitcoin userbase is sustained, grows or declines. Investors, merchants, everyday users.
You would think if bitcoin demand stays the same with each halving the price should at least remain stable or slowly rise. But of course this is just like any other thing that has value and is affected by knowns and unknowns. Nothing is static. It's impossible to try and predict the future price of bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-02-07 05:02:34
I'm going to say not very many have been lost.  Most of these stories  of "oh I discovered a wallet full of bitcoins on my hard drive after all these years" or "I just lost 10000 coins doing something dumb" are complete bullshit for attention. The coins that haven't moved since the early days are most likely waiting to be moved when the time is right because the owner of those coins is a long term holder or has many more coins that he has been spending.
If I had to guess I'd say most have been lost through switching wallets and not giving a damn about a small amount. No way 3 million coins. 100,000? maybe.

Some wallets will send an output less than 0.01 without raising up the fee  (even if you send say a full bitcoin ) that is the real issue of some of these unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:48:11
the most used bitcoin android wallet does. It will occasionally send an output less than 0.01 from an address without raising fee.  Because the way it uses new addresses all the time. Sometimes small amounts of bitcoin get left behind only to be included later on in a new transaction and it does not calculate a new fee when that happens.

@_date: 2016-05-07 03:59:45
Simple answer: You can think of miners and nodes like servers. The miners create new coins every time they solve a block of transactions. The miners must solve a very complicated math problem to win the reward. This is what makes bitcoin secure. The first miner to solve the problem gets the reward. These individual blocks are added to the blockchain which is a huge ledger or complete list of every transaction ever made.  They then sell these coins to market to pay for mining costs and keep as profit. If you wanted to, you could trace the coins you hold all the way back to when they were created using the blockchain.
Bitcoin is the currency. Nobody controls it.
