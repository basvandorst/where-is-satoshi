So gold is environmentally clean?
Could we scale it?
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:29:47
Valid point. Thank you, sir.
We are faraway from adootion.
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:47:34
You mean less?
Sry was to drunk to write more explanation. But I would expect everybody into bitcoin to read a minimum of  tech basics, or the whitepaper, before discussing it 
If thats too much, OK..
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:09:49
The Whitepaper says Bitcoin dot ORG, not com.
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:43:00
..but it's still fiat ...
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:44:58
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:22:09
I was thinking about that Nacho Cheese thing. If you're money is on a bank it's not yours, the same way as if your coins are on an exchange. What is told everyone in crpyto should be told everyone in Fiat. You could also say, not your cash, not your money. But that wouldn't even be correct, as the bills are just IOUs. So, not your gold, oil, food, land..

Nonono, transaction verification doesn't consume alotof computational power. Only a few ms per 10min.
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:36:31
But what about ethics?
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:22:17
Energy usage would not rise with higher usage/transactions. It's the base security that uses that much energy, transaction verification is nullable compared to the block puzzle.
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:32:51
Transactions are easily verified. Power goes to the cryptographic puzzle to solve the block.
Please read the basics..

Nonono, transaction verification doesn't consume alotof computational power. Only a few ms per 10min.

You can mine it with that kind of energy

But gold was a viable currency and exchange medium for a Long Time, before they brought us fiat. Time to revert some things.
Edit: I mean, bitcoin can and should be both.

Yes it hurts, when your monthly income raises by 50 and the health insurance by 70.
I try to feed a 5 head family in this system. I have a good education and a good job, we live in a rented appartement and have no car. At the end of the month, there is nothing left.

Cash is anonymous with except to the two parties, which in most cases are not interessted to make it public. Sure, there is the risk of cops making a trap, but this applies to dnm as well. Or the situation, when two guys come to your home and want the money for the kilo coke you bought and used without paying.. well these things happen, no matter what exchange medium was used.
And I don't agree, the value of crypto comes from the amount of usage. Right now it's pure speculation. Also, the fiat value doesn't mean something to dark net trades. Prices will adjust.
Don't get me wrong. I see your point, as crypto allows a far bigger market then traditional black market, espescially for digital goods like illegal videos or chemicals from the other end of the world, but using crypto for legal things or trading/investment doesn't mean, you're supporting all the things you listed above. They existed before crypto, even before fiat, and will always.

@_date: 2018-07-14 23:02:51
But the same could be said about USD. Just because I use the same currency doesn't mean I fund organized crime.
