A government supported currency has some level of lock-in. 
Firstly, there are millions of people in Russian who probably have no other option - no computer or internet for Bitcoin even if they had the education. They need to use ruble because they have nothing else. Precious metals are too rare to trade. They could find something else or transfer to barter economy, but realistically that's worse.
Secondly, and more importantly, a government currency is supported by all government debts. You can (and have to) always pay your taxes in government currency, any fees or charges in government currency. This gives guaranteed value and an incentive to hold.

You must be joking. Without government interference (eg the federal reserve, etc) financial institutions, banks, insurance companies and anyone else who needs to hedge markets is going to need a lot more guidance from economists. I don't think this guidance would be as functional as it currently is, but it would undeniably exist.

I didn't suggest they advise investors. They provide guidance for their employers. What do you think bank economists do if not provide guidance and information?
And as an economist, you either teach or research (academic) or you work for government or enterprise. And if you work, you provide information and advice on economic conditions.

Who is 'they'? I'm not aware of any economic consensus on Bitcoin, apart from it being new, unproven and of unknown utility.

As the article states, shielding both sides of each transaction from price fluctuation - using Bitcoin as a transfer protocol only - is a significant advantage. It provides value by lowering transaction costs cf existing financial system.
The volume being transmitted through the network will give the network value. This in turn will stabilize and bolster the price. I don't care if people aren't using Bitcoin directly, and from an investment perspective it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:29:58
It would be if this were a proven long term income producing investment. Speculative investments, however, usually shoot up and slowly drain back down to near zero - that's what Bitcoin needs to avoid.

1. Grow up. Taxes paid for the internet, the schools where you learnt to read. Probably should have had higher taxes so you learnt to think, too.
2. Silk Road was shut down. Pirate Bay and Kim Dotcom. Sure, you can't stop it, but you can't make it very difficult to use. Where are you going to buy your Bitcoin? Black market Bitcoin sounds very expensive. Maybe you don't remember how difficult it was to buy back in the MtGox days.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:27:53
Because Bitcoin is easier (literally take a photo of a barcode with your cell phone, no numbers being typed in) and more secure in terms of giving your card an unknown, untrusted vendor.

A compromised credit card causes an account to be frozen. You can be issued a new card and new number but there is significant inconvenience. How do you deal with that?
Credit card cannot be push. Absolutely not. What do you "push" to? The only push involved is that you're pushing the credit card number to a processor who pulls the finance from that card.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:54:30
The number is disposable for a financial institution, but I can't create my own credit card number.
So if this isn't a benefit of Bitcoin then what is? Liberty albeit with a permanent public record of all transactions?
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:50:05
Which two are these?
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:31:41
If the primary card is frozen then the secondary holders are also frozen, or at least that's my experience.
And again, no, they aren't push. Giving dates doesn't do anything to impress me. How can they possibly be push? I'll repeat: what are they pushing to? A bank account? That's not how it works.

If the price is headed sub $100 that's downside; you should sell.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:13:08
To avoid market crashes and misinformation about the stability of a platform?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:54:28
Using what protocol? A bank transfer? A bill payment process? When your credit card doubles as a bank account, using banking features of that account does not mean those features are features of a credit card.
These are banking features, not credit card features. The credit card itself provides no push opportunity.
But then why am I trying to reason with a buttcoiner. You are obviously just here to argue. Being *against* a technology, especially one with no reasonable rival tech like Bitcoin, speaks volumes about your character.
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:14:04
Much safer to have coinbase manage your cold wallet than do it yourself, unless you know what you're doing

I do, and that's how I know credit cards don't push. For the third time,  tell me how I can push using a credit card. I know you won't, because it can't be done.

Oh, so I should have a stack of prepaid credit cards and just manage the remaining balance? Sounds easy. Of course I can't pay for items online using multiple credit cards so I'm going to end up with a bunch of cards with a few dollars each.
Or even time I want to buy something I'll log in to my bank and get them to generate a new number?
You may not have noticed, but credit cards are "pull", not "push". 
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:49:47
Good luck with that
If the government wanted to steal money why hasn't it happened yet? Wouldn't it just be done through taxes? And how exactly does Bitcoin help? Isn't Bitcoin going to be illegal if it's subverting a government money seizure?

Banks were invented to allow safe storage of cash. Who wants to have $100,000 under the mattress, living in constant worry?
The same is true of Bitcoin. It's legitimate to have someone take care of it for you and guarantee security of your coins. No doubt OP took the libertarian view that we no longer need banks, but in reality I'm more than happy to have done reputable organization like Coinbase manage the details for me.

Bitcoin is not a subset of the internet. The internet is not a subset of electricity.
Being a predecessor or dependency is not the same as being a superset or parent. It's asinine and logically embarrassing to assume so.
Another way to put it is that the internet is not a sufficient condition for Bitcoin. It is a necessary condition, sure, but the proof of work algorithm is also necessary. Bitcoin can't exist without that, otherwise it would have anyway existed. This Bitcoin is obviously not a subset of the internet.

I have $US in an Australian PayPal account that I can't transfer to my US PayPal account, just due to the way PayPal works. I've paid their fee of 1.9% when I want to cash out, and various other fees when accepting payments. I've gone through the headache of making claims with them before with no success - and they didn't give me a 14 day grace period (maybe they've changed). And I'm always paranoid about logging in to PayPal from a public computer - rightfully so. And I need a very complex password to feel safe because they don't even have 2FA.
Alternatively, I can buy something with Bitcoin by scanning an on-screen barcode with my phone. I'm already authenticated. No personal info. No fee.
It is like Uber in a lot of ways. We are finding ways around existing legacy systems that are arduous, heavy, slow and expensive.
