How can you implement a stratergy when the market does whatever it wants. The only statergy I can think of is buy low, sell high. But Crypto is all over the place. 
I hope the price doesn't fall too much. I guess luck has a big part of whether you can make a prophet. I don't have a team working behind me analyzing every sing fluctuation in price. So it seems to be a guessing game. One that I do enjoy mindyou!

Don't you regret not selling at 20k? ouch

It’s all the same stuff that people say about gold – another waste of human investment energy. Government-issued currencies have value because they represent human trust and cooperation. There is no wealth and no trade without these two things, so you might as well go all in and trust people.
People who think that there’s even a tiny chance bitcoin could become a world currency say it is severely undervalued. You could make the same argument about my fingernail clippings: they may have no intrinsic value, but they’re in limited supply so let’s use them as the new world currency.
Let’s get this straight: in order for bitcoin to be a real currency, it needs several things:
* Easy and frictionless trading between people.
* To be widely accepted as legal tender for all debts, public and private.
* A stable value that does not fluctuate (otherwise it’s impossible to set prices).
Bitcoin has NONE of these things, and even safely storing it is difficult. Bitcoin exchanges such as Mt Gox in Japan, Bitfinex and various other wallets and exchanges have been [h](
The second point is crucial. Bitcoin is only valuable if it truly becomes a critical world currency. In other words, if you truly need it to buy stuff, and thus you need to buy coins from some other person in order to conduct important bits of world commerce that you can’t do any other way. Right now, speculators are the only people driving up the price.
A speculative cult currency like bitcoin is only valuable when you cash it out to a real currency, like the US dollar, and use it to buy something useful like a nice house or a business. When the supply of foolish speculators dries up the value evaporates – often very quickly.
A currency should also not be artificially sparse. It needs to expand with the supply of goods and services in the world, otherwise we end up with deflation and hoarding. It helps to have the Federal Reserve system and other central banks guiding the system.
Finally, nothing becomes a good investment just because “it’s been going up in price lately”.
The world’s governments are not going to let everyone start trading money anonymously and evading taxes using bitcoin. If cryptocurrency does take off, it will be in a government-backed form, like a new “Fedcoin”. Full anonymity and government evasion will not be one of its features.
The cryptocurrency bubble is really a repetition of the past. This is a known bug in our operating system, and we have designed some parts of our society to protect us against it.
These days, stocks in the US are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, precisely, because in the olden days, there were many stocks issued that were much like bitcoin, marketed to unsophisticated investors as a get-rich-quick scheme. The very definition of this investor is: “Being more willing to buy something the more its price goes up.”

Obviously that's a rediculous claim. Just go on youtube channels predicting this BS.  To answer why bitcoin has become so big, we need to separate the usefulness of the underlying technology called “blockchain” from the mania of people turning bitcoin into a big dumb lottery. Blockchain is simply a nifty software invention (which is open-source and free for anyone to use), whereas bitcoin is just one well-known way to use it. 
 
You’ve got bitcoin with a market value of $238bn, then Ethereum at $124bn, and so on. The imaginary value of these valueless bits of computer data represents enough money to change the course of the human race, for example, eliminating poverty or replacing the world’s 800 gigawatts of coal power plants with solar generation.
Bitcoin has become an investment bubble, with the complementary forces of human herd behavior, greed, fear of missing out, and a lack of understanding of past financial bubbles amplifying it. 
 It’s all the same stuff that people say about gold – another [w]( of human investment energy. Government-issued currencies have value because they represent human trust and cooperation. There is no wealth and no trade without these two things, so you might as well go all in and trust people.
