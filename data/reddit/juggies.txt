Phone recordings of being on hold for 3 hours?
Screenshots of my account details that show there's nothing cancelled?
A case? This is a warning. They will steal your bitcoin. I'm not here to have reddit judge who is at fault. I don't need to prove anything to the internet. You're more than welcome to try to cancel and have fun going through what I've done, or not.
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, rather their awful customer service. I agree with you. However if I were using a credit card, there would have been 0 issues.

That would be nice. There was no option to cancel the booking online.
Yes I understand there should be but there was not.

What do I tell coinbase? I booked with Expedia and they refuse to refund me?

I've been a beta tester for their app since the launched support for more banks. It's not a perfect app yet, but it generally works well and when there are issues Patrick on support is the hardest working dude. Big fan!

Is the percentage part set at the employer level? Aka they send 50% to one bank account and 50% to bitwage?
Or do they send 100% to bitwage and bitwage controls what percent is forwarded on to the bank account?
