I can see it happening in a year easily, with its high fees bitcoin in its current form lacks utility, maybe the lightening network will work out, but that's all pie in the sky right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:49:30
But if there are low fees there would still be plenty of people prepared to use it as a currency. I'd happily spend a couple hundred dollars a month in bitcoin regardless of adoption if use was easy and low fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:33:00
lol 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:05:14
it's almost inevitable something will overtake bitcoin, rarely is the first moving able to establish monopoly and sustained dominance.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:47:05
What is this? I've seen it mentioned a few times and in bud light commercials. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:30:10
Wait a few days lol.
It might be at 18k by then. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:00:36
Lol, what the fuck are you talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:12:25
If your ever in Taiwan, you can buy bitcoin in every familymart. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:40:27
Honestly I think he might actually be rather rich already, but didn't want to draw the attention onto himself. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:13:58


So brilliantly British! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:21:23
And for pussy. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:08:13
Nothing lasts forever. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 08:09:02
Ive just another crustation on the barbie for you mate, got a few cold VBs in the fridge, when you coming round ya sick cunt?! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:06:04
Riding camels is badass tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:42:44
It's not the last fight to win, when scalability is still an issue. Until the Lightning Network is actually released, and if and when it's working smoothly there will be plenty more fights.  
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:57:24
Even at 25 if it’s all the time it’s pathetic, yeah sure sometimes if you enjoy it, but all the time? Nah bro. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:19:26
Not the sharpest bit in the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:34:16
Yeah probably because there are not coming. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:21:29
this. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:20:54
Yeah i don't believe most people here are doing much of this thinking. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:01:41
Anyone who is certain this going to dip is foolish. I see plenty of institutional and mom and pop investor getting on board by the day.  Few days about when it rocketed to $3300 people were telling each other to wait for the dip to buy more. Nobody can be sure what's going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:17:02
Let me check my crystal ball. Answer: nobody fucking knows. 
Personally I think there is a lot more growth coming as institutional investors get onboard. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:59:40
This is good news. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:31:29
Yeah I've pretty much shut up about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:18:26
I'm predicting $20,000 one year from now. 
We shall see. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:43:58
Incredible! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:51:59
It was a joke. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:17:23
I want to buy property in neutral bay. Need this bitcoin to moon a fair bit before that happens. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:28:37
Only getting 0.15% interest. What the fuck is he doing with it. There are plenty better options available in traditional investments.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:16:00
You think Goldman Sachs has unlimited money? What are you smoking? 
MSM media is designed with one purpose, making money. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:24:00
It's fantastic if it happens. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:19:48
Yeah this is several years old. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:50:53
Dollar cost averaging is safer but has less potential upside. It depends on risk tolerance. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:49:50
10% depending on risk tolerance. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:39:04
I don't know what to believe. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:31:15
That was deleted by the mods? Holy fuck. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:59:41
Plus you can rent it out and go live somewhere cheap like Asia or South America for awhile. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:40:07
It's okay to spend it now where you can. Help grow the bitcoin economy, then go buy some more with whatever fiat your earning. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:28:36
Can we launch child coin? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:44:53
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:01:13
This is wrong currently the total market cap of bitcoin is about 0.5% the total market for gold - about $7 trillion USD. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:46:36
But what if you can't afford one Berkshire Hathaway share?
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:48:24
Can we make this a thing? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:02:09
Monero. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:12:31
It might not drop, don't wait too long. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:12:55
I ducking hope so. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:29:57
Warren buffet has a great understanding of the financial world but thinks there is no value behind bitcoin. Isn't this exactly what you said about your wife? Cmon 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:15:55
She knows better than everyone else here how this world works? 
Might want to adjust those rose tinted glasses mate. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:34:23
Plenty of US debt held in Japan and China amoungst others. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:46:44
Cool, also where is that background photo taken? Looks beautiful! 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:15:12
There are about 1000 now. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:24:15
I'll be super excited if this does happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:16:16
Couldn't have articulated it better myself. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:11:30
Don't try to time the market its gambling. Time in the market beats timing the market. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:50:14
Why would people randomly send a btc whale extra? 
There is probably a much simpler explanation here. It's a high worth individual that's got some lucrative investments, business or very high paying job that's constantly building their stack. 
Or it's miners accumulating. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:40:16
2 days ago you asked a fairly basic question about buying btc on localbitcoin and now you are suddenly an expert? 
Yeah sure that checks out. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:03:01
Seriously, fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:29:47
If not when. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:41:48
Remember transaction fees even if minor do add up. In the end every satoshi counts. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:33:33
She had twins? I had no idea, it's easy to avoid mainstream media if you choose to. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:56:08
I'm going buy some damn nice real estate if that ever happens. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:33:33
Fuck that daily rate is incredible, brb going to make a polo account.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:16:32
 I kind of want to buy a kg of silver just as a paper weight. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:21:32
Again mate, for all the muppets here they are also plenty of smart people here. Smarter than all the people here with regards to the financial world - that's quite a claim. Is your wife warren buffet or something? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:20:58
It was a joke, he has also written a book 'The bitcoin big bang' by Brian Kelly 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:39:47
Almost at Aud$5000 too, this is wild! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:01:54
That's exactly what my friend said to me, "I'm not buying bitcoin it's too expensive" I facepalmed while explaining you could buy fractions. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:36:55
upset about smart women? 
Where have you pulled this rabbit from? 
There are plenty of smart and talented women out there. 
My comment was with regard to your hubris. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:49:24
Yeah but to say exactly when the dip will occur and by how much is pure gambling. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:56:01
Is it easy to buy say a 1kg bar of gold or silver to just gave sitting around the house? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:45:16
You are dense. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:52:10
Is this an actual Einstein quote? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:40:23
Actually their is talk in the Australian senate about our reserve bank buying btc to hold. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:40:30
You are a voice of reason amongst trolls. I'm appreciating your well thought out comments 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:23:03
The amount of people who don't understand this here is alarming. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:53:59
Not likely, so many institutional and everyday investors are get onboard. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:29:05
That's fucking ridiculous! I'm actually in India right now doing yoga in Rishikesh, great place to visit but the financial restrictions and bureaucracy here are ridiculous! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:32:03
Of course they are, Goldman Sachs got their fat grubby fingers in this for sure. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:33:08
You've missed what I said. The last comment was a comparison. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:59:28
Except that's not what everyone is doing, for every seller there has to be a buyer. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:56:46
Nah I'm not contributing, I like my satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:44:06
Personally I'd rather live in a country with better health care than the USA, practically any other first would country with government healthcare. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:31:27
Best to do both I think, take some profits off the table but you don't need to sell your entire position. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:57:54
Compare: estimate, measure, or note the similarity or dissimilarity between.
Because cryptocurrency as a form of payment is not common anywhere in China. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:39:15
I'd say yes, do it. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:52:26
I live in china, a place with half a million could be described as a village here. Not necessarily in the literal sense, but frequently enough that the vocabulary applies. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:50:27
Are you talking about your ass a little here or have you actually spent significant time in Shenzhen recently? 
I haven’t been to shenzhen recently but I live in Shanghai. There is nowhere here that accepts cryptocurrency payments, maybe a bunch of entrepreneurs in Shenzhen would be happy to accept bitcoin but at the retail level I actually doubt you would see any exposure at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:16:09
Or nice yoga retreats, hedonism isn't always for everyone but each to their own. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:02:40
Ah how I wish that will happen in Australia. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:15:20
then you didn’t have any skin in the game. You were merely interested. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:15:59

You really think it is possible Litecoin could surpass bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:57:56
He probably means the entire crypto market is worth 1.7T and that bitocoin holds it worth compared to the other coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:47:23
He? How do you know it is a guy your talking to? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:55:11
Nah cause dude can be gender neutral. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:05:22


That is what i read that as. 
I think i need to take a nap! haha
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:02:20


It's not? hahaha

Christ in a shoe box!

Yeah I'm holding pivx kind of thinking of getting rid of most of my holding... 
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:59:13
Go in, on what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:38:30
Chill dude
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:42:45
Daytrading is a great way to not maximizes gains in my opinion.  
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:01:18
What doesn't fall short?
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:11:08
Great article, thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:03:44
It is just risk averse rather than people who are investing in crypto currencies who a highly risk tolerant. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:59:29
Well played sir.

Propaganda designed to push up eth price? Or?
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:50:31
How much is peace and prosperity in Lambos? 
Seriously we live in the most peaceful time in human history. The current governments people talk about are not the war machines people make them out to be. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:34:09
They way you speak with absolute certainty is interesting. Nothing is easy to predict, especially the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:52:06
I think it's kind of both. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:38:48
Maybe he just pulled out a portion of his portfolio. It is good to have levels at which to exit. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:00:36
What was the hint?
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:06:37
You're thinking this should be followed by a real sharp appreciation?
