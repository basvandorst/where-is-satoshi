"I'm 23 and I'll school you"? Yeah, that will fix the reputation of the bitcoin community in a heartbeat.

Ok, I'm curious. How would you approach the debate?
I'm assuming you actually read the article. You will notice that he doesn't go into much detail about bitcoin. He draws parallels between statements used (by the Winkelvoss brothers) in support of bitcoin and the "goldbug rhetoric", then proceeds to skewer the "bitbugs" using slightly modified anti-gold standard arguments.
The way I see it, a rebuttal could focus on a few lines of thought. By far the most promising is finding a way to demonstrate that the gold-bitcoin analogy is false. If you try and argue in favour bullion-backed currency I see a much less rosy outcome for you. The man has been arguing this position since the early seventies, against the best minds the Austrian School has to offer. I can't imagine there are any arguments that you can put forward that he has not heard before...

Different schemes for crypto-based "electronic cash" have been around since the 1980s. David Chaum's [e-cash]( is the first one I remember, but there may have been others before it.
Granted, none achieved the level of success we're seeing with bitcoin, and these are very exciting times from crypto currencies. But calling them "new" is a bit of a stretch.

I would agree with you, but he was the one that brought up age in the first place.
