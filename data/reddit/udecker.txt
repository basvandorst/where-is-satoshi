Awesome to see some public progress - I’ve enjoyed working with this team for the past two years.  The test builds worked well, so I’m really excited to see public alphas getting out into the wild.

Names are not unique in Omni, so names cannot be “squatted" - what’s important are the asset ID (which is unique and the asset ID counter is incremented each time a new asset is created) and the issuance address.  When Bitfinex issues the offical BFX coin on Omni, the proper asset ID and the issuance address will be provided to confirm validity.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:40:08
The only thing not currently functional at the tether.to website is the automated BTC&lt;-&gt;USD₮ conversion function (it uses the Bitfinex API which is currently unavailable). You can cash out your tether USD₮ at tether.to into USD via SWIFT, and you can convert USD₮&lt;-&gt;BTC at Poloniex and Shapeshift until the Bitfinex API comes available again.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:42:18
Yes you can, via SWIFT at tether.to.  You can also convert BTC&lt;-&gt;USD₮ using Poloniex and Shapeshift.  Once the Bitfinex API comes back online, the automated USD₮&lt;-&gt;BTC conversions at tether.to will also come back online.

Omni is one of those things that doesn’t self-promote, but has just simply been running as the second-most used digital asset platform (behind Ethereum) for a while.  
Applications like the Omni Layer demonstrate the power that Bitcoin as a decentralized network can provide above and beyond simple value transfer.  
For those who don’t know, Omni actually has a built-in ICO mechanism (since Mastercoin was the first ICO) - anyone can use it to create tokens based on the tokens they receive, just like ERC-20 on Ethereum.

@_date: 2014-01-23 02:34:39
I think more of a token that is only redeemable in few disparate locations, for a limited set of items you would rather not have; a token without intrinsic value otherwise.  Which as a description is fine, if you happen to believe it is a parallel to bitcoin.  
However, the “value” of Bitcoin, and the bitcoins themselves, to paraphrase Mr. Andreessen, is that they can be exchanged independently of location, easily, and it can be made to serve any similar purpose.
These are two separate concepts in my mind, trying to occupy the same space.  And they don’t go together.
But I’ll accept this: if it’s a token, it’s a bubble.
@_date: 2014-08-07 06:27:06
I can. :-)  We’ve got a lot we’re working on… the context needs to be made more evident.
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:46:25
Depends entirely if you’re claiming that the asset you’re issuing is intended to be treated as a security (in which case, it probably is), or if you are treating the asset like an access token for the use of software (where the “interest” is simply increased functionality).
Very gray line.

This is incorrect.  Both are platforms built using the Bitcoin blockchain, which exist within the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Upon them are tokens (sometimes called meta-coins) which operate independently of bitcoins, which still being transacted on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Altcoins reside on their own blockchains, separate from Bitcoin's.

Folks, this was an integration to vennd created by an asset issuer for the Master Protocol.  Since it needs to be maintained and can be used by others, we put it into the Mastercoin repo.

So let’s start thinking about how to balance it properly, which Marx could never do.
Which market mechanisms, when used in practice, create quantifiable metrics that can be relied upon in calculations to balance the system?  We’re adding such things to the blockchain everyday.  How can we best use them?

@_date: 2014-08-25 05:47:33
In order for this to be viable, wouldn’t the banks needs to be able to get into and out of huge amounts of bitcoin at a time?  Otherwise their carry risk would outweigh the benefits.  They’re transacting in fiat to fiat, and would need something whose value can’t move around during the time it takes to get fiat in, moved, and the other bank get fiat out.

Every crowdsale thus far has taught the community something new.  Don’t fix ratios between currencies.  People need to know if there are no refunds.  People need proper expectations about liquidity.  If the crowdsale doesn’t raise the amount needed, can the rules be changed mid-way?  
MaidSafe ran the first decentralized crowdsale on an automated protocol, and things happened fast, and lots of lessons were learned.  
New ventures like CoinPowers, SWARM, etc that leverage these 2.0 protocols like Mastercoin for crowdsales should be using these newly learned best-practices such that each subsequent crowdsale will run more effectively than the last.
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:26:45
No one is claiming anything of the sort.  The work that Vennd has done is exceptional, and since an asset issuer wanted to use it with the Master Protocol, they adapted it for that purpose.  We just put it into our repo so that others could build off of that effort.

Absolutely - we’ve got Euros and Yen queued up currently, and will then be looking at other currencies (including GBP).  We (Tether) are likely not going to go down the non-currency route for the foreseeable future, so I would personally point you to Digital Tangible or others who have formatted metals on the blockchain.

Taiwanese customers are having no issue with deposits and withdrawals, but international customers can only deposit and withdraw USD₮ via the blockchain until new banking corridors are established.
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:39:56
Because they both have accounts in Taiwan and funds movements aren’t restricted between them because no correspondent banks are required, same as other Taiwanese customers currently acquiring and redeeming with Tether.
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:26:45
Bitfinex is a **customer** of Tether.  If Bitfinex wants more USD₮, they make a request to Tether, just like all other Tether customers.  Tether waits for USD to show up, and when it does, creates the necessary tethers and credits Bitfinex.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:48:58

I’ve personally spoken to the several names listed above, and although they are extremely aggressive, they (apparently) honestly believe they’ve uncovered something hideous and evil lurking underneath the Tether covers.  They likely want to be the “told you so” guys in case any of it is true.
Many of their assumptions *rely* on the premise that shady shit is going on (and thus many of their “logical arguments” then kinda “make sense”)…. but if their premises are wrong… it renders their conclusions equally wrong.
I have had constructive dialogue with each of them, and I don’t attribute anything they are doing to a concerted smear campaign.  But they also tell me I’m naive, so maybe I am.

In essence, it’s a way to tether fiat value to the blockchain, so that you can move dollars, euros, yen around exactly like you use bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:15:06
Companies, all of them, require trust.  Until someone invents a decentralized autonomous organization that can handle and manage fiat balances (and trust me, we’re trying to figure that one out), this is the best I believe that can be done, today.
Bridges bring people here, you know.
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:55:28
Verified Bitfinex users can already acquire/redeem tethers via wire (or bitcoin), as well.
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:47:28
Digital cash, directly on the blockchain!  This is extremely exciting - now you can arbitrage between exchanges like Bitfinex, Poloniex and C-CEX seamlessly, and even make purchases in dollars through GoCoin merchants.
With Tether USD₮, you no longer need to keep *any* balances on an exchange, and can hold digital dollars in your own wallet, in cold storage, or using multi-sig.
Make sure you use an Omni Layer wallet, or have control over your private keys when getting tethers.

When you hear “interest rate”, instead think “demand.”  When you hear “money,” or “assets,” instead think “supply.”
Doesn’t work that way?
That’s the problem.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:57:51
The trust aspect exists only on the redemption of the tokens - the rest of the platform - which runs on top of Bitcoin - is entirely trustless and decentralized.
Regarding the capability of redemption, every tether token in existence is published on the Blockchain, and the fiat balances that back them are audited to ensure 100% reserve.

Hi, this is Craig, co­founder and CTO of Tether, a company working to digitize fiat currencies using Blockchain technology; specifically, the Bitcoin blockchain.
There are lots of great questions in this thread. In the development of our product we’ve given serious thought to each of these issues, from backing processes, to Blockchain security, to custodial risks.
I’d invite anyone looking to engage in a scientific discussion about this topic to read our white­paper here:
Keep in mind this is the first time the white­paper has been opened up to the public. Feel free to make comments in the reddit thread and we’ll respond.
On a personal level, here is why I believe this topic is of immense importance to the growth of Bitcoin and blockchain technology (directly from our white­paper):
*There exists a vast array of assets in the world which people freely choose as a store­of­value, a transactional medium, or an investment. We believe the Bitcoin blockchain is a better technology for transacting, storing, and accounting for these assets. Most estimates measure global wealth around 250 trillion dollars with much of that being held by banks or similar financial institutions. The migration of these assets onto the Bitcoin blockchain represents a proportionally large opportunity.*
Since fiat is off­chain, there is no truly decentralized way to express fiat value accurately without a bridge between the blockchain and the fiat world. Tether acts as that bridge, decentralizing everything possible and minimizing centralization wherever possible. We are Bitcoin people, and we appreciate how important it is to minimize trust. I believe we have come as close to that as we can with the state ­of ­the ­art available to us today.
Regarding our service, here’s some interesting facts for you.
We have completed integrations with the following exchanges where you can purchase tethers right now: Bitfinex, Poloneix, C­CEX, Crypto Next, and Expresscoin. We’re about to announce integrations with many more exchanges, including more of the top ten largest Bitcoin exchanges globally. Payment processors and wallets are also adding support as we speak. 
We are happy that some of the largest Bitcoin and altcoin exchanges globally have thoroughly reviewed our implementation and find it to be the most secure and robust solution out there today.
Even though our Tether.to wallet is currently in private beta, people can still use tethers on the exchanges listed above, and also through Omni Wallet, which is an open­source, browser­encrypted wallet much like Blockchain.info’s wallet, but with support for tethers and other assets on the Omni Layer. Holy Transactions is also fully integrated with tethers. You can request an invite to the Tether.to private beta at 
Thank you in advance for your feedback and we look forward to engaging a meaningful discussion on this topic.

You can also go directly from USD₮ to dollars and vice-versa - depending on which exchange you use.  offers this as well.
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:32:05
As Erik says, BitUSD is backed by BitShares, which operates on its own blockchain, has its own value, and relies on efficient market theory to maintain the value against US dollars.  
Tether assets (USD₮, EUR₮, etc), are directly backed by the underlying fiat currency on reserve, which can only be used for redeeming the tokens.  It operates entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain, and is fully auditable. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 03:41:36

"Pegging" vs "backing" is the distinction. See my post with the Tether white paper, which describes how a 100% non-fractional asset backing is a feasible way to accomplish this without untested hedging and balancing models.

At Tether, we've been asking banks to provide an API that anyone could call and get our bank balance. They can't even imagine why anyone would ever want such a thing. :-)
From our perspective, it's about letting the world know that the reserve funds are verified by a third party. It's a feature of Bitcoin that doesn't yet exist in the normal world of currency. 
When I worked for Mastercoin, I published my address so that anyone who cared could watch that I was being compensated following the rules of the organization. 
Charitable and government organizations can also do the same, to demonstrate the flow of funds follows the intended purpose. 
People should be free to share, or not share, the amounts they hold. If it's not for transparency purposes, though, I'm  not sure the benefit, besides perhaps ego.

Tether is already preparing EUR₮, JPY₮, GPB₮, and around 7 other currencies within the next couple of months, as well.

Wow. These guys let customers withdraw within four days of the incident, and two weeks later are back up and running with a multi-sig withdrawal process. 
I hope more Bitcoin companies follow Coinapult's lead - their post-mortem analysis was updated in real-time as they walked through what occurred, communicated well with their customers, opened withdrawals as soon as they could, migrated services and implemented multi-sig to protect funds in the future. 
Great job, Coinapult!

Tether issues fiat-backed digital currencies for use on the Bitcoin blockchain.  USD₮, EUR₮, JPY₮, GBP₮, CNY₮, CAD₮, etc.  
These digital currencies are backed 1-to-1 with their underlying currency, so every unit held in a Bitcoin address has a corresponding fiat unit held in reserve for redemption purposes.
Now that this capability is available, Bitcoin users are able to hold stable currency in their wallet, which can be used to purchase items (via merchants that support ShapeShift Lens, GoCoin, etc), or can be used to withdraw fiat balances from exchanges.
Basically, now you don’t have to keep your money on an exchange, in any format, and can hold digital value protected by your own private key.  
Another big use case we’ve seen being used is inter-exchange arbitrage - you can immediately move your USD balance, for example, between Bitfinex and Poloniex to take advantage of the BTC/USD spread between the two exchanges.
Our goal is this: to get people using cryptocurrency, they have to first use something they already understand.  People understand their local currency.  If we can give them their local currency with all of the same benefits as bitcoin, they will be using Bitcoin without even knowing it.  Then, they will begin to realize what all of us already know: that Bitcoin is the currency of the future.  And by then, they’ll already be using it!

Honestly, I would assume the same: a very large pending USD₮ redeem/destruction that got filled with a big deposit during reconciliation.  One part is done by the system automatically, the other requires human input.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:46:36
As of today, no, but we intend to support it in either our very next release or the one immediately following it.  Two of our developers (Zathras and DexX7) have already begun the work necessary to get this done.  
Initial evaluation shows that 99.9% of all Omni transactions ever submitted will fit into OP_RETURN.

Mmmm.  Smoke and mirrors. ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:23:16
My understanding is that sometimes the USD₮ queued for destruction gets set aside prior to the accountants updating the bank balances.  Usually this gets replaced by incoming new deposits once the balances are updated.  In the interim, the number would look negative.  
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:07:35
As of right now, almost of the transactions are happening on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is already auditable (this includes the creation/redemption and movement of tethers).  Tether.to wallet transactions (those that occur off-blockchain) will be published via Factom.

Omni/Mastercoin and Counterparty are both open standards as well.  The “coin in the middle” is used to enable further functionality (such as decentralized exchange) and serve as an example of what assets on these layers are capable of doing.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:50:47
Sure, but Omni/Mastercoin and Counterparty are meta-layers on top of Bitcoin.  Either Bitcoin gains capabilities through the efforts of these teams (along with Colored Coins), or through hard-forks.  Both types of Bitcoin innovation should be encouraged, and this is a great place to get exposure and commentary from the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:31:00
I can’t believe you did that
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:37:44
I’m not convinced that we have to go full-centralized, but either we’re in for a long wait while the fully decentralized model gets its sea legs, or we help it along by using centuries-old techniques.
In the end, the obvious solution is the decentralized one.  But if no one ever uses it, then it stays only an experiment.

This is the pull-quote.  Acknowledging that Bitcoin is a threat, he must immediately downplay the aspect of it that could be portrayed as potentially disreputable: the token.  He’s not allowing the premise to be conceded.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:03:12




David hits it right on the head - the first responsibility of custodial companies working to establish stable digital currencies must absolutely provide transparency and full auditability on the physical side in order to establish and maintain trust.  
As new technologies arise to make this even easier, Tether, Digital Tangible and others may set the standard for providing these services in a manner that requires less trust than they otherwise do today.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:46:17
Posts like this made us (Omni/Mastercoin) re-evaluate our development plans around a year ago.  We realized that we needed to focus on a stable, fast, native reference implementation, and we focused on Bitcoin Core and C++.  The more features we added, the more we needed the core to be extensible and extremely fast.
We’re fortunate that our talented group of developers were able to create Omni Core / Master Core, using Bitcoin Core as the base.  Now we’ve got a rock-solid, stable and extremely fast parsing engine that integrators can drop in, fire up, and support meta-protocol assets on the Omni Layer.  And they do.
If the Counterparty team is interested, since we worked very hard to provide an extensible core reference implementation, we would be more than happy to work with them and get XCP merged into Omni Core so a single daemon can support both major meta-asset layers on top of Bitcoin.
