The uptrend is entirely intact... Another opportunity for your future self to thank the present.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:03:14
Major support at 10300... This roaring comeback will take no prisoners...
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:55:09
Idiots selling at 12k will regret the day...
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:31:06
Wide ranges should be expected when implementing TA on BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:05:55
This consolidation period before an epic breakout will not last for long...
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:07:49
HODL like the rest of us...
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:47:19
Guess you missed the part where BTC was a couple of hundred from 14k? You werent entirely right sorry ..
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:12:23
Deadcat bounce from that shallow selloff failed miserably. HODL
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:37:06
It's natural to take a breather and accumulate after a nice run up... The true breakout is on the horizon.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:34:14
Stay calm boys. Selling is exactly what they want us to do.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:54:47
Jesus BTC just reversed a head and shoulders at 11k... This is an extremely bullish sign.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:39:19
We're in the deep end of the pool boys... HODL
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:39:47
When BTC hits 50k then 11k will look dam bloody to me...
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:11:51
This is the part where sellers come back and buy at a higher price... we're witnessing the true value of HODLing right before our eyes.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:26:22
I'll concede... Poor choice of words.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:53:07
Looks like the sellers are tiring... They will be met with an unrelenting wave of HODLers.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:15:37
Whatever you do.. DO NOT BUY BACK...ty
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:57:28
It's time to trim your weeds(alt shit coins) and add to your flowers(BTC)... be greedy on dips!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:37:46
Pullbacks are healthy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:54:37
You're right about shitty
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:28:52
More like a cup and handle breakout
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:31:49
Whatever it is... The bottoms are being gobbled up... Nohomer
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:59:44
It's the same story...BTC price rises "I wish I got in earlier"... Price corrects "yeah not buying at these lows"... be greedy boys... There's blood in the streets!
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:09:02
Testing resistance at 11200... The breakout is cumin boys!
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:01:20
Large sell orders triggered a minor selloff at 12k... It's to be expected...
