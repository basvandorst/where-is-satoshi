Its stable version isn't yet released
Couple of days ago it was for first time tested on mainnet

Warren Buffet was the first guy who compared btcoin's moment as a BUBBLE
He was the guy who accepted he never invested in Microsoft or Facebook or any tech firm because he never knew their future.
He is a fantastic trader who is just not good with tech

Force exchanges to implement SegWit and it will be more cheaper
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:35:22
Bitcoin.com is seriously BS
Mining in India is not profitable at all
Even the answers of the quroa question referenced in the article states so
Unless you get proper Internet connectivity and cheap electricity near Himalayas
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:22:19
Yep its backward compatible
but still there are many around 70% Txs between non segwit addresses
thats messy
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:46:54
Bitcoin is a beast
At present only bitcoin's 24 hour volume is more compared to the circulating supply, it cant drop in 10s
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:52:34
To be honest blockchain can help them to claim images rights.
Just it will be little bit expensive
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:58:17
Coinbase have millions of users &amp; an on-line petition signed by only 200 users wont help
Anyways they are earning by not implementing segwit and promoting altcoins too increase their business so it will be hard to get this done.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:33:18
All the altcoins are shit baring 2-3 all others will eventually die 
but wtf 21K, Why don't I have  a korean relative or friend ?
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:26:34
That happens often with small sell orders 
Last time it took 6-8 hours to eat 17250 sell wall
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:14:30
sorry it was my bad btc/trx volume is 170K
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:57:35
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:06:27
Just read the title of the Ad
But why even compare a shitcoin to Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:41
its caused by many selling but still its just 10% compared total number of coins

i am not promoting my Chevrolet as a Ferrari by sticking Ferrari's logo on it 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:45:22
awesome man just sell all your coins just now gogoogogog
Else will be having assets worth 0 value
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:47:51
have you read the whitepaper of bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:59:13
If i am not wrong he has retired
He might be a hodler 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:40:57
how you came to those numbers ?
24hr volume is a sliding volume of buy and sell orders
I can buy and then sell and then buy in 24hrs that will double up the volume, am i wrong ?
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:27:28
Sell wall is kind of 6-8 hours of no fun as per my past experiences 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:07:50
South Korean govt announcement has had major impact on prices
Its good that it hasn't hit the 10K mark yet
But I am still hoping that it drops below 10K so we can buy more :D

16Million bitcoins are mined they aren't circulating in the market daily
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:07:10
My understanding from my limited knowledge. Even if u post r/bitcoin and r/Bitcoincash links together at lot of places you can achieve this.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:47:07
25K ?
may be when all the exchanges will implement SegWit
or on LN's stable release 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:55:03
My point of these post wasn't to promote some  other currency 
How can someone curse Bitcoin for other currency's downfall 
When Bitcoin was the reason they do exist.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:06:55
I encounter this once a day its ok refresh 
&amp; try Kraken its better No 502 or timed out or anything
 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:44:44
I agree but the point is people are mostly using crpyto-currencies to gain money in short term
To be honest each exchange should allow people to either buy or sell single coin then only people will use it for the cause for which it was developed
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:30:51
please do explain yourself
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:08:24
Its not the price that matters
Exchanges not accepting segwit that matters
Market share of bitcoin is falling that matters
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:58:58
1+1 =2 
Quick math
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:23:06
Mostly the prices listed on Coinmarket are higher compared to gdax or bitstamp or bitfinex. But its unusual as after a long time prices on gdax is lower than bitfinex or bitstamp
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:38:25
did he need to compare bitcoin to a bubble ?
Everyone is master of his own space just dont bother/influence others
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:42:13
Fear u edited the post. Slow claps
Anyways people arbitrage just now too. its that LN will increase the number of people who arbitrage (I may be wrong too )
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:53:25
Its not FUD its good everyone can earn
And only time will let us know about its stability  
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:50:18
Bull has arrived
but bear will soon follow 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:25:35
Before the recent hike he was the one who tagged bitcoin's moment as Bubble where prices were around 3K or 4K
&amp; he has publicly admitted that he doesnt invest in those stuff where he knows nothing &amp; he has even admitted publicly in the latest interview that he knows nothing about crypto
His opinion doesnt matter in case of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:54:21
Trying something to get out of  context
Should I laugh ?
FYI we all own bitcoin just because you bought a domain before everyone else so you will attack bitcoin. Its funny how alt coins' disciples are defending Ver

Comment of the day
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:42:02
The exchange issue is not minor one its like govt officials not working because they want some bribe to work
Here altcoins' trading fees is acting as the bribe amount 
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:32:36
thanks for that
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:44:54
FUD FUD FUD FUD FUD
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:39:27
They posted a blog stating that they are working on implementing SegWit on 16th dec
Its almost a month and we haven't received any update on the same.
They are jut milking the situation to earn more and i even feel Coinbase somehow is in favor of Bcash and they failed once probably they will try again 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:16:55
Not all the accounts are active
Even if 100K accounts containing 0.1BTC each closes it will be a big blow to them
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:39:48
practically you cant double in one dip
Multiple dips can help you there

if its too dumb then  why do u bother to comment  ?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:25:16
Why would a country ban a commodity which has already consumed some of its own currency to grow 
US citizens have spent billions to buy btc 
If US bans btc to usd then it will be their own loss 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:54:39
according to their statement probably in initial 60 mins u would be able to only buy
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:40:16
South Korean exchange was hacked and it declared that its going bankrupt
Bcoz of that people are selling and prices are going down and futures traders &amp; big whales are buying

Downvote,This may be a fraud 
I googled and 2nd link that i found was 
and it throws error
even their Investor Parameter has a single photo of all their concerned members 
dont fall for this kind of ponzi schemes
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:35:08
that will be too scary
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:09:09
at-least u can sell them to buy more bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:06:22
for sure &amp; even ask if he induce some sense in homo sapiens
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:54:01
Attack is mainly coordinated by an individual or a group who wants to disrupt prices mostly to promote an alt coin
So i took it for granted while mentioning fork 
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:44:09
Are you sure that Satoshi left  ?
He might be bluffing
He might have projected that his net worth will be in billions in future and that might be matter of security and even paying taxes and all
Or he might be just a shy fellow who isn't interested in self publicity
Or he might be having the fear that this wont grow at higher pace if there is a face associated with it
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:01:16
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:39:18
which alt coin u suggest ?
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:43:42
what if i mine any alt coin ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:01
Not even bankers try to supress prices when the prices are rising from a dip.
It can be a small effort by a group of individuals to supress BTC prices to promote BCH 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:16
all new investors will panic sell and the big whales will buy it cheaply
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:23:08
it was all good till 3:09 where core is converted to cash
You killed the entire feel in those 2 secs
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:34:17
last point is wrong
What's the first rule ?
Invest the money that you can afford to LOSE
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:53:33
I get your point 
but for me it was little less appealing to see core's logo flipped up to be a BCash logo &amp; i was gutted
Anyways i will watch your documentary for sure
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:36:21
This may be a stupid argument but
If by lack of supply exchanges can surge price 
then why wont they just sure prices and arbitrate the market and create dip ma&amp; maintain volatility  &amp; increase trade volume and earn more instead
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:52:33
lets arbitrage your national market
Deposit money to my bank account &amp; I will send you Bitcoins at normal market rates. We can accumulate around 1 or 2 bitcoins in 1 month
Was js kidding but if you are ready I am too :D
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:46:44
for every trade there is a buyer and there is some resistance built if the trade volume is high 
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:42:41
Everyone knows that coins bought on Mt Gox were at much lower prices but he obviously was trying to make as much as he can according to [this](  so as many did he panicked and sold a fraction of his portfolio(i.e 200K coins) 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:06:42
They do provide better Fiat deposit service and because of that they do have higher users but still 1.18% fees is too high
more number of users means more easily your trade orders are completed and that inturn causes monopoly
Still mate 1.18% is too high thats like 5x compared to other big exchanges
Even because of that many from use poloniex or BInance
&amp; just use this exchange to buyin or cashout 
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:36:03
Calm down mate
If 1 Satoshi = $64 then 1 btc will be arnd $64 x 10^8
even if 1 BTC = $164K in next 8 years then it will be great
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:01:59
its trading fees 
For this exchange my BTC balance is just a number and even when i check my address' balance on blockchain.info its nearly 0
How can you compare that to transaction fees ?
 
1.18 is almost 5x times the fees other exchanges charge
Do you work in the PR team of this exchange ?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:04:24
My only problem is that this was treated as a hedge fund or something else instead of it being auctioned or slowly sold in a upward moving market
They wanted to sell them since September then why didn't he sold as Much as they could  when the market was bullish and 1000 btc sell walls were taken down in few hours ?
Why only when it picked and when it  was crashing ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:59:44
yeah exactly, how did  u figured this out ? 
Do you have that crystal ball ?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:55:22
It was dis-hearteing to watch him moan
Once he was a strong bitcoin promoter
BTW I just have bitcoin no other shit coins

Where did you find "Crash was good"
How can a crash be good for any commodity/asset/currency ?
&amp; the worst thing was because of the crash many lost lot of money &amp; they even lost faith in Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:07:59
If that's the case then it's awesome 
Btw this news has created lot of fud 
Prices are increasing worldwide while in India there has been a small dip because of this.

This is seriously nonsense they have earned around a billion dollars &amp; they want have 1 and ideally prefer to have 5 devs working on open source platforms which is the cause of their existence.
&amp; on other hard its too hard to get decent devs who can work on platforms like lightning
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:09:27
yesterdaay's XRP boost was just because India's biggest exchange introduced XRP and dunno why everyone bought it then are still buying XRP which isnt a crypto currency (its a company's product) 
&amp; its prices pumped by 20%
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:02:32
No exchange is regulated 
So if all in regulated transactions will be banned then all the exchanges will be down 
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:11:08
There is lot of FUD
according to major news outlets all the exchanges are unregulated and depositing money to them will be illegal tbh I never had fear of India banning crypto but last night i took was scared even had [few panic posts]( not panic sell :D
but seems all is FUD and it wont have any impact on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:36:22
Article was published 5 hours ago but they tweeted just when the prices started falling 4 hours later to spread FUD. 
TBH there is nothing in the article but the title will just create FUD/panic. Only question is why publish old news again when the prices are falling ? 
manipulation everywhere
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:01:24
according to my twitter time-line people are complaining that the bank isn't processing their withdrawals
Even many are complaining that their insurance cheques aren't cleared
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:01:09
According to me this was agenda/problem is the cause of bitcoin's existence (Just my theory )
presently stock market's dip causes dip in bitcoin prices
&amp; to keep in mind Bear market wont be arriving in coming future so till then Bitcoin will be evenly distributed
Once the money is evenly distributed amongst laymen, billionaires, stock brokers, bankers etc in different countries
It would be more like gold, dip in Stock would hike up Bitcoin prices
The best part is it will be better than gold as there aren't ways to use gold in making daily transactions while for bitcoin many new apps / platforms are under development or in testing phase so believe me or not but in long term Stock market bear will be beneficial for Bitcoin (I may be wrong but I may be right too js like the schrodinger's cat theory)
PS : even posted the same comment somewhere else too few mins ago 
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:17:15
awesome sell all your bitcoins gogogogo
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:15:00
To be honest its misinterpreted
Goldman sachs has just declared that that most Cryptocurrencies would fall to zero &amp; that will be the case
Their are like 1000s of altcoins which doesn't make sense, there should be ideally 1 or 2 crypto currencies only but by the end of 2020 there will be maximum 5 cryptocurrencies
Its evident even in the lastest big dip all other altcoins were struggling for their existence 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:39:10
Yes but we cant expect it to retest 6000 for at-least next  few months
latest pump is like the one we had in nov 2017 where the resistance was around 9400
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:09:38
yep fear^2
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:32:22
is it js 2000 or 16000 BTC moment ?
8 wallets have 2000 BTC moved each on 26 april 2018
