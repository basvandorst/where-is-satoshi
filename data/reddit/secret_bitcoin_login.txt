True. (But it can be easier to link your wallet to your identity than you might guess.)


Not really true. The entire network agrees on the bitcoin protocol,  that's the only reason it can work. People do squabble about the future development of the protocol, but everyone agrees what it is at this moment.


This is true, but it's not the whole truth. Satoshi chose to remain anonymous and the real community respects his anonynimity. The search for Satoshi is really a mass media thing. Bitcoin isn't about Satoshi, it's about the protocol and it should stay that way.


The community does need real leadership, but Satoshi is a founding father, not the future leader. In order for bitcoin to thrive it has to stand on its own and be anti-fragile against one leader. For all that Satoshi has brought to bitcoin it would be anti-fragile for him to lead the project again. 


This is hyperbole. The worst case scenario is that it would dilute the market by 1/20th, and the markets would fall, but the magic of bitcoin isn't about the exchange rate, it's about the stateless transfer of digital currency from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world without permission. If Satoshi cashed in it would have a fast and dramatic effect, but bitcoin would recover and be more resilient in the long run. I say "more resilient" because people can't harp on about his coins.

Wait! the wallet you're using is not recommended for new users. The bitcoin-qt wallet requires a syncing process that can take several days (not kidding). 
I would really suggest that you check out [this]( site and choose a wallet that will meet your needs without causing you to wait for days. The Green Address wallet is a great multi-platform wallet. I would recommend Mycelium if you're an android user and breadwallet if you're an iOS user.
Since your friend has already sent a transaction to your bitcoin-qt wallet you can still recover those funds easily, but it will take a few console commands to export the private key.

I believe you will have more success predicting the future of bitcoin by examining what it _CAN_ do rather than what it is _CURRENTLY_ doing. The markets that bitcoin is on the verge of opening right now (probably micropayments and remittances) are nowhere near the full potential that it has in the next 15 years to open up much wider markets like worldwide self-managed banking and microtransactions managed by machines rather than people [(IoT)](

You shouldn't limit free speech because of the possibility that people might break the law. Instead, law enforcement needs to pivot to identify those who would break laws using decentralized markets. It's obvious that drug use should be decriminalized, but there ARE laws that the majority of us agree with, so rather than preventing commerce, law enforcement should deal with the violators.

Okay, I [read your comment history]( a bit and it looks like you've been paid in bitcoin and just want the cash, is that right? If that's your plan we can help. I would encourage you to consider holding until after July, but we can definitely help you sell if that's your intent. 
You want to open up the bitcoin debug console (from the top menu) and run the dumpprivkey command for your receiving address. the command might look a little like:
    walletpassphrase yoursupersecretwalletpassword 600
    dumpprivkey "1524THEADDRESSWITHCOINS"
If things went well you'll see a new long string of digits - this is your super secret private key.
Now, if you want to sell them, you can take that private key to somewhere like coinbase.com. They have a feature where you can paste that long number and they will credit the coins to your account for immediate sale. They WILL require you to submit personal identification and bank information before withdrawing the money from the bitcoin sale.

Please understand that I mean you no disrespect and I'm not trying to argue with you.
DBAN is not a formatting tool, it is an overwriting tool. It actively overwrites every bit on a harddrive multiple times. After a completed DBAN no data will be recoverable.
A full windows format is not significantly different than a "quick format" except a full format checks for bad sectors and marks them in the partition table so the OS doesn't attempt to access them - trying to perform IO on those bad sectors can lead to CRC errors, boot failures, BSOD's, lockups, etc.

I call bullshit. So what if Luke-Jr has really weird religious beliefs? It doesn't prevent him from contributing code to bitcoin or supporting the community. The beauty of bitcoin is that it **IS** math, so it doesn't matter what he believes as long as he obeys the algorithm. If anyone doesn't like the code he pushes they're free to use any other codebase that obeys the algorithm. 
So, yeah, I think his beliefs are nutty, but I like that he has the freedom to believe those things and he's still forced to obey the blockchain. He has a history of these stunts, and you're free to join the majority of the network that excludes foolish behavior.

Bitcoin is SO MUCH MORE than an investment.. people keep calling it "stock" and "shares", it's just much more than that. It's programmable money. It's a complete paradigm shift in the way that we think about transferring and managing value. 
Anyway, whatever those people say, bitcoin will only grow stronger and more resilient in the next few years. I don't know what the long term will bring, but my bet is on it showing tremendous success in the near term.

Decentralized marketplaces are VASTLY different than silk road. There is no "third party" managing the servers that keep all of the data. There's no sysadmin. The code runs independently on the blockchain and bitmessage networks and cannot be (easily) be censored by a third party. So.. your product listings aren't written to a server in some data center, it's all maintained in the bitmessage chain.
A determined third party might be able to shut down a few nodes, but it would be an incredible challenge to take down the entire network.

You may not have observed the changes, but I can tell you they are real and dramatic. When I started in 2011, no one had heard of bitcoin. The first public acknowledgements of bitcoin were jokes or calling it a scheme. Since that time, thousands of websites have begun to accept it, there is serious discussion of it as a real method of exchange, Venture Capitalists are putting money into it. I've seen 10-15 television programs where bitcoin is mentioned spontaneously (and I don't even watch TV). So.. When I come from my perspective three years ago of "no one has ever heard of this" to today, where people are beginning to consider it, things have changed drastically.

A "full node" means running the bitcoin-qt application that downloads the full blockchain: 30 GB of data.

Hello! I think you were very close to booting Linux from the usb drive, but you will likely need to include the nomodeset parameter.. It is very easy (Google can hook you up).
There are also lots of ways to accomplish your goal with varying levels of security that will all work fine in 99.999% of cases. If you feel confident that your install is clean, download the bitaddress.org page then take your computer offline to generate and print a wallet. Run mac janitor (or whatever people use now) shut your computer down, and restart before reconnecting and you'll be fine.
As with any security, nothing is perfect, but you should always implement the best measures you have available. I feel like a lot of people are going overboard by suggesting that people overcomplicate the process because a few people have had bad encounters.

That's incredibly unlikely. Tux didn't develop with the reference client, he developed his own transaction stack in php.

Yes, that is my understanding. The caveat is "as long as there is a demand". If something has a significant negative impact on the demand the exchange rate would logically fall. 
Those things that might decrease demand include:
* undiscovered software bugs
* a better system that replaces bitcoin
* successful restrictions to the bitcoin network
@_date: 2014-05-18 15:44:42
This is part of a recognized cycle in bitcoin exchange rates. I'm not interested in technical analysis, but my experience tells me that the stages look a little like this. (This is rough and oversimplified)
1. News event triggers new investors.
2. Price climbs as new investors get involved.
3. New investors become irrational ("To the moon!") and push the exchange rate FAR above the demand. (the bubble)
4. New investors panic and sell (some at a profit, some at a loss), this creates the crash.
5. At some level the exchange rate normalizes (as it has now around $450)
6. The rate will stabilize for several months (the last stabilization was over a year).
7. Rinse, wash, repeat.
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:38:03
Well, not exactly. It does increase the available supply of coins, but that was by design. 25 new coins are created about every 10 minutes. This will continue until about August 2016 when the reward will decrease to 12.5 coins every ten minutes. The reward will continue to halve every four years and at some point it will be a fraction of a coin. In the long run, the total supply of coins in existence will be very close to 21,000,000.00000000 coins.
This model is intentional - the purpose is to promote a fair distribution of bitcoins to the most motivated miners.
The new coins don't have a direct effect on the exchange rate of bitcoin. The exchange rate is controlled by supply and demand, so only coins that are being sold at the time affect the price. If I find a block and receive a 25 BTC reward, I'm going to store those coins for a rainy day and it won't impact the exchange rate at all.

I'm thinking about selling something like OpenBazaar T-shirts. I think there will be a growing demand for them as the platform develops, and they're relatively easy to produce. My wife also has an etsy store that I might persuade her to list on OpenBazaar.


I'm a hacker - in the sense that I don't know how things are supposed to work, but I can try every combination until it DOES work. It wouldn't be fair to call me a developer on the project, but I have been maintaining the code to test the product in a virtual machine. I'm involved because I believe in the project and I want to help it grow.. and improve my python skills. I am a contributor. This thread is part of my contribution to raise awareness :-)


The ultimate "how" is still being worked out, but it is likely to use peer discovery similar to p2p (torrenting) to locate other peers, and link those peers to a store maintained by each node (each end user). You will also use your node to browse and search other stores all within your web browser. Transactions are handled using multi-signature transactions, with 2of3 signatures required, that's the buyer and seller who release funds upon receipt of delivery, with the third signature held by an aribiter. This is a big deal because multisignature transactions have only been usable for about 5 months and they make this type of venture possible.


Your guess is as good as mine. The Proof of Concept is very fragile, but it is real. As I watch and provide my skillset (basically organization and linux virtual machine support), I'm aware that the project will require help from people with p2p and blockchain coding experience. There are currently lots of forkers, but few committers. I would guestimate that given current progress a testable alpha (capable of transactions) could be running some time in June.

I mined bitcoins in 2011. I got discouraged after the $30 crash and put my HDD in storage. The next time I heard anything about it, the price had increased back to about $12 per coin, and inaba was describing the first ASICs that would be manufactured and sold in about six months. I took my entire stash and bought miners from BFL. And I waited. And I waited. I was so concerned that they were going to be delivered during my summer beach trip in June 2013 that I canceled the trip so I could wait for them. They finally arrived in February of 2014 (I think).

It has been awhile since I compared the wallets, but I think Armory and Electrum are regarded as the best and most secure. I feel comfortable recommending both of them.


This is because of Know Your Customer (KYC) laws and supported by FinCen guidance in the US. Businesses that operate in the United States and exchange money are required to collect all of your personal information and perform a prostate exam before exchanging money with you. There aren't many easy ways to get around this I'm afraid.


I would limit your testing of services to those that are well regarded. Each service you give your information to is subject to data breach that could put your information in the wrong hands. It happens every day with big banks and big business, but there's no reason to to be more exposed then you need to be. 


Again, here's one of the frictionless beautiful features of bitcoin - you can already pay for any service through your changetip wallet. There's no special feature to be built. If you withdraw funds from changetip and enter them into a bitcoin payment field at newegg, you are paying for that service.


Not generally. This may be regarded as "exchanging money" and it requires government permission, a saliva sample, and two hairs from your firstborn. Blame government, not bitcoin. There ARE some hints that [blockchain.info]( will make that possible, but we've been waiting a LONG time with little public progress.
Also - I failed to mention  - it's a very well regarded wallet service (and smartphone app) that is a cross between a web wallet and a desktop wallet. It generally offers high security and it does not control your private keys (you control your private keys through a complex password). A lot of folks rely on this wallet. If you check it out, please use a very secure password, back it up, 2FA, etc. etc. Thefts HAVE happened, but always because of poor end-user security.
Keep them coming. You have excellent questions.

Do you really think the doc will scare them away? Banks aren't risk averse (unless you're a customer) - they are eager for new revenue streams. These hazards will be meaningless to any bank when they figure out how to monetize bitcoin for profit.

I'm imagining that the bot manager will use the accounts to upvote or down vote content to influence front page content. The ultimate goal is likely to influence the exchange rate and make favorable trades.
It might look like this:
**Monday:** al queda discusses using bitcoin to fund terror campaign. (The bot buys on the dip)
**Tuesday:** California passes law advocating the use of bitcoin in VC. (the bot sells at the peak)
**Wednesday:** Bitcoin linked to human trafficking in recent child abduction case. (Buy)
**Thursday:** Coinstar approves plan to exchange change for bitcoin by the end of August. (Sell)
Anyway, its clear that selected news - whether true or false, can seriously impact the exchange rate. When the votes of 5000 bots are behind the news it gains some illusion of legitimacy.

You'll notice that those two sources put the decimal in a different place and that's sometimes confusing for new folks. One bitcoin is currently worth about $475.00 USD


The time for mining has passed. I say this as a friend and a former miner. It is pretty much an industrial undertaking now and you're not likely to realize profit from mining.


Probably, but I'm not aware of any code that currently exists to do that. If you did write the code I can promise you that you will never earn _any_ bitcoin (not even 0.00000001) - but the proof of concept is probably possible.

This is a tricky question. As a new bitcoiner I would suggest using the  wallet on your desktop and iOS. We don't "combine" bitcoin storage - every wallet (no matter how many you have) is a standalone wallet... BUT, if you log into your blockchain.info wallet you can share the credentials between your desktop and iOS.

Come on! You're better than that. Late shipping is the norm in the mining industry because BFL set that standard.

You ought to acknowledge/disclose that you also received the first mining unit prior to actual shipping. That would give motive for you to speak highly of the company.

If you are _REALLY_ determined, I'll be glad to help you troubleshoot this GUIminer/slush stack, but I'm afraid you are living in the bitcoin world of a year ago and not the present.

I really suggest that you study up on [kalroth's cgminer]( and mine an [exchanging pool]( As a matter of fact, it looks like you're using windows, there are [prebuilt binaries]( of that miner for windows.

To be honest, I'm a bigger fan of letting the facts speak and banning incendiary people. Shitcoins are not a threat to bitcoin, if some other cryptocurrency shows up with more benefit than bitcoin we should all migrate toward it. The fact is that all of these altcoins are testbeds for innovation that might work within bitcoin, and if they strike gold bitcoin can integrate that success into its model.

Your description is pretty okay. I think the problem is that people don't like to be told what they think. I would work to avoid phrases like "you think" to describe your perceptions about the beliefs of others.
Also, it is fine to regard bitcoin as a "token", but some of the dumbed down technical explanation is a bit confusing. It might be better to call it a "digital token" and focus on the blockchain, not the exchange of tokens.

Sorry, I wasn't going to respond to this because any response would sound trite.. but I'm going to do it anyway. It is actually a GOOD thing that bitcoin is a trustless system. In the banking world we live in today, we are **required** to trust third parties - from the Government that issues currency, to JP Morgan/Chase, to Bank of America, to Paypal. We can conclude with near certainty that these entities are acting in their best interest rather than our own - and we are forced to trust them.
A trustless system doesn't mean that we can't be friends with people or act in good faith - it simply means that EVERYTHING can be accomplished without having to believe that someone else is acting in your best interest. The OP is not yet prepared to act as their own agent, so it isn't wise to extend trust to anyone who would abuse that trust. When she is knowledgable about how to act in her own best interest, she can ensure that her good will isn't being abused.
It's really no different than a mentally disabled person who inherited an undisclosed amount of money. Would you expect that person to appropriately act as their own agent in choosing someone from the internet to help withdraw those funds and pay bills? I wouldn't, and you shouldn't.

You have a solid strategy. Invest only what you can afford and do it incrementally. Don't let yourself stare at the exchange rate, you'll only go insane more quickly.
Hoarding is fine, but you might try to use a bit of your stash to actually buy things with bitcoin.

You've been around long enough to know that no one's opinion is as valuable as your own intuition.. but ... I sold my LTC and stashed most of it bitcoin, and picked up some of the newer innovative coins with the rest. Of course, the moment I say this, Litecoin could explode again.
The problem with LTC is that it's not substantially different from bitcoin anymore. Back in the day it was "silver to bitcoin's gold", but now with more innovative 2.0 coins that offer different features (notably anonynimity and contracts) Litecoin simply doesn't offer enough to remain a valid contender.

There have been around a thousand "blockchain 2.0" technologies that started off with a pre-sale. I can't think of a single one that has really matured to the point that it was actually worth the initial investment. There _HAVE_ been cases where I profited from greater fools - but none that have actually lived up to the hype.
It's time for developers to show a product before selling something. OpenBazaar and DarkWallet are two great examples - they haven't over-promised and keep re-iterating by developing from their initial PoC.

Sure, as I explained earlier, we have a pretty serious troll problem here - even people who are paid to be jerks. It's wild and complicated. The friendly community does exist, but it is often hidden by protective measures against people who have other motives.


The big difference here is that Apple will make lots of money from you. Bitcoin doesn't profit from you. Bitcoin is not company with shareholders, it is an open source distributed network with lots of good guys, lots of bad guys, and lots of competing interests.


Just to provide some background since we're building a positive relationship - the techniques of scammers and trolls include coming here and saying the exact same things you said (as a form of begging).

Security _IS_ a big deal, and it's very important that you take some basic precautions to secure your bitcoin, but I also see a lot of overkill. Using air-gapped dedicated computers in a EMP shielded bunker 60' below bedrock is not really necessary. 
I suggest that you buy 1/10th of one day's salary in bitcoin and just play with it. Move it here and there, back and forth. In time, you'll realize that it's not scary and is really simple to play with. There's a time and a place to create secure wallets, but it's really simple. It takes me about 5 mintues to create a multi-signature offline wallet that is insanely secure.

That's an excellent question. I have had a node running for a few years, it doesn't have a noticeable impact on my electric bill the way a miner would, but I'm estimating I pay about $6 a month in electricity to run it.
I used to run the node on desktop hardware, but every time it lost power I would lose all of my connections - even if this only happens once a year it's still upsetting when you're playing the uptime game.
My current setup uses a modern laptop running ubuntu linux. I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, but it does work well for me - the smart thing would be to use a Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), but I don't have one available.
So, anyway, I installed ubuntu server 14.04 with no additional packages, and just the bare minimum for a bitcoin node and ssh access. 
My favorite metric isn't actually uptime (that's easy - it's the "score" you get when you run 
    bitcoind getnetworkinfo
Basically, you get a couple score points every minute your node is live as a way to describe your network reliability to other peers.
Lastly - Doing this on a RPi may be possible, but I would strongly suggest using hardware that can keep up with the network. The RPi won't actually support the network because of the lag it will experience processing requests.

I want to add... If this were my drive, I would never work on the original drive, there are too many risks. I generally begin this kind of data recovery by cloning the drive. I use a tool called dd or ddrescue for linux, but I know there are other tools (I think I used to use something called ghostery back in the day). 
By working on a clone of your original drive you can guarantee that you'll never be worse off than you are when you start. 
I bet you could even take your drive to a trusted computer shop and ask them to clone it for you (don't tell them why) and they shouldn't charge more than $50 for the service.

CSRF is related to a web attack called Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). End users shouldn't receive those errors, but it is possible in this case because you are authenticating at changetip using your reddit account. runs changetip and he may be interested in replicating &amp; resolving that problem, or at least documenting it.


Hmm.. you're getting there. Your kids will want to have their own wallet, and we haven't really talked about what a wallet is yet because it's kind of an abstract concept. And while I _AM_ building trust in changetip, it's not wise to store your children's nest egg there. Don't build the nest egg yet, but when you do, you'll be interested in an offline cold storage wallet, like one provided at  [This]( video seems to provide a decent introduction, but I haven't really watched it. Again, don't do these things until you have a better grasp of the big picture.


changetip **IS** a wallet, you can send funds from there to anywhere. It is great for multipurpose sending, the only thing you need to keep in mind is that you're not the only one with access to the wallet, in fact, the owner of changetip holds the private keys that actually control the wallet and he generously allows you to use his service.

I'd say it's clearly not difficult to use, but it will take several years for the world to understand WHY they would want to use it. In psychology there's a concept of "learned helplessness". One illustration is that a elephant who has been staked to a pole for 15 years won't walk away from the pole when the chain is cut - the elelphant isn't aware of what it can do and isn't aware of new horizons. People in the current monetary system are the same: they are used to the status quo and aren't aware that things could be better if the system improved. In time, the world will begin to cross paths with bitcoin more frequently and eventually understand the promise and benefit it brings.

I've learned that all bitcoin pundits are fair weathered friends and they're not going to shut up regardless of how bitcoin performs.

I have debated this with myself for a long time. When you have a few coins, $0.02 is nothing, but I remember when I started, mining seemed complicated and I just wanted ANY kind of deposit in my wallet to see it do something. I was really happy when someone dropped a few cents my way. 
I also remember when it was common to tip 0.25 BTC, which would have been about $0.50 at the time - when we were using bitcointip. That would be valuable to anyone right now.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:01:45
That's right. They're posting their wallet address. You can share that with anyone who you might be receiving coins from . It will almost always start with a "1". Your private key is a super secret.. you generally won't even see it yourself unless you try. It will start with a "5".
I'm not sure how much bitcoin you intend to invest or hold, but you should plan to keep less than 5% of your net worth in a blockchain.info wallet. They ARE secure, and I do trust them - but if you are investing large sums you need to 1) wait until you understand bitcoin a little better 2) use offline cold storage.

That sparks an interesting idea. It reminds me of the windows license loophole where you could buy an OEM license if it was attached to a piece of hardware (that's how I remember it, but it doesn't seem correct now).

I'm sorry to hear that the re-scan didn't find the coins.
I wouldn't panic yet. As I mentioned previously, time is your best friend in these situations. I would recommend removing your SSD and "putting it on ice" (that's my term for setting it aside where you know you won't use it). I generally type a note with EVERYTHING I can remember about the situation - what you did, what software you used, the addresses of your wallet, etc. Write down literally anything that could be a useful clue. I would take that drive and seal it in a manilla envelope for awhile. You need to take some time to research, think, and learn.
Here are some hints:
* I would want to get a clone of the drive. I have even been known to clone a drive and make two copies - one to work from and one for reference. Do not degrade your original media any further. 
* In this case it doesn't matter if the drive is SSD or platter drive (because the drive hasn't failed), we're actually dealing with a software operation here.
Here are the possible scenarios I can think of:
1. The coins are still in the wallet.dat that you have but you have made some sort of mistake recognizing them.
2. The wallet.dat file is still on your SSD in an "unlinked" state but recuva didn't pick it up - possibly because of a parameter issue, possibly because of fragmentation.
3. The data has been deleted and will not be recoverable.
This is really the time you need to take some time to think without acting rashly. If you have any plans of recovering your wallet you need to stop booting into Windows 7 on that hard drive. Each boot will write additional data to the drive that risks overwriting old data. It is VERY surprising what will remain on an older drive even after months or years of use.
At this moment, the most likely course of action would be to use one of the "python-based bitcoin private key carvers", these are homegrown tools that search hard drives for signatures that look like private keys and extract them. Before you do this, I would encourage you to take a full week to slow down and consider your options carefully.

It gets old hearing people complain about vendors driving the exchange rate down by converting bitcoin to USD. There are other important factors in the mix..

Sounds like a lucrative idea for an exchange to modify the sell price by adding a few cents to the exchange rate. As a matter of fact, it could even be regarded as a profit model - maybe an unethical one if you fail to disclose it. The problem is that smart money is going to buy the cheapest coins they can find and the exchange adding a surcharge will eventually suffer a lack of business.

I'm a sucker for _ANY_ physical manifestation of bitcoin. These poker-chip style coins don't hold any value, but they're neat to hold and give away. I saw that has been advertising these in dozens of subreddits, and I was curious.
Here's what I know:
* I love the weight. They are pretty heavy and don't feel cheap. They make a solid thunk when you drop them and are well suited for flipping in your hand/between your fingers.
* The manufacturing quality is pretty good. The designs on the edge are pretty cool.
* The coin face has a nice sandy texture to it. Not gritty, but rough enough to keep the chips from slipping off each other.
* I love the size - I don't know if it's a standard size/weight, but it is just right.
* Shipping was very fast. I didn't expect to have them today, yet, here they are!
* Expensive. I think I paid $3 each. I would value them around $2 each.
* The image quality is somewhat grainy.
*  ~~It appears that one side of each coin has the image applied with a sticker. I can't be certain because I'm not ready to destroy on in the name of science. If it is a sticker, it is well applied.~~ It is **NOT** a sticker. With feedback over PM, I picked at the face and found that the printing is directly on the chip. It is a higher quality than I initially estimated.
So.. Yeah. I'm glad I got them, I think I overpaid a bit, but they are a neat possession.
**Update:** I carried these when we went out to trivia with friends.. I was VERY impressed with the quality of manufacturing in the coins. I banged them, dropped them, and rubbed them against each other - they still look brand new. They're higher quality than I initially believed.

I am aware of the dissension, and I considered removing the last point because it seems to be the only one people can see.. but I'm leaving it because it is SO big. You're imagining a complex DAC, but I think there are far simpler implementations in progress. When these products hit the network they will solidify bitcoin as the de facto currency of the modern world. Part of the reason the already fast adoption of bitcoin seems kind of slow to us is because it isn't operating in a native environment - we're trying to use a digital currency in a physical world. When DACs become a reality bitcoin will operate in a native environment and grow with far more fluidity. (\*Admitting that none of this has been proven, and I may be expressing some fantasy)

Step 1) Don't trust anyone. Bitcoin was developed to be a trustless system. You are likely to receive messages on reddit from "kind" users who are willing to help. Ignore them.
Step 2) Don't trust anyone. I recommend against contacting a local geek and asking for help. Anyone who is knowledgable about bitcoin will also know how to steal them underneath your nose without your knowledge.
Step 3) Take your time. If your husband held onto bitcoin it's because he had faith in their success. As long as you don't make any irrational moves, that bitcoin will stay exactly where it is until you learn enough to access it.
Step 4) Archive the hardware. If I were you I might stop using the family computer until you learn more. If you can check his history in Firefox you might easily be able to see what bitcoin related sites he frequented, this might help you know his storage methods.
Step 5) There are a couple things that might help us help you get a rough estimate of what you're dealing with. Are you comfortable posting a picture of his computer hardware used for bitcoins? Are you comfortable posting his username on reddit?
Step 6) Don't trust anyone. Not even me.

Please feel free to ask questions all day long (without accusing me of being hostile!)


This is actually a complex question. Web wallets are generally not considered to be "secure" because the site maintainer has final control over your funds (rather than you having final control over your funds). I do trust several web wallets with small amounts of coin, including coinbase and changetip, but at the end of the day I only trust storage where I hold the private keys - like a local desktop wallet. I use other services freely and trust many of them, I hold the private keys to my other funds. I encourage people to keep less than 1% of their annual earnings in online wallets, and learn about local and/or cold storage if they intend to keep more than that.


Most of the public services have developed a decent system for managing coins, but I recommend using a 2FA (2 factor authentication) wherever possible. Many thefts transcend 2FA by attacking the service itself, but it is always good practice.


You can send tips to any reddit, twitter, or google user and they will receive a notification on their respective account. Your email address is not required. This is the beauty of bitcoin. Simple and frictionless.


This has been foolish talk for years and there's no evidence that it is making any progress. It's contradictory to the foundational privacy laws of most countries and will likely not happen in our lifetimes anywhere without a revolutionary fight. As far as linking that identity to bitcoin accounts - any user can generate thousands of bitcoin accounts all day long and there's no mechanism to stop them.


I cannot predict the future.

So... there are a couple factors to consider here.
 
* Unless you open up port 8333 on your router to the bitcoin node, you will never have more than 8 connections. This is not regarded as a help, but rather a hinderance to the network. If you plan to run a full node you'll need to open port 8333.
* Each block has to be verified by your local node and this can be a very processor-intensive event. You'll need to be sure that your computer can keep up with the blockchain and continue to process new blocks as they are added to the chain.
* 4 days is not really unlikely, but it depends on the other factors I mentioned. I think you're probably experiencing a bottleneck by having port 8333 closed.
* When you DO open port 8333, you can hover over the rainbow colored bars in the lower right corner of bitcoin-qt and see how many other clients you're connected to. When you connect to many other clients (30, 40, 50, etc) you may also experince processor overload. Unless your system is fast and robust, you may need to manually limit the number of nodes you connect to.
* The torrent is fine, but you've got nothing but time. If you're in it for the long haul, you might as well just finish the download.

The hashrate is not that closely linked to the exchange rate. The fluctuations you're seeing are not a true representation of the network power.

Great question! No government monitors bitcoin - it is self-monitored by the bitcoin network. The transactions are ALL written to a worldwide ledger called the bitcoin blockchain, so every time I send bitcoin to someone it is written in the blockchain and shared with (currently) 1600 people who keep a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain.
Bitcoin is monitored by the math behind it - fraud is never really a question because the system monitors and corrects itself if someone tries to send a fraudulent transaction. The beauty behind this is that we don't have to trust people who are corruptible - we trust the math of cryptography.
Here's a small bit to get started. Changetip is a private company that handles transactions alongside the bitcoin blockchain.
2500 bits

I would no longer recommend the full client to new bitcoiners. There are lots of other excellent tools developed and maintained by the community that work very well. Bitcoin-qt is a "reference client" - it is not intended to be all things to all people, but it should set the standard for managing the blockchain.

We really should refute some of his bullshit with facts.. A few things that stand out to me:
[rpietlla]( on bitcointalk keeps a running tally of bitcoin holders that is the best known metric (that I'm aware of). The last survey was in April 2014 and estimated 1 million holders - though it was revised down from 2 million. When you consider that bitcoin itself is an opensource project with no corporation behind it, that's pretty impressive.
He says that there are "only 250,000 people using bitcoin". That statement alone is an indictment of his entire conversation. I don't know the actual number of bitcoin users, but I can make some estimates:
* Coinbase surpassed [650,000 users]( a year ago. Do you think those wallets are empty? I doubt it - how many people would complete identity verification on a service they wouldn't use?
* Blockchain has [over 2 million wallets]( ([currently around 2.5 million]( which is interesting, but probably not the best metric. I have two accounts myself and I imagine others do as well - and those numbers don't reflect the number of wallets in use.
This whole concept that bitcoin is a scam by the lucky early adopters and they have taken the money and run is foolishness. The biggest holder is Satoshi by mining when he started the blockchain - and none of those coins have ever moved. There ARE other big holders - but notice that people like the Winkelvii, Richard Branson (Virgin Atlantic), Patrick Byrne (Overstock), and Tim Draper (Venture Capitalist). If I'm choosing between the fellow who is trying to push a book and these guys - I'm probably going to side with the guys who put their money where their mouth is, not the guy who's trying to make a buck off of me.
I wouldn't want to offer this guy additional publicity, but it would be interesting to see someone like Max Keiser confront him directly. The truth is that he's making a buck by riding the wave - he wants to be the guy who make a buck by providing fuel to the people who distrust bitcoin. 
Let's also address the exchange rate - it has fallen significantly in the past year, which is honestly a great opportunity for new adopters to get their foot in the door. Regardless of the fall, the exchange rate has gone from $0 to $350 in five years - can anyone point to other commodities that have performed that well? (Really - I don't know.) I really think our current exchange rate is due to Willy the MtGox trading bot, and it's odd to me that others don't seem to believe that as well.

This can get a little complicated.. I don't gamble but I can share two hints with you:
1. You can send funds to any gambling site you want if you first send them to a middle wallet. I suggest an account at coinkite.com. This effectively rinses the association between Coinbase and your gambling site.
2. You mentioned looking for sites in the US. Look into using a VPN, then you can send coins from anywhere.

People who wish to stay anonymous (often because they're breaking some kind of law or evading taxes) prefer not to link their identity to their bitcoin purchases. In most cases it is a non-issue.

They're pretty similar. Circle is the new hotness because you don't have to link your actual bank account, you can buy using a credit card - but they do require identity verification that includes some pretty private information. Both of these businesses are regarded as "third parties" like banks - it's fine to purchase bitcoin from them, but don't assume that they will secure your bitcoin for the long term- that's your job.


You don't need bitcoin-qt to create a cold storage wallet. There are a hundred different ways to store bitcoin, but it's kind of difficult to help you choose the right one without a conversation.

**Description of Exchange**
 Exchanges bring together brokers and dealers who buy and sell these objects. These various financial instruments can typically be sold either through the exchange, typically with the benefit of a clearinghouse to cover defaults, or over-the-counter (OTC), where there is typically less protection against counter-party risk from clearinghouses,[1] although OTC clearinghouses have become more common over the years, with regulators placing pressure on the OTC markets to clear and display trades openly.[2][3]
It does appear that the Mycelium market is more closely related to the description of an exchange than "craigslist for bitcoins".

Talk about it and share your interest with other people. We call this "bitcoin evangelism". One of the biggest hurdles we have to overcome is helping people realize that bitcoin isn't for the tech-elite, but it's for everyone. It will still be a few years before things are "so simple your grandma could use it", but things ARE easy enough that pretty much anyone who has average (or slightly above average) computer skills can participate in the bitcoin revolution.
Here are some talking points:
* Bitcoin is not about drugs or anarchy. It's about giving people control over their own wealth.
* Bitcoin isn't anti-bank or anti-government. It is literally agnostic about these things. People may choose to adopt these agendas, but they don't exist inherently.
* Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be generated and there is a financial incentive to buy and hold early.
* It might take twenty minutes to figure out how to spend bitcoin, but once you understand you realize that it spends VERY easily and smoothly.
* Bitcoin is a technological infant like email was in the 1990's. Things will only get easier and simpler to use.
* Despite bad press, bitcoin hasn't been hacked. There have been lots of web services that were hacked while trying to learn how to secure bitcoin.
* You can buy bitcoin in less than 30 seconds (usually) using a credit card at Circle.com 
* Bitcoin is about more than the exchange rate (the "cost" of a coin). The exchange rate really has very little to do with the reality of bitcoin and is confusing &amp; misleading to most people. Bitcoin will succeed regardless of what the exchange rate is.
There's one guy in New York who stands by a fountain and just gives bitcoin away while answering questions (Sorry, I don't know who you are)[Found a link though!]( You might think about inviting people to a meetup or a community Q&amp;A.

Funny .. I dreamed about cryptocurrency/bitcoin last night also.

There was a specific focus on the tech people because they posed the greatest threat to the status quo. Just a dream. Anonymous was involved but I don't recall the exact context. It was some kind of retribution for Occupy Wall street... Which we discovered was the original "analog version" of identifying dissenters.

Eligius, Btcguild, and slush are all good choices. None are big enough to mount a 51% attack, but all are big enough to hit a few blocks every day.
I personally prefer eligius, but you may want to learn more about the pool operator (luke-jr) before you point your miners there.
Slush's pool (mining.bitcoin.cz) is great and slush is well regarded, but time between blocks can get close to 24 hours. That doesn't change the overall payout, but it can be tense waiting for a block to hit.
I've only used btcguild in passing. Its fine I guess, but it has never been my preference.

I set up a dedicated machine on an isolated network to run it.. and I can confirm that it does appear to work as advertised.

On the other hand, it does appear to work and is an extension of the PoC of decentralized markets.

The Recuva search shows some database files.. It also shows that the area where your wallet would be is relatively undamaged. The damage that has been done is from your installation of Recuva on the existing drive - you can see that it has overwritten some data. You really must stop using this drive - the data is being overwritten while you're searching.


I'm not completely clear what you mean here.


No, I'm sorry. Not unless bitstamp has some crazy feature that I'm not aware of (and this would be a horrible security flaw for them). The security of bitcoin is that you absolutely cannot work backwards from your wallet address to your private key. 
Here's the thing - even if the wallet is destroyed or partially overwritten, there are still tools that you can use - namely [PyWallet]( to find the private keys and recover your funds. I don't usually do this, but I think we might make progress talking about where your data could be. If you want to PM me we can arrange a google chat.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:31:57
is incorrect. Formatting does nothing to the existing data on a drive, it only creates a new partition table. A partition table is kind of like a big spreadsheet (database) that links file names to inode numbers (a unique number for each file). You might even think of a partition table like DNS for your hard drive.
Formatting does not generally harm any data. I have completed numerous 100% recoveries of formatted windows drives.

The thing is that the tomfoolery is not a secret. It's documented in plain view on the block chain and monitored by lots of people and systems. If a pool goes rogue it can be corrected without significant difficulty and that pool can be appropriately sanctioned (and banned). It's not trust - it's  a supervised trustless system.

I think you might be referring to the different uses of the comma and decimal. The decimal is used as a place separator in some places, but I believe it's used in the American sense here. I think it's "430", not "430k"

That's not completely true. blockchain practically forces you to download a backup of your wallet. I imagine if someone knows how to access TOR they know how to use a backup. Multibit has a pretty simple procedure for importing the blockchain.info wallet which provides full access to the funds.
\* It turns out that Multibit has removed this function from newer clients, but older versions (0.5.17) can still be used. There's also a tool on [bitcointalk]( that suggests it can help with the process.

I'm not really sure what you're trying to prove here. The price that people buy or sell at is personal - they aren't really under a strong obligation to tell you about their own finances. Obviously, it would be preferable if they didn't lie. It may be dishonest if the intent is to modify the behavior of others, but people have a responsibility to practice due diligence on their own.
The moral is: no one owes you the truth about their personal finance. Its not a conspiracy, its just none of your business and something most people lie about frequently.

I bought a couple Baron Figs when I first saw Adam's post - I think it was this summer. I bought them as gifts, but I liked them so much I kept two for myself. The quality is excellent, and they're very distinctive. I use one of them every day and I love the way it has aged - I'm very hard on my materials, but the aging has actually caused me to appreciate my Baron Fig even more. It looks "worn in" without appearing worn out.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, it is pseudoanonymous. It does provide relative anonymity, but it makes no claims in regard to being anonymous, and does not attempt to be anonymous.
If you somehow found a way to generate fraudulent bitcoins and submitted transactions, they could be rolled back by something called a hard fork - which is basically, 51% of the community agreeing on a network decision. In fact, in [2010 a bug was discovered]( in the bitcoin code that allowed coins to be fraudulently generated. The network agreed that this was a mistake, the software was updated, and the network was rolled back as if it had never taken place. Since that time no significant attacks have been successful against the network. You can see a full record of the [exploit history here](
As far as bitcoin being hacked - the fundamental protocol is very secure. It is backed by ECDSA, SHA512, and RIPEMD-160. If any of these protocols were breached the client could easily be upgraded and the community would vote on whether or not to implement the change by using the new client - or not. You can see the [full protocol specification here]( 
There are lots of layers and services on top of bitcoin that may be subject to hacking, but as bitcoin matures this is becoming more rare - SysAdmins are developing better techniques to secure their servers.
We do trust encryption every day in every facet of our lives - from online banking, https, nuclear codes, and WPA2 wireless security. Some is better than others, but the encryption in bitcoin appears to surpass other encryption protocols that we've seen.

Hey! We're glad you're here! 


badges and karma come by active positive participation at reddit. We evaluate people by their contributions - so when you've been here awhile and helped people or make interesting and/or insightful comments people hit the "up arrow" and give you votes. When you have a couple thousand of those upvotes (called karma), we regard you as a positive contributor and you're more likely to be showered with love. As a new user, you're VERY welcome here, but we have to remain skeptical of your motives. Perhaps you're a bot or a troll trying to manipulate us, or someone who generates new accounts every day to attempt new schemes to get free stuff. We generally don't give tips to brand new users because of the very (very) high likelihood that they're trolling and/or spamming.
If you hang out here a year and wind out with over 1000 karma points, I'll be glad to share a £10 tip with you.

Mental illness and its role in crime is very frequently misunderstood. Having a mental illness doesn't offer a "get out of jail free" card because he is still knowledgeable and accountable for his actions, but being aware of a mental illness could allow this community (and the legal system) to better understand his behavior.
If you find yourself saying, "no one in their right mind would do this.." there's a fair chance you're accurate. That still doesn't diminish or excuse the crime.

There is absolutely no contest. Linux is very well developed and established - anyone in the world who touches an electronic device is likely to come into contact with linux several times per day. Even if/when Bitcoin reaches its full potential, it will be a smaller project than linux because their scopes are wildly different - Bitcoin seeks to fill a niche for currency and stores of wealth, linux serves MILLIONS of uses already - from running your phone, the Internet, websites, smart TV's, kiosks, store POS's, cars with advanced OS's... and linux is just getting started. It's just not conceivable that the use cases for bitcoin could ever eclipse that of linux.

Great questions and concerns.
CyanogenMod is a high quality professionally developed ROM for android. It integrates security features and cutting edge is features into Android which are often later adopted into the main repo. It also eliminates carrier bloat and preinstalled software from the carrier ROM that you're likely running.
ROOT rights are a legitimate concern, and they aren't taken lightly. Users have ultimate control to grant root to applications of their choosing on a fine grained basis.
CyanogenMod also offers security features like baked in SELinux and per-app privacy controls. Basically, I get to decide whether any app gets to access my personal info (like location and contacts).
CyanogenMod IS a powerful tool, but anyone with a very basic understanding of security can use it to be more secure rather than less secure.

Because the miners require a small fee to include your transaction in a block. With no fee, or a small fee, you will have to wait until a miner has mercy on you, this could take 10 minutes or 2 days.
You can get around this by changing your wallet fee to "generous fee", which might charge you ten cents ($0.10)  to send a transaction AND have it included in the next block.

I think our views are more aligned than you are aware (in this case anyway). I repeated the phrase "American citizens" because it does confer responsibility and ownership, but I use the responsibility to point to our mistakes, not my perception that we are somehow better or more entitled (We certainly behave as though we are more entitled). 
I do not feel like US citizens are experiencing freedom right now. We have had the mantra of freedom pressed into our heads since birth, but we cannot be free if we live under constant surveillance and insist upon surveilling everyone else in the world. Surveillance is only one of several grand mistakes, but the one we're discussing here.
If I let my teenage daughter go our for a night on the town and I track her location with GPS, record her audio, and have people "check" on her without her knowledge it would suggest that I don't trust her and she isn't truly free (we might refer to this as being on a short leash). I don't think the US government has the authority or the right to treat anyone in the world this way and it saddens me that they have chosen this path rather than one of liberty.
As I've said, I think voters (I think that might be a more acceptable word for "American citizens") have a responsibility to vote those decision-makers out and promote a country that is a healthy and vibrant contributor to the world community.

Ethereum is just the contender to fill that space at the moment. I have come to the conclusion that ether doesn't represent a store of value, it is only fuel for contracts. I believe bitcoin will remain the dominant store of value and ethereum (or similar) will find a niche in organizing DAO's. 
To say that ethereum is pre-mined suggests that the mined coins will have substantial value, but I think the value of ethereum (or similar) will come from the DACs and bitcoin transactions while being fuelled by ether. It won't be free, nor will it represent a substantial store of value.

Just as a thought, why not title it something like "Everything you thought you knew about bitcoin is wrong - well, mostly." and then launch into debunking the common misconceptions:
1. Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.
2. Bitcoin went bankrupt when MtGox went down.
3. A good hacker can crack bitcoin and steal all of the coins.
4. The government will make it illegal and no one will be able to trade.
5. If your computer crashes you will lose your bitcoin forever.
6. Bitcoin is "free money" to the early adopters, and pointless to everyone else.
7. Someone with a powerful enough computer can make all the bitcoins they want and dilute the value.
8. A supercomputer will "crack" bitcoin and render it useless.
After you debunk the foolishness, people will begin to feel curious about what bitcoin actually IS - then you can focus on the present and future:
1. Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger that is shared by everyone on Earth and controlled by no one.
2. With proper precautions, bitcoin can be stored securely forever, even persisting if the entire bitcoin network is crashed.
3. Bitcoin enables very cheap and efficient transfer of wealth from anywhere to anywhere with the click of a button.
4. Bitcoin has no central authority to make silly rules that would ruin the value of the coin.
5. There will be a hard limit of 21,000,000 bitcoins, but these coins can be subdivided infinitely, so we'll never run out. (The 8 decimal place limitation is not set in stone.)
6. Bitcoin development is moving at the speed of light involving innovation in a thousand different directions. (multi-signature transactions, colored coins, side chains, decentralized markets)
7. Bitcoin has very little to do with trading and getting rich, but everything to do with re-imagining what currency is and who actually controls wealth - (banks/governments vs. individuals)
8. The inherent value of bitcoin and the blockchain AREN'T what we see today, it's in the potential that bitcoin will unleash as it develops in the coming years.
Anyway, just a few ideas to chew on. It may be a foolish approach.

Before you tinker too much, I'd do a few things:
1. Set the phone down for awhile. Use a text editor/spreadsheet to create a list of every possible password (Without actually trying it).
2. Get a backup of your phone &amp; app if possible. I don't know what your setup is, but you might be able to do an adb backup, use titanium backup, or backup your entire phone rom. Save the current state you have as much as possible.
3. In my experience, you're at a "near miss" phase. There's a 50% chance of recovering you wallet, and a 50% chance of losing it. You can make choices that increase or decrease those odds. If you act without a plan you will certainly decrease the odds.

Don't worry, this rabbit hole goes pretty deep. There's a bunch to learn!


"bitcoin" is simply an application built on top of the blockchain protocol. There are no businesses or companies that are directly controlled by bitcoin, anyone who participates in bitcoin is simply a part of it. Coinbase is one exchange, there are several with different advantages and disadvantages. For example,  lets you buy with a credit card, but they charge a little more and have lower limits. Coinbase is well regarded, but they require you to link your bank account. 


The general sentiment is a mix of two perspectives:
1. "WTF!? This can't possibly get ANY worse. What the hell is wrong with the bitcoin market!?"
2. "Hold on boys, this rocket is going to launch ANY SECOND!"


Most people continue to hold bitcoin based on its future potential, though many of us are eager to support businesses that support bitcoin.

I don't find that to be a concerning scenario. One of the blessings of the altcoins/clonecoins is that they are treading ground that bitcoin hasn't encountered. A solution to this has already been developed.
Following step 1, Core devs would implement the [Kimoto Gravity Well]( in the reference client and add resistance to long block times caused by spurious hash rates. There's obviously no point in doing that now because there's no assumption that the scenario will occur. Because hashes are produced by ASICs, there's no real reason to assume they'll go offline within the span of their hardware life.

Two things:
1. This survey asks about discovering bitcoin and perceptions toward bitcoin, not the standard questions of "how many do you have" and "how high will it go". That makes it a win in my book.

Thanks for sharing. We're not too different. I'm a [(-8, -5.7)]( though I admit to a continued struggle with many of the political concepts. For some reason I always imagined myself as a (0,0), but that wouldn't be any fun, now would it? I think our recent history of US presidents has pushed me farther into the libertarian spectrum, though I still identify as a "liberal" rather than a libertarian... probably because I perceive the libertarian party in the US as being far right of center.

I don't see the problem.
First, create two accounts at slush. (Easy).
Open up cgminer using the credentials for your first account.
Press "p" to open the pool dialog.
press "a" to add a pool.
input slush's pool info:  and your username/pw
Now you should see one or two pools.. add or remove them until you get both pools listed, ~~0: and 1:~~ (the numbers don't matter.) 
Now hit "C" to change your management strategy.
choose "4" to balance the mining.
press space to return to the main dialog. You should see a line that says, "Connected to multiple pools" and you should see shares going back and forth between accounts. I'm actually doing it for giggles right now just to make sure I'm correct.

Your questions are welcome - they're nothing that hasn't been discussed for five years already.
The coins aren't generated out of "thin air" - if you believe this - then go ahead and generate some... but you can't. They're the product of mining, which is a very intensive computer process. Mining isn't just for fun, it has a very important purpose. Miners are solving mathematical problems that ensure the security of the entire bitcoin network. The reward is given to promote a fair distribution of coins and to subsidize mining until transaction fees provide a greater reward than the "block generation reward". Transaction fees also go to miners, but right now they aren't significant. Some time around 2020, mining fees will be a greater reward than the block generation reward and miners will work just to earn the transaction fees.
To think of mining as "free" or "out of thin air" is inaccurate. People pay upwards of $10,000 and lots of electricity to create blocks "out of thin air".
Please, by all means, continue to work to understand how this works - but realize that you're not uncovering some vast conspiracy. These are all well-thought out and understood concepts.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:43:48
I wouldn't sweat that. Mass adoption tends to come in waves and my contention is that a new wave is coming. Very few of my current friends actually understand bitcoin, but they're missing the boat anyway. I was an evangelist when the exchange rate was $2 and my friends thought I was crazy. When it shot up to $30 everyone asked me why I didn't push them harder to invest - very few of those people (if any) bought in and they are the same people who are still trying to decide when to buy now. All I can say, is be willing to talk about it with people who ask questions, but realize that 99.9% of them are too scared to put their money where their mouth is.

Changetip is providing a wallet for you right now, the problem is that someone else has ultimate control over that wallet, not you. You can send and receive funds, but you don't "own" the wallet. Wallet ownership is a little more complicated, it is based on a cryptographic key called a private key - it's a little advanced for today's discussion.


You can send funds anywhere, changetip will work just fine as a multi-purpose wallet for small funds that you are willing to lose in a hack.


There are things called "bitcoin faucets". You would need to google them and beware of scams, but they do exist - they give you tiny amounts of bitcoin to play with. You don't need to use the faucets since you have the tip I gave you - the faucets will only provide fractions of a cent.


I don't know exactly what this means, but we do recognize that financial regulations have made it somewhat difficult for new users to obtain bicoin. This is because of government regulation, not by our doing.

No one needs to vouch for bitcoin. It is mathematically secured. It's considered a trustless exchange because we've found that trust is often abused.

Multisig is great, but this post reads like an ad for BitGo, which is less of a "BIP 16 implementation" and more of a  third party wallet manager. If two of three keys are required to sign transactions and they hold two keys (to your one), they really control the wallet.
For anyone who is new to bitcoin - if you're not in control of the signing keys (private keys) the bitcoin aren't yours, they're someone elses.

I don't know of any great sources off hand. The company (Butterfly Labs) is currently spending money to buy and change Google search results related to the fiasco. You might search for highly voted posts related to bfl - there should be a lot of them. I might go look on your behalf. Also, try searching for "bfl class action".
The basic idea is that butterfly labs told customers they would be shipping ASIC miners very soon and had numerous delays which were not clearly explained to purchasers (they actually said something like "we don't owe you an explanation, we don't work for you, you are only customers"). Anyway, many people waited over a year after spending cheap bitcoin ($10 bitcoins to buy a $1300 product). By the time the miners eventually shipped the market was flooded with other miners and difficulty skyrocketed. The actual mining return on the miners was around 3-4 bitcoin over the life of the product, which, as you might guess, pisses people off when they paid ~130 BTC for a miner.
The real fault of BFL was lying to purchasers about their actual timeline. They repeated that shipping would begin "in two weeks" for nearly a year. I actually canceled a vacation to the beach once because I anticipated that shipping was _just_ about to begin.

The concept of investing didn't really develop until after it peaked at $30 in June of 2011 (or was it 2012?). I felt in my gut that it was going to be big, but at the time I didn't really consider buying it with cash. People thought I was crazy, my wife thought I was crazy, and I was pretty sure I was crazy as well, but it just made sense at the time. After the first bubble burst (the $30 bubble), I just figured it was like so many other fads that had come and gone, so I put my hard drive in a drawer until I heard about ASIC miners and a renewed interest a year or so later.
The point is - it wasn't about money, it was about a new model for transactions. If I had considered money I would have maxxed out my credit cards to buy.

I just started to wonder if we might benefit from a flair system that helped new users identify well regarded sources. Even something as simple as a "T" for trusted users.
That makes me begin to think of bitcointalk's system, but his trust system is oriented toward trade, and I'm only referring to information quality.

what do you think about the pic?
We're only 14 years into the 21st century... I'm not a smart man, but passing the Turing test, developing 3D printing, self-driving cars, mobile device development, and voice recognition all seem like a quick list of other impressive developments in this century that might have wider (current) implications than bitcoin.

There is [$1.24 trillion USD]( in circulation at the moment and bitcoin has a market cap of [$6.3 billion USD]( That's an order of magnitude difference. At current exchange rates you could buy the entire bitcoin ecconomy over and over several times with existing cash in circulation. While you may consider cash a ledger receipt, it's incredibly fungible. Ask [Pablo Escobar](

You hit the nail on the head. Buffy made his money investing in sectors that he knows well. He admittedly doesn't know anything about bitcoin and would logically not make an investment there. He also sat out of the tech boom for the same reason. The thing that's odd to me is that he derides bitcoin. I think he does that because he expects bitcoin to follow the same boom/bust scenario that tech stocks did in the 90's - an assumption that someone who is completely unfamiliar with the sector might make.

First, I have to admit that it's interesting to me that you use a lot of our lingo (circlejerk, eli5) and knowledge of comment editing for someone who just discovered reddit 12 hours ago, but as I stated before, we are glad you're here and interested in learning no matter what your background. To tell the truth, I'm really a 9 year-old girl posing as a bitcoin nerd, so I understand whenever anyone uses a false identity here.


You hit the nail on the head. Many of us are weary of this community because we've been inundated by trolls and idiots in the past year and a half or so. There's no easy way to get rid of them, so we just work carefully not to feed them. We've become very skeptical of anyone we don't recognize and have some positive interaction with. So, with that said I do encourage you to hang out and build a positive reputation while learning more about bitcoin - we always need people with open minds and kind words to help out the new folks.

I would say the difference is that Reddit is sharing virtual equity\* in an existing developed company, not bootstrapping something that doesn't exist. With the altcoins, the developers were often trying to develop something of value out of thin air and then cash in on a premine. With Reddit, the asset is real and it exists, the coin is being developed to represent that existing asset.
\* I know there were clarifications that suggest it's not actual equity, but the concept still remains.

That's a wild assumption. I don't know what would really happen, but I wouldn't give up on bitcoin; in fact, if it collapsed, I would buy up all I could. I'm probably not the only one who would do that ... and suddenly, it has scarcity and value (hence, it didn't collapse).
In addition, banks may freeze electronic assets, but it's very easy to buy bitcoin with any fiat cash that has value. It's difficult for anyone to put a stop to that.

The protocols are stored by the full bitcoin client that many people run - most often recognized as bitcoin-qt or bitcoind. They download 20+ GB of data in the full blockchain. Each of these clients is called a node, and each node uses the protocol to police the network.
This is distinct from miners - miners obey the protocol, but they don't house it or verify it (in fact, mining software can be amazingly dumb and simple); miners are solving equations to secure the network and submit that completed work to clients who will verify that it adheres to the protocol.
It is possible for the client (node) and miner to be housed in the same operation, but the emergence of pools has generally separated these functions.

1. The transaction fees go to the miners (in addition to the block reward) for including your transaction in a block.
2. Over time, mining fees from transactions will become a greater incentive and block rewards (currently 25 BTC) will halve about every 4 years. At some point, transaction fees should provide a sufficient reward for miners to keep mining.

The problem with an FAQ is that things change REALLY fast. Seems like six months ago there was no Circle and people were still trying to win on Mt. Gox. I currently like the bitcoin.org site for organizing information and helping people get started, but I don't know of any FAQ that can keep up.

First, call it what you will, but this is an advertisement for bitsharesx.
Second, There are literally hundreds of clone coins and 2.0 coins seeking to distinguish themselves from the herd and garner the respect of bitcoin. It is obvious that this goal would be accomplished by having these organizations publicly recognize the value of your coin.
Finally, nothing prevents your organization from holding deposits for these orgs until it reaches a substantial amount and then offering it. If your donation is easily converted into $100,00 USD or 200BTC I couldn't imagine anyone turning you down.
Good luck.

If I can guide your fun: you can mine at 110 Kh/s* on a RPi with cgminer and learn everything you want to learn about the process. Those 2 GH/s miners are literally worthless now. The 0.2 BTC you could buy with $75 will always be a better bet than those miners.
If you just want to understand mining, mine with the hardware you have and get actual coin with the money you're saving.

$460 doesn't mean shit. If it happens, we'll buy and things will move on. $490 doesn't mean shit. It's an exchange rate, it doesn't accurately describe the value of bitcoin --- because none of us know what the actual value of a bitcoin is.

I'd say that's the ideal case.

it does work with quota, but you're splitting your hash up into smaller segments, so the "lns" is going to decrease.

Turn off your machine. 
I assume you're using something like Windows 7. 
You can use a deleted file recovery tool like Recuva to pull the files off, but you'll need to be careful that you don't overwrite them in the process. This usually means booting from a different hard drive, but if you're gutsy you can do it from this install (not recommended).
When you recover the files (you really only need the wallet.dat file, don't worry about the others), be sure not to save them to the original disk - save them to a flash drive or something. Keep the original disk safe until you're completely sure you have the coins.
Time is on your side. Be patient. Be very patient. The data won't be destroyed unless you make a foolish move. Formatting doesn't remove the data from the drive, it only unlinks the name and makes it more difficult to access.
I'll be glad to answer any questions and provide support.
\* There's an excellent chance that a copy of the wallet.dat file still exists even if you've reinstalled an OS on the disk. Don't worry.
\* The correct file (even if deleted) could remain on your encrypted USB drives. Keep those to the side for now as well, but just be aware that recovering data from encrypted drives is somewhat challenging.

I don't need to rationalize it. The bitcoin blockchain stands on its own. If people fail to adopt it now, they'll eventually recognize the revolution.

**from wikipedia:**
In Internet slang, a troll (/ˈtroʊl/, /ˈtrɒl/) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people,[1] by posting inflammatory,[2] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response[3] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.[4]
interestingly, the kids have a different interpretation:
**from urbandictionary:**
 One who posts a deliberately provocative message to a newsgroup or message board with the intention of causing maximum disruption and argument 
wikipedia (likely the older users) have a concept that a troll is someone who disrupts normal conversation and uses off-topic messages, while urbandictionary (likely younger users) views it simply as people who cause disruption and argument - which isn't always a bad thing.

Isn't the entire point to upvote relevant content and downvote irrelevant content? It's not as if he said "upvote those who share my agenda". I think the problem is that the concept of trolling has been so watered down that people don't have a clear understanding of the behavior and few people will agree on what is and isn't trolling. So we wind up with a definition that's something like "trolling is anything I don't like" - which couldn't be further from the truth.

I'm afraid you're mistaken. The ultimate goal isn't to generate wealth, it is to secure the network for the foreseeable future. Establishing many chains means that some chains will be weak at one time or another and it opens the opportunity for bad actors to disrupt those networks by repurposing hashes. It may be possible to support 2-3 networks, but the altcoin situation is not a long term solution.

I wish everyone - mods included - would recognize that bitcoin is more than just bitcoin. Bitcoin is blockchain technology. We will all be judged by the success of blockchain technology.

I think that's where my frustration lies. Lots of us have been overwhelmed with foolish behavior on reddit and I've considered a few other forums that might have a more rewarding structure... but it really makes me angry to see valid contributors removed while so much low level foolishness carries on unabated. ~~Sure - I agree that he violated the rule~~ (I really don't know if I believe that. He encouraged appropriate voting... I think..), but if the rules don't work, cool heads would improve the rules not punish the users. If reddit is going to march forward successfully they'll need to keep up with the rapid pace of change, not just stick to their guns.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:19:41
My recommendation:
If you are storing wealth that represents less than 1 week's salary, use the Electrum desktop wallet with a strong password that is backed up. You won't have to download the blockchain and Electrum is regarded as secure.
For storing wealth that is greater than one week's salary, use a hardware wallet like Trezor (about $100) or print paper wallets that are backed up in multiple secure locations.

I've always loved the concept, but been very concerned about making such a huge target. It just seems so difficult to verify the security of this kind of install. checksums are great, but that's not to say it doesn't have a keylogger or some other trickery pre-installed.
I'm not against the project, to the contrary, I really hope this or something like it succeeds, but it will need to have a pretty strong guarantee of security and I don't know what that would look like.

Let's be aware of the difference between mods and admins. mods (like theymos, hardleft121, and bashco) can ban and moderate on any subreddit (like bitcoin or iama). Shadowbanning is a sitewide decision that comes from an admin (kn0thing, alienth, jedberg - and a whole crapton of people I barely recognize). This was apparently a decision proposed and approved by site administrators - people who get paid to run reddit, not volunteer moderators.

I haven't had an opportunity to follow the news today but I gathered that this was a RNG attack.

Lots of top layer services will be centralized. That's not a real problem as long as people don't depend on the centralized top layer service instead of the blockchain. Bitcoin IS decentralized, it would be a mistake to expect every service based on bitcoin to be decentralized. I think there's a lot of room for improved decentralization as we move forward, but if we demand that now we'll never make progress. tl;dr: baby steps.

There was an EXCELLENT table published a week or so ago (?) showing the popular wallets and how they compare with each other.

This is a talk I'm glad to have.


refers to readers and subscribers of It is a self-selected population of people who are interested in learning more about bitcoin.


Users who post with high frequency regardless of whether the content is accurate and meaningful. This includes users who post sensationalist information without concern for the truth.


Scientific polls mean little to me these days. Science is flawed and rewarded for publishing and confirming hypotheses, not for identifying truth. (yes, I recognize this is not a widely held view, and one I generally keep to myself)


Content that does not add information to the conversation but is sufficiently attractive to enough users to accumulate upvotes. i.e. "to the moon!"


No. Quality and upvotes are often not correlated. 


The content should stand on its own merit, it should be unique and sourced to the best of the poster's ability.


This community is composed of several different groups of people with wildly different perceptions of what comprises good quality. Here are what I believe to be the three largest constituencies here:
1. Those interested in bitcoin as a technological solution to a mathematical problem.
2. Libertarians and other politically minded people who have a wide variety of opinions on how bitcoin should impact current and future governments.
3. Speculators and investors who are focused on the exchange rate and the potential profit they would like to realize from their involvement with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.


More often than I'd like. I tend to exercise better filters online than in the real world, but I do work to build consensus and allow people to feel welcome. I work to keep my mouth shut rather than condescend.


I find that the bitcoin protocol itself is an eccentric and revolutionary idea without attaching it to other causes (like politics and finance) that are more likely to polarize adopters than stimulate growth of bitcoin.


You have no idea. Your speculation is offensive and unwelcome.


Your comment leads me to feel otherwise.


Certainly. I will always strive to reduce my own ego and seek humility. I apologize if I came across otherwise. This thread was not an attempt to condescend to any users, only to establish a standard for interaction with the rest of reddit.


I have been developing a reasoned understanding of the various viewpoints and approaches to bitcoin for over three years. It seems that my progress does not meet your expectations, but I cannot change that.

The bitcoin hashing algorithm is single purposed. It secures the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:45:03
Dual booting will not serve your purpose here. The point of being offline is that any hacking tool that did discover your private keys would not be able to exfiltrate those keys. Simply having the keys on a different partition will not prevent this.
However, it sounds like you're thinking of excessive security measures to begin with. Creating strong passwords is a great start, but make sure you're not going to lose them. Generating paper wallets are great as well and protect against hacking.
While security is important, being secure shouldn't prevent you from exploring bitcoin. The people who go on and on about security are probably making a poor cost/benefit analysis of security.
Be smart, be secure, but above all - be realistic and use common sense.

I get that you're being snide, but I think you actually have a legitimate point. Consider ELI5. How long should it take for something like eli5 (or showerthoughts) to demonstrate utility and get a million subscribers? Obviously not long - they're not doing anything new, just providing simple explanations (or interesting ideas in the case of showerthoughts). Bitcoin is a new paradigm and requires support infrastructure that has to be built from the ground up. The concept bitcoin is still in its infancy and none of us know how it will mature - will it be used by individuals? Businesses? Banks? Its not really surprising that we're not exploding as a Reddit, but that doesn't mean the concept has failed. For 99.9% of the world, bitcoin is something they "might use in the future", not something they are ready to use at this moment. This Reddit is for the 0.01% of people who see the potential and want to participate in the revolution.

I'm going to have to vehemently disagree with you. 6400 global nodes reflect people who were willing to download the full 20-30GB blockchain and open a port on their firewall to be visible to the bitnodes survey.

The only measure that has suggested that bitcoin is "dying" is the deflation of the bubble. If you look at a longer view you would see that a little more than a year ago bitcoin was trading at $100, and just about three years ago it was trading for $3 a coin. Bitcoin is exploding, but it has nothing to do with the exchange rate.
Venture Capital in bitcoin is growing quickly and going full steam. Everywhere I look on the internet I'm seeing evidence of bitcoin. The infrastructure is being rolled out in every direction - multisig, tipping, 0 confirmtation transactions. Gemini and Coinbase are opening as full exchanges. We're seeing projects like lighthouse and OpenBazaar as proofs of concept for how bitcoin can change the world. 
Bitcoin is not dying, it is becoming more real every day. The only people who think otherwise are people who are too lazy to learn about the technology and only know how to stare at an exchange rate ticker.

Bitcoin is open source source software - it can be compiled and distributed by anyone. In early 2013 it became popular to "tweak" this open source software and redistribute it under different names; dogecoin is one of the children of that process. For the most part, none of these cryptocurrencies are "companies", they are re-factored open source code. Bitcoin is the largest and most robust of these coins. You can see the status of bitcoin and other popular coins here:

This is a bad, bad idea. It's neat if you want to understand the concepts behind running a full node, but absolutely horrible for making _ANY_ contribution to the network.

I'm not really even sure that's disputable as it was publicly described as a limit on altcoin discussion.

That's not really true. An old computer could just as easily have a keylogger or bios exploit that could transfer your data to a third party. Just because the exploit wasn't initially designed to target bitcoin doesn't mean it couldn't be used to do that.
Additionally, older hardware is often not compatible with the latest software, and you may be forced to use an older version of software to get things working, this would introduce known vulnerabilities that have already been patched.

...and... "Simplified Payment Verification" still doesn't show up in this thread.
From [Mastering Bitcoin]( 
**Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Nodes**
Not all nodes have the ability to store the full blockchain. Many bitcoin clients are designed to run on space- and power-constrained devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or embedded systems. For such devices, a simplified payment verification (SPV) method is used to allow them to operate without storing the full blockchain. These types of clients are called SPV clients or lightweight clients. As bitcoin adoption surges, the SPV node is becoming the most common form of bitcoin node, especially for bitcoin wallets.
SPV nodes download only the block headers and do not download the transactions included in each block. The resulting chain of blocks, without transactions, is 1,000 times smaller than the full blockchain. SPV nodes cannot construct a full picture of all the UTXOs that are available for spending because they do not know about all the transactions on the network. SPV nodes verify transactions using a slightly different methodology that relies on peers to provide partial views of relevant parts of the blockchain on demand.

That's right. The electricity used by miners is related to competition to solve blocks (by solving more hashes than other miners). Adding transactions into those blocks is sort of like a side effect.

There is a HUGE difference.. I'm not the most qualified person to describe it, but in simple terms, buying bitcoin is owning control over a private key and the ability to be the sole controller of those coins.

We used to tip by sending bitcoin directly to an address, but it was a bit cumbersome. developed bitcointip to improve the process and it integrated directly into blockchain.info, but transaction fees can be onerous for micro transactions and we were concerned about the block size limit - everyone was pushing for services that kept internal accounting for small transactions but allowed entry and exit points on the blockchain. 
I have to admit, I was VERY weirded out by the changetip concept initially. I even said as much to when changetip started, but the model has worked well and I'm impressed with the progress it has made.
The inline tipping needs to be stupid simple and we need to realize that wallet addresses are a bottom layer - not something everyone needs to be exposed to.
The only troubling issue is that any bitcoin you hold in changetip aren't yours until you withdraw them - this could be improved if changetip developed a multisig wallet recovery system, similar to what bitcointip did with blockchain wallets.

One of the benefits of not knowing the identify of Satoshi is that he can't be the face of bitcoin. The face of bitcoin is.. bitcoin. We don't have to worry what Satoshi's motives are because the code speaks for itself. The code cannot be used in a malicious way - it's not like Satoshi could have coded some secret backdoor, the code has been studied FAR too deeply for anything like that to exist. None of us know the fate of the Satoshi fortune and there is always a likelihood that he could cash that in one day. The rationale of any company that accepts this risk is that bitcoin is a game changer. It will change the world in the same way that credit cards and cell phones did... I predict that the world won't be radically different, but bitcoin will be recognized by the world as an obvious integration. 


Miners are not a trusted third party. They are untrusted just like every peer. They must prove the validity of their work in order for it to be accepted. I repeat, there are no trusted third parties in bitcoin. I'm not sure what Peter was referring to, but I suspect this was a misunderstanding on your behalf. 
I don't find those things to be paradoxes. Bitcoin is transparent and private. There is no true anonymity and people shouldn't expect bitcoin to provide that. Scarcity and infinite divisibility are concepts that promote the success of a tool that exchanges wealth. Liberation, freedom, oppression, etc.. All of those are the work of philosophers. It seems that everyone who understands bitcoin seems imagine relative to their own political perspective.. bitcoin doesn't inherently address any of these. Why so much worry about China? If this were a purely US venture we wouldn't have the benefit of interacting with the rest of the world. Miners are bound to the rules of the protocol just like everyone else, no matter where they live. I know there are people who are smarter than I am who can shed more light, but that's what I know.


I sort of see where you're coming from, but as time goes on miners will be more and more dependent on transaction fees. Miners who wish to remain successful will have less willingness to refuse transactions that pay any transaction fee. Anyway, any valid transaction will eventually be picked up by a miner even if it's not immediate. These concerns are real, but there's plenty of time and space to resolve them, they are recognized challenges, not show stoppers.


This has actually been attempted. The transactions were eventually recognized as dust and purged from the system. You might google for 1Sochi and 1Enjoy (I think those were the address names). Dust transactions that don't include a miner fee are easily discarded and don't pose any threat to the network.


Quantum computing doesn't pose a threat to bitcoin because the protocol can be changed as needed. As soon as someone recognizes a threat from quantum computing (or any technology) the network can respond by improving the algorithm and updating the protocol. Let's say some really bad actor pulls off a well planned attack one day in the future - It might disrupt a day of exchanges and there may be clean up to do, but it won't disrupt the ledger that has faithfully stored the balance of every wallet. 
Some of these answers are incomplete and off the cuff.. you asked a lot and I don't know everything. I may update/edit if I see something I could improve.
I think I hear a lot of people saying, "What if?" like.. what if SHA256, ECSDA, or RIPEMD-160 are compromised? Well, that's very possible, but crypto is always advancing and bitcoin isn't etched in stone. There's a strong team and a lot of vested interest in seeing these challenges coming and addressing them. If any of these mechanisms are compromised it will be a world changing event, not just something that affects bitcoin.

The "routing number" part was baloney, but I was pleased to see many elements of cryptocurrency portrayed semi-accurately.

I'm going to explain this in a way that many people have difficulty understanding: Your bitcoins are not in your wallet. Your bitcoins are stored in the blockchain, and they can be viewed from any of the blockchain browsers listed in other comments. A wallet stores signing keys, and it works by scanning the blockchain for all of the bitcoin related to your signing key so you can see them. Just by having the wallet you have your keys safe and sound, but it takes awhile for the wallet to scan the blockchain to find your balance. As a matter of fact - because you JUST moved the coins, they won't show up in your wallet until the wallet is 99.999% synced.
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:50:09
Any time you give your coins to a third party (i.e. evolution market &amp; btc-e) you give them control of your ownership and face a significant risk of not getting them back. Bitcoin is designed to be trustless and we should embrace that.

The number of blocks will be very close to 52,560. The generation of blocks isn't dependent on hashrate, but by the algorithm that seeks to regulate block rewards to every 10 minutes. There are 525,600 minutes in one year and given that period of time the algorithm will do an excellent job of regulating the block reward. You could tinker with the hashrate to squeeze a few more blocks out but the consequences would be pretty complicated to calculate.
There is obviously some factor in this that I don't understand: After one year of life the bitcoin blockchain was at block [33802]( This could not easily be described by natural variance. 
Interestingly, year two ended at [101710]( which is far closer to the expected 52,560 blocks per year - but the average should be more evident on a 2016 block basis (14 days), not a yearly basis.

I agree on all points. People are so focused on what I consider to be extraneous variables.
**Things that have an exaggerated significance:**
* the exchange rate
* the current number of users
* the number of current transactions
**Things that are very important:**
* the security and stability of the protocol
* the development of a robust infrastructure on top of the protocol
* fostering multiple providers for every service - resisting centralization
* the number of educational exposures available - this will translate to more developers
I think the infrastructure will continue to build until it reaches a tipping point where bitcoin will be the obvious option, not something people are trying to figure out.

3. The mining rate reported by your mining program is an "actual rate" - it tells the number of hashes being solved on your computer every second. The "effective rate" is being reported by Slush's pool. They don't know your actual hash rate, they can only predict it by the number of shares you submit. These numbers should be kind of close together, but they do vary significantly at low hash rates (like you're experiencing now).

We've seen lots of site operators (Shout out to Trendon Shavers, Mark Karpeles, Danny Brewster) who were poor stewards of lots of funds, but we didn't know it until afterward. We have the technology to secure wallets against failure and theft - and we (as users) should demand those features without exception. I've been around awhile and it's no longer enough to say, "I'll throw a few bits here, and if they get lost I'll just have to accept the loss." I'm not going to stop using changetip, but I do expect the community to hold site operators to a high standard that includes funds recovery in the event of a catastrophe.

As far as I can tell it's not a concern regarding bitrated - though I do think you would benefit from better brand awareness. In the cases I've dealt with it's people who are committed to antiquated concepts of trust and aren't really interested in the additional risk of including a third party they aren't already familiar with. If you could make bitrated a [bitcoin] household name I think you would increase that "third party trust". 
I'm ranting - but what I discovered is that using any third party (even an escrow service) requires additional trust, even if that trust is in a third party escrow service.

The bitcoin foundation is holding a random drawing each week to give one lucky node about $30 in coin. The hoops detailed above are necessary to accurately link a receiving address to an eligible node - meeting those requirements puts you in the eligibility category (you also need to have a minimum score at bitnode).
Overall, I think its a great way to incentivize nodes, but this reward alone isn't substantial enough to matter.

It has been a couple years since I've been on virwox, but I think you might be misunderstanding how it works. Don't look for an option that says "payment" or "transfer" - you're looking to withdraw bitcoin. When you withdraw bitcoin, enter the address of where you want to send your payment.
If you're still struggling, there are several great wallets out there, my current favorite is  - they'll ask you to set up a lot of security, and I encourage you to take that process seriously.
Greenaddress is a wallet, not an exchange, so you can't actually buy bitcoin from them. If you're buying I suggest you use Coinbase or tell us what your locale is.

You are referring to "transferring". That is not the same as sending funds. I wouldn't recommend acting rashly.

This has a lot to do with where you live. Assuming you live in the USA, no website can sell you bitcoin without collecting identifying information - it's called "KYC" (Know Your Customer).

That version number looks weird to me: bitcoin qt 4.8.2 
The block chain verification will slow down as you get closer to the complete chain, and it will often come in spurts. As you get later in the chain more time is taken by checking the block integrity than downloading.
You have 8 active connections which is the max number of connections without forwarding port 8333 to your client from your router. It does appear that your bottleneck at block 16012 would be caused by this client issue.
You should be able to solve your problem by forwarding that port, or just by being patient. There is also an option to download the blockchain all at once as a zip file, but I've never tried it.

You can go to [this mining profitability calculator]( to estimate your gain - I tried plugging in your numbers and got a net loss of $10 per month while running your gpu at 100MH/s. This is usually due to the additional power cost - just because your computer is on (downloading) doesn't mean it's pulling the kind of energy required for mining. Mining will also add strain to your system, so just keep that in mind if you mine for the long term. I'm going to have to agree with [xrandr]( that at your current level of investment/involvement your most cost effective route is to just buy a bit on [an exchange other than Mt Gox]( and hold on.

I find that to be unrealistic. We will soon enter a linear phase of growth. The current logarithmic growth represents the shift from GPU mining to ASIC mining; ASIC deployment is in swing and I don't believe difficulty growths will reach that magnitude in the next 90 days.

I have to say, the reason I like the trading there is because I don't have to have funds in my account to create an order. I can put any crazy order in - even without funds, then deposit funds later or whatever. 
I can also create competing buy/sell orders and leave them in the queue. So I can put an order in to sell at 90 and buy at 50 with 1BTC in my account. Nothing will happen at first - but if BTC hits 90, it will sell, then if it falls to 50 it will buy. I like the functionality.
At my other exchanger (campbx) I have to pretty much do the exact math myself, and then have the order rejected if I didn't get it right.

This might be a fallacy. If BFL does ship, then a 4.5GH/s miner at 4.5 watts  could be worthwhile (if they do ship, recent evidence shows they are going to miss power targets pretty bad).
The reason I say this is that you'll be competing with other similarly efficient miners for the same resources. Your income may be small, but it will be efficient and potentially profitable.

It depends on what your goals are. You can buy pizza and computer hardware pretty easily, but I doubt you'll be able to go out and use it in your neighborhood yet. It is still in its infancy. The good news about the infancy thing is that many of us believe the value of bitcoin will increase significantly if people continue to use it.


Sure, that makes sense. I suggest that you acquire what you can, save half of what you acquire and find ways to spend the rest. This will encourage the spender's bitcoin economy and increase the likelihood of seeing more places accept bitcoin.

_Here's a whack at it:_
 Bitcoin actually predates modern computing. Einstein developed the basic concept in his notes in 1940, but he didn't have the hardware resources to develop the concept. The idea was rediscovered in the early 90's by Steve Wozniak of Apple fame, and Steve spent quite a bit of his fortune developing the core program behind bitcoin. 
 The bitcoin concept is a little difficult to describe, it basically involves using your CPU (or GPU) to "mine" for bitcoin which are stored in the silica substrate of integrated circuits. When coins are located, a complex address is assigned to the location on the IC where the coins exist, and that address can be used to refer to that coin as long as the computer is connected to the internet. You can imagine bitcoin as tiny "golden" imperfections in the microchips that run your computer.

* It does begin with seeing a confulence of of opinion where one is not likely to exist. I know the general vibe for several reddits that I frequent, so unusual comments stick out.
* When a commenter is not frequent on but comes in from unrelated reddits out of the blue to drop a line of support.
* When a post in r/$reddit/new has several upvotes in the first 10 minutes with no extraordinary content.
* When the same commenters endorse each other repeatedly in a short time span.
* When there's a short gap between similar conversations here and bitcointalk involving the same or similar accounts.
* When buying/selling is involved, I usually see irrational exuberance early on from sock buyers. "This is so great, I bought 30 shares in the first 10 seconds!"
There are several more that are difficult to articulate. One of which is just my gut.
Without being unkind or pointing fingers at anyone, I got a lot of those suggestions from this post. I called it (probably a mistake) and aggravated people.

[In response to:](


I love your reference to garbage. Let's imagine that (or any reddit) is a house. In that house, we have furniture, and we have rules. We enjoy having friends over, and our friends enjoy sitting on our couch and admiring our art work, they appreciate that we have maintained our household. Because they appreciate our friendship, they bring us gifts (posts &amp; comments). If we like the gift, we upvote it, if we don't we downvote it - it helps us get along with our friends when we have an understanding of what gifts are acceptable. 
Let's say a crack dealer (spammer) (no offense to crack dealers) wanders into our house and begins throwing fast food wrappers on the floor. He spits on our art and smashes our TV. It makes sense to begin by downvoting the crack dealer, but at some point we realize that the crack dealer doesn't care about our relationship, he is only using us to sell crack and destroy our fine home.
Over time, friends who used to come over frequently are less comfortable in our home. They feel akward around the crack dealer because all he ever talks about is his crack business. 
As a good host, we have a responsibility to keep our home free of crack dealers. 
Here's the catch - some of our friends are casual drug users - they may occasionally bring crack and garbage into our house. We don't end the friendship, we can easily overlook minor transgressions, but we still have to keep our house a tidy and welcoming place to others.
As an experienced user, it's easy for me to RES block this domain, as well as the handful of users that make reddit an ugly experience, but as someone who cares about the community, I feel like we should keep the house relatively clean, not just ignore the garbage.
**A personal note:** I am generally laissez-faire in my attitudes toward moderation, but there is a time and a place to keep reddit a welcoming environment.
**tl;dr:** Downvoting works well when people follow the rules; when people ignore the rules of reddit/society, we need to draw clear lines.

* They can also be purchased on the black market in the form of botnets. Guess what the preferred form of payment is?

[Here]( is a link to the bitcoin wiki page for the private key. It contains the most accurate and succinct information regarding bitcoin.
[Here]( is a link to bitaddress.org. Don't put your personal information in there for now, but just as a fun exercise, do this:
* Start at the tab for "Single Wallet". 
* Generate a Single Wallet. Press "Generate New Address" twenty times and become familiar with the general look of a Bitcoin Address, and a private key.
* Copy a private key, then switch to the "Wallet Details" tab.
* Paste it in the top box where it says "Enter private key"
You will see all of the standard forms that a private key and bitcoin address can take. These private keys represent a secret wallet, but there's nothing in them - unless you put it there.

That is a fair assumption, but it is not correct. Solving bitcoin hashes is more complex than just a sha256, it requires halving the string, calculating the nonce, and solving the hash twice.

I think you are moving too small of an amount to make it worthwhile for it to be added into a block by a miner.

Oh wow! In one sentence you have single-handedly shaken the very underpinnings of bitcoin itself!
Nah, just kidding. It will be 2140 before all of the coins are mined, by then even very tiny transaction fees will be valuable enough to keep miners happy.
Not to mention, the concept of 21 million bitcoins is technically an illusion. The real (current) estimate of total bitcoins is 21,000,000.00000000 - and the neat part is that it would be a minor change in the client to add even more decimals of accuracy. 
If we divided that into "current divisible units", there would be 2,100,000,000,000,000 unique divisible units without making any changes to the existing client.

ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) is the next step in the bitcoin mining evolution. You appear to be mining with a GPU (Graphics card) right now - general purpose computers are **"pretty good at a lot of things"**; in other words, they can run lots of programs and have lots of flexibility. Your GPU is solving hashes at 260MH/s. 
In mid february, ASIC miners entered the world of reality. ASIC miners are **"very good at exactly one task"** - so you'll never be able to do anything with your ASIC miner except mine bitcoin. There are three or four companies in the game - [The Avalon Miner]( was the first to hit the streets about two weeks ago - it is hashing at 68GH/s, or 260 times faster than your GPU. [Butterfly Labs]( is believed to be close to shipping their version of a low-wattage ASIC miner in March, though it is likely that this is true, there is still no concrete proof.

That is totally okay, it has been known to happen in the past. You still have absolutely nothing to worry about. Here are some steps for you to take:
1. Breathe. This is okay. Your coins are not lost. Really. I promise.
2. Think. Do some research. Don't trust anything I or anyone else says at face value.
3. Backup. You have a wallet.dat file that contains your private key. Find this and back it up to at least two safe locations.
4. If your chain is not synchronizing it could be corrupt. That's really no big deal. To fix this, you'll need to re-download the blockchain.
5. To re-download the block chain, you'll need to shut down your bitcoin-qt instance first.
6. Delete blockchain files without deleting your wallet.dat file.
7. Re-open bitcoin-qt and you should begin downloading the blockchain again.
8. It could take a LONG time to download the block chain, but you have nothing to worry about - your coin is safe.
9. When the blockchain download gets near block 229,706 your coins will appear. 
10. Another user suggested downloading a bootstrap version of the blockchain. That is fine, it will get you 90% caught up more quickly, but that's an option - you don't have to do that.

You ask some excellent questions!


No idea about Japanica laws. I think it's likely you're a US citizen, you might feel more comfortable with a US exchange. I have been very satisfied with campbx.com - you can save money with a referral code, but i am irritated by pushers, so pm me if you would like to use mine. (I also benefit)


If Gox gets shut down (or hacked again) there's a fair chance you'll be separated from your coin for months or eternity. It is wise to use exchanges to buy &amp; sell bitcoin, but you would not be wise to leave your funds out of your possession longer than necessary.


Yes, but this will vary by exchange. Once you own bitcoin you can sell it on any exchange, and different exchanges offer different (or many) currencies. Once you own bitcoin it is no longer linked to it's currency of origin except by an exchange rate.


I am not aware of anyone allowing short selling right now. There are several sites that run virtual stock markets though - btct.co and havelockinvestments.com - if you're interested in investing I suggest ASICMINER-PT from btct.co (disclaimer - i own a few shares)


This is just a start. Smart hackers want your bitcoin and they will work hard to access it. The protocol is fundamentally secure, but that doesn't give you a license to be foolish. Start small and learn to secure your assets. For large assets, use offline paper storage. Most folks are trustworthy, but don't trust anyone. Learn to use 2-factor authentication through google, and use it at every site where you have any bitcoin. Even then, you'll need to be vigilant about your security.


A wallet is automatically generated for you under many conditions. If you open an account at an exchange they will create a wallet for you. If you install bitcoin-qt it will generate a wallet for you. Forget the concept of "one wallet" - you can have many wallets in many places, and it's safe to diversify.

Is it a truly random password, or do you have a basic idea of the length and character set (i.e. lowercase, uppercase, numbers, etc.)? If it is truly random, you're in big trouble. If you have some hunches you can script your own bruteforce attack pretty easily.

BFL claims they will be able to fill 450-500 orders per day at projected production capacity. That would take 67 work days to catch up to 30,000 orders (assuming 450 per day). That's about 13 work weeks, or a little under 100 days to ship orders made today, if they were at full production today. It seems safe to add a 20 day buffer to that, so _if_ they are real, and you order today, it seems like you could expect to receive your ASIC in 4 months, around August 9, which is in line with the estimates BFL offers.

Only bitcoin clients. If your wallet is encrypted you may only be able to unlock it with the client that encrypted it. I am not clear about this.


100 addresses are generated when you initially create your wallet.dat file. If you cycle through all 100 more will be generated. If these are not backed up they will be lost. Do incremental backups.


Yes, you could probably import the private key(s) into your android app. I am still cautious about using android wallet apps because they're always on and always connected to the network. Be especially cautious if your device is rooted.


The private key is the literal address where your bitcoin is stashed. Think about a city filled with millions of houses. The private key opens the door to one of the houses, but only you know which one. Lose the key, lose the coins. My favorite way to store the private key is in the text file that you mentioned.

Welcome to r/bitcoin!
There's one VERY important piece of advice I can share with you: Anyone who claims to be able to predict the future price of bitcoin is a fool and a liar.
With that administrivia out of the way, let me share a few of the variables that might be linked to (near future) bitcoin prices:
1. The Google search trend for the word "bitcoin" has been a good indicator.
2. The sourceforge download stats page for the bitcoin-qt client is a good indicator.
3. The wikipedia traffic history for the bitcoin page is a good indicator.
4. News of economic instability in countries where bitcoin might be a good alternative are  a good indicator.
5. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the bitcoin price, as well as several other market analytic tools have been fair indicators.
6. Popular news stories (Wired, Bloomberg) tend to be good indicators.
7. The stattit page showing the growth of subscribers to this reddit indicates the rate of interest and adoption which is a driver price.
There are several more, and I can tell you that $100 has been a psychological barrier that will be teased for awhile until its broken - after that it's anyone's guess. 
Note: i'll _try_ to add links for these when I'm not on mobile.
My official interpretation of these indicators? The price is going UP UP UP! buy now!

Excellent! You simply have a corrupted blockchain. You'll need to delete your old blockchain files and re-download it. 
* Close any open bitcoin programs.
* Navigate to your bitcoin directory (depends on your OS)
* Delete everything EXCEPT wallet.dat and bitcoin.conf
* Files to delete look like blk0001.dat
* Reboot just for giggles
* Restart your wallet program
* It will re-download the blockchain, and your coins will eventually show up.

I just used it to purchase a half a coin to see the process. The process was very smooth and it is definitely a legit site.
The concern that I sense (and that others have expressed) is that some banks view any dealing with bitcoin as high risk and they may close your account in response. 
If you have the financial resources, set up a new account at a local bank and use coinbase from that account.
I used my account at a nationwide credit union and so far I haven't had any trouble.
YMMV. 
I would be interested to see a comment from someone who had an account closed specifically because of a coinbase purchase, and not because of allegations of fraud/theft.

Don't misinterpret this as a crash. No one plans to let go of their coins for less than $100, so it may reach $100 and hover there for a few weeks, but that doesn't mean a massive sell off where sellers would accept less than $100.  
In other words, the $100 mark doesn't represent a loss of confidence, it represents the willingness of some investors to cash in.

* BAMT (Big Ass Miner Thing) version 0.5c is the last formal version that I am aware of. Later versions are potential malware. This is probably the most dummy proof of the three, but not my personal preference. Has a LOT of autoconfig, so it's nearly plug and play. Does not include stratum protocol, this must be hacked on to work well with many modern pools.
* LinuxCoin 0.2b - I used this for quite awhile. It is rather outdated, but I fired it up last week because it appears that BFL may not ship in my lifetime and I am down to less than 1 BTC. It is hard to find, and has a bit of a learning curve, but it's very easy to set up with stratum and the old phoenix miner gives me the hash rate I'm looking for on my old 5830's.
**Caveat 1:** I didn't add links to these because xubuntu is stupid easy to find, and the other two are only worth locating if you REALLY want them.
**Caveat 2:** Please don't use the information I've shared to be dishonest.

It all depends on your desired level of security. Securing bitcoin-qt on a home computer sounds like a great option, but it leaves you susceptible to attacks. I suggest keeping a "spending wallet" of whatever you might use in 1 month in a live bitcoin-qt wallet, then if you have substantial funds, learn to securely generate a paper wallet through bitaddress.org.


Well, coinbase is your middle man in this case. You're giving them your fiat and they're putting BTC in a wallet for you to access. If you want to cut out coinbase you could buy coins locally using something like  - you would give the individual cash in exchange for bitcoin.

The supply wasn't limitless, but the market was smaller. You could buy as many were available at $7, but when the supply ran out, you'd be paying $7.01, $7.02 .. the outcome of buying bitcoin is at "ask" price is that the market price goes up. Without numbers on hand, I would guess that when bitcoin was $7, a 1000BTC buy would push the market up to $8 or $9 per BTC.

I think this suggests that old coin was being sold off to stabilize the market at $120-$125 for a significant period. In other words, one of the founders did a slow cash-out without busting the market. That cash out appears to have ended today, which means the endless supply at $125 is over.

Use [wireshark]( from a different computer on the same network to sniff packets leaving the infected computer. You should be able to pick up the public address that cgminer is mining for (Assuming they're using p2pool or Eligius). Less likely is that they're using a regular pool, in that case you'll be able to pick up some credentials, but they'll be useless to you. There is a slight chance of picking up a username from a worker, but even that will be spoofed.
The short story is that you might get some giggles, but you won't get very close to the bad guy's actual identity, and you have little ability to cause him heartburn.
You can do the same thing by locating the actual executable in windows and decompiling it. I can't explain how to do that (not a windows user), but my assumption is that he has custom compiled cgminer to mine for a static address that you can identify by decompiling it. If he's lazy, you'll find a standard conf file that will give you some credentials.
As I said previously, none of this data will be awesome. You're likely to find a miner working for p2pool or a username like 352j345234jn with 'password' as a password.
Do it for the lulz.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:46:23
Please don't take this wrong, but I think you are mistaken on two fronts:
1. We will never be able to predict or estimate the number of lost coins. Coins that may have been regarded as "lost" could pop up at any moment. There is simply no way to evaluate lost coin.
2. It will never be computationally affordable to mine for lost keys because the pool is too big. There are more potential addresses than we can conceive of - more than could be potentially mined for any expectation of recovering coin.

is correct. Good mining clients offer plenty of fallbacks. There's a strong incentive for miners to drop back to rpc mining and pick up a few quick blocks if a couple of the major pools fail. I also believe the major pools have become more resilient to attack as they've developed - I know that slush has substantially hardened his infrastructure.

You can't really "integrate" two wallets like that. Basically, you would have one wallet at blockchain.info and a separate wallet on your desktop bitcoin-qt. You could very easily send funds back and forth between the two (though you may encounter some small transaction fees), but you wouldn't integrate them. 
**Advanced Information:** You can export your private key from blockchain.info for safe keeping. You can also import this private key into your bitcoin-qt desktop instance, but if you do this you can cause wallet problems by using the same private key on two nodes. This tends to cause spending problems and is not advised. 
[This is a bitcointalk.org post by our benevolent developer Gavin Andersen where he talks about the fallacy of using the same private key in two wallets.](

GPU survival is linked to the difficulty as well as the market price of BTC. Difficulty will certainly go sky high when ASIC mining becomes prevalent, but the market price of BTC may rise as well. For example, if you are only able to mine 0.02 BTC per day with your GPU, but bitcoin is valued at $100, you would make $2 per day, which is actually slightly profitable.

If you have a couple hundred bucks to throw at it, you stand a good chance of recovering your original investment, maybe even some extra coin on that, but don't expect the kinds of returns you see with current difficulty.

Despite all of the Sad Sally's, this is actually pretty possible, although it would use that actual blockchain not blockchain.info notes. It would require a two-part system:
The first part would encode the data in the blockchain using [bicoin scripted]( transactions. This is where you would store the vital data that you wanted to preserve in txout. Even a noob could encode data in the value of bitcoin that you send by ascii encoding data in the transaction amount.. of course, that could lead to data that costs about $150 per byte. (ouch!)
The second part would be to write a custom decoder and formatting engine that you could share freely. The decoder/formatter would look at a reference block or transaction and pull addressed data into the page where it would be formatted for viewing. (think: css, html)
It wouldn't be easy, and probably not a good use of the blockchain, but it's certainly possible using a variety of methods.
There are several references (below), all you would need to do is write a server side interpreter, which would actually be relatively easy.

You need to slow down and act cautiously. Here are the steps I would suggest:
* Don't act rashly. Right now, there's a great chance that everything is fine. Most losses are the result of rash decision making, you won't lose anything by thinking and researching. Don't tinker with the drive beyond your skill level. It's best to leave it alone until you have a solid plan.
* Try to determine (by memory or other documentation) how many bitcoins are stored on the drive. That will help you know the maximum you can spend on recovering the drive.
* Find someone you trust who knows a lot about hard drives. Platter drives are not very complicated. Even when dead they can easily be revived by someone who knows what they're doing.
* Don't trust anyone, don't let the drive out of your sight. People get greedy and foolish. Any recovery pro can recover the wallet, then destroy the evidence while telling you it is a total loss.

My biggest con is their lack of liquidity. Sure, if you get them to an exchanger you can trade them for USD, you can even buy cars, houses, and pizza for bitcoin (I intended to link those, but it's too late). But I can't walk out of my house with bitcoin and do much. That sort of poor liquidity could be a long term problem. It could also be easily resolved if someone develops an integrated POS.

This. They are a physical representation of bitcoin. A novelty and nothing more, but I still love them BECAUSE of the novelty. No one should consider them secure storage; we've known from the onset that they have risks simply because the private keys exist in casascius's possession while he creates them.
@_date: 2013-04-28 12:51:11
Everything you said is correct, but whether to pool or not is a personal decision. Just because there's a 50% chance your miner will find a block each week, there's also a very real chance that it could go 5 weeks without hitting a block. Pooled mining is kind of like a buffer against that risk.

It will be 2140 before most of the coins are mined, by then even very tiny transaction fees will be valuable enough to keep miners happy.
 
The concept of 21 million bitcoins is technically an illusion. The real (current) estimate of total bitcoins is 21,000,000.00000000 - and the neat part is that it would be a minor change in the client to add even more decimals of accuracy.
 
If we divided that into "current divisible units", there would be 2,100,000,000,000,000 unique divisible units without making any changes to the existing client.
 
The reality is that we will never run out of bitcoins. They may take smaller denominations, but they will never be exhausted.

The problem would be securing the blockchain. The great thing about bitcoin is that the security is distributed by every miner in the world. If google created its own blockchain it would be responsible for solving hashes to secure that chain - but because it is controlled by one entity (even one as large as google), it would be trivial for an attacker to fork the chain. 
One of the greatest strengths of bitcoin is its distributed hash power. It would be a mistake to centralize that hashpower under one roof. 
The funny thing about all of that is that currently there are two pools [BTC Guild and Ghash.io]( who together control 55% of the hash - that could be a problem if they colluded.

I developed two good scenarios that both make sense to me:
1. The bubble angle: The current trend data is surprisingly consistent with the 2011 bubble that took bitcoin from $2 to $30 and back to $2 in the span of a month. If you look at search trend data and price data the conclusion is irrefutable. Bitcoin will crash again soon.
2. The capitalization angle: After 4 years as a proven currency bitcoin is finally reaching its true market capitalization potential. Banks are failing and no one trusts governments anymore. Bitcoin is a safe haven and has a controlled and limited supply. We can expect the price to continue rising with a few minor bumps for the forseeable future.

No, "all" will do the trick. You may have to wait a significant period of time. The bot can take several minutes to respond, then it can take several minutes for the transaction to be incorporated into a block. I don't know the confirmation policy at instawallet, but it could reasonably take up to 65 minutes for the transaction to appear in your instawallet.

Excellent questions. OP asked about the "majority of your coins", and I consider that a savings wallet. I use bitaddress.org to create a wallet private key that has never been exposed to the network, and I use the wallet address to make deposits and check my balance. When I decide to use the coin, I generally use the command line (bitcoind) to import the private key and access the funds instantly, or you can use a mtgox feature to import the key and the coins. With that said, I would actively encourage you to seek exchangers other than mtgox.

I always recommend a "dollar cost averaging" strategy, where you make a few small buys, maybe one a week for 10 weeks, to get the average cost. In this case, I would speculate that we're at a pretty safe level, and I don't expect the price to decline substantially soon - so it may be wise to go 100% in.
I guess my actual recommendation would be to go 70% in today, then make a "hedge offer" around $90 with your remaining 30% just in case we see a crash soon.
    My advice is worthless.

Thanks for catching that. My words were definitely unclear.

I don't know why I feel compelled to continue encouraging you to buy asicminer when you've clearly stated your preference, but I have a couple other thoughts:
1. As an investment, you are somewhat more likely to increase your overall value than by simply storing your bitcoin under your mattress.
2. I won't argue your math because I do most of my decisions by using anecdotal evidence and history, but the [79 day return for ASICMINER-PT]( suggests a 1 BTC return per year. Follow the link, then choose the "History" tab to see the dividend history.
3. Buying any security is not a disposible purchase. In most cases the buyer has some reasonable expectation that she will recover some portion of the original value at a later sell, so the "pay for itself" valuation is somewhat flawed - i think the "annual return on investment" is a better metric.
After all of my babbling, I have to return to my original position - i simply don't know the future. If you find a more productive instrument to grow the value of your exisitng bitcoin I would like to learn more about it.

No, you're not tied to coinbase; they are simply the vendor of bitcoin that you chose. You can send those bitcoins to any wallet anywhere. For example, I have a wallet on my computer, a wallet on my android phone, a wallet with reddit ([r/bitcointip]( and paper wallets that have never seen the network (but still have value). 
Once you have possession of bitcoins you are free from restrictions on moving currency - you can move it around all day - just be aware that you could incur some tiny transaction fees.

I would urge you to be careful about trying to turn a quick profit on them ... You might think "I'll sell these while the price is high and buy them back if the price falls again." - Speculation suggests that coinbase frowns on frequent buy/sell trades. If you want to speculate on the price it's better to do it at one of the exchanges that is set up for that.

If you learn to generate a secure paper wallet address with bitaddress.org you can store your own coins very securely AND if a crash starts you can import your private key and sell in 30 seconds. The only drawback is that you won't be able to have a standing open order at a price to hedge your bet.
On the other side, investing in btc shouldn't be regarded as a gamble. The price will certainly rise and fall over time; we may even have another crash- if we do the system will be so backed up you won't be able to sell even if you have an open order in the queue (see history). 
Tldr: a crash is the worst time to sell.

I am a fan of ASICMINER as well as other cryptostocks. There are two significant risks to be aware of:
1. Your bitcoin is only as safe as your account on the site managing your shares. I use btct.co and they are very up front about the security risks. The risk of storing your coin on an online site is usually only calculated when the site is hacked.
2. There is nothing to prevent a scare or mishap from quickly changing the market and rendering your shares worthless.

Bitcoin purely as a value store could be a long term problem. The issue is that world trends will cause many people who choose to cash out to do so at the same time, leading to a crash, rendering those valuable stores worth less (not worthless).
Let's do an example. War breaks out and people are forced to leave their homes and physically migrate to a new location. They need cash for the trip, so lots of people begin cashing in their bitcoin for fiat currency causing the market to fall significantly. The valuable stash will have lost significant value because it only acted as a stash. Now consider the same scenario where many vendors accept bitcoin. There is no reason to sell for fiat, and you can make the journey using bitcoin along the way. Rather than devaluing, that scenario actually strengthens the case for bitcoin use.

Your position makes sense, but when you've earned some BTC you have about three choices:
* Buy stuff with it.
* Put it in storage and hope the exchange price goes up.
* Grow it.
This discussion is about option 3 - growing it. So, you acquired some BTC, now, if you put it in a cold storage wallet it will be safe, but some people want to take a chance to increase their investment - and that's where these stocks come in. They allow you to increase your bitcoin position incrementally, so, while you may have a little bit of coin now, you can put that coin to work and have a little extra later.

This would be great, but Josh Zerlan from BFL has made it prettty clear that they don't feel obligated to disclose any information to the public or purchasers of BFL miners. Whereas some BFL preorder folks perceive themselves as "investors" with some claim to status updates, BFL has rebuffed this and clearly states that those who made preorders are nothing more than customers.
Their current perception is that the more information they give the community the more backlash they receive by people picking apart their words and misconstruing their intent.

You're description is a little lacking, but the truth might be even more complicated. What we actually send are transaction ID's that are linked to private keys. Technically, when a block is generated (25 BTC) it exists as one transaction ID.

You can use eligius mining pool through a proxy and funds are deposited directly to your wallet upon generation (there's no intermediate transaction like other pools). I am pretty certain this allows the miner to retain a high level of anonymity.
Here's an example using the first BFL 5GH/s miner used by Luke-Jr. 
The stats page is public and anonymous: [BFL 5GHs miner](
If you feed the public key into blockchain.info, you'll see that the deposits are generated with freshly minted coin, just like if you were solo mining: [blockchain.info](

You only REQUIRE one wallet. You can keep your one wallet anywhere you please (you can even leave it on coinbase if you trust them).
If you want to spend, you will go through the checkout process and be presented with a "send to" address. You will then access your wallet and fill in two blanks: 1) What address do you want to send funds to 2) How much do you want to send.
The network takes care of the rest. In a few moments the funds will be transferred. You can even watch the transfer occurring by entering your address into the search field at  
Please.. ask more questions!
**Edit:** As I re-read your understanding above, it is sort of technically correct. The vendor will use a program to generate a special wallet with your name on it, and when you send funds to that wallet they will know that Propane's wallet now contains  bitcoin, so you have completed payment and may now receive goods. Even though it's "Propane's wallet", you gave them the BTC, they just call it "Propane's wallet" to identify that the money came from you so they can credit the appropriate account.

Your bitcoin is always stored in a wallet somewhere. That wallet may be controlled by a website, and websites where bitcoins are stored are targets for hackers. Bitcoin is safest if it's stored in a wallet that you control - like, on your secured computer, or in a paper wallet stored in your possession. To be very elementary, a bitcoin wallet is simply an address, that address needs to be kept as private as possible- and the best secrets are the ones you keep yourself.


This statement is incorrect. Bitcoin is independent of any mining pool or any exchange. The moment you have bitcoin you can exchange it, trade it, or keep it anywhere you want. It has no link to the method you acquired it (except a ledger in the blockchain). For example, if you mine as slush's pool, you can sell that bitcoin at campbx, or exchange it for USD through localbitcoins.com or whatever.

I would suggest ~~two~~ three features that bitcoin currently struggles with are quick transactions, microtransactions, and the decimal point.
* **Quick Transactions** - it can take 10 minutes for a single transaction verification and 60 minutes if the vendor requires multiple verifications. This is really a vendor problem in my eyes - once a transaction is announced to the network it can't be recalled, and only a fork can cancel it; so it's a problem that vendors need to adapt to.
* **microtransactions** - Microtransactions relate to the concept that every transaction made in bitcoin is stored in the blockchain and the core developers generally discourage microtransactions. The work-around here is for vendors to hold accounts for each customer and allow them to cash in or out at will. This significantly reduces the number of transactions broadcast to the network, but allows users to have fine grained control over their assets.
* **the decimal point** - the decimal point is a "barrier to entry" for new people who think that they need to buy a "whole" bitcoin, or that fractions of a bitcoin are insignificant. The decimal point problem is purely psychological, but I actually see it as a barrier to adoption. You often hear people say, "Bitcoin is too damn expensive! I'm going to litecoin!" What they're really saying is that they don't like where the decimal place is. If they felt like they were mining 500,000 of something every day instead of 0.0005 of something, they would feel more empowered.
So, those are my ~~two~~ three concerns, but I think as bitcoin develops a substantial vendor framework will develop to mitigate these factors.

It sounds like you're mixing two potentially separate issues. For educated &amp; intelligent people, work isn't the thing we do to get paid, its the thing we do to maintain a basic structure in life. If your work isn't providing a basic sense of accomplishment and pleasure you might want to shift gears into a different job/career. Bitcoin may be a facilitating factor, but its not a solution. How about creating a bitcoin startup? What about providing a bitcoin boot camp for CEO's?

The only gaping security hole I see is that of existing malware. By using a pre-existing install you can't be sure that your bitaddress.org wallet is protected from keylogger, screengrabbers, file stealers. You may be safe for the 10 minutes you're unplugged, but a well-written bug will upload that payload the moment you re-connect. In reality, you're probably fine, but if you want to be 100% safe, use a liveCD or USB.
Also - [I tried to make a tutorial for bitaddress.org the other day](
You can verify the private key but it will take a little while. I do it like this: 
* Send a bit of change to your bitaddress.org wallet and give it a few confirmations.
* Install your OS on a blank drive.
* Install the bitcoin-qt client (I prefer bitcoind, but whatever)
* Download the entire block chain on this fresh installation.
* Disconnect from the internet.
* Import the private key.
* If the wallet works you will see the small transaction when you import the key.
* Format and dban your drive.
Using this method, you can test a bitaddress.org private key while never exposing the key to the internet.

I have never been much of a price speculator, but I was inspired by this data to give it a go.
Let's imagine that at the next blockchain reward halving in 2017 that bitcoin has grown to be the 50th largest currency in the world.
At that time, we will be looking at [15,750,000]( bitcoins in circulation and a market capitalization similar to Iran(50) at [$42,910,000,000]( 
If my math and wild speculation are as incorrect as they generally are, that suggests a price of about $2724 per coin in 2017.
This is, of course, a complete shot in the dark. We know that the distribution of bitcoin throughout time is predictable, but we have absolutely no idea what growth trend it will take over the next four years. It could rise to the market cap of Iran, or collapse to 0. Still - it was fun.

 The price has exploded because bitcoin awareness has exploded due to a few references in mass media ([Bloomberg]( and the FinCEN virtual currency statement. This increased awareness has led to a massive influx of speculators who are buying as an investment (with little or no intent to use bitcoin as a currency). Cypress and the EU are in a continuing economic crisis and the possibility of savings account levies have caused bitcoin to become more attractive to small account holders. At the same time, the holders of bitcoin have no compelling reason to part with their precious coin, so it has driven the price sky high.
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:36:05


hahah.. absolutely. There are likely between 1000 and 3000 people who have over a million USD of bitcoin wealth - at least at current trading prices. Most of them are smart and modest, so you would never know about their wealth. I remember a couple years ago there was a youtube video with a guy mining in his house - he had 20+ mining rigs scattered everywhere and his control screen was showing 50 BTC blocks every few seconds. (I wonder if that video is still around..)
@_date: 2013-07-28 14:50:00
That could be related to FinCen regulations that limit transfers above $1000 for customers who haven't completed KYC. I recognize that mtgox operates in Japan, and that bitcoin is not USD, but I'm sure an exchange operator would have a hard time explaining that to the Fed.
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:38:56

It will be 2140 before most of the coins are mined, by then even very tiny transaction fees will be valuable enough to keep miners happy.
 
The concept of 21 million bitcoins is technically an illusion. The real (current) estimate of total bitcoins is 21,000,000.00000000 - and the neat part is that it would be a minor change in the client to add even more decimals of accuracy.
 
If we divided that into "current divisible units", there would be 2,100,000,000,000,000 unique divisible units without making any changes to the existing client.
 
The reality is that we will never run out of bitcoins. They may take smaller denominations, but they will never be exhausted.
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:29:11


I have conflicting recollections of how this works. I think I have initiated a transaction when my client is synced up to the block where I had funds deposited, but I don't think it will announce a transaction to the network until you are completely synced.

I'm currently estimating 90 days for orders placed today. Some might consider that optimistic, but my logic is that BFL claims they will begin shipping loose chips in 100 days. They also appear to _finally_ have their manufacturing process ready to roll and they claim to have contracted additional labor. 
Notice that all of these estimates are based on BFL _claims_ - the truth is that they have not been very forthcoming with accurate timelines, so none of us can give you an accurate answer.

I'll leave the community to comment on their own, but I'd like to make one point regarding:


That is an arms race that we are already committed and prepared to fight. We don't maintain a popular reddit by ignoring spam because fighting it would only make things worse. On the contrary, we maintain policies that increase the ever valuable signal-to-noise ratio. That policy already includes the ban on url shorteners, and should include a ban on sites that only exist as spam factories.

@_date: 2013-03-30 17:28:12
Well, let me give you this from two angles:
1. The bubble angle: The current trend data is surprisingly consistent with the 2011 bubble that took bitcoin from $2 to $30 and back to $2 in the span of a month. If you look at search trend data and price data the conclusion is irrefutable.
2. The capitalization angle: After 4 years as a proven currency bitcoin is finally reaching its true market capitalization potential. Banks are failing and no one trusts governments anymore. Bitcoin is a safe haven and has a controlled and limited supply. We can expect the price to continue rising with a few minor bumps for the forseeable future.

I agree. I think it would be optimal to have groups of pools operating around 20% each in something like the following. It's actually very possible If we developed a system (site?) to encourage miners to support responsible distributed mining practices:
* Solo Miners (inclding ASICMiner) 20%
* BTCGuild 20%
* GHash.io/Cex.io 20%
* [Luke Jr]( &amp; [Slush]( 20%
* BitMinter &amp; P2Pool 20%
The idea is that we have a mining resource like [ but with a little more detail - sort of a template overlay that shows the ideal distribution over the pie chart, and an indicator at the bottom that says, "New miners are encouraged to join x pool."
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:18:14

@_date: 2013-04-04 02:02:42
Your friend is mistaken. "Bitcoin" is not a single program or website - is a protocol that has proven to be incredibly resilient and durable. In other words, bitcoin is simply a set of rules that tell how the cryptographic currency is created and managed. The issue is that bitcoin is becoming popular and people are developing services around bitcoin. Some of these services aren't completely secure and may be vulnerable to attacks. That doesn't make the bitcoin protocol any less secure, it means that securing a website can be a pretty big challenge.
Bitcoin related sites are hacked and DDoS'd because bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency. If any other cryptocurrency reached the dominant level of popularity it would be subjected to similar attacks.
Litecoin is no more fundamentally secure than bitcoin. As a matter of fact, as a spawn of the bitcoin algorithm, it is likely to receive updates after they have been vetted through bitcoin.

Bitcoin:Paypal :: MP3:RIAA
New technologies doing a job better than the old provider without the overhead expense.
Bitcoin is  a revolutionary payment process that upsets the very profitable system that paypal has spent years developing. Bitcoin does what paypal does, only cheaper and without all of the unnecessary overhead that paypal provides. No one actually wants the overhead of paypal, they simply want to be paid smoothly, so bitcoin represents a serious threat to their business model.
I can't say whether the higher ups at paypal regard bitcoin as a serious business threat yet, but I think they might. They have labeled bitcoin as a high risk commodity and are very eager to freeze funds or reverse transactions associated with bitcoin.
One fundamental difference between paypal and bitcoin is reversability - paypal transactions can be reversed by a third party, but bitcoin transactions cannot. Paypal has repeatedly reversed bitcoin transactions after the fact causing significant losses to those selling bitoin and accepting paypal.

Miners won't shut down in mass. When people make a significant investment in miners they have a vested interest in squeezing every cent out of it before moving to the next generation of mining hardware. Miner efficiency will increase and the network will remain strong. People said the same thing about the reward drop from 50BTC to 25BTC, but instead of weakening, the strength of the hash network increased in correlation with the price of bitcoin. It was no less profitable as a result of the generation reduction.

And just to be clear, i feel like it would be a horrible thing if google or another large company "took over" bitcoin by providing a crucial service that everyone flocked to.

It may have been added to the blockchain, but it hasn't been encoded into the chain to ensure that it cannot later be reversed by a hard fork or a 51% attack. That's why receivers generally wait for 6 confirmations before accepting a transaction - waiting for several confirmations prevents a reversal. (Confirmations = completed blocks)

I spend too much time on bitcoin reddits and I do not sense vote manipulation. I have noticed the use of sockies and I do see a lot of scams, but I don't sense that it's a "coordinated government effort".
With that said, I am a firm believer that you have to trust your gut while being willing to accept and integrate disconfirming information.
I have no doubt that the US three-letter-agencies are running psyops on reddit, I just don't feel a strong concentration of that here now.
**Edit:** If anything, I would guess that the sockpuppet accounts are downvoting bitcoin related posts on the rest of reddit in order to make it appear as a hairbrained scam; but that doesn't bother me at all, I think controlled growth is a good thing for bitcoin, and I don't see it going anywhere.

The hash you're seeing is 25-34 characters and it is referred to as a "wallet address", it is a public key and can be shared freely.
In this case, coinbase holds your actual wallet, and they maintain your private key - which controls access to spend the funds. You will never set eyes on this private key because coinbase maintains the wallet and you access it through the web interface.
If you choose, you could set up bitcoin-qt or another wallet on your computer and send those funds to your local computer, there you would be in control of the private key - and the fate of the funds.

There is really no need to recover lost coins. It seems like a hard limit of 21 million coins limits the availability of coins, but the fact that coins are infinitely divisible means that there will always be bitcoin available for distribution. Even if only 0.00000001 BTC were remaining, it would be trivial to extend the client to recognize 0.000000010000000 coins, instantly creating new availability. In this case, there would be 10,000,000 units available for distribution.

Hello friends! 
After all of these interesting comments, I figured I should give the back story. I commissioned to draw this dollar and another similar to it. I could not be more satisfied with the product.
Many of you have asked "Why Stallman?" It's a fair question- Richard Stallman is not intimately associated with bitcoin. But similar to the style that US Dollars have pictures of presidents who did not create the dollar, I have a very high regard for Richard Stallman and wanted him on the face of my bitcoin dollar.
I have a very complicated perception of RMS. In many ways he drives me nuts by his unwillingness to compromise. In other ways, I regard him as the father of digital freedom. Bitcoin also represents digital freedom, and that's one of the reasons I'm such a fan. It doesn't matter if Stallman doesn't believe bitcoin is "the" answer - he acknowledges that it's a step in the right direction and I agree.
As far as having the private key and the wallet address on the front of the bill, that was also my choice. I regard this as art, not as a mechanism for hoarding bitcoin. Art is fragile, and this art embodies it's fragility in the display of both keys.
I had tinkered with the idea of sending one of these bills to RMS himself with 1 BTC attached to it.. Still wondering. I wonder what he'd think of it. As much as I respect him, he is one of the most cantankerous folks I am aware of.

I wrote this just a few minutes ago and I really liked it:
Well, let me give you this from two angles:
1. The bubble angle: The current trend data is surprisingly consistent with the 2011 bubble that took bitcoin from $2 to $30 and back to $2 in the span of a month. If you look at search trend data and price data the conclusion is irrefutable.
2. The capitalization angle: After 4 years as a proven currency bitcoin is finally reaching its true market capitalization potential. Banks are failing and no one trusts governments anymore. Bitcoin is a safe haven and has a controlled and limited supply. We can expect the price to continue rising with a few minor bumps for the forseeable future.

That's a beautiful question. You don't actually store bitcoin anywhere, you store a private key that accesses your bitcoin on the network. You could store your bitcoin private keys in a few ways on that flash drive, all of which are tiny:
* As a 51-digit private key in a text file. This is my personal favorite, takes less than 1k of storage. This (in my opinion) is the most versatile storage.
* As a wallet.dat file. This ranges between 49k and 700k, usually on the smaller side. This is easy to import into many wallet programs, including many online wallets.
* As a pdf printed page generated at bitaddress.org. I like this because it translates my private key into several formats including QR codes. I feel like the multiple versions of the key reduce the likelihood of it being lost. Learn a lot more about this before you go plugging your private key in. This method takes about 120k.
All of these methods are less than 1 meg, so you could theoretically store thousands of wallets on a 16GB flash drive.
* Bonus - as a persistent linux installation that you only use to access your bitcoin. This would require you to install something like xubuntu on the flash drive, then boot into it and install the local client of your choice. Lots of people are fans of the armory client for security; I don't have a personal preference.

[Physical Bitcoins by Casascius]( are the standard in physical bitcoins. They are an excellent way to store bitcoin, especially if you use a two-factor key.

I can agree with a large portion of what you said, but I don't believe that increased mining capacity will lead to plummeting prices. I don't say that to encourage speculation, but miners and vendors have to jump quite a financial hurdle to mine bitcoin these days, and they're not likely to just give them away. With the hash capacity growing and the supply staying the same I think we'll continue to see a strong valuation. The current $130-$140 seems very reasonable to me right now given the difficulty of mining. I wish I had better information for predicting long term value, but I got nothin.

At the same time, the holders of bitcoin have no compelling reason to part with their precious coin, so it has driven the price sky high.
Because there is a limited and known quantity of bitcoin, the value will continue to increase unless something unforseen occurs. 
At some point in the next 5-8 years, the ability to purchase physical goods with bitcoin and exchange it freely with fiat currency will determine whether it will be viable.
At this moment, the ability to buy physical goods is severely limited, though acceptance is increasing at a break neck pace.
There's an interesting conundrum that those who hold their coin will profit the most if bitcoin survives, but the only way for bitcoin to survive is to spend it as currency. There is a huge amount of capital to be gained by developing industry that encourages people to pay with bitcoin.

You're not likely to have a substantial hash rate but if you're not paying for electricity you might give it a shot.
You should get [19.2 MH/s]( on each i7 920 for a total of 57.6MH/s over the long term. You would gross [$11.94]( per month at the current bitcoin price of $90ish.

It sounds like you have some very basic questions. Let me answer a bit and direct you to some video resources that should help.
Bitcoin ownership is not associated with any government entity. You should still pay taxes on your bitcoin wealth, and the US is working to enforce that, but it is not directly related to US Dollars in any way.
Have you seen the introduction to bitcoin video?

Please refer to the second community rule on the right sidebar. It's not that we don't want to welcome you, it's just that it would become a messy place if everyone begged for donations.

I don't claim to understand all of the specifics, but this is part of the hash network resiliency plan. A found block only needs one successful broadcast to propagate throughout the network. In the absence of that link, both chains would continue mining creating a fork. When the connection is reestablished the forks merge and balances are settled. There is the potential for a double spend, but I think there are countermeasures for that as well.

I guess I see the frenzy a little differently than you suggest. Where you see "tell everyone about bitcoin so the price rises", I see "there is this incredible new technology that could change payment systems the way email changed the postal system."
I do have weird political struggles with bitcoin - I'm actually socially liberal and a believer in community/social programs, but I'm a little annoyed that my government uses my tax dollars to kill people with a different shade of skin color, a slightly different religion, or a stockpile of black gold.
My hope is that bitcoin could eventually allow wealth in the hands of more people than the hands of a few. I could be wrong - I probably am - but I enjoy the concept.

Wow. That is literally insane. I was 100% sure that you were being phished before reading this. Are you sure you're on the real MtGox? Does the SSL check out? 
I have to say, if what you say is accurate, this is first class ass quackery for about 37 reasons. The simplest reason, is that customer support staff shouldn't have or need direct access to your login information. They should easily be able to issue a one-time-password reset  after meticulously verifiying that you are the legitimate owner. Further, they risk your security be requesting that you send your pasword through ANY email server.

Most people do seem to say it "bun" ... but I sure do like my pronunciation ;-)
Here's the thing - most people think that having your keys stored deep in an electronic file somewhere is the most accessible method. The truth is that if I have a raw private key I can import it anywhere in seconds while someone else is searching for a stored file.
And yes, this is a "nest egg" sort of thing. Once the private key has been imported all of the precautions of keeping the key off of the network are pointless.

Oh. The idea of storing it separately is to recognize that my house might burn down and if it did I could have lost my bitcoin. By cutting the private key into a few segments, you can give each segment to a trusted friend and recover the private key if the need arises.

It is fair for Theymos to say that he resolved the situation on his own, and I am sure that he is responsible for much of the effort, but there are additional facts:
1) the night of the attack, Theymos came here and said (essentially) "I don't know what happened, but I know it's out of my league, and I'll offer 50 BTC to anyone who can resolve it."
2) After that post, lots of people identified potential issues with php and SMF that could have elucidated the issue.
I am grateful to Theymos for resolving this issue in a timely manner, but I suggest that he wouldn't have solved it without the zeitgeist created by hundreds of people working simultaneously to solve the problem. 
Basically, while I am willing to concede that Theymos solved the problem, I think it's appropriate to recognize a contributor in the community who provided substantial input to expedite the process. There are several people on the original thread who may fit that bill.
Many of us recognize this event in science as "standing on the shoulders of giants".

That bitcoin is circling the drain and that miners will quit. 100% of the assumptions I observed I interpret as faulty.
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:25:59
I get your jist, but I just don't see that scenario unfolding. I think bitcoin is pretty close to having reached a longevity status that surpasses the fad stage. If it becomes outlawed, or traffic filtered, or threatened in other ways miners will see this as a challenge to basic human freedoms and they will find innovative ways to mine. It may drive the price and scarcity even higher, but it won't kill the hashrate or the network. See: The Piratebay's resiliency. I don't intend to compare bitcoin to the pirate bay, but the piratebay is a similarly resilient distributed technology that has thrived despite being scorned by much of the establishment.
To actually entertain your question, mass shutdowns could be caused by an international failure of the power grid or a geographic partitioning of the internet. Depending on when these events occur (in the next "x" number of years), bitcoin will either be snuffed out quickly, or it will be seen by the world as a priority service that must be re-established as quickly as possible.
