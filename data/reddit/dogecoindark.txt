If you are looking for "typical" transactions the average (the mean) is the wrong statistical measure. Using the median would produce more suitable results.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:26:32
Yeah, this doesn't really help on margin. It can actually slow the network down in some cases. Running a node for development of an app is one thing, in which case a selfish node is best, but this idea of running a node to help the community is more like virtue signalling to those who wrongly believe it helps, and it ends up just costing you money that you otherwise could have spent developing a crypto app or buying more crypto or advertising it.

The tools to accurately report it didn't really exist at the time. A lack of clarity, too, as people still have questions about it despite the minimal guidance the IRS has provided. Even TurboTax didn't provide a clear option about how or what to do. So for those who wanted to do things right it might not have even been possible.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:32:58
Quoted from another user:


@_date: 2017-12-05 13:36:19
That tool does not work for every person's situation. Exchange failures, hacks, theft, altcoin trades, donations, etc. all effect the outcome of this. Basically for a majority of people who used Bitcoin as a cash system, *as it used to be*, they would have found accurately reporting impossible, hence the discrepancy between those who reported and those who may have realized gains *or* losses. Only the simple crypto users who buy one kind and sell one kind on exchange could use the tool you mention. So while it may have worked easily for your situation, you may not be among those who utilize this technology in a broader sense of investing or day to day use. Nobody is looking for sympathy (pathos), especially from some anon on the internet, we want to figure out how we can accurately (logos) report our taxes truthfully (ethos). If we can't do this then we can't report it without perjuring ourselves.

I haven't seen anyone discuss this point, so let me bring it forth:
If someone was to make a copy of Bitcoin or Litecoin or any other form of blockchain and mine it on their computer, and allow others to mine it, yet they didn't give it any name, they wouldn't have any way to differentiate between kinds. They could keep making more and more blockchains but they would be indistinguishable in kind. This demonstrates blockchains have commodity like characteristics, and what people are confusing for different kinds are actually just different *brands* of the same kind.
So while its possible to have an infinite number of *brands* of soybeans, each selling for different prices, its not possible to have an infinite number of species. Even slight genetic differences, such as "Round-Up ready" versus standard don't change its kind.
Such with blockchains, listing it only as "virtual currency", regardless of its brand, as the IRS names it in their literature, simplifies the issue and suffices. It is all only one kind with many different brands.

1) Why would you call me names? I assume you think Jihan Wu is a bad guy, whether this is true or not, I have no opinion to voice about the guy.
2) Actively discouraging people from running useless nodes helps both the network and the person who saves themselves the trouble and money.
3) Mining conglomerates and corporations are run by real people. They are firms. Read Coase if you want to understand how these are not bad at all.
4) Digital signatures reliably linked to validated transactions makes Bitcoin trustless
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:05:26
These, too, slow down the network, so unless your rig is being used for an app, don't, and if it is, configure it to be a selfish node. This network was originally designed to work following economic principles. Any deviation from those original principles makes the system weaker.

If a Chinese person uses the i2p feature in DogecoinDark nobody could find the node and their privacy is preserved. It means choose an altcoin instead of keeping everything with Bitcoin.

Consider how many actually abide by licensing restrictions. IP laws are rarely enforced, as with most laws in China that do not directly affect government owned assets. Also, components of ASICs factor in as well, not just processors. Also, warehousing is cheap.

The argument can be made it is a barter transaction and not an investment. It's a common way to reduce exchange rate risk on international transactions, for example. The classification as a commodity supports this practice.
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:52:20
Manufacturing is cheaper and has a comparative advantage in computer hardware. Capital outflow is controlled and bitcoin is a means of sidestepping these controls. These capital restrictions also mean bitcoin holds a higher value than elsewhere and trades at a premium. These factors make mining more profitable than other countries.

Bitcoin foremost is a software program. Software is speech. Speech is not taxable as it is protected under the First Amendment. This case has already been decided in the courts a long time ago. Any entity regulating Bitcoin is likely unintentionally breaking the law and hasn't done their due diligence looking for precedent.

Think of it this way. "Bitcoin" is the name of a software program that enables players to send in-game tokens. Each player hosts the game instead of some big game company that issues tokens. To make sure nobody hacks the game to unfairly give themselves more tokens each player checks all the others' transfer history. If there is any disagreement the cheater gets his version of the transfer history rejected and the others keep the record the majority, in terms of processing power, agrees on.

I get the vibe they're the low-hanging fruit of VC (case in point, Megaupload 2.0). They cater to Bitcoiners and do not at first glance appear to advertise relationships for startup companies from other industries, or demonstrate a track-record from companies they've funded in other industries. You'd think VC would want to diversify itself.
