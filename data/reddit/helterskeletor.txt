Does the US not have email money transfers? Canada has had them for over 12 years.

It went up to around $1200 and then dropped back down or around 500.

My account was also breached:

I created the account when Bitcoin went up to over $1kUSD and put like 0.08 bitcoins in it. No transaction info since then though. I also don't have a Kickstarter account so I don't think it's that.
The IPs all seem to be coming from China but I would be this is someone inside MtGox more than anything.

Nope. Here we can use our online banking to send an email money transfer which can be accepted by any major bank or credit union in Canada.

More like "accidentally found"

Hey, don't be so negative. It could just be a factory defect!

I know several. Perhaps you are just inexperienced with anyone other than yourself.

I'm sure you're a much better person than that slutty prostitute you keep attempting to shame.
Go to hell.
