JPMC has millions of customers, and I highly doubt 100 customers closed their bank accounts because of Jamie's remarks. It's a huge PITA to change primary banking institutions (moving direct deposit, updating all auto-pays, etc). There's now way a Bitcoin user exodus is anywhere near the level of the Occupy Wall Street bank takedown of 2012 and that barely hurt the banks.

Robinhood Gold is for margin trading. Margin isn't free.

That's not an account closure...

Good or bad, it's unavoidable. There are derivatives/futures on every financial instrument.

The  way to get there is by having more passive holders in relation to the news junkie "traders" that dominate the market today. Coinbase got big because it was easy (no wallets or knowledge of public-key cryptography necessary) and feels safer than many of the relatively unknown exchanges. Robinhood being a trusted brokerage used by many armchair investors is a step in the right direction in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:08:54


I really doubt that.

You buy Bitcoin from people who bought it cheaper, you're planning on selling to someone who will pay more. At what point does the world run out of greater fools?
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:44:30
That makes no sense. Fewer people selling raises the price.

Never close a financial account until you've paid all taxes associated with it. You need to be able to prove when you purchased your assets and for how much should the taxman cometh.

Keeping ~$8M USD worth of bitcoin on an exchange is a different kind of risk.

Keeping $8M USD worth of assets (not even counting his other exchange accounts) is a different kind of risk...

You just described a form of fiat.

I don't think this is true but I don't know enough about pan handlers to dispute it.

They automate verification.

It most certainly is.

I spoke with this vendor at an event recently. When you take a picture of your ID and then yourself holding your ID, machine vision is used in conjunction with the other KYC processes. 
Edit: on your "reliability" point, these techs can handle 99+% of customers and flag the rest for fraud review.

What city?
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:36:15
I think the FOMO will be even more hardcore during the next real bull run. Now people know that Bitcoin can see 400% growth in 6 months.

Infinitely scalable .... A term that's only ever used at the beginning of emerging technologies. Let's wait and see the bottlenecks once the tech moves into the real world.

Just save your money and buy your parts on Black Friday. You'll save more money on sales that you will make from Bitcoin in that time frame. Most likely scenario you will take a loss, best case scenario you'll make like $20.

If there are two versions of Bitcoin with near-equivalent market cap (e.g. a true split) then your point is valid. However, that is just speculation at this point and the likely outcome is that capital will move towards the coin that appears dominant. Once capital moves towards one coin, there will likely be a snowball effect as people try to cash out of the coin that's declining in value and move their earnings into the dominant coin. In the eyes of those outside of the community, there is still only one Bitcoin.

A large amount of inefficiency due to the way banks interact with each OTHER. It doesn't take your bank 3 days to transfer money, it takes the string of financial institutions 3 days to transfer money. Having a distributed ledger among the FIs eases these inefficiencies. I believe any coin issued by a central bank will be premined and pegged to their fiat rate. Most money is already digital, but still moves along old school rails. Blockchain has the potential to be the new rails, whether it be through BTC or USD. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:36:00
The problem with a database is when you have multiple parties involved, such as banks in different jurisdictions, clearing houses, and custodians all involved with each transaction. A distributed ledger can centralize this activity to drive efficiencies. Yes, a database is miles more efficient in a silo, but a single database can't manage the complicated processes behind cross-border payments. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:29:58
One can only hope.

Don't buy the dip, use dollar cost averaging and buy over time.

They are being regulated through KYC/AML at endpoints ... The only regulation they need. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:13:02
SWIFT is actively experimenting with blockchain as they are very quickly becoming irrelevant. Ripple is definitely an important player here, but once blockchain is demystified (which is happening FAST) there will be no need for them. It's trivial to create a cryptocurrency network at this point and the banks will want to control it. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:57:26
You better have enough for the rest of your life, because the cost of acquiring more will keep rising.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:29:45
There are two questions here: how much you want to invest and how often you want to purchase. You want to first decide how much you are willing to put on the table every month (e.g. $100). You then buy $100 worth every month, or $25 every week, etc. This protects you from volatility and as long as there is long-term growth in Bitcoin you are protected from swings and can confidently buy at all-time-highs.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:28:21
Park your coins in a wallet compatible with both chains, grab a pint, and wait for this to all blow over. One chain will emerge triumphant and capital will flow in that direction.

Deflation makes for a shit currency, but a great store of value.

The benefits of cryptocurrency for commercial use are lower transaction fees and instant settlement. Businesses and government will never use BTC but want those benefits. Keep watching and you'll see more and more state-issued crypto over the next year.

How much of your spending is through Bitcoin today?
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:55:15
Spending money literally is the economy ... the production and consumption of goods and services.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:48:32
KYC/AML regulations do affect Bitcoin. All endpoints (where crypto can be exchanged for fiat) are required to follow KYC/AML in most jurisdictions. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:28:52
You'll probably be down voted but you're very right. Banks are already developing their own cryptocurrency that provides the benefits of BTC to the financial institutions without the risks. People on this sub don't realize how little typical consumers care about decentralization which is the only benefit BTC will have over bank-issued cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:20:34
I use Trezor. If you don't have a hardware wallet, you should do your own research. I think Electrum would be fine, but I have not had to research into that.
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:05:50
Why would you spend money today that would be worth more tomorrow? Gradual, controlled inflation is healthy for economies.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:29:33
If you think you can call the bottom, you're going to lose money. Dollar cost average my friend. Buy the same dollar amount of bitcoin at regular intervals indefinitely and you will beat the market. It's math.
edit: assuming bitcoin grows over the long-term
