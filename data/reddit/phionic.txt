Bro, I know what side chains are, they're on the Monero roadmap too.  I didn't say anything about the coin limit either.  Is that a reference to Monero's tail emission?  The emission curves are actually pretty similar and only really diverge long after we'll all be dead.  I get a kick out of people who obsess over inflation in crypto when Bitcoin is and has been highly inflationary throughout its rise.  My point about the fungibility of the base layer stands, it'll never be enforced by law so it'll have to be enforced cryptographically and I don't think the Bitcoin community has the will to do it anymore.  There are too many competing interests including political and commercial ones, and even worse, unholy hybrids of the two like chainalysis companies.  Bitcoin = Panopticoin and it's only going to get worse.

ELI5 brah, I don't even know what I'm looking for.  I do understand the basic concept of what sidechains are and how they work.

Except non-fungibility of the base layer, non-scalability of the base layer (no, 1MB blocks will never be enough even with side chains/lightning), and mining centralization in China.  The only real drawback to Monero is the blockchain size which is comparable to Bitcoin with CT (if it ever gets integrated) and still way less than something like Ethereum.

Lol, who's going to sign up for recording their pr0n downloads permanently in the blockchain?  What is the point of this?

Dash is definitely the coin of choice for edgy retards.

I'm now convinced that Monero is what Bitcoin should have been.  Downvote me if you want, its true.

The number one benefit of DE shaving I've found is that the razor doesn't fucking clog!  I'm surprised more people don't mention this because it was a game changer for me.  I never had a problem with the way my Mach3 shaved per se but if I tried to shave through more than a days growth it would clog to the point of uselessness before i was even half done, I'd have to either deal with poking the hairs out of it with a toothpick or buzz my face with clippers before shaving.  Fuck that noise, I hated shaving so much before I tried a DE but now its at least tolerable, I'm not an enthusiast like some guys but I'm definitely happy I made the switch.

Alts like Monero are why I'm convinced Bitcoin will succeed.  Governments have to know that if they shut down Bitcoin (implying they even can) they'll be forever playing whack-a-mole with other more anonymous currencies; its a prisoner's dilemma.

I'm now certain that Putin is Satoshi Nakamoto.

I remember Ron Paul talking about using letters of marque to fight terrorism back in 2007 an everybody thought he was crazy.

Yes, it threatens their taxing power which is what all state power rests on; however Bitcoin doesn't completely eliminate it (because its not completely anonymous) like an altcoin might (whack-a-mole problem).  I said a state which embraces Bitcoin would benefit *relative to others*; this is the crux of the prisoner's dilemma, an actor still faces punishment but the question is how much.  So, a state can reduce its "punishment" by embracing Bitcoin and gain relative to others which do not because of capital flight (the Bitcoin ecosystem is essentially zero-sum); therefore all rational states will embrace Bitcoin.

So is proof of stake (like Mintcoin) actually more secure since an attacker would have to actually buy 51% of the coins which would skyrocket the price?  A Bitcoin adversary could accumulate hashing power with fiat money without affecting the price before launching his attack.

Eh, that was sort of a half finished thought.  On thinking about it more the whack-a-mole bit is only part of it.  Bitcoin is a global phenomenon (because the internet is global) but the world is made up of nation states and destroying the network would require the collusion of all of them.  There is incentive for them to do this because it threatens their power (by making capital flight easy) yet enmity exists between states and any state which embraces Bitcoin stands to gain relative to the others; therefore a prisoner's dilemma exists.

Its called Monero

IMO Trump will be the best thing to ever happen to crypto if he tries to cut off Mexican remittances because the left will be back in opposition mode and fashionable opinion will be on our side for once.  Hillary on the other hand is literally Satan, there is no potential upside.
