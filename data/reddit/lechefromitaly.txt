yea basically. in the eu the most secure one is kraken. don't know in the US but i wouldn't advise you coinbase because it's a shit exchange. they lock people out of the accounts for months without notice and steal all your coins if even one coin is traced back to the deep web.

binance is imho the best one but doesn't allow cashouts. only exchange of cryptos or buying from cc with fiat
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:16:42
Kraken requires identification and you have to send enough documents to confirm your identity. There is some limit but there is always an higher tier that suits your finances. Sign up and try it. There is also a subreddit with their support and a live chat on their site that I used many times and were always helpful

This and hundreds others require you a verification of ID for bank stuff and it takes weeks. Not a single one is working if you don't have a cc

Cheaper for casual use, not that much faster than a normal bank for what I saw.

Probably overdosed on eroin

That's even worse. Coinbase is similar and has to cooperate with law enforcement. So many accounts frozen without notice. Kraken let's you know before hands and gives you a chance to withdraw the funds
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:46:41
Nothing because the database was hacked and my account was emptied right before the bankruptcy. I didn't even know that because the site closed right after. Took me years to realize
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:34:03
First thing I did when I came back to crypto is buying a nano s. Never leave your crypto on a website. I read thousands of bad things happening. I only trust kraken and binance.

Mt gox victim here. Nothing scares me anymore

You probably wasted more in fees than what you would actually have in the end.

First rule of crypto is not to trust anyone in here. On reddit they like to spread fake positive news to try to artificially pump interest and price into coins to dump them later on. I actually documented this phenomenon for some time. Do your own research and don't believe any article from websites and you're good to go.

Unless you get your crypto from cex.io

Some admin literally deleted him manually from the database for the legal issues and not wanting to deal with the fbi maybe? Let's ask directly

Literally nobody was selling btc for PayPal back in the  day. You got lucky. I had to buy some bullshit videogame currency then transfer it somewhere else. Before converting it to btc. Took me. Like 3 days

You could. But you also have a recovery password in case you lose your hardware wallet you can just buy a new one and recover your wallet seed from the phrase. Same as a password. Now you only have to keep 24 words safe

Sent my btc in 2013 from btc-e to Mtgox cause they gave a higher rate.  Now I don't even fully trust binance.i bought a ledger nano s right away when I got into crypto and only have verge and some other shitcoin there. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:14:55
Man I don't even remember wich house number I live at. Sometimes I need 5 seconds to remember how old I am and I forget things right away and my memories are fucked up and most of the times, wrong. The only reason  I'm still alive is because of muscle memory when I have to use the atm and don't have to remember the pin. Believe me some people like me can't remember shit.

Never saw people buying bread with stocks. Crypto is being used like stocks. I know the circlejerk in this sub but it's the truth. Being a currency and a payment system is now even in 90% people's mind. Almost everyone wants to just buy, get rich and sell. They don't care about buying stuff with crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:34:20
I mean if it were to save my country's economy I wouldnt really be mad. Can't trade or use bitcoins if the economy is fucked. The price of crypto would be 0 so not much of an use. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:39:11
I will. Thanks for the heads up

That's not how it should work... What's the point of permissions If the app stores it anyway lol

Yes but actually no cause my account was hacked right before anyway. I can only get 20 cents
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:32:32
I remember sending my btc to mtgox 2 weeks before bankruptcy cause it was worth more lmao
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:31:47
i've already sent the money on my first wallet but it's still 121 weeks behind. i didn't recive the money yet, that means i have to wait until the update is done, then i get the money and then i can sent it to the other wallet because it's faster right?
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:09:14
the bot was 
and this is the pm i've got 
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:41:59
or i can send the money to a web wallet no?

Holy shit dude... I have like 0.40 btc, I feel broke as fuck

ho visto che questo è il modo piu facile ma ancora non mi fidavo completamente, cioè una volta che pago, dove finiscono sti slc? non ho un account 2nd life, come li riscatto?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:11:02
well, what if it's not just me? if they rob 0.5 from 1000 accounts instead of 100 bitcoins from one? who knows... just everything that happened seems too strange, you don't have to be a dick and feel superior because "you spend your day on bitcoins" anyway. try maybe to be at least friendly? not saying that i'm right, i'm just sharing what happened but c'mon! don't be a dick.
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:13:10
I gotta say that I was pretty naive. My account was hacked anyway cause of the btc-e hacking and I lost the funds anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:15:17
why? i don't have any reasons to do that at all. i always thought the sevice was great
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:16:13
ok did it, now let's wait but oh shit i'm like 215 weeks behind on my bitcoins client, is that normal? how are we going to use this software 10 years later? like we have to load 2-3 years? am i missing something? or just a new release should fix the weeks behind?
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:12:12
oh shit ahah. not a wallet, i just ignored the msg because i wasn't interested in bitcoins. i just remebered right now that i have 3 dollars in bitcoins and that's the only link i have
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:35:22
