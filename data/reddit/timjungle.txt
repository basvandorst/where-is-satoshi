I had a deposit of 5.000 CHF 3 years ago on eToro. After 1 week I discovered they are fraud and it's just a whole simulation. You will *never* win money there because it's not real.
I got my money back after 8 months with my lawyer.
Don't give this site a platform. I will provide proofs and tons of screenshots if the CEO ever come here again and talk good about this site.
Like FT_clox said, this is not good news. This site is toxic, fraud on all levels and only survive because they are able to pay huge money to new sign ups ( Webmaster program ), this is obviously only possible because they never payout the actual trader because the system is fully made up.
Damn why you guys even upvote this topic here, please I just want to understand.

What exactly they said on phone ?
Try to get some paper from the bank to proof they block the payments and bring it to the news ( Bild.de, Welt.de, Spiegel.de etc. ). This is a pretty big deal, I can't believe you guys just taking it.
What the fuck, seriously. Just block outgoing payments without even saying a word. It's worse then paypal.

Not exactly. 
They used a program to takeover a computer ( which is illegal ) after that they use the hardware to generate bitcoin. Germany had a lot of cases where a botnet was involved but they never send GSG 9 to them, it's the first time.
I am not saying the whole thing is good but the usual way is sending the "Kriminalpolizei".

Yes I am one of the few people who shares your opinion. It's the same with filesharing: "Piratebay is just a site with links", blabla, everyone knows what happens there. Silk Road is full of people selling drugs, money laundering, tax evasion etc.
For bitcoin it's a good thing they shut this down.

I think it's very funny. Government gets nervous about bitcoin ? No problem, send GSG-9 for 2 kids.
If someone is curious about GSG-9, here you go:  ( GSG 9 is a German counter-terrorism and special operations unit. )

Usually they send the Kriminalpolizei when a botnet is involved, it's the first time they sent GSG-9. This probably had something to do with bitcoin.

Well, we help our customers to purchase BitCoin. Not all banks are bad.

I work in a bank in Switzerland and everyone here is hyped about BitCoin. I understand banks in Germany get nervous, we get a lot of traffic lately from your country.
My advice: Drop the bank if you don't have some kind of special relationship or credit there. A lot of our customers using the "Deutsche Bank". Never heard something bad.
