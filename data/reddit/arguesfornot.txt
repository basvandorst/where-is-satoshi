Temporarily yes. But he controls 1 million of 21 million total coins. The demand for BTC would quickly absorb that influx.
And obviously he knows that it would damage the market at this point 
Right now, there is a big effort to create ETFs (ETNs) for this coin. The institutions are working on a way to leverage BTC as a hedge against inflation since storing and managing gold has issues.
Bitcoin has intrinsic value now and not because the creator holds his coins.
It’s because millions of people hold the coins in personal wallets. There is a global network of exchanges. Large mining operations. GPU mined alts which peg to BTC price.
And a new class of platforms like ethereum, cardano, and others that trade against it.
It’s too big to just disappear at this point. We are just figuring out how to incorporate it into the existing system in an intelligent way.
It’s way past one guy or company.

XRP is well organized and funded by banks. I’m not a fan, but it’s definitely a good value proposition.
LTC is pegged to BTC. Like the coin and it’s good that you hold them. Not sure if they will increase much against BTC, but we shall see.
Monero is a like a ninja warrior. Silent and deadly. Good choice. My current favorite alt.
Powr looks like a pump and dump. Not sure yet on it, but I love the idea. Maybe it’ll go the distance.

The leaks weren’t the reason Hillary lost. She lost because she was a terrible candidate and the Bernie supporters stayed home.
It’s as simple as that. People had made up their minds MONTHS before. They were abstaining, writing in candidates, or voting for the Donald. The base voted for Hillary because that was the only realistic thing to do. 
Stop blaming the outcome on what Russia did. Yes they fucked with our elections. But we are grown ups who can make up our minds.

Bitcoin is a commodity currency that’s designed to be the new global reserve currency.
The US Government can’t “force” anyone to hold USD. That’s now how free markets work.
The rest of the world has been quietly moving off the USD for many years now. The last crash was the last straw.
They will increasingly turn to blockchains as reserve systems. Bitcoin happens to lead the space right now.
“People” decide how to protect their money. Not governments. It has and always will be that way. 
German and Japan have both legalized bitcoin as a currency in their country. You can use it all over the place now.
The US treats it as property. For now, we will rely on  and other services like it to create credit cards with blockchain asset collateral. We can create fiat from our coins. Just like magic. And it’s tax efficient.
The US will continue to have the USD as it’s official currency (for now). But globally, it will be far less advantageous for the average person to hold USD.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:03:22
What can you do with gold? 
It’s valuable because industries need it. It’s a luxury. Has a long history of value.

@_date: 2017-12-24 22:44:35
The assumption is that bitcoin will not fix its issues. 
Other coins would have the same challenge that bitcoin has if they had its traffic.
Being decentralized AND efficient is very challenging and it’s taking time to roll out the next layer.
Another platform like Dash or ripple is highly centralized around a few groups. Makes it easy to move fast, but it’s closer to a security than a commodity.
Bitcoin today is still the reserve currency. You can scream and yell about it all you want, but the whole industry was created from what they did. All other digital currencies are “pegged” to it.
You underestimate how entrenched bitcoin is at this point. What other coin, that’s decentralized could take its place right now?
 Fees are high so people moving small amounts will have issues.
For the committed users of bitcoin, it’s a rounding error. We don’t move bitcoin all that often.

As long as basics of life are still denominated in fiat, the existing system isn’t going anywhere.
What we are building is a system for the (new) elites of the world.
The people with lots of capital who want to be free to roam the world and travel. Not be tied to a single country, but tied to an idea.
The USD is not going to go anywhere because 300 million people rely on it to live. And they will kill you if you try to fuck with them.
On the global scale, the world will move off the usd reserve system and on to blockchains. It may be bitcoin based or it may be a banker solution like XRP (god forbid).
My bet is that it’ll be a basket of cryptocurrencies.

You just touched on what a very large economy is really... a decentralized Ponzi scheme.
It’s just complex enough that it’s can sustain itself for many, many years.
Except eventually, it does collapse (2009) and require a central authority to jump in and fix it.
Bitcoin is an attempt at removing the need for the central authority by replacing it with coins that have no centralized mint and aren’t backed by a single country.
Convince enough people that this is the way we will do money in the future, and you’ve created a new reserve currency that all other currencies will peg against.
Crazy idea. even if they aren’t successful, the world will learn that there are alternatives to our current central banking system.

I think the argument was that it was kicking the can down the road by increasing the block size. They also didn’t want to support mining anymore, but move to an additional proof of stake model via an L2 strategy. This is a step in that direction.
I thought it was reasonable to increase the block size to keep us together a little longer. Apparently, that wasn’t a popular opinion.

This market and technology is decades in the making.

That’s not how this works. 
We are held hostage by bitcoin until it solves its bottlenecks. Going to fiat is not an option. We are married to the mad king for now.
Reserve currency = Bitcoin
USD has the same power for the rest of the world which makes divesting a foolish move.
Bitcoin is broken right now. To say otherwise, is being intellectually dishonest. We can’t leave however because it’s the basis of the new digital currency economy.
I’ve been a holder for years and don’t plan on leaving, but we have to fix this situation.

Gold conquered the world because it was distributed, verifiable, durable, and fungible.
Bitcoin is attempting to duplicate those properties digitally.
If we do it right, they won’t have a chance but accept defeat. When everyone is buying and hoarding the coin, it becomes the symbol of wealth.
It’s a long process and many more challenges lay ahead before this goal is achieved. This version of the attempt (we tried this a few times before in the 90s) May or may not be successful.
Needless to say we will try again if it fails.

Fair enough. I can respect that idea. 
Where I’m coming from is if you didn’t live in the US. You didn’t have access or really a compelled reason to own us equities (no tax benefit, no 401k, etc).
You are one of the 95% of the population that until recently, you would use USD as an asset to hedge against inflation in your country.
What people need is some sort of competitive currency market that lets them store value and connect globally to a world of other people who believe in distributed money.
That’s what we built. A smarter, safer way to store and transmit value. And every year for the past 8 years we have continued to grow and gain acceptance.

Monero took bitcoins job for that market.
Btc is now an inflation hedge for central banking shenanigans now. It’s not so much the BTC price as the amount of new money that has been printed that’s sloshing around the global economy.
Crypto is designed to take that money instead of it being poured into assets that have capped upside.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:41:06

So does the USD and current global banking system.
The difference is if you have a big enough network, growth, and have currency properties (fungible, divisible, transmissible, etc), you can be considered a currency.

You sound like someone who just bought bitcoin in the past 12 months. Bitcoin does NOT always go up in value.


All decent (non segwit) support fee selection. It’s been around since the beginning.
Segwit isn’t available on most exchanges. Shapeshift.io hasn’t enabled it. It’s still too early to see the effect of segwit on prices because most places you need to send bitcoin don’t support it and thus you need to use legacy.


It’s a long way off to having a production ready system. Lightning discussions have been around for years. I’m assuming we are still at least 18 months away from this.
My point is that Bitcoin is a speculative investment as it currently exists today. It has potential to be much more, but to assume that it’s working as it is supposed to is just plain false.
I’m speaking from someone who has been in this game since 2012. It’s not ready for prime time yet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:48:41
If it costs $25 to move $500,000 then that’s pretty reasonable to those that need to move money. The people who use bitcoin move a lot of money.
It is not good for new adopters for sure. Litecoin, monero, or dash might be a better coin for small transactions right now.

Except it’s a tiny fraction of new people working on a different coin that’s funded by Jihan, Roger Ver, and a few wealthy, powerful people.
Bitmain’s monopoly is what this fork is also about. Bitcoin Cash doesn’t contain segwit which removes his patented competitive advantage (asicboost). Jihan wants to ensure mining drives the network vs the users of the coin.
The movement is about NOT centralizing money. And Bitcoin Cash Is absolutely trying to ensure that (Chinese) miners stay in control.
Not acceptable for the majority of people who hold Bitcoin.

The mempool has been backed up a whole bunch the past several weeks. I don’t always have the luxury to wait until the network is clear.

Instead of China holding us dollars, they will hold a global cryptocurrency as a reserve currency.
This is about the next financial system. One that isn’t backed by the USD. 
It may be Bitcoin, or it may be a new challenger that has yet to appear.
We may need to retool with a new distribution method that isn’t as energy intensive as mining. Or we can just limit the mining by keeping the blocks small (hint hint).

We have 3-7 years to think about how to right the ship. 
That means focusing on getting the right policy and candidates in place. The rise of decentralized money (cryptocurrencies) will play a huge part in the future as we can now spend unlimited money without controls.

Yeah, there is a lot of anarch-capitalist feelings in the community. That sort of comes from being very oppressed in the existing system for generations. I think it goes way too far, when really people just want to live in peace and prosper.
Money became way to centralized in the previous decades. It created unfair advantages for the few and caused a lot of suffering for many, many people.
Two income families with high debt and lots of pressure. Misery caused by inflation and stagnant wages. This system spread through the rest of the world because it enabled oligarchs to stay in power while enslaving an ever growing number of people.
When along came a deflationary currency system (back from the 1800s) where you weren’t PUNISHED for saving. You could still choose to invest in assets, but your MONEY itself was an asset!
The Austrian economic model is what this is about. You are seeing the rise of a new banking system based on “sound money” where we know the circulation and network of our money.
We can “choose” which blockchain we hold currency in. Don’t like the politics of your current coin? Fuck them, there are a dozen others that are cool. I am not stuck on one because of where I live.
Monero - privacy always
Litecoin - transaction speed
Dash - mining + masternodes allows for scaling and better governance

Loses are only real if you sell. The wealthy know this. You don’t sell assets. You leverage them to create more money. 
So do whatever you have to do to not ever have to sell assets at the wrong time. That means being smart and always having enough cash to carry you during rough times. Buffet suggests a 30% (local currency) cash position.

Bitcoin Cash is interesting, but I’m not convinced on the tech team.
I am really not impressed with Jihan and Roger Ver. They have their own economic interests at heart. 
While I’ll agree that bitcoin is a shitshow right now, I’m not convinced the team behind Bitcoin Cash can deliver. They don’t have any plans for L2 scaling. They don’t have much in terms of tech talent working on it. 
I’m also not convinced on chain scale is going to work long term. Everything I studied about networks while studying CS has taught me that.
I’ll take a wait and see approach over the next few years to decide if on chain scaling actually works.
But I’m sure as hell not buying into a classic Pump ;). Been in this space waaay to long to fall for that one.
Good luck with your coin though!

There are many, many governments in the world that would like to see the USD get replaced as the reserve currency.
Why do you think every country is in a race to do it? Russia, China, India, Switzerland, (even the US) etc.

I disagree. The smart ones will acquire other assets with it or leverage it for fiat if absolutely necessary. You don’t sell assets, you leverage them.
There is no going back really once you understand this stuff. You’ve got potentially unlimited upside.

That’s like saying in the old system that using the USD in Japan was not really possible so the USD is “tanking”.
There is one reserve currency. You’ll always have many, many currencies for different reasons. Think about why that is.
There is one reserve currency of the modern world. Bitcoin is attempting to supplant the USD as that currency.
It’s getting close to that dream. We have futures. We have institutions beginning to trade it.
If it works, it’ll become the global system by which all other currencies are pegged. 
Just like the USD or pound sterling before it.
This is one giant race to be the one true coin. 
This has and always will be about which currency will be the next reserve currency to replace the USD. It’s way bigger than buying shit at amazon.

Or we can use an ever growing number of other chains to move money around and use the common coin as a store of value.
Bitcoin Cash Competes with USD and credit cards, litecoin, monero, dash, and a whole set of “transaction networks”.

I trust Litecoin and monero more than a bad copy of Bitcoin.

I don’t see how it can replace local currencies. 
It’ll be a global currency on top that allows individuals to borrow against to create other fiat currencies. Or you can convert real time into whatever payment the merchant requests.
I don’t see credit and debts going away as instruments.
I don’t see countries, organizations, and individuals no longer creating currencies. If they can, they will.  Bitcoin has to work with other currencies if it is to be accepted.

Take a look at the top 15-20 coins. You can take a look at their websites and read about their “innovations”. Then visit their subreddits and see what people are interested in.
Ultimately, people can choose a coin based on their political ideals as well as tech innovation. 
You need to convince yourself that this coin is quality because you’ll need to buy when they dip against bitcoin and USD to make money with them.
It’s not easy to trade alts. 
You can find “dark horses” by going further down the page and see a nice up and comer. For example, cardano was started by an early Ethereum dev who wanted to make a better version.
eventually, every coin “has its day”. It’ll pump like crazy on some news or whales jumping in on one.
You’ll have to sell back to BTC if you want to take profit. It’s NOT easy again because you may want to just see where it goes. Eventually, if the coin doesn’t “become king” and replace bitcoin it’ll drop back down.

No he knows exactly what it is. 
They’ve had countless meetings about it since it was introduced years ago.
Its been on their radar since 2010-2011 in the first  bubble. 
What he is arguing is that the concept of a currency comes from the strength of an organized government rather than the people who actually use said currency.
One could argue that day to day life in major countries is based largely on the stability of a government and its ability to provide the basic needs to its people at an affordable price. 
That’s his argument. Bitcoin’s argument is that that’s fine and dandy, but the internet is not bound by any one country. It’s not based on a predefined socialized system. 
It’s based purely on greed and fear. It should be open and available to anyone without being tied to one country.
We need a coin to rule them all.

We need to be able to spend it or it’s just a Ponzi scheme. No country will adopt it without risk of being cut off from the central banking system.
Ultimately, it’s a global savings bank for people. after many, many years it may be incorporated into the global governance structure, but we have a long way to go.
But if regular people can’t spend it, it’s not useful and will eventually fall out of favor for a better system.

Inflation subsidized transactions will cover the “low fees“. Bitcoin Cash can’t scale on chain and do the number of transactions necessary and the engineers know it. It can keep pace for a while, but eventually it’ll be a problem. 
But people aren’t  using  bitcoin as a transaction network. It supports moving money around, but it’s for larger amounts (think how a savings account works).
They use it as a store of value than can easily be transferred to another person without a third party or tax. It’s more like a private wealth preservation system.
That’s the use case.
We have credit cards and USD. I also have Litecoin and monero and a whole bunch of other great networks to move money around fast.
There is ONE store of value.

Bitcoin is more than bitcoin. There is a cryptocurrency market with lots of new contenders trying to challenge it (or ally with it).
Bitcoin is safe when you buy it on sale (watch for dips!). Dollar cost average is good too. Only risk what you can afford to lose. Do NOT sell when it drops. If you are over exposed, you’ll freak out and do the wrong thing.
There are other fast growing coins like monero, dash,  and zcash. Big and safe. More volatile. There is a sea of shitcoins that you can gamble on (not my style).
The goal in these networks is to acquire users (miners, hoarders, or larger scale investors). 
It’s a boom and bust cycle so be prepared for bear markets. Eventually, If you build up enough, you can start to consume it. We will soon have credit cards like saltlending.com that’ll make this easy.
Above all, educate yourself. You don’t need a broker. You are the broker. It’s p2p cash.

He is using the Bitcoin name for his own project instead of rebranding. He also is attempting to rename the Bitcoin project as Bitcoin Core. 
There is no innovation except a fork of an older version of Bitcoin. This isn’t the first or last time they have tried this.
They have mining manufacturing, money, and power behind them vs actual users. Bitcoins power comes from the hoards of people who continue to HODL and support the cause. It doesn’t come from businesses.
No one owns the bitcoin name so you see it all over the place.
The longer you spend time in this space the more you’ll realize that the system is focused on its end users (you) NOT miners or third party businesses.
That’s why the design choices have been made.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:24:42
It’s not good at all. 
Currently, the people who are in Bitcoin aren’t too worried because most of the new users stay on exchanges anyway and aren’t moving the coin around. They are on GDAX and or an alt exchange like bittrex gambling on shitcoins.
You can’t use bitcoin to buy anything. And why the hell would you when the price is so volatile! It’s more of a store of value that can be traded with other coins or back to USD. But it’s incredibly valuable because it’s network effect and constrained circulation.
It’s more like digital gold at this point.
Eventually, If the second layer systems aren’t rolled out, then we will have major problems. People will lose interest and money will move else where.
My bet is that SaltLending.com will provide a credit cards and a lending platform first that will make “leveraging” blockchain assets easy.

There is a very active competitive currency market that’s determining who will be king.
Stability to what? USD?  Eventually, another currency will replace the USD. Global Adoption of that currency will supplant the existing king.
Just as every other global reserve fiat before the USD. Remember that the name dollar came from the Spanish Dollar that was used in the new world early on.
The history of money is very long. The pound sterling has been in continuous use since the 8th century. It used to be the reserve currency.
I believe a basket of large, distributed circulation coins  will become the reserve currency system of the world later in this century.
We are in the early stages of figuring out how to get them to scale and work within existing systems. Great wealth will be created during the early adoption phase. Some will lose money.
But one thing is certain, the days of humans actively controlling the circulation of money are numbered. Money will be programmable.

Bitcoin Cash is a pump and dump coin at this point. I’m supportive of a group trying something new, but when the community has zero clue who is working on the project, then that should be a red flag that BCH is not really a serious project.

The date they picked coincided with the difficulty change of bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash always has a pump when that happens so they can steal miners from the original chain. 
Brian Armstrong purposely released Bitcoin Cash early and worked with Jihan and Ver to pump Bitcoin Cash. 
Armstrong is an outspoken opponent of the core developers. That’s fine, but his position gives him special power over the market. A self-regulated market. 
CB originally said they would tell everyone if they were going to release the coin for trading. It was announced that they would support withdrawals but not trading.
They didn’t tell the community and instead did a hasty release early in order to pump the coin and coincide with the difficulty change of BTC (when it’s vulnerable). It looks like a game to manipulate the market vs provide a free one where people can buy and sell without influence from an exchanges behavior.
It’s shady, but not illegal. But telegraphs the fact that it’s not a “fair market” when the ceo behaves in this manner.
Just understand that coinbase will behave in what’s best for them and NOT the end customer. My advice is to buy coins and pull them off into your own wallet.

Agreed on your statements. I think lending and borrowing is critical to a functioning economy, but I think what this whole experiment is about is the absolute insanity that the current system has been.
It was a monopoly of money so infinite debt is accepted as standard practice.
We could do that before because most people weren’t aware of what they were doing. Now with the internet, everyone is aware of the absolute disregard for average people around the world.
So we now have systems that can protect people from inflation AND not be dependent on a terrible year corrupt banking system (see Ukraine for an example of such ).
There are also issues of civil rights and freedom of speech that these systems create. We aren’t free if our banks tell us what we can and can’t do.
So Bitcoin is broken today, but it’s now so entrenched I don’t see it getting flipped anytime soon. We are stuck with it until we can upgrade to a better system (or coin).
I am personally using litecoin for my transactions. It’s a public chain and it’s trusted so I feel comfortable using it.

The concept of tokens where each company can create their own useable token which trades against other coins is a very interesting concept.
Bitcoin will be the engine and tokens will be the “stable” currency that companies can use to provide predictable revenue.
The problem today is there aren’t that many companies using ethereum, Neo, or cardano properly.
Without companies that accept this stuff, it’ll just be a boom and bust cycle. Eventually, it could be the way our economies are built.

We didn’t know how to solve the Byzantine generals problem until an anonymous person or person solved it.
It was a computer science people that stumped us for decades. How could you create a decentralized system that ruled by consensus.
It has to do with distributed networks and how do we know what the “truth” is without a central authority.
Until that point, every attempt at an online currency failed because the central authority could be attacked.
The only stuff that works is ones that are decentralized. Bitcoin attempts to be the first decentralized currency (however imperfect it is today).

I got in years ago as well. Bitcoin changed because adoption grew. 
A constrained money supply is going to make it behave like an 1800s currency which is exactly what this is. We have seen this before hundreds of years ago.
Those that are studies of history know this and have been planning for how it’ll evolve.
If you constrain a supply of something, people will hoard it. It’s that simple. It’ll go up really fast in value and then have a massive sell off as people panic.
It’s a boom and bust cycle. NOT a good use for a currency. It is however an incredible digital commodity/asset that combines the strengths of everything humans value.
So it’s the greatest investment of all time. It’s not something I part with lightly.
So you can say whatever you want about what “bitcoin was”. In its current form, it’s not really useable as a currency. 
It’s now behaving like gold was for us centuries ago.
Once we have L2 and more advanced borrowing systems (salt lending), we will be able to use it like an asset (which it is).

I’m really sorry about your mother. Capitalism is a brutal bitch. It’s never fun to hear stories about older, proud generations suffer after sacrificing so much.
The sad truth is most of the world struggles. In the past, the US could skate by a little because everyone sort of relied on the dollar as a reserve. It meant we could borrow and other countries would pay the tab. We could fund easy living through cheap credit. That’s going to get harder.
Blockahins make it easy to build closed loop systems that don’t rely on central banking or advantageous fiat currency imbalances.
Peer to peer money makes it easy for the rich to stay rich without having to get their hands dirty.

What people have done is found a safe way to store and use value no matter where you live. Whether you live in a poor country or rich. You’ve got 1st class banking and with access to lending.
You can invest in both systems. If you live in the US, invest in your local economy. It makes sense to do so for you.

It takes a lot more than good developers to build a great business. The strategy here is that they want to grow the bitcoin payment economy to increase the marketcap of bitcoin itself. The strategy is important.
I bet they also want smart people to create new smaller payment services so that they don't have to take the smaller, potentially riskier merchants. They want to focus on the big guys and want the business relationships that come with the big retailers.
Tldr: Bitpay wants to focus on the big fish. Open sourcing lets other people go after the smaller merchants. Bitcoin growth is a win for everyone.

It was meant to be a new reserve currency which IS an asset to other pegged currencies.
It’s why people hoard USD in other countries. It’s deflationary compared to their local currency.
That’s what this is. An attempt at supplanting the USD as the words reserve currency.
It’s like no one paid attention in Econ class. Sigh.

Read his tweets. Listen to his speeches. That's not someone who inspires me to be my best. He is the product of too much money without someone telling him he is being a turd. Seriously. He missed out on that important socialization.
He may not have a learning disability, but his targeted audience is obviously not what I would consider above average intelligence. He is a classic populist.
It's disheartening to see a US president pander to the masses like a game show host.
I'm not knocking the conservatives in this country that support the Republican Party. I am however frustrated with those that try to justify an unqualified person for an important job. I expect more from this country.
Zero chance a man like that is allowed to run a major public company. The board would never allow it.
Why the hell do we allow someone like that to run our country? Poor impulse control. Emotional to a fault. Lack of prudence. He is also showing signs of a clinical case of narcissism.
Again, not knocking my conservative friends or their views. I understand and respect well thought out conservative policy arguments.
I just refuse to accept that Donald Trump is fit to be president. Maybe he will calm down and start acting more responsible and collected, but I don't have a lot of faith at this point.

This is actually a well thought out answer.
I like the idea of a derivative based market though. Yes, there is more risk, but so is holding your own coins (stolen keys, losing keys, etc).

That is an interesting point that what he says is designed to further his own interests (at any cost). He is doing things to distract and evade from what he doesn't want people to think about.
I'm almost convinced, but he has made major blunders that would have buried most candidates. I guess the normal rules of engagement don't apply.
Here are a few examples that I can think of:
His off the cuff statements about women come to mind. When he was taped talking to Billy Bush on a bus while miked up just before going on national TV, it showed someone that is careless with words. He was sorry he was caught, but he was miked up and talking to a TV personality. Why would he say that?
His statements about the military family that lost a son during the run up to the debates. When challenged by the father, he immediately went on the offensive and looked like an asshole. Instead of acknowledging the parents sacrifice he made a stupid comment about the mother being not allowed to speak? The whole episode looked like someone who isn't used to being challenged.
He lies about stupid things including the size of his inauguration address size which forces his people to be complicit and back him up making them look foolish too. Why bullshit about something that can be measured?
He runs his mouth because he lacks training and discipline. It is just unprofessional.
It shows that he doesn't handle criticism well and lowers himself to petty insults instead of rising above it and acting like a leader. He continually lies when he doesn't have to. Lies that are easily refuted and just undermine his character.

Momentum trading is a good strategy, but just make sure you understand that you could get caught bag holding when profit taking and FUD occurs. It's a cycle of pumping and then dumping over and over again.
The fact that there is a huge influx of people who have no clue what's going on means there will be much bag holding. Lots of newbie tears. Strong hands will take the weak.
This is NOT like stocks. You are largely in charge of your own coin. There is no FDIC insurance. Your safest bet is to hold your own coin. Invest in a hardware wallet.
Trusting an exchange with lots of coin will eventually burn you. For those that have been in this for years, we tell you these things in hopes you will listen.

While I'm a fan of ETH, without a clear inflation rate published, it's not really a currency but a crypto asset. So Yes, try to ride the ETH pumps, but it's definitely not a HODL coin until they clarify the future direction of the project.
Better SHORT TERM returns will come from assets like Omisego that aren't widely known yet. Ethereum is WELL known and being sold as Bitcoin 2.0 (which lets be honest, it's not... its more of a commidity like oil than a store of value like gold).
Today, unless you have a better strategy, HODL Bitcoin. There are no better alternatives (today).

Believe me when I say I understand the power of a distributed ledger.
But as long as the US dollar is the world reserve currency, they do have the ability to control the value of bitcoin which trades against said currency.
 Not saying things won't change in the future. But today, the US fiat dollar is the supreme currency.

We did not have Segwit yet and scaling was a huge problem. We had infighting over the past several years that held back progress.
A WHOLE lot of competition from solid efforts like dash and alternative approaches with digital assets like Ethereum have challenges the reserve currency status of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a much bigger market now and becoming more mainstream. Still needs to figure out how to handle IOU transactions so that accepting bitcoin is a matter of accepting your local currency.
Ultimately, bitcoin and systems like it will replace the bond markets. Why own debt when you can hold a digital asset.

Great entrepreneurs are actually risk adverse / aware. That's because YOU HAVE TO BE to survive. Any idiot can pretend to be an entrepreneur and burn a fools money. That's called being in America.
Plenty of one off heroes who hit it big on luck and then fade into mediocrity as they continually blow their money on terrible ideas. It's the ones that leverage other people's money intelligently and go from low utilization to high that make it (and continually do it... serial entrepreneurship).
Trump took risks with others money and hedged his downside. He is a good business man. 
That may or may not make a great president. Those guys like to win at all costs (including destroying shareholder value). You can be reckless when you are dealing with sophisticated investors. Or a fools money.

I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin and will always be, but Bitcoin has a LOT of catching up to do. The years of political infighting have greatly weakened it's innovation.
I wouldn't go and assume that "the smartest people" in the room are just going to keep innovating on bitcoin.
Instead, they are going to jump on trains like NEO or ETH and hopefully get better returns.
Again, I'm not stupid enough to sell my BTC, but to assume all innovation will go to Bitcoin is seriously underestimating how smart the competition is now.

.And the brightest minds in FinTech. Investors in Asia, North America, and Europe.
The internet of value is what this is really about. bitcoin was the first to come out and has the honor of being the reserve currency of the new digital economy. There are many new currencies and assets that have been created using blockchains and even non-blockchain, distributed tech.
We are building new companies that are leveraging next generation distributed private money networks to handle the 90% of the world population that doesn't have FED support. And allow the rich countries to do business in places previously not possible.
While the market is small today (140+ billion), the sector is growing fast.
Competitive, private money will be a giant industry that'll rival major industries in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:13:41
And there it is. 
Credit will ALWAYS be faster and better at paying for things because the money doesn't have to be transferred. It's "already there".
For small transactions, we don't need to send money. We just need to verify that the user is good for it.
In developed countries with sound financial systems,  this is the best strategy that we've come up with. The only better option is the make the coffee free (which is basically what credit does for us btw).
For large transactions, we use the blockchain so we don't need a central bank. No Libor rate shenanigans. No FED that hides the the actual circulation of USD. It's all public knowledge.
So we need a bridge to existing financial credit systems, or we need to create our own new ones. It's as simple as that.
Multi-tiered systems are the only sound path forward in complex, developed economies.

The idea of a a decentralized, store of value WILL be the the center. Whether it's Bitcoin or not, that has a lot to do with the community behind it. It's a bunch of annoying children that got ahold of the keys to the castle. They know what it is, but don't have the maturity to handle it.
The richest and smartest people in the world saw this years ago. They were all over it first because they understood that bitcoin solved the "Byzantine Generals Problem".
This special problem, if solved, would open Pandora's box to building a decentralized system by which there IS NO authority but consensus.
Similar to how humans are tricked into submitting with democracy, the bitcoin protocol is just good enough to convince independent actors to behave and act to solve one problem goal... without a leader. 
An artificial, invisible hand if you will.
It is truly an incredible achievement and will spell the end of Wall Street as we know it. We don't need a third party. We just need an algorithm.
I sound crazy, but believe me that the smartest people in the room understand what we have unleashed. They got rich off it YEARS ago. 
Real money? When your industry REPLACES the FED, you don't care about the USD. You are a superior currency. People want your money. Your industry actually creates the money. 
I don't mean to sound outrageous, but believe me when I say that what was unleashed in 2009 will rework the political power of the world. Follow this space closely because the disruption it will cause over the coming decades will make the internet disruption feel like a soft breeze in comparison.
Why do you think Russia is focused on launching their own cryptocurrency? You don't need to trust Russia. You just have to trust their Math.
Think about that last part. I don't have to trust Putin, just read the code that defines how their currency works. And suddenly, they don't need the FED anymore. 
It's a game changer.

1. No one owns the name Bitcoin. That's the problem with "decentralization". Brand management is kinda shit. Now you see why we originally centralized money under governments with big guns.
2. Let the market decide what it wants. Vote with money.
3. If you truly believe in Segwit, you'll understand why off chain payments will ultimately win (integration with credit). You don't need to scare everyone with weak arguments about why big blocks are bad for bitcoin. Why send money at all??
4. Bitcoin isn't the ONLY game in town. Not by a long shot. Maybe proof of work and hashing isn't the "best way forward".

Spoken like someone who is not a successful entrepreneur ;).
Entrepreneurs (the successful ones) want to win. 
They take risks that aren't really risks. That's the difference. 
If you notice young ones live cheap as hell even though they could get a cush job and save and invest. 
The truth is that the "safe path" is the riskier path in the US.  It's someone else's game.
You should expect high returns because it's ALL RISKY. Life is risky.
What the smart ones do is go from low utilization to high utilization. And that is not risky.
Going from high utilization to higher utilization (consulting, doctors, lawyers, etc) is risky as hell in this environment.
Talk to successful entrepreneurs and you'll know that they always play with a stacked deck. You leverage something (a fools money usually).
If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, live dirt cheap so you can soft fail without risking your ass. That's called being risk aware.

My assumption is that you studied business in college... maybe an MBA?
I'll take the bigger upside as long as I know my downside is capped. What percentage of my net wealth is at stake? 
If the gamble is larger than 5% of wealth, then the risk reward isn't worth it. I would convince others to invest with me to reduce my downside yet still have "first right of refusal" for new money. Basically ensure everyone else gets fucked first.
That's how it's done.

Holding USD is insanely risky right now especially. Why the hell would you HOLD cash?
Have a USD position to handle taxes, etc, but you'd better be buying assets at reasonable prices on a regular basis.
What do you think LOW INTEREST RATES are going to do to your buying power?
It's not that having a cash position is a bad idea. It's that you are worried about a "crash". Bitcoin is ALWAYS being manipulated by strong hands that want you to sell. If you are watching the price on a regular basis, then you should NOT be in crypto. 
Those that can handle volatility are the ones that rule the world.

PayPal is based on the USD. Money is FDIC Insured. They use an internal ledger to move money around. Requires a central bank to create money to run.
Not decentralized. Not helpful to much of the word that doesn't live under FED protection. Great for rich people in developed countries (10% of the world).
What about the 90%??
PayPal TRIED to be its own currency already in the 90s internet heyday times. Elon and Peter Theil tried hard but ultimately failed.
This crypto industry started in the 90s with other tries like e-gold as well. Google e-gold and learn what happened. CENTRAL authorities get shut down by the US government. Single point of failure means governments can go after companies that try to compete with the USD.
The Feds aren't stupid. 
Alternative e-currencies have been around since the 1990s. PayPal STARTED as their own currency and failed. That early work led to a decade of additional work which led to the Bitcoin White paper (2008) after 10 years of research. Double spend protection WITHOUT a central authority. Byzantine Generals Problem.   Etc. Etc.
If you are seriously interested in FinTech and computer science, my advice is to read up on the history of alternative currencies and see WHY we are where we are. It is a LONG storied history of private money and it's fight against the man!

Missing the point:
To replace the central banks NOT the credit card industry. Instead of central banks controlling money, the people do it by saving and holding bitcoin.
Crypto will make central banks obsolete long term. It just requires us to reprogram the way in which credit card processing works. Difficult, but a solvable problem.
Getting rid of credit card companies will require us to reprogram people. That's a whole lot harder to do.  Humans are natural spenders. We exploit that fact to create a modern consumer based economy.

It's a really fucked up world that we live in now thanks to incredibly poor planning by central banks. Millions of middle class folks are getting crushed because the speed at which you have to make money JUST to keep up has gotten out of control.
Your costs go up, but your ability to make more money flatlines based on hourly work (salary or otherwise).

Bitcoin was created in response to the economic collapse in 2008 due to poor money management policies of the central banks and lose lending rules.
If it doesn’t help rich people, how can it help poor people? Only people can help others in need. You need a system to create capital to do that.
You need people to be able to store wealth and leverage it to create new businesses or have time to take care of others without requiring a high salary.

There is one king. The rest chase the king and are pegged against it.
The other use the king as the store of value. It’s what people trade against to give the coins value.
That means that in order to become king, you have to destroy the king because people need to NOT use the previous king as their store of value.
Bittrex.com is a good altcoin Exchange.
Stick to bigger coins first. The shitcoins are the small cap coins that may take off or “pump”, but usually drop right back down again.
Basically we use Bitcoin to pump and dump other coins. The bigger coins like dash, monero, and zcash actually are useful and challenge bitcoin’s (the king) supremacy.

I can tell by your statement that you don’t believe in either bitcoin or apple stock.
You should do yourself a favor and sell both because you’ll most likely sell when they crash (when you should be buying). If you don’t believe in your investments, you’ll have weak hands when it gets tough.
If you actually were committed to building wealth, you’d have been invested in both those for years now and have made a great return.
Asset prices always go up over time. You just need to get it at a good price and be patient.

Yes. Governments can control prices of basic goods. They do this via currency controls. Food, power, real estate are all managed.
You need controls to make those prices stable. Crypto is meant to detach from that economy into one that’s free to explore the boundaries of capitalism.
It’s definitely not some thing you want to rely on, but great if you are already stable and looking to push the wealth envelope.
As long as nation states exist, fiat will exist as well. Both will exist because people need both.

You do realize that cash replaced gold?
Cash became gold for the world. It was a better store of value.l and a way to transmit more easily.
Originally, usd was backed by gold. Then over time they stopped backing the currency by gold. Nixon shock in the 1970s.
we lost responsible money. From that point on, people have gotten poorer and poorer as the world banks have printed more and more money.
BitCOIN isn’t supposed to be “cash” in fiat sense. Its cash in the old 1800s sense when they first invented it. It was an IOU for gold with a very clear conversion.
Bitcoin is a move back to fiscal responsibility and allow people to build wealth (without trusting a third party).
Bitcoin will always be  a commodity and store of value first and a transmission network second.

Gold isn’t as easily replaceable as such there aren’t that many elements (that we know of) and none process it’s qualities.

 the fact that people use gold as a way to hedge against inflation is definitely on them decline.

Okay. CASH means cash in the 1800s version of cash.
One that was backed by a commodity!! 
Bitcoin is a cash system that is backed by the properties of a commodity. It allows for a controlled inflation rate instead of a holy-shit- what-are-we-doing-to-money central bankers inflation rate.
This is a deflationary currency like the old ones from 1800s except it’s been perfected for the 22st century.
You’ll leverage bitcoin to create OTHER currencies and tokens. Like we used to do. You can borrow with it because it’s actually an asset as apposed to what fiat is today (fiat money below a million is basically a rounding error for big money now).

Ethereum is pegged to BTC. Thus all those tokens are derivatives of that relationship.
Ethereum is a great coin, but it is an alt currently.
It’s currently centralized and largely controlled by a Swiss foundation.
It’s a fine coin, but if there is no official inflation rate posted, it’s no different than fiat. Why would anyone move off the USD and move to ETH? 
ETH wasn’t setup as a store value. It’s designed to enable “assets” on its platform.
I, and most investors, prefer to hold assets that have legal frameworks that protect investors. Currently, the ICO boom as led to a LOT of pissed off people.
So no, ethereum is not king. It’s a pegged currency to BTC. 
I hold bitcoin as a store of value to protect against inflation of my local currency. I also buy other new undervalued currencies (like ETH if it’s on sale).
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:58:00
Read the case for off chain scaling, and you’ll see what’s going on. This is a battle that’s very old.
There are a LOT of reasons for pushing for “pegged sidechains, Lightning networks, etc). We can’t be completely reliant on one mining network and hash rate for the money transmission system. Bandwidth and network fees are yet another reason.
Think about why letting Jihan having a patented advantage and controlling all bitcoin mining is a terrible idea for the millions of people who rely on the network. That’s a BIG deal for me.
The idea is to be distributed in every way. Including how bitcoin moves around.
Allowing for bigger and bigger blocks means that every transaction will require to be posted as one transaction in a VERY, very Expensive piece of real estate.
Look at the real costs of each block in bitcoin to get an idea. It’s far cheaper to centralize. But that’s not what we are after.
So the trade off is instead of using bitcoin to buy coffee you can use an IOU and then settle LATER. Like a solution any sane engineer would come up with! I fact we did this DECADES ago with credit systems.
Alternatively, by pushing the creation of “pegged-side chains”, we allow for innovation on the edges. You can create an infinite number of coins and now tokens which can leverage the value of bitcoin.
It’s how the USD created the world. Bitcoin has replaced the USD in the world as the “reserve currency”. It means it’s a store of value for the rest of the currency market.
So the plan has been (from the early days) to make this the new financial system of the 21st century that the rest of the world builds off of.

Not saying it’ll happen soon, but a a LOT can happen in this space in a short amount of time. Ethereum was a tiny blip 24 months ago. It actually made a serious go at taking the king position against BTC. It failed for a variety of reasons, but it’s not to say that people could come up with a smarter system, that’s more secure than bitcoin.
- Nvidia and AMD are working on mining hardware.

Gold as a commodity is not replaceable in the real world. You know what I meant. We use gold for industrial purposes. It’s used in electronics. It’s used in jewelry. That’s ultimately what it’s value comes from. 
Gold has not been backed a currency in many decades. Not talking about it as a currency. 
Currencies come and go. Real commodities tend to stick around. 
In the digital world, you can come up with a better commodity-based blockchain that could eventually eclipse bitcoin. Many believe we will. 
If that were to happen, bitcoin would become an altcoin and thus eventually die a (very slow) death as people move to the new winner.
So yes. Bitcoin as a currency and store of value can be replaced. Gold (which is not a currency or a backing any serious one at this point) cannot be replaced as a commodity (where it gets its real value).
Bitcoin has a special because it’s the reserve currency for the new digital economy.  If it were not, there would be several other coins that would dominate it.

Backup your wallet there tiger.
Take this shit deadly serious. Listen to everyone warning you to follow directions closely. Backup your wallet.
Do not store the backup digitally.
An encrypted drive is a good idea.
Hardware wallets are best. Paper wallets very secure and cheapest option (but not practical for everyday use).
Protect your private keys.

You can use coinbase, but it’s not your coin. They hold all the fork money too. Coinbase is safe, but a custodial wallet isn’t what makes crypto powerful.
My advice is to invest in a hardware wallet. Ledger nano s is my current favorite. There are others.
They let you control your private keys. When forks happen, like bitcoin cash or bitcoin gold, you get access to that money quickly. Coinbase may choose to never support bitcoin gold. And currently bitcoin gold is a top 10 coin (for now).
When you really understand how cryptocurrencies work and can secure your own private keys, you are actually participating in the network. It’s democratized finance. 
It’s not supposed to be, let’s make coinbase the biggest bank in the world. It’s let’s make everyone their own bank.

Apple produces products,.. etc etc. why do you care? You don’t see any of that. You don’t own it. You have no say in its direction. You don’t see that income. You get a shit dividend (if you are lucky) that comes from borrowed money that will never be repaid.
Holding common apple stock goes up in value because they print the SHIT out of the dollar via fractional reserve banking. Not because it’s worth more. Your dollar is worth less. 
They can’t create more stock without notifying stock holders and the outstanding shares are published (controlled circulation). The FED hasn’t published the USD in circulation since 2006. My guess is they aren’t completely sure and probably they don’t want us to know anyway. Apple stock goes up because of supply and demand. 
Bitcoin has a massive network and a brand that many people around the work have heard of. It’s creator invented blockchains as a way of solving the Byzantine generals problem.
It’s 50+ years in the making (we’ve been trying to solve that computer science problem for decades).
Bitcoin has a controlled circulation that’s published and is decentralized. It solves a LOT of money problems for much of the world.
It allows people to stop holding dollars. 
Today, it’s the reserve currency of all of the other coins and is the largest market cap. 
All other coins get their value via BTC ( even ETH) because they are paired against them in markets.
What gives bitcoin value is the same thing that gives the dollar value. People need it to have a value for the system to work. (That and it costs money to manage the system which we pay to miners who sell it back to us for a profit).
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:18
I like ledger wallet nano s. It’s a hardware wallet that lets you hold different types of better known coins. 
Jaxx wallet is also popular and Freewallet. Those are mobile apps and being connected to the internet is a risk. But they are free as apposed to $100 for the nano.
A lot of people just trade alt coins on exchanges like bittrex. Eventually they sell back to BTC and move off to an offline wallet. Or they hold ethereum or another big coin.
Its deflationary so you’ve got to be careful as the bigger coins drain from the “smaller coins” because of something called Metcalf’s law. The value is tied to the number of users.

Bitcoin is replaceable. Gold is not.
If you actually don’t see that there are other alternatives that with the right endorsement from a state actor could best bitcoin in marketcap.
If for example, they created a digital dollar currency that’s controlled via the fed. That may attract a lot more people who are dependent on the success of the dollar.
I’m playing devils advocate. You are a fool if you believe no one can possibly beat bitcoin. ethereum can very close to surpassing bitcoins marketcap. And it’s a complete shitshow of engineering (though ideas are interesting).
My argument is that if a currency gains more marketshare over a LONG period of time, people will begin to assume it as the “reserve currency”.
That’s just how it works.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:55:18
Because we don’t send bitcoin anywhere. We hoard it. Occasionally we move it.
It’s digital gold.
What makes Bitcoin Cash any different than dash, monero, zcash, etc? It’s does everything worse than the next tier of coins.
It’s just a system for moving value around. There are tons of those. Bitcoin Cash is  dinosaur compared to the latest coins.
Bitcoin is now just the reserve currency. It’s a store of value. Occasionally we move it, but I would never use it to buy consumer goods.
Think about it. You can have your cash. I want my gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:12:06
Ledgerwallet.com sells hardware and software to make it easier for you.
Coinbase is a great business for coinbase investors. Notice that they get to hold everyone’s coin (and fork coins) without paying any interest.
They don’t have to pay you bitcoin gold or Bitcoin Cash when those coins fork off bitcoin. That’s not their job, though they do it so they don’t piss off too many customers.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:58:34
They all lose to bitcoin or eventually they become bitcoin.
They are all pegged to bitcoin as it’s seen as the reserve currency.
LTC and ETH are great coins, but you need to trade them against bitcoin. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency which means besides being a currency it’s also a store of value (asset).
It was the first coin so it has that honor (like USD after WWII)

“A real commodity” you don’t own. You don’t even control. You buy an ETN or some other bullshit derivative. 
Unless you hold the copper, gold in real life, then you don’t really own anything. A business makes money off of you believing you hold something.
Also, the USD also intrinsically has no value. It’s what we all assign Ir (based on government manipulated prices like power and minimum wage). We do things to make it valuable obviously.  But the price of everyday goods is completely managed. It’s someone else’s game that you are playing.
With Bitcoin, People have to buy and HODL it for it to be worth more money. PEOPLE who hold it create its value. That’s all it takes. 
Sometimes it’s a massive bull run phase. Sometimes it’s a bear. It doesn’t matter. You buy and hodl. Until it’s value returns. Rinse and repeat. If enough people believe, we all build wealth together.
The people who hodl bitcoin do so for a reason. You can decide if that’s stupid or not. 
My advice is to buy into an asset you believe in because god knows your fiat currency can’t hold its value very well.

Fair enough. I reread your post.
Smaller amounts would make sense and would be needed for the sake of buying and selling the currency.
I see your point. We have "bits" as a term that has been used as a smaller amount.
Anything you add will make t more confusing.

We could just have some sort of system that moved the decimal. But we would need a clever, easy to use system that could adjust over time.

It’s a hard fork, everyone will own equal amounts of both coin. People won’t be so quick to sell this time around after learning what happened with bitcoin cash.
If Coinbase supports both coins, which Charlie Lee seems to think will happen, then its on. You’ve got distribution and brand awareness (or confusion depending how you look at it).
Like I said, I’m not selling either coin. Just going to use the wait and see strategy.
I’m not sure why you think that “everyone” wants small blocks. People want a clear winner and consensus. That’s not happening with Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:24:48
Because that’s how markets work. Asset classes (even ones that are magical like Bitcoin) have a limited set of buyers. Yes, there is limited circulation, but you need new buyers. 
Once we burn through this latest group of new people and/or the US enters a recession and contraction, people will stop speculating. Prices will stagnate or trade sideways. Once momentum drops for long enough, people will want to go back to their reserve currency (fiat). Some will hold more coin than others.
Bitcoin prices will fall. As will the rest of the crypto market. It will fall to a new level after x number of months. Many will be holding more coin than before. Some will panic sell. Once we hit the bottom, it’ll start growing slowly again and the cycle will repeat itself.
We’ve had many boom and bust cycles in Bitcoin. It’s not always this much fun. The whole crypto market is tied to bitcoin and the USD.
No matter what coin you hold, everyone lives and dies by the btcusd exchange rate.
Not sure when it’ll end so I hodl. I consume when I want to.
Eventually this trend will start to reverse and the price will crash hard. Just as every other time bitcoin has a run up (this is the 5th phase since 2009).
Always repeats itself. No one knows really when the bull run ends.

Because it's not important. That's not important.
The price of something will always be a subjective, arbitrary thing that can decouple from a currency.
With the advent of credit card adoption, people stopped using dollars. Much of the consumer economy is paid with debt that will NEVER be repaid.
And the price of your food is not a real reflection of demand and supply. It's a carefully controlled experience that governments make sure works to keep people from rioting.
So we will always have fiat based prices. We will use some sort of credit and debt system.
BUT the settlement layer, that will SURELY change. 
So who cares if bitcoin looks weird to a human. Its not designed to be stable. It's designed to be a commodity and go up in value over a longer period of time against fiat.
It's designed to free humanity from tyranny of a constantly devaluing currency.

Ledgerwallet already supports it. Broad support by lots of bitcoin users. Miners are signaling for it (take that for whatever it's worth).
It could become the most adopted chain if fees are lower and innovation continues. 
Ultimately, even if this doesn't work, there will be more tries to move bitcoin forward and away from Blockstream control.
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:12:55
I'm not so sure that's the case. I was also anti fork and upset at the Bitcoin Cash team for breaking off and not starting over with a new chain,  but the result of the action showed us what to expect.
I was also against hard forking 2x, but given what we know now, bitcoin can survive hard forks.
The people behind it don't need permission from Core to make this happen. 
Alts can do quite well on their own. One day, it may be Dash that is the reserve currency while Bitcoin trades like Gold vs a reserve currency.
That's what the reality of this all is. Nothing is for sure. It's a lot of risk right now unfortunately.

After the fork, your private keys will work on both chains (that is if you hold your private keys).

Careful. Markets get irrational.
There is a limited pool of people willing to buy as well as a limited supply of bitcoin.
The reason why many people don’t like deflationary currencies is because of the dramatic boom and bust cycles. Booms are fun, but when your currency is treated as an instrument of speculation (which most of new bitcoiners are at this point) you don’t have a sense of what the real market is willing to pay

Blockstream can't be the central authority forever. If SegWit2x turns out to be the best option for consumers on price and speed, you'll see it become "Bitcoin". You'll quickly see legacy chain become an alt coin.
Bitcoin Cash may not have been the right strategy (SegWit is useful), but it showed the cracks in Blockstream-funded Core on keeping everyone in line.

“Peer review” means that a few developers are the architects who decide what is good and what is bad.
Those architects decide what gets accepted and what gets rejected.
It’s tyranny through the guise of “good development”.
This is bitcoins biggest weakness. It’s not really decentralized control. 
Edit: it’s why we have a bunch of new coins obviously.
But who controls Bitcoin the name is really what this is about. The money spent investing in getting the mass public aware of the currency. The advertising dollars.
Marketing. Not just engineering. And this is why you have companies. You have divisions of labor. You have the people that market. And the engineers.
Trying to keep these things as separate is BS. Marketing controls companies.  Not the engineering. And that’s why I get frustrated and ask WHO is paying the developers. It’s the sales and marketing people.

I respectfully disagree. 
Your phone is not secure. You carry it around with you everywhere. It’s not designed to house very secure information. 
Paper wallets are fine, but the average person has no clue how to print a paper wallet securely using a machine that’s never been online.
Account-based wallets like Coinbase are okay, but then you have to deal with Coinbase. It’s not really your money anymore. You have a contract with them where they promise to pay you back when you need your bitcoin.
Hardware wallets like the ledger nano s are the easiest solution for those that want to hold their own keys (since that’s the whole reason we created cryptocurrencies in the first place).
And why bother with crypto at all if you only have a few thousand invested? It’s not exactly a stable, beginner friendly kind of market.

Law of gravity. As long as people sell less than they buy though, the price will continue to go up over the longer term.
Due to the constrained amount in circulation, there will always be big run ups followed by retracements. 
People don’t like to sell an asset that they believe will increase in value. They buy more. Others have FOMO and desperately want to get in.
low supply and high demand will push the price up FAST. Everyone wants to get rich so the cycle continues until people start selling to take profit and then it’s a crowded panic as new buyers sell to protect their money.
Commodities are always boom and bust. There isn’t a counter balancing force to balance out the peaks and values. It’s truly a free market.

Crypto isn’t meant to be held on exchanges. It’s meant to be secured by individuals. It was designed to allow individuals the ability to hold their own cash without a third party.

Who decides the core feature and direction?
Control comes from somewhere. 90+ developers means a clusterfuck mess without controls on expected features and delivery. 
It’s not a democracy. It’s a very controlled release with feature requirements that come from SOMEONE else. 
GitHub tells a different story of a few developers controlling exactly what gets into and what gets rejected from core. It’s not 90+ people making decisions. It’s a few dictating work to many.

It goes up in waves. We may or may not be done with the current bull market. We don’t know.
When you have an influx of new investors, you’ll get a big boom again. However, it may be a few years before the next phase. We need a bear market first to shake out the hype.
But as long as people believe, people will continue to HODL some percentage of their net wealth in bitcoin and crypto. 
Bitcoin is deflationary meaning that the miners will continue to be less and less coin produced (1/2 production is cut every 4 years... the halving). Only 21 million coins will ever be created. Many will be lost or stolen. That’s all part of the idea that scarcity is what creates value. HODL your coins. Keep them safe. 
Eventually, the price will drop and enters a bear market. At which time, people will sell off and protect their profits. At some point, the price action will reverse (hopefully at a number above the previous trough) and we will enter the next bull market phase.
This cycle repeats it self over and over again. Boom and bust. Boom and bust.

You need organizations that specialize in a particular labor force. Call them cyber banks or whatever you want. They act on your behalf so you don’t have to do a service yourself.
Eventually, you have to delegate some of your labor. And people organize in groups so they can work more efficiently. You need some sort of structure to make that labor work effectively.
You’ll already have banks that do services. They may not control your money in the future, but they will work for you and you’ll pay them a fee for it.

Most holders wouldn’t know the difference.
What matters is adoption. If you can’t move or spend the money, it’s not a currency.  It’s just a speculative tool. And those always collapse.
While Bitcoin decides it’s fate, there are 5 or 6 serious competitors continually taking mind and market share.
Eventually, if the community can’t rally behind one true coin, you will see a flippening.

Then they should not be in crypto. Telling people that this is just like owning stock is absolutely absurd.
They are better off in coinbase unless thy take securing their coin very seriously. Your machine is NOT SAFE. A paper wallet generated to a machine that was connected online is also not the best option.
At least use a fresh install of a computer that has never been online. And run the generator. Then wipe the drive. (Or just spend $90 on a ledger) 
A bot that finds your machine will absolutely sweep your wallet within a few seconds. Believe me when I tell you nothing connected to the internet is safe.

Get a ledger wallet nano s on amazon.  They actually already support 2x. You’ll be able to “split” coins and hold them in a completely new address so you don’t have to worry about replay attacks.
They will walk you through the process when the time comes. 
This won’t be the last time bitcoin forks. There will be SEVERAL more groups who break off. 
There will be specific chains for each need. One will be focused on moving money cheaply and payments (bitcoin cash). One will be digital gold. Others will be focused on building platforms for additional economic activity (aka like Ethereum etc).
Once you allow one group to break off, you will have many more follow. See The Reformation for what it looks like.

@_date: 2017-10-08 05:02:59
You’ll have coins in two separate chains. Your private key will unlock access to both. Your wallet will need to be able to “split” your coins or you may accidentally spend BOTH sets of coins st the same time.
Your wallet should help you split and move your coins to prevent issues.
The chains share the same exact history, but like twins, once they separate, the grow apart as different organisms with different experiences
They will have different transaction histories after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:46:40
Nothing. Coinbase will decide what to do for you. 
Unless you get a hardware wallet like ledger or move to an exchange that gives you both coins at the time of the fork (with a split), you can’t do anything.
Coinbase controls the private keys and this controls when and where you get your new coins.

I'm going to say it. If Bitcoin doesn't get its shit together, it's going to get lapped. 
Fist mover advantage doesn't mean shit if you split the empire. It just means the second, third, or fourth place finisher can beat you in the long run.
Stop making this political and figure out how to work together.
When litecoin is moving fast, has Segwit, and has no transaction fees, they aren't the "little brother", they are the existential threat.
My hope is that the bitcoin community can work together to avoid a split of the reserve currency of the digital economy. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:09:08
Funny how this is. The more people who believe bitcoin is worth 10,000, the more it becomes that price.
The challenge is that you need to "convince" everyone what it's worth.
IMHO, bitcoin has yet to show me that it can be a mature system. We have way too much consolidated power in the hands of greedy people. We've got greed running rampant without a thought about the users of the system. The miners have way too much power right now and that has to change or users will move to a superior currency.
I am still hopeful things will change as the community grows and matures, but for now, i see a lot of terrible leadership. Foolish people who think of themselves first instead of the community.
I think a hard fork is necessary to clear out the extremists in the community. The hard core types can have their way and be in the minority. 
In the end, only one currency will rule this space. It's yet to be clear which one that will be.

Hold a portion of the coin. A cash position is wise so selling some when you would like to raise fiat, isn't unreasonable.
Treat it like any other asset class that rises and falls against the dollar. Over time, it's designed to increase in value so think long term in your hodling strategy. Take profit when you want, but make sure you are always holding some coin because it's hard to predict tops and bottoms.

I am a huge long time fan of bitcoin, but I don't understand how it's not an asset with currency properties.
You "give currency away". you hold assets. Fiat currency has more to do with influence and its value comes from making sure everyone has it.
Assets are an "opt in" instrument. There is no magic crypto fairy that sprinkles money into our accounts (similar to how fiat works through jobs programs and corporate welfare).
Again, I don't like trading and asset for bullshit crap. I HODL. That sounds more like I'm treating this as an asset than anything else.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:12:46
You guys are silly.
If I can't trade the USD against bitcoin in a fast, safe, and easy way, the value of bitcoin against the dollar will plummet. No new fiat means the price will drop. Dramatically.
I don't think that'll happen, but the US could do a lot more to destroy crypto. I don't think they will because we have a LOT of support for it by large segments of the US population.
Yes, crypto would keep going, but it would be relegated to a much smaller, niche play. It would not be mainstream. The number of end users would fall dramatically.
A currency MUST be liquid for it to be useful. No serious business would accept it if they could not convert it to a stable currency. 
It's a wonderful new asset class, but don't kid yourself if you think it'll replace fiat.

Or the bull market is over and it's time to come back to reality.
Asset prices don't rise forever, you have pull backs as people try to "lock in profit" against it.
New fiat goes in. Some needs to come out. It's part of the game. Your investment strategy should take this into account. Still should hold at least some of the coin (damn hard to predict the bottom).
The bull market will return, but we just ran from $250 to $3000. It's going to settle somewhere in between that before the next rally.

The theory is based on the "s" curve of technology adoption. There is linear growth, then exponential growth as the masses adopt the tech, then there is a plateau as the number of new users becomes very small in comparison to the existing user base. At that point, the price will stabilize and the true utility of bitcoin as a currency will be realized. 
Because there is a finite number of bitcoins, the supply is limited. The price of bitcoin should continually go up. But hopefully at a slower, more predictable rate.
