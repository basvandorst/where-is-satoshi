I was about to buy a video card but they price bitcoins at about $770 each. SCAMMERS. They are currently $910. USD conversation they were over charging by almost $70 for my purchase. I cancelled.~~
Nevermind, see below. That's annoying.

Yes, 1.

We surpassed Good job everyone!

40% swings every 15 minutes... I wouldn't worry too much
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:15:14
Yes.  It took long but eventually happened, must have been close to two hours for me, had like 6 verifications by the time I got it.

I use mtgox and used bitinstant to deposit my funds via moneygram.  I personally did not have issues but I hear that some did.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:00:39
pump and dump.  The pump just happened.

You are in a game, but like it or not all use of the currency, to include daytraders, speculators, criminals, legit means, and all others only do good for the currency.  More use, more talk, etc.  The more money in it the harder it will be to manipulate by a few people.

I put my M# and did not have a problem.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:30:45
You expect us to help how exactly?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:30:23
I'm sure money can be made by somebody willing to offer insured storage of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:46:06
If you don't think it will be back at that price within 15 minutes you haven't been paying attention
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:36:59
You must have cash.  ATM limits are normally $600/day
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:26:35
I clicked the cancel button about 30 times.  It is lagging.  the order disappeared magically after I clicked around for a bit.

I was once watching something on the history channel where some dead-beat high school "science" teacher was claiming the hadron collider  had a 50% chance to create a black hole.  It either would, or would not.  He was serious.

I would just imagine it as a bunch of homeless drunks banging on pans and hitting sticks

If for whatever reason your post is legit, which I don't have and reason as to believe why.  I would recommend selling in small increments.  Not only will you not crash the market, but your return will be greater.

Seriously, a money order or a check (after a verification process).
Sorry, until a viable online purchase option such as a credit card or paypal is available then I just can't get interested in supporting bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:41:04
This was my experience but I'm not making any claims people will have similar.  There are also complaints but I believe they are clearing things up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:36:52
It's probably posted but I'll ask anyway, what is their normal transaction fee percentage?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:34:50
We do not know.  Ask coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:42:09
They only publish data to their API every 5 minutes right now, pretty annoying.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:22:50
Global War on Bitcoin.
My guess it will just become even more of a black market.  Which means it will actually go up in price.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:17:34
Yeah, that was WITH one...
I transfered back to mtgox without one and it was actually faster (but still took 30-40 minutes).
I was literally doing it to test speeds.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:13:13
And people are wondering why the daytraders are showing up and making a killing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:20:45
When I saw the daily limit I avoided coinbase immediately.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:15
It makes wallstreet look like a fucking superhero.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:46:16
Transfer internationally immediately and free.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:04:55
Why? Not like we'd ever receive anything.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:33:16
I do not speak for any of them.  Are you?  I personally just used it and it worked very well.  How was your experience?  Oh you don't have any?  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:38:17
I ended up doing it, here is my experience:

Please submit all future propositions as a meme

I was getting ready to do this and there isn't a bank of America within 100 miles from me, fantastic.
