Yeah, I was an early adopter, I got out early too back in 2012 when the first "Drop" happened and coins became less than $10 each.
It's now 5 years later, and it's work-eat-sleep just so I can pay minimum payments on student loans that will never be paid off (I'll by 70 by the time I make my final payment, If I live that long).
I can't save for retirement, I can't go on vacations, I can't even buy a home, start a family, or do anything with my life.  I got into bitcoin in the early days for the novelty of an "Internet currency" you could earn by letting your computer run some application.  I donated dozens of coins to fountains, traded coins with people, and even gifted some to people in the early days as a novelty as nobody knew where it would be today.
I'll put it this way... if I still had even 5 or 6 of the coins out of the hundreds I had today, my loan situation would be non-existent and I might actually be enjoying life instead of counting down how many more years I have to serve what feels like a life sentence.

It does fix crippling student debt that prevents me from getting married, having kids, or even owning a home but hey, at least I work 60 hours a week right? ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯
not trying to be an ass, just a lot of people who I know who have gone from just struggling day to day to suddenly rich and here I am, someone who got "out" of bitcoin so that I could make ends meet (sold my bitcoin to make min. payments on student loans), completely still broke, penniless.
I guess you could say, yeah, the grass is always greener on the other side, but you and I?  we're on opposite sides of the same coin.  Money is evil to me, because it represents all of the missed opportunities I will *never* have in my life whereas, money to you shows you the true nature of the people around you and how even your closest friends you've known for decades suddenly see you... differently.
Anyway, coming from the other side of the fence, congrats on the gains.  I only wish I had the chance to stay in the game back in 2011 when I had just over 80 coins before selling out at around $2.00 each.

We sadly lost touch.  I believe he mentioned he cashed some of it out at $2k each.

This is of course, the hardest part.
2 years ago, I got back into mining... Started mining Gridcoin which was awesome since I could still use my GPUs at the time (and lots of CPUs).  I had just over $400 USD of gridcoin when they updated the wallet app.  of course, something happened where now over half my gridcoin went missing.  yes, missing.  I haven't touched it since.
Tried mining monero the past few weeks...  I think I made a total of $2 but spent about $20 in power?  yeah :\
If I could invest $100 in bitcoins right now...  I feel i'd be *lucky* to see $110, which would require bitcoin to go up a thousand dollars.  to even double my money, bitcoin would have to go from $10k to $20k.  quite a feat.
Alt-coins are much riskier and i'm out of the loop.  as I mentioned, my life as of late is working 12-14 hour days, sleeping for 5-6, and that's about it.

I guess.
It's been a while since i've touched it:

i'm only kicking myself because I had mined about 300-400 coins back in the day, and sold them all so that I could focus on paying my monthly student loan payments while I looked for a "real job" as I was living at home.
Now i'm 30, broke, paying over $1000/mo in student loans which i'll have until i'm 70 (if I live that long).
I gave a friend of mine at the time 10 coins right before I gave up mining (After the ASICS came and the big crash occured).
I see people becoming millionaires, or even ending up with enough to buy a Tesla or Lambo...
I don't / didn't want any of that.  I wanted to grow the currency and in the process, maybe, pay off the 90k in student loans that are dragging me down.
Nope, Now my whole existence on this earth is to ensure I stay healthy, so I can go to work, so I can make loan payments, so that I can live another day.
I had 9 coins stolen from me from when they were $20 each, I donated dozens when they were less than $1 each to fountains, etc.  and gave 10 to my friend.  I cashed out to pay minimum payments while I was unemployed for a grand sum of around $300.
So yeah, Seeing bitcoin hit $10k... and then $11k... Makes me die a little more inside.  My loans could have been paid off, and I could be working, to actually live my life, and enjoy life... not just working, so I could eat and go to bed, so I could wake up for work again.
Life sucks.  I'm tired of the rat race and the one way I had out, I *had* to give up so that I could make min monthly payments.  at this point, it's just salt in an open wound :(
