It's up to the contractor to report their own income so the 1099 is really to keep you square if you contract someone to do something more than $600. As a contractor I can take jobs up to $599 per client per year and they never have to file 1099. I still have to file all my income as a contractor. Really this stuff isn't that hard you just have to track it.

She was comparing a disruptive/revolutionary piece of software with a disruptive/revolutionary piece of software and gave examples as to why she was comparing the two. I thought she did an excellent job with that comparison and she asked the right questions without appearing negative. Hell she could even rattle off quite a few alt's so she at least appears to know what she's talking about.
Maybe if you want to see $600+ coins again you should embrace these "laypeople" you speak of and stop being the asshole nutter Libertarian that the interviewer was talking about. I personally want to see everyone who is interested in BTC invest at least $200 of their tax returns into BTC. Grandma, bankers, Bill at work, whoever, let's get the hype train running full steam again so we can all make some money!
EDIT: Oh and apparently [u/DeeSpace9er]( likes to send threatening personal messages. Here's what he sent me:


Wow you're so hardcore that you couldn't even keep it on the thread. Shut up, bitch.

*I'm drunk as hell and really want to get laid so maybe I should bang this person but I should totally wait and meet them sober just to make sure.*
Logic is sound.

He's also put money into [Dwolla]( which hasn't exactly done a great job of supporting the Bitcoin community.

Coinbase works just fine and I don't see them getting a lot of head from the fed. Gox was sleezy, plain and simple.
EDIT: head should be heat but I like it so I'm keeping it!

Would basement dweller be a more appropriate term?

That's when I come in and make major cash of those morons inability to code. With the amount of shit PHP devs out there you'd be surprised how well this pays as long as you can deal with the madness of shit code.

What you would need is some kind of pocket pussy reclaimer that would break the used one down into cells which could then be used to print another one. Kinda like a filament reclaimer for a 3D printer.

The article says they found logs that show how much each customer's machine mined before it was shipped. I would assume that if your name/machine is on that list you're owed some money.

So the "average person" that the developer finds to be the first one is super hot. Ya, total coincidence there....

So if Apple can't be trusted to hold a key that will unlock the phone if a warrant is issued how can we trust Apple to protect their software signature keys? Getting access to those keys gives you full blown access to sign and install whatever you want which is just as bad as a back door.

God damn that is some mid-90's ass right there. Looks like you scanned it out of a magazine and everything.
