And that's not what the article's about.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:40:36
I don't think he was wrong about that point, which is why I quoted it.
Edit: Also, I wasn't refuting him, or the OP. I was commenting on your handwaving.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:22:18
What am I wrong about? I'll gladly address any concerns you have.
Bitcoin must change if it is to grow. If it stays the same size, fine, it's Bitcoin. If the block size is allowed to grow and Bitcoin ends up morphing into a client-server model due to SPV, which is IMO very likely, then it is arguably not Bitcoin.

1 million coins? That's only 10% of the entire production run in single hands. What could go wrong?
EDIT: 5%. (Which is about how much of my brain is working, apparently.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:44:04
That wasn't my original point, no.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:38:20
Yes, the developers know it's a problem. I said the "community." How many people on Reddit have even heard of this issue? Do they know how it's going to be solved? Do they know the potential ramifications of the changes involved?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:42:38
From the paper:
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."
Doesn't sound like it to me. SPV is inherently trust-based: first, because I trust the "full nodes" (i.e., a financial institution) with my identity, and second, because it opens up the possibility of a Sybil attack.
Edit: Besides, Bitcoin is billed as peer-to-peer. If that is to change then the marketing must change.

I don't want anonymity because Bitcoin never was anonymous. Note I said PRETENSE of anonymity. It's a very common myth and one that not enough Bitcoin supporters do enough to dispel. But I notice you forgot to address the other point I made: How does Bitcoin stay "decentralized" if it must switch to a client-server model?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:04:51
In other words, if you don't want to be a full node you have to give up anonymity and, perhaps, take on counterparty risk. We come full circle.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:05:03
You really see not one single reason steady exponential growth shouldn't continue? Does that constitute investment advice? Will there be any dips along the way or is it straight to the moon?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:23
The article is talking about bandwidth, not hard drive space. "Transacting on your home computer" does not address the issue of compromised anonymity by the inevitable switch to a "thin client" model.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:21
It's not about storing the block chain, it's about downloading it. Eventually that won't be feasible, and at that point Bitcoin morphs into... something else.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:51:40
The growth rate in the chart in the article looks pretty exponential to me.
Hard drives are not the issue. Bandwidth is.
What optimizations?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:50:47
I think requiring participants to obtain a terabyte of data represents a barrier to entry.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:17:42
They can do that. That's what they do in 0.8.0. But how difficult would it be to figure out someone's identity if you do that often enough? It's a simple matter of statistics. Think like an attacker.
Edit: Yes, the transaction limit can be changed. Will it? That's the point. If it is then Bitcoin changes to a client-server model.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:28:26
And the way it must change is anti-Bitcoin, no? Towards a client-server model, towards centralization...?
Edit: Also, if you agree with me then perhaps you'd be kind enough to upvote me again?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:55:11
That's what everyone says. Please show me how. There's a reason a bunch of early adopters have moved on to Ripple.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:04:04
Connecting to multiple nodes doesn't make it more secure. See the discussion on cancer nodes on the wiki.
tor doesn't help much either. It might help for you, because you are (presumably) not using it to shift a lot of money. But do you know who runs those tor nodes?
In other words: to move money securely through Bitcoin one must run a full node, which, if the transaction volume grows much, will require running a datacenter. This fact explains Ripple and is not widely enough understood.
And can it still be called "decentralized," if it's split into "nodes" and "full nodes", i.e. "clients" and "servers", i.e. "customers" and "financial institutions"?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:07:38
Right. But if you let it grow (and/or blossom, flow) you'll eventually (quickly) get to the point where e.g. a smartphone can't handle the transaction volume, hence SPV in the new version, right? But read up on SPV. Actually, don't. It doesn't matter. There is NO WAY to filter the transactions you receive from other nodes without also revealing some information about who you are/are not. You can either give them your wallet addresses directly or you can beat around the bush with Bloom filters like the recently released implementation, but the fact remains you can't stay anonymous on a bigger Bitcoin without being a full node, which will require expensive hardware and bandwidth.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:32:25
The onus is not on me to fix the problem. The onus is on the Bitcoin community to admit there is one.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:12:32
To me it's a problem because it breaks the ethos behind Bitcoin: that of a trustless, decentralized, peer-to-peer currency. The sidebar here says "decentralized," right up there with "digital"! If you're going to say it's okay to make Bitcoin more centralized--if you're going to propose it SHOULD scale up to handling many transactions/second--then maybe you need to change the name. At the very least you need to change the sidebar. And wouldn't that be as big a switch as going from digital to analog?
Are the people paying $95/Bitcoin right now even aware of this still unresolved issue?
(I mean the generic "you," not you specifically.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:19:50
Or, as Kaminsky said back in 2011, Bitcoin is uniquely hard to audit because its proponents don't say "we can't do that," but rather "something else could do that."
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:14:07
Like I linked to in the blog? Efficiency reasons: SPV as described in the paper is linear. This will not scale to many transactions per second. Security reasons: cancer nodes, as discussed on the Bitcoin wiki. I linked to both those things. You are being disingenuous.
Edit: Also, I didn't call it a bait-and-switch, I merely suggested it might inadvertently qualify as one.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:52
Sure, if you want to run a full Bitcoin node. It won't be cheap, though.
@_date: 2013-04-14 07:31:35
It doesn't matter how you go about filtering the transactions you see; any attempt to filter them gives up a) all pretense of anonymity and b) decentralization.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:42:06
Giving me a description of an implementation doesn't stop it being a client-server model, i.e. not decentralized. If I must own or rent a rack of servers to see the entire block chain (and that's how it'll be, eventually) then Bitcoin is no longer decentralized, IMO, and loses its entire point. If I must trust anyone I'd sooner trust a bank or Western Union than some random "full nodes" on the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:29:20
And if it's lifted eventually you'll need a rack of servers to keep up with the block chain and almost everyone will be a "thin client," at which point it would seem a stretch to call Bitcoin "decentralized."
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:53:20
The problem with Bitcoin is not hackability, the problem is scalability and anonymity. Bitcoin cannot get much larger than it is while keeping most nodes anonymous. In other words, you can only be anonymous if you receive the full stream of transactions. (See  for details.)
The original inventors knew this, I think, which is why they left Simple Payment Verification (see section 8 in the original paper) unfinished. It was just finished after years of work (by others) and included in 0.8.0, and uses Bloom filters to avoid revealing client's addresses directly, but the fact remains that ANY selective processing of the transaction stream reduces your anonymity. Think about it.
So either Bitcoin must stay roughly the size it is now, transaction fees go up significantly, and everyone stays (kind of) anonymous, or Bitcoin gets significantly bigger, transaction fees stay low, "thin" clients lose their "anonymity," and Bitcoin morphs into a client-server banking model.
You can't have both. Will the max block size constant ever be raised or abandoned? If that happens Bitcoin becomes something very different. And if you don't understand this you shouldn't own them, IMO.
Edit: At this point I'm starting to see the "maximum block size" constant, and various other "hard" limits in the protocol, as monetary policy. Set by developers. What could go wrong?
Edit 2: How many downvotes can someone being politely critical of Bitcoin collect? Let's find out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:09:59
My definition of privacy is the same as the one used in the paper. The paper simply doesn't admit such privacy isn't maintainable once the switch to SPV happens.
How many people know this must be "solved at a different layer"?
Edit: And is it actually solvable at a different layer? An awful lot of money is still riding on that being true, and on Bitcoin itself being valuable.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:08:31
Another insightful article buried.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:33:30
I for one am looking forward to the developers getting to explaining how they're going to make a decentralized network much more centralized while still calling it "decentralized."
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:57:48
It's secure at this size. Can it be if it doubles twice more? What about cancer nodes and Sybil attacks on thin clients?
