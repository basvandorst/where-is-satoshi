I just withdrew from Poloniex and it took a lot longer than usual. I expect many exchanges are having to deal with a high number of withdrawals, plus are being very careful given the current circumstances.

Sceptical or not, turning down hundred bucks is pretty dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:29:55
Whilst this isn't by any means the end for Bitcoin, I do expect the price to drop a lot lower.
As a holder since 2013, today I finally sold a good proportion of my coins @ around 15k. Sure, could have timed it a little better, but I paid a couple hundred for each of them so it's a good result and I never imagined we'd be hitting 10k this year, let alone nearly 20k.
Holding is all very noble, but Bitcoin has some serious issues facing it at the moment. I expect they will be solved, but not fast enough to stop the slow bleed of value. I think we'll be looking at half the current value by the new year.
The sad thing is, many of the recent newcomers simply can't afford to move their coins at the moment, and will have to watch as those with lots invested pile past via high fees to cash out.
On the plus side, r/bitcoin was a far more pleasant place during the bear years of 2014 - 2016 - limited memes, interesting technical discussion and less get rich quick idiots.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:26
I really doubt that. I think it will probably settle around the 7k mark based on previous retraces.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:49:32
Not possible as all future positions require a counter party, so for every short there has to be a long.

Ethereum (smart contract first mover advantage)
Litecoin (long history and potential testbed for BTC) 
XRP (centralised and popular with mainstream finance)

I think you misunderstand how lighting works. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:56:13
Which country you in? 
I've always tested a withdrawal with a few hundred dollars first, just to make sure it works. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:00:40
The useful alts are probably Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. They represent three unique spins on the original Bitcoin concept. Everything else is just noise. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:06
I own BTC, BCH and Eth. Ethereum has its own scaling issues and at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:50:44
It's always like this. Bitcoin sets a new ATH and the alts follow. What usually happens is that BTC then surges again, and the alts drop temporarily.
I think you're also seeing people like me that have a reasonable amount of BTC diversifying into things like Litecoin and Ethereum as a hedge against temporary downward pressure on the BTC price due to Future trading and the uncertainty it's created.
This sums it up:
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:10:35
God, you guys. Give it a fucking rest.
Coinbase is not the devil. It is a company looking to make money. It doesn't have a moral obligation to support your chosen world view or ideology. 
If you don't like them, don't use them. But this constant conspiracy bullshit is soooo fuuucking tiiiring...

What's the point of posts like this? Just contributing to the echo chamber? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:14:04
Because people with tens of thousands of dollars in BTC will happily pay 80 bucks to get their coins onto an exchange quickly. It's the small investors that are going to get fucked, because as the price continues to trend downwards and more panic sets in, those with the most Bitcoin will simply pay higher and higher fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:51:10
Listen... There's tons of information out there. 
You can even try the lightning network yourself on the Bitcoin Testnet. Download the Eclair android wallet, grab yourself some tBTC and start playing with it.
Starblocks.acinq.co is a website currently allowing lighting transactions (on the testnet).
Bitcoin isn't about sitting back and waiting for "them" to build it for a you. Participate! Help develop the protocol. Even if you can't code you can test stuff, run nodes and provide feedback to the devs.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:15:28
This level off fud borders on the insane. Prices have been broadly stable between 18 and 19k. And that's following an ATH just 24 hours ago or so.

I sold at 15k. Well, half my position. I think we're going sub ten k
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:58:23
If true, you realise that people like this will simply ride the bumps. Even with a general downward trajectory, there will still be occasional spikes, and with that volume of trade you can make a healthy profit on even relatively small price increases.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:15
People take profits and people panic sell. The fact all the main cryptos are falling is a good sign. You need to worry when just one is collapsing. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:49:10
So tacky. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:02:38
When alts crash, Bitcoin usually benefits. When Bitcoin crashes, everything tends to collapse.
Personally I don't think it's ever good to have all your eggs in one basket, so I split my holdings (not evenly) between Bitcoin (plus forks) Litecoin and Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:06:59

I love it when people with a few hundred dollars in Bitcoin shit bricks when the price drops a few percent.

Most aren't buying it because of its potential utility. They are buying it to make a quick buck. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:19:00
There's so much fud about this, people running around saying that you have to open channels with everyone you want to pay. But yes, once you establish a channel, you should in theory be able to pay anyone else on the lighting network, provided the routing system works as expected. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:16:22
Damn, if only this was all recorded somewhere. Like a chain of data containing all past transactions.

Worked far better than I was expecting and despite being still pretty rough around the edges, the process itself felt very intuitive.
Great work and can't wait to see this rolled out. 
Seeing the transactions confirm reminded me of my first btc transaction back in 2012 and how it felt almost magical.

You realise how much business they have had over the last few months? Like INSANE AMOUNTS?
You also realise that most people didn't leave Coinbase. Just because lots of people shout on Reddit, doesn't mean they represent the views of the majority.
You also need to realise that Coinbase doesn't buy your coins off you - they simply facilitate the trade between individuals.

Your ledger only stores your keys,not your Bitcoin. Bitcoins never leave the blockchain. Your transaction will appear when you restore. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:04:19
The Litecoin community is less awful, but more tragic. It's kinda like purgatory - or at least it was for a good three years.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:51:10
I'd use Electrum on my PC to actually 'store' the coins. Or just use a paper wallet. 
Then download Bitcoin Balance from the Android App store, and enter your public addresses. And voila, you can now see your balance on your phone.

Me too. Well back in the full BTC club.

Yes, but supply is not fixed, so matters less. 
All I'm saying is that, being so similar, developers could basically just switch.

Anyone that invests more money in BTC than they can afford to lose is an idiot. I know people say this all the time, but it's true. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:06:04
I appreciate I was being simplistic when I said "Bitcoin fans", but generally speaking the debate on this reddit had generally supported the world view that regulation = bad. I'm not saying that all Bitcoin users take this ideological stance, but clearly many do. So I do maintain that it is hypocritical that people now wish to use the mechanisms of government to try and offset their losses. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:26:24
But maybe this is Bitcoin's MySpace moment? And why would you be so against a currency that is basically the same as the one you support? It's probably more transparent as there was no premining with Ltc. 
Ps I have far more in BTC than LTC. But it seems like an option. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:44:21

I think it's a great shame that Bitcoin's future is in doubt as the technology still seems to be perfectly functional. But humans are funny things and its increasingly shady history seems to be making wider adoption almost impossible. 
Litecoin is basically Bitcoin, but with a clean image. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:30:12
Yet my debit card still works. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:09:41
Does no one else see the hypocrisy here? For years Bitcoin fans have claimed they hate government regulation and laughed at the warnings of financial institutes that claimed Bitcoin was risky. 
Now things have gone a bit crappy the very same people are demanding lawsuits! How long till people here start calling for proper regulation of exchanges? 
@_date: 2016-01-23 10:33:24
It's funny really, as the technology has so far proved extremely stable and is not really in question. The problems bitcoin has are all due to human behavior. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:43:14

It's not hard to get real time price updates from all the major exchanges. I know I do...
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:59:36
It's actually remarkable stable when you consider it's just seen a rise of about $200. It's holding comfortably at around $680. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:24:38
I think people are waking up to the fact that centralised blockchains are fairly useless for most uses. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:41:26
I don't know what everyone is so mad about. Coindesk is reporting a price of $690. 
I think a little break in the rise is a good thing. The fact it's holding is a good thing. 
Tomorrow is another day and the rise may well continue.

I'm a lot older than you, and I only keep in Bitcoin an amount I wouldn't be upset about it it vanished tomorrow. 
Can you perhaps take out your initial investment? That would give you £500 in your pocket, plus another £700 still in Bitcoin, which could go up further (or crash to nothing)?

That's exactly what I mean. Which is why I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Because a small blockchain has no real benefits over current centralized approaches to computing.
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:28:18
Yeah, I get that. But given that people are interested in blockchain technology often because of its decentralised nature and the concept of a common shared "truth", the above approach doesn't really offer anything beyond what existing mainframe computers do. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:53:34
It's a terrible video. The average user will come away thinking: "so you want to replace a server with an army of butlers"?

But Valve wants to convert to fiat straight away, hence its use of BitPay. The last thing Valve wants is to hold Bitcoin, but as a transfer mechanism it makes a lot of sense.
Either way, a great step towards wider adoption.
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:11:39
The efficiency thing puzzles me a bit too... Because I've never considered the blockchain particularly efficient. It's the price you pay for ensuring trust within the system, but if companies aren't really that interested in that part, it seems like a lot of wasted effort.
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:08:16
I see. Thanks for clarifying. I think it's because the media keep reporting it as if these companies want to capitalise on the trust concept the bitcoin blockchain offers.

I think Circle is now the cheapest way to buy Bitcoins in the UK. It used to incur fees, but as of last month debit card transfers are free.

The reason I've always got annoyed when people talk about the tulip bubble when discussing BTC is because BTC actually has a genuine purpose and solves some fundamental problems with existing currencies. Sadly, I do see China's announcement as a bad thing, as it undermines the very thing that sets BTC apart from tulips. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:52:54
Lol.. don't say that! Why do I suddenly need the data folders? I thought just the .wallet file?
