Yep that's what happens when there hadn't been many high profile arrests before so OPSEC wasn't deemed as important as today. The Ross of today would probably have a 360 camera view on his hat and brick his laptop if anyone gets close to him lol. People need to go down for others to realise how important having good OPSEC is.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:18:09
Yeah, and of course you have those idiots like AlphaBay admin that had his privatekeys unencrypted on a notepad on his computer while he himself posted on clearnet forums the same username and giving out his IP. Ross went down to make sure we don't repeat his mistakes, but humans will be humans.

Idk man, I thought 60 sat/b was alright, I didn't want to pay a 400 sat/b tx.

Thank you, what exactly do you do? Do you work for a pool?

Thanks, it's from the blockchain.info wallet, im sure it wont rebroadcast alone.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:17:15
Or maybe it's because bitcoin fees really are becoming way too high for a normal person to use? Hmmm, I wonder which one is it? Not they have to be wrong!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:35:17
Don't worry It's not my main wallet haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:09
That’s literally just an opinion lol. What if btc doesn’t come out of it cocoon and just dies? What if bcash fixes itself and become better? What if bitbean takes over the cryptomarket? It’s all just speculation, but the truth is bcash is working a lot smoother right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:29:50
“Soon” “soon” “soon” that’s all we hear for segwit and lightning network. People are tired of that, it’s been years for lightning network and all we hear is soon, people got tired of it that’s why they dump. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:26:40
Haha I love how predictable every brainless zealot is here. They all have only 3 arguments “haha u probably don’t even own 1 btc fuck off” , “you are a paid bch shill”, and the “wtf I sent 10 trillion  btc with 1 Satoshi fee and it confirmed in a nanosecond”. People here are voicing their concerns over how flaws and unusable bitcoin is and it’s not going to get better in the future, LN won’t fix anything it has yet to come and it’s been advertised for years as coming soon lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:44:53
"or use litecoin" thats so stupid, why even buy bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:18:03
For now, yes, and only because btc is traded up and down as a stock and nothing else. When that stops and people realize that BTC as a technology is flawed and $20 transactions aren't worth it the price will drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:13:08
Oh no, you're going to get downvoted now because your post doesn't contain price memes, but instead serious issues.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:16:22
What fee should he set? Anything under 200 sat/b is stuck for hours/days in mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:36:21
Segwit adoption is very tiny and it’s been out for a long time. LN adoption will be near zero as well. Just because it worked on some stupid test doesn’t mean it’ll work full scale in the real world. Vitalik tweeted the same thug a couple of days ago about how tests done on test networks give false data and it’s usually far less than that, and he gave proof. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:28:53
Why do you think you will ever be rich when you're uneducated? lol What happens when all those uneducated FOMO people like you realize that bitcoin is very flawed and thus will never reach 1 million per coin? Mass panic starts. You lose all your money cuz you just "wanted to be rich" with doing 0 research. Good luck to you then.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:32:24
I never bought any Bcash lol, I despise Roger Ver too much and his approach while a little bit better isn't going to win in the long run.  I sold my Bcash at 600 when it pumped fiy.
I'm trashing LN because it's flawed. You don't know the first thing about it lol. All you know about BTC is what you get from the frontpage "BTC MOON LOL LAMBO HAHA xdd". You're a headless investor driven by FOMO and the sad part is you're in the majority of the investors and that's why BTC will crash sooner or later.
edit: a word
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:23:33
Oh, darling, it's because of people like you that Bitcoin is in such a huge bubble. There was never proper infrastructure, btc is flawed on the code leve. Satoshi never expected his network to have so many tx at a time. You've never read anything about LN if you actually think it'll solve this problem. LN will add more problems than it will solve. 
People like you screaming "1 BTC AT OVER A MILLION"  is what attracts all this noob money and creates this huge bubble. 
You know nothing about BTC or the tech outside of the price and FOMO and that's scary. Take a day off to educate yourself and learn where the flaws off. You've been eating too much of the hype of the front page.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:36:27
There are many coins that do that, the problem, for now, is BTC is pumped by noob money from people like your grandpa and your mom that don't know about other coins that do everything BTC does but better. Once people realize there are other coins and BTC's actual value compared to others is way less, it'll drop, but god knows how high it'll go by then.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:08:07
Try a 1 btc/B next maybe it’ll finally work lol 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:31
Haha sure it’s been like that since the start, right? You’re literally a brainless bitcoin shill, just now bitcoin is too unusable so it’s dropping rapidly.  BCH was supposed to die on day one according to people like you, yet it hasn’t. I own 0 bch or care about it so you can’t even call me a shill, it’s people like you that make me lose faith in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:38
Im fine with waiting 2 weeks. So if after 2 weeks the transaction isn't back in the wallet how do I move the coins if they don't show in my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:16:04
Oh no the common person has to learn something, god help him!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:22:56
Oh sorry, should I make my own blockchain next? Is it too much to ask for a normal tx fee/confirmation time? haha Look at the frontpage, memes and price talk, no one cares about the 130k transactions stuck in limbo.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:18
See you back at 2,500 would probably be correct, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:26:49
Nono you see it was a currency before, now that we saw we were 100% wrong we all changed our minds and it’s a store of value now, but you’re still an idiot for pointing out we were wrong. Downvoted bch shill 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:12:11
Why? Tell me how much should I pay for a transaction? blind FOMO follower. Can't you see how inherently broken the whole network is? I shouldn't be forced to pay a $20 tx fee. That's why steam dropped BTC because it's way too flawed to be used in real life. If bitcoin becomes mainstream like everyone here dreams of are we going to pay 10000 sat/b tx fees? 
Do you want me to ignore the flawed network and just brainlessly post memes and price talk? The bitcoin community is the absolute worst of any crypto, any discussion about the flaws gets downvoted because it's not FOMO related.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:59
Oh should we go back to posting price memes and gifs to satisfy your autism? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:49:15
I'm trying to start a dialogue, but sure buddy, enjoy your memes. Let
s see if you'll still enjoy them later when the price crashes because people start to realize how flawed this coin is.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:45:13
Are you suggesting I pay 400 sat/b? So I have to pay larger fees than in banks? Whats the point if bitcoin then? lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:46
what a shill haha 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:04:22
Exchanges don’t use segwit, only a few wallets are segwit enabled. Lightning isn’t coming ever, “coming soon” has been their motto for years now. And no I’m not a bch shill, I hold 0 bch, I’m not pushing any narrative just because I’m not blindly in love with btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:35:01
I meant you're uneducated when it comes to bitcoin. You clearly don't understand how it works or how Ln works if you keep repeating "BTC at 1 million". And everyone with half a brain has made good gains in the crypto market this year. Don't think you're special, because you're not. Idc what your field is or if you graduated with honors, for all I care you could be lying. My entire point is you invest in bitcoin because you think it's a get quick rich scheme, which it's not, and that's what's going to bring the market down. This is 100% a bubble when 90% of investors think it's a get quick rich scheme, sadly it's really becoming a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:37:12
Exactly people here are stupid and downvote any talk about how flawed btc is. Transactions will keep going up and nothing will be done about it but everyone that brings it up gets downvotes because it’s “FUD” . Only memes are allowed on the front page 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:40:13
Do you realize how low segwit adoption is? If I want to transfer funds from exchange or to one you can't use segwit because the top exchanges do not support it. Most wallets do not support it as well.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:56:09
Please tell me one good thing that BTC brings lol? It's a problem when BTC is advertised as a good alternative to banks when actually using a bank is way cheaper and easier lol.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:43:38
And that's okay according to you? How is BTC supposed to be used when it's slow and has high fees? This subreddit is full of just memes about the price and 0 discussions about how flawed this is, that's the literal definition of a bubble, people buying because of FOMO while ignoring how broken the actual product is.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:52:58
Yeah exactly, bitcoin.de has deals with banks and whatnot
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:56:55
We've been waiting for this magical upgrade for years, nobody cares about it. Look at the front page, full of memes and price talk, nothing about the tech itself. That's how you know you're in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:10:44
I said it's becoming one. It's not the definition of a Ponzi, yes, but the demand is 100% FOMO. What happens when the last person that buys bitcoin at ATH realizes that it's not actually worth this much because it's a flawed product and sells? The person before him will sell as well and it'll be like an avalanche until it loses most of its value.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:47:49
How am I angry or sour? Do you know anything about the tech behind bitcoin or did u invest just so you can be rich? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:53:33
I know they'll have scaling problems as well, but at least it'll be less of a problem, instead of $20 fees it'll be  $10 fees, not great but it's a start. I've been with BTC for years and I don't want to use Bcash, but BTC has been so unusable lately that it's just super frustrating. 
Lightning network has been advertised for YEARS and it's still in that "Coming soon" phase lol. I absolutely do NOT believe that it'll fix anything because it's inherently flawed as well. If it ever arrives at all lol. 
The problem with thinking BTC is a store of value like gold is that gold is shiny and you can make stuff with it, show it off etc. That's why gold is so valuable, it obviously shows the difference between a rich and a poor person, but BTC can't do that. Are rich people going to wear shirts saying " I own 100 BTC"? Don't kid yourself, the price rise in bitcoin is only for one thing - FOMO. Bitcoin will never be as attractive as gold or as useful as a real currency. Once investors realize how flawed it is and there are other alternatives BTC will drop. The only good thing is that BTC is giving exposure to the entire alt coin market which is good for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:33:35
Did you read my post? I already own and use other currencies, I just don't understand how can everyone here cheer when the prices increases by $100 when Bitcoin doesn't have a bright future at all. 
And I don't understand how BTC can keep growing so much while being the most flawed coin in the top 20.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:08:57
We've been waiting years for lightning network idiot.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:07:18
Are you high? First of all bitcoin is not secure, bitcoin is controlled by a mafia of Chinese farmers that can destroy bitcoin in a day if they wish, for now, they're going along with us because it's in their best profit interests. Bitcoin is very centralized and that makes it extremely vulnerable. 
Etherium's actual value as a technology is way higher than that of bitcoin, no doubt about it.
 The reason why XMR is growing as it is is that it was built from the ground up as an anonymity coin. BTC can never rival that level of anonymity without changing most of the code and thus creating a different coin.
Lightning network has been advertised for years as "Coming soon" and we still don't know when we'll see it if we ever do lol. 
I don't know what you think alts are, but to me alt coins are every coin that's not bitcoin, that's what I meant by alts. And the truth is  most alts are worthless but there are dozens of alts that are way better than BTC as a technology, BTC brings nothing except huge fees and slow confirmation. And if you had a brain you would've made more money this year from the alt market than by holding BTC lol. BTC is up 2000% this year but if you played the alt market smart you would've seen returns above 10000%. I think you're the salty one in that regard lol. Also does it matter if your portfolio is alt coins or bitcoin? In the end if BTC crashes alts will crash as well so who cares if you own BTC or alts when the value of all of them will be lost.
The only thing you're right about is the liquidity.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:21:45
Can you re-broadcast with this tx? 60 sat/b stuck for almost 20h, unbelievable
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:13:58
So you only put money in btc to become rich and you won’t spend It for a year. Yep definitely a bubble. 0 knowledge investors everywhere, everyone wants to be the next millionaire but they’re just signing their own death warrant by buying from each other for the simple reason to become rich lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:18:58
You need a 1000sat/b fee nowadays haha. And you call people complaining about that bots and shills? You do realize the average person doesn’t give a shit about bitcoin when it’s too expensive and complicated, better use a bank, you’ll save on fees actually.

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:31:11
Why hasn’t bcash died yet my friend? Why are they actually  going up in price instead? How do you explain that?  Your little death spiral argument has no ground
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:57:45
It's becoming a ponzi in the sense that people like you throw money at it to make money, but your gains are coming from someone else after you who puts in money to get returns and so on and so on. Bitcoin right now is not worth its current valuation because more than half of it is just due to FOMO. I know very well the technology isn't a ponzi but the way people throw money at it make it one.
 The fact is bitcoin will never replace gold. Bitcoin is dependant on electricity and the internet. If one of those goes out (due to an EMP for example) it's worthless. You can wear gold and show off your wealth, you can't do that with BTC. Nobody will use bitcoin as a safe haven for offshore money because it's not anonymous one bit and there's already regulations. You have to show the IRS where you bought it and whatnot. Nobody will let you convert hundreds or more bitcoins to fiat without asking questions lol. Bitcoin is centralized and controlled by a mafia of Chinese miners that can destroy it in a day if they want. If bitcoin continues to grow with this speed then it's going to require as much electricity as 10 Norways. You realize bitcoin will never become 1 million because that would destroy the planet thanks to its huge energy consumption. 
You do 0 research on who the team is or the technology. You've just been lucky and you will get burned. So many like you got burned from Confido lol, "OMG IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PROJECT LET ME THROW 100K IN IT" without doing any research, turns out the team was fake and the project will never work and boom dropped to 0. You are a headless investor throwing money at anything because in crypto everything pumps today.  But it won't be like that all the time, you'll get burned sooner or later because of statements like "I don't care about the tech or what this project means".
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:22:23
Absolutely the bitcoin community is full of 15 year olds that "invested" their lunch money and get hyped and post memes every time the price goes up by $1. Any discussion to be had about how BTC is so flawed and how the tech is way overvalued results in getting called a troll,shill, fudster and downvoted. It's horrible and that's how I know BTC is 100% a bubble. When 90% of the investors don't want to face reality and just buy because of FOMO there's nothing else it can be.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:34
And that's why bitcoin will never be successful and it will never reach a million as some people wish. Bitcoin mining is controlled by a Chinese mafia (Bcash as well btw, im not a shill). You will never have a decentralized bitcoin and tx will never be cheap. That's why BTC will crash, mark my words. There are many, many more coins that do what BTC does better and once your average joe gets a smell of them they'll all abandon btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:02
Oh yeah, cuz bitcoin is very decentralized hahah. Controlled by a mafia of Chinese miners rofl.

What exactly are your customers having trouble with? It sounds like they  just cant operate a computer at all. How hard is it to go into coinbase and just copy paste the amount you want to buy from the checkout  page and thats it. It shouldn't take someone more than an hour to figure it out.

@_date: 2017-08-08 23:42:04
So everything is taking super long to confirm?
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:56:49
You pay 5% more than the actual price to buy it so you if 1 btc is 1000 bucks and you pay  1000 you'd be getting bitcoin for 950 and if the price doubles and btc is 2k and you try to sell it the sell price will be 2100.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:05:36
Thank you for actually making a legit response. Funny how this sub talks about getting more people into bitcoin but when someone new has a question some people just meme. 
Im thinking in investing a few thousand bucks but I fear that with other coins growing in the near future there might be a coin that does everything that bitcoin does +  more and that might make people forget about bitcoin and flock there. Ill probably use the dollar cost averaging method just to be safer.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:46:29
Iota will get even bigger than that it's a brand new technology that solves even the problems even bitcoin can't. You can still use bitfinex if ur a us citizen just with a vpn and iota is going to be listen on a few major exchanges soon ( bittrex in a week or two confirmed)  it's like selling your bitcoin when it reaches 40 bucks cuz u got it at 10 ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:31:18
sounds like cloud mining tbh
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:56:29
if u put 10 bucks into bitcoin and in a week the price of bitcoin doubles then your 10 bucks turn into 20 bucks and you can sell it but because of sale fees and shit you'll probably get 10% less 
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:17:54
If its so risky why would anyone invest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:40:59
Oh yeah im sure OP's baker will have almost no success as well but it really depends on what you're selling and the exposure. If you're selling something tech related you have a way higher chance of getting bitcoins from your customers. So its either your website must have a lot of exposure or you need to market it specifically to people who use computers a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:24:17
Might as well gamble, its faster.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:02:20
Most people don't need to understand every little technical detail of bitcoin to invest in it or use it. You should try to explain it to people and not scoff and be like "pff you'll never understand it so go away". While bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are genius they aren't rocket science to understand.

I had about 90 euro in my wallet then I sent a transaction thats about 15 bucks, then i added 100 more and  then I sent 30. The way I look it I should have had enough to cover the outgoing transactions.

Where I live if you want to sell bitcoins to a bitcoin ATM you'll have to pay around 10% more than the buy bitcoins price.  But fair enough i dont know that much about exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:49:29
I suggest you do the dollar cost average method. If bitcoin does dip below 3k again it'll be better for you.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:53:47
Why don't you just compare it to dollars for example 0.55 dollars is just 55 cents so the same concept works there. Your customers probably just dont want to deal with the hassle of making a wallet, buying bitcoins through some exchange that requires verification and whatnot, waiting for confirmations while wondering WTF is taking so long etc. 
But even if 5% of your customers are comfortable with using bitcoins then that's great tbh. You can maybe add a link to your checkout page that sends them to a page on your website thats shows with pictures how to make a coinbase account, create a breadwallet wallet on their phone and transfer coins step by step. If you hold their hands while they are probably more likely to pay in bitcoins especially if you throw a 5-10% "pay in bitcoin" discount.

Centralization literally goes against these coins' nature. Tagged as a fudder

What are they doing in Vertcoin, I thought VTC was always ASIC resistant?

We're comparing the technologies not market caps. You're saying a coin cant exist without ASICs which is hilarious.

Well good on you for admitting it at least, hopefully, you read more on it and understand it better to spread the right kind of awareness.

Why wouldn't it? If it's asic resistant then a lot of people will mine with their video cards at home like at the start of bitcoin, and that would help the network.

What the fuck is kik?
I'm just saying if there's a project that interests you and you want to use it its better to get into the ICO so you can get the tokens cheaper for later when u want to use it. Or if you see potential in it get into the ICO get the tokens cheap and sell them once people realize about it and they're worth x times as much.

No? Gift cards don't change value with time. Think of tokens as a mixture between gift cards and stocks. And tokens are a set amount.
If you have a really cool arcade game that can only be played using specific coins made by the manufacturer the more popular the game gets the more people will want to play it and for that they need to purchase the tokens. There's demand. You as a token holder knowing there won't be any more tokens created choose how much to sell them for.

what do you mean by the full bitcoin experience?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:26:47
Why would there be no need to sell it if bitcoin succeeds?  
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:20:19
Thanks for the explanation. That helps.

What about governments? How would they react? Are they going to be okay with paying taxes with bitcoins, a currency that they dont control? 
Why would the guy at subway accept bitcoin if at the end of the day the government is still going to want taxes paid in their own currency?
