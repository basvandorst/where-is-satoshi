I'm a software developer - a pretty good one, in my estimation, having worked with tons that aren't. 
That said you don't need to be some genius (or even particularly talented) to make some serious bank. You just have to put in the work in a space where nobody is paying enough attention yet.

I'm not sure what they meant - that its harder for owners to control or harder for governments to control. Both are true at the moment. One of my big fears is that there's no way to give control to individuals in a way that most will understand without some kind of centralization / custodial relationship. And if centralization / custodial relationships are necessary for the average user, why bother with crypto in the first place?

I'm skeptical for different reasons. If this does what its supposed to do, it could mean massive civil unrest at best and famine/war at worst. Basically we'll all have Lambos but they'll be covered with spikes because we'll be in a real life Mad Max post apocalyptic world. If anyone thinks their civil or human rights are still going to matter if the dollar collapses then they are poor students of history. Remember that one time there was a financial crisis and the U.S. government literally started seizing people's gold? Ya.

I just don't think market cap makes any sense for this. If there's 100 apples and a few dudes trade the same 5 apples between themselves for 50 bucks a piece does that mean the market cap for apples is 5000 bucks? Sure, technically. But its not very useful to say that "apples are now more valuable than bananas!!~!"
Instead we should be looking at trading volume - and honestly we should be looking at it in a way that ignores coins that are just doing loops between addresses.

I've started thinking in Bitcoin terms and not in dollar terms. With Bitcoin, I know how much of the pie I have. With dollars, who even knows. In 10 years everything will be 1.5x as expensive in dollar terms due to inflation. When two things trade against each other and one inflates while the other deflates... like, look, its not rocket science here.

Wild thing is - if Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency, it may make sense to buy the landfill and meticulously search it for that hard drive one day. Considering what they spend on gold mines and that hard drive contains 1/2000th of the world's maybe future money supply. Be like somebody losing 50 billion in a land fill in today's money.

@_date: 2019-07-23 09:38:12
There are other issues. At 1mb blocks it would cost only about 50b usd per year to peg fees  at 500 usd per tx. This is way easier than 51% attacks. Btc takes over or dies, but unlike most seem to think, it wont die by people losing interest. Has to be some failure that can't be forked around.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:45:56
Ya, I get all that. The weird part to me is that "selling something you don't own" (shorting) can drive down the price of the thing.
I guess volume is relevant, since if you have 1B and you want to short bitcoin the market must lack a corresponding 1B that wants to buy discount bitcoin in order for it to move the price via the order books.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:59
What you describe is BCH.
I read both subs and have no real dog in the fight; I own BTC and BCH (and BTG which really is a scam coin in my estimation) in equal number and I will continue to hold all of them no matter the price in the near term. If you are not worried that BCH could take over and surpass BTC in marketcap then... I wish I had your future seeing abilities. There's a real good chance that the only thing that pushes miners to adopt a big change like a block size increase is to make BCH worth more than BTC. And if that's the only way it can happen, then that's what's going to happen in my estimation.
LN might fix the problem, but it also might take forever to roll out like segwit has and the market might have moved on by the time its a reasonable option.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:16:21
Question is will it crash from 12k to 5k or from 50k back down to 30k? Nobody knows. I think its cheap now; if I had more money, I'd buy more bitcoin.

I don't know what scaling strategy Dash has, but any coin with low user volume is going to be quick to transact. BTC is slow / expensive because its so popular.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:27:02
Bitcoin is a weird investment in that it has a lot of retail investors (people like you and me). This feels like regular Christmas stuff; people cash out because holidays are expensive. Come January I expect it to rebound and maybe post new gains as people, particularly young people, turn gift money into crypto and those with weak hands and poor judgement who sold low see that they made a mistake and buy high again. Also big money from CME - large investors aren't in yet (they can be but aren't). I think they will be once they see a few months of futures playing out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:26:07
I'm worried about the BTC futures because, from my understanding, you don't ever have to actually own the Bitcoin to play the Bitcoin game... which seems insane, but who knows.

No big traders are going to jump in at an ATH when futures open; they are going to wait and see what effect futures has on BTC before buying in. If they buy in (instead of shorting), it will be slowly at first then all at once.

I still don't think we're talking about the same thing when we say decentralization; you're talking about the distributed system, I'm talking about the fact that nobody owns Bitcoin. There is no "Rob's store" to copy because "Rob" is everybody and nobody. You can't "steal" Bitcoin's brand because there is nobody to steal it from because nobody owns it. When Protestantism branched from Catholicism they were both broadly "Christianity" no matter how much whining the Catholics did over Christianity being "their thing" and Protestants being the devil. There's tons of precedent for this sort of thing. When Bitcoin has been branched 50 more times and they're all competing with varying market caps (Catholicism:BTC, Protestantism:BCH, Mormonism:BTG roughly speaking) it'll make a ton more sense why they are all Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin in its truest sense is a protocol not a property, even though tons of people use the word Bitcoin to mean "the fork of Bitcoin that I bought and kept." Everyone thinks some branch of Bitcoin is going to win and the others are going to go away but I doubt that seriously. _Maybe_ BTC goes to 100k or 1M or whatever the true valuation of the underlying technology is, but more likely in my opinion is that the sum of forks reach that market cap (or an altcoin usurps it entirely).
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:57:45
The Bitcoin protocol has changed a lot though. A whole lot. How do you explain that?

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:56:07
I'm a software developer that's been involved in a lot of startups. Pristine code with no users is worse than bad code with lots of users.
Also you seem to fundamentally not get what decentralized means. Anyone can fork Bitcoin; forking Bitcoin does not create something that "isn't Bitcoin." It creates another version of Bitcoin. What matters is the number of users and miners. At times BCH has had more miners than BTC - did that make BCH "Bitcoin" and BTC "BCore?" - no. That's not how this works. They're both Bitcoin in the same way that Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are both Ethereum.

I don't think the price has much to do with this; there's a lot of technical analysis that says the price should dip a bit after the last rise. It's not based on anything, but enough volume traders / bots follow the analysis and so it becomes self fulfilling.

Flipside is, it could crash into the moon. You were probably waiting at 8k too because it was too sketch? Now its double that.

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:49:06
Problem is, any L2 solution requires a lot of infrastructure to support it. So the rollout will be slow, like it was with segwit. The only solution that works for the existing network is increasing the blocksize, which core devs don't want to do and even if they did its a distributed network so you'd have to get the miners raking in all these fees to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:16:52
Its still Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold is Bitcoin. I get that you don't like the changes and that's fine, but trying to control the conversation by calling Bitcoin Cash "not Bitcoin" is the exact same as trying to control the conversation by calling Bitcoin Core "not Bitcoin."
The comparison to Apple is bunk because Bitcoin is a protocol not a company. Its more like if somebody took the Bible and started another religion - but guess what, that happens a LOT and its still broadly called Christianity whether or not "other true Christians" agree.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:26:24
But if you're only going to put in like 1k, I'd wait a few years unless, say, 5k is life changing money to you.

The predicted volatility happened 3 months before the futures. Everything in Bitcoin happens 3 months earlier than predicted.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:37:29
Bitcoin already increased the blocksize. That fork is called Bitcoin Cash.
That sounds simple and obvious but that's really it; if the market decides that transaction fees are too high it will switch to Bitcoin Cash (which is still Bitcoin).
Market hasn't done that yet, but it might. If it does, everyone claiming there's a Bitcoin bubble will say "see, told ya!" And Bitcoin Cash will carry on as Bitcoin with Bitcoin being called Bitcoin Classic (or Core or something) in the same way that Ethereum took the place of Ethereum Classic.
We'll see what happens when Coinbase starts trading BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:51:30
"steal control of the coin and brand" ... "decentralized currency"
That's kind of the thing for me. Tons of people are trying to "steal control" of Bitcoin but nobody owns it so there's nothing to steal. I've watched a lot of Roger Ver and this dude is not looking at BCH as some get richer quick scam; for better or worse he believes in what he is doing.
I'm a software developer and I've seen this before a LOT. Management needs something done right now because if it doesn't get done the business will suffer perhaps unrecoverably. Developers don't want to take the shortcut because they know its going to cause other issues in the future. BCH is coming at this from a management standpoint; if we don't do something people may realize that the Bitcoin they own doesn't work as advertised and jump ship. BTC is coming at it from a long game standpoint; ever-bigger blocks doesn't work indefinitely.
As is often the case, neither side is wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:34:33
I would bet most people follow a pattern where they don't stop believing in the project/thesis, but the dollar value becomes so high and the asset is so volatile that they must take profits. So if you've been active since 2011, I'd guess you bought as many as 10k and saw that dollar value fluctuate dramatically. If you took profits like most, you maybe have 50-1000 BTC left. Not based on any specifics.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:37:10
Ya! What happens if China opens up hard?!
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:52:32
Exactly. And this is fine. Anyone can fork Bitcoin, anyone can make an altcoin, etc. The market will decide.
The only people who care which fork wins are the people who sell off the "bad guy coins" because they think they've got it figured out. Its not a religion people, its a new asset class. Bitcoin has already tipped above 20k if you hold your own private keys and don't pay enough attention to coin politics to bother selling.
Everyone is assuming that there will be one true Bitcoin that hits 100k or 1M or whatever - maybe it'll be 20 different branches that sum to that amount? Maybe something else will take over? Anyone selling all the forks but one is way smarter or way dumber than me, at any rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:19:40
Bitcoin is speculation; spend what you can afford and check back in a year. If you're in it for quick money you're part of the reason it micro-crashed. HODL on to your butt, 2018 is going to be bumpy. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:33:06
I've been trying to get people to buy since February of this year. It's been hard not to say I told you so.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:27:51
Right now, I think the speculative guess is that LN (or something) will alleviate this issue. But, ya, who knows. Moon?! :)
Being a store of value where regular transactions are still done in fiat isn't exactly a non-starter. But if some other coin can scale and BTC can't copy its scaling technique, then why not use that other coin as a store of value...
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:48:52
Think of Bitcoin like a religion; nobody owns it. So like we have Catholics and Protestants and at first they hated each other because "we're the _true_ Christians" where in fact both are broadly Christianity, we now have Core and Cash and both are Bitcoin (BTG is also Bitcoin; anyone who wants to fork Bitcoin is also Bitcoin, because _nobody owns it_ and that's _great_). There is good precedent for all of this stuff.
Right now we're in the holy war phase, but eventually the dust will settle and the various cryptos will have to rest on their merits and number of actual users instead of hype / speculation. Will Bitcoin win, nevermind which flavor? Who knows. My guess is that BTC/BCH/BTG market share goes to the 20-30% range unless: 
* LN becomes a thing that works.
* Transaction fees go down, irrespective of LN.
* It can re-brand to milibits so that it doesn't seem "too expensive" to people.
But who knows, that's just my guess.

It will take time for the big investors to start buying into Bitcoin. They'll probably wait a month or two at least, to see what everyone else does, then enter gradually (then, eventually, maybe, all at once). Most still see this as a gamble/bubble/mania/unknown otherwise they'd be buying in like we have. I think that sentiment will change for more and more people, but it will take time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:25:35
Opinions like this are why its 20k this year and 100k next year instead of 100k right now and 1M next year. Its all sentiment driven, right now sentiment is good. Maybe that all changes but in the short term I don't see it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:06:14
So if "I bet you 10 billion this is going to zero" outpaces "I bet you 10 billion this is going to a million" then BTC loses?

They literally announced that they'd be supporting BCH "by January 2018" like 4 months ago. What did you think, they wouldn't go through? Not sure how new to the scene you are, but when BCH forked they lost a TON of people because their original stance was that they would not support it. So people moved their coins to their own wallets - bad for Coinbase. They are a business they can't afford to be ideological. They have to follow the market and right now a non-trivial part of the market is choosing to bet on BCH for valid reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:20:16

@_date: 2017-12-16 01:21:56
Everyone gets that. I'll reiterate: neither Bitcoin Core nor Bitcoin Cash are the "one and only true Bitcoin" because Bitcoin is a protocol not an implementation. Likewise, as someone else pointed out in this thread, Ubuntu is not Fedora but both are Linux. 
Don't agree with the implementation of BCH? Pretty sure you've got it all figured out and that the current state of the market will support BTC indefinitely? Cool, sell all your BCH and take that risk. You don't have to hold it. Maybe Bitcoin will hit a million by BCH being worth 990k and BTC being worth 10k. Maybe BCH will go away entirely. Maybe something better will take over and make Bitcoin the Netscape of crypto. Who knows? This is the wild west and if you're getting religious about it you might get burned. Or you might not. If either of us could predict the future we'd have gotten in 5 years ago and not be talking to each other on reddit.

It'll be way easier to get the market to switch to BCH as the "true Bitcoin" than to update the existing network, as attempts to do so have shown in the last year.

You may be right; but from my seat it seems like the broader market doesn't know or care about any of that and "Bitcoin with no transaction fees that works right now" is a pretty compelling story. Can BTC survive a crash to 5k if BCH is at 10k? Nobody calls it BCash outside of those who want to see it fail. The greater market sees it as a Bitcoin fork.  All hypothetical, of course.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:47:24

You took a picture that included the private key, even if you edited it out later. Don't do this. Compromised cellphones are super common. This is like storing an entire Bitcoin on your phone (or putting 15k in hundreds in your physical wallet). It'll probably be fine but its not very responsible.

The marketcap for btc is much lower. About 5M btc are actually circulating. Many are lost, or held by a small group of individuals. Market cap for btc is about 10M (coins) * 10k (price) if we are looking at it realistically.

The Bitcoin bet everyone is making is that Bitcoin replaces fiat money. If it does, whatever you put in will do way more than double. But it might not work. You may or may not ever double your money; if you are putting in so little that you can "just pretend you lost it" then you're doing it right. Don't sell for the next ~4 years (even if BTC gets to 100k or 1M or whatever). If the project is successful even very little now could be substantial. A 10% cut into the forex market implies a valuation at 2-5M, replacing currency outright implies a valuation at hundreds of millions (and some Mad Max post apocalyptic shit happening globally, being honest).

In my opinion? Use this money to start your own startup/charity; a truly decentralized blockchain platform for connecting those in real need to the money, removing existing charity middlemen.

It colors the outcome, for sure. Imagine if they ran a gold vs bitcoin poll as a physical mail-in from some newspaper? The only way to avoid selection bias is to get a true random sample. Even professional pollsters struggle with this - the bias being that, people who choose to answer a poll once they've been randomly selected tend to be more agreeable than most, which colors the results of the poll if agreeableness is a factor. Imagine you're a Trump supporter and you get polled for political affiliation. I would guess that Trump supporters are extremely unlikely to be agreeable to being polled on stuff. So the numbers will reflect a lower trend in that direction than is true (how much lower, who knows).

@_date: 2019-11-22 17:52:47
Interesting. Maybe. I would imagine they would hold as much as they can afford to, idea being that they can sell into the pre-halving run-up (eta 3 months?) or post-halving recovery (eta 12 months?). But if your view is that we are going to retrace to as low as 2-3k, then selling now makes way more sense. Maybe they are just hedging for all possible scenarios.
@_date: 2019-11-26 00:22:01
I think BTC will allow for the first Trillionaires. One, because the dollar will continue to depreciate due to inflation. Imagine everyone with a net worth of 500 million becoming Billionaires - its easier if you realize that the dollar loses 40% of its purchasing power every decade with expected inflation rates. So in 12 years or so, having 500 million in purchasing power today will make you a Billionaire inflation adjusted.
Bitcoin is a new category of money, and one with absolute scarcity. And I think that's how people need to think about it. You have dollars/yuan/francs/whatever else and all of their tradeoffs then gold and all of its tradeoffs. Now there are those two categories plus Bitcoin. Rich people tend to diversify their monetary holdings and its unreasonable (to me) to expect that this won't include Bitcoin more and more going into the future.

Alternative viewpoint:
Bitcoin is going to zero or millions. It will likely look like its going to do one, then the other, on repeat for the foreseeable future. Buy a little and forget about it for 10 years. Pretend the money is lost. Don't put in more than you can realistically and comfortably sit back and watch it go to zero. Even better - don't watch it.
@_date: 2019-11-26 04:17:12
Are you from the future?! &lt;3
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:24:50
The real key here is that its a shortcut. If you haven't invested more than you can afford to lose, you won't be tempted to sell when it feels like its going to zero. Breaks the "buy high sell low" cycle. If you bought at 20k or 14k or whatever, you'll be fine - eventually. Its that eventually that gets people. They don't have the stomach to sit on it at 4k when everyone is calling for 2k because they have too much invested. If you only have a little invested, your head is much clearer. Heck you might even buy more because it looks cheap to you (instead of you worrying about how much you just "lost").

Do you trust your government so much that you'll stake 100% of your future on their ability to make decisions? Then Bitcoin has no value for you. Others won't, so it has value. Imagine you're trying to expatriate money from China. What better way is there to do this than with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:49:02
Both are valuable. Bitcoin is better suited to be money, which is why Schiff hates it so much. If it succeeds like it might then his business goes under because so much of its value is because Boomers think it might be money again some day.

@_date: 2019-11-21 17:28:05
Yes. Buy red sell green. People who lose money do the opposite. It has to feel crappy to be correct. Like, its hard to feel good buying BTC at 3k when everyone is saying its going to 1.5k. Its hard to feel good about selling BTC at 14k when everyone is saying 100k.
But also we must realize that nobody can time the top or bottom perfectly. You might sell and it keeps going up, you might buy and it keeps going down.

This is exactly why its so volatile. Some people bought at 10 cents, some at 10 bucks, some at 10k. The earlier you bought the smarter you are; nothing goes up forever. "Its going to 1M" and "I should sell some at 15k" both make sense if you have 20k BTC in your stash.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:58:24
Having a block size that is too small _may_ be a security risk. One attack vector is spending the ~50 billion a year it would cost to peg every transaction at 500 bucks minimum. If its a true backbone layer, 500 buck transactions may be fine (10k may be fine, who knows). But this precludes things like lightning network and means we still have banks (just backed by Bitcoin) and if this is the case why not just use gold? Long term the inflation schedule for Bitcoin is better, but only for those who get in early. If the inflation schedule is the only story that matters, then people ought to have the majority of their net worth in gold not dollars. But they don't. So it isn't. People don't, en masse, go to gold over fiat because it inflates at a 1% lower rate so there's no reason to think they'll switch to BTC because it inflates at 2% lower still. 
It does depend on what you call success. I do think Bitcoin will be (and is) a new asset class that many will own. But the question of whether or not we'll have it as a new global reserve currency is an open question. Maybe? We do have new world reserve currencies every few hundred years, so the timing is right.
@_date: 2019-10-25 01:48:46
You seem to be conflating scarcity with ... well I don't know what. The fact that things can be divided into smaller things? That you can divide a gold bar into 20^23 atoms per mole does not make a gold bar less scarce.
Scarcity relates to how many people could have exclusive ownership of a thing, not how many base units of that thing you can divide it into. Satoshis are not scarce; anyone can own a few. Bitcoins are scarce because only 21 million people can conceivably own a whole one.
Dollars, by contrast, are not scarce. If there were a reason to give everyone on earth a billion dollars you could do it because dollars are backed by laws of man where gold is backed by laws of nature and bitcoin is backed by laws of collectivist game theory.
If you think its dumb don't buy any. I genuinely don't care. More for me and others who get it.

Lets theorycraft how to generate easy to remember but hard to guess brain wallet seeds!
Here's my contribution:
Pick a number [N1] greater than 100,000 but less than 10,000,000. Pick another large number [N2] smaller than [N1] but also bigger than 100,000 and less than 10,000,000. Pick a word more than 5 characters [W1] and pick an uncommon misspelling for that word (like tacos might be tackos). Pick another word more than 5 characters [W2] and an uncommon misspelling for that word (espionage might be espoinage).
[N1] is how many times you repeat [W1]. [N2] is the position of that sequence where you've instead used [W2]. Run the whole thing through a SHA256 algorithm then feed the result back into the SHA256 algorithm ([N1] + [N2]) * 1000 times and at the end you've created your password (will take a solid ten minutes to generate on a modern PC). Now all you have to remember is the two numbers and the two words and how you misspelled them. Better yet to have a program generate the numbers, the words, and their misspellings. Guessing is very computationally expensive. Memorizing is easy.
If you actually do it, do it at your own risk. Seems safe to me though, if you pick numbers and words attackers can't guess. Any thoughts?

Tone Vays has been pretty good. Willy Woo.
And before you go pointing out the times they were wrong. They have been right more often than this. If you followed all of Tone Vay's calls you were in BTC at about 800 bucks, out at about 15k in early 2018, and have started slowly accumulating after we broke above 6k. He also called that we'd bounce from 3k and we'd break down around 5k, and he was wrong there. He called that we'd break down around 9k, and he was wrong there. So lets say you take all of his calls, right and wrong, and allocated 800 bucks in an all-in-then-all-out kind of way based on his TA. You're at about 25k now. You're welcome.
And again, he's been wrong a few times. Yes. Sure. But you know how TA works and that its percentages, not a crystal ball that tells you prices and dates, so luckily we can skip that whole conversation and agree that if you'd acted on Tone's TA and ignored the noise otherwise you'd be wildly profitable.

I think what they don't get is that... look. If money had to be backed by something with intrinsic value, then when we went off the gold standard in the 70s, everyone would've switched back to gold. People would've never used seashells or beads or rai stones as currency. The experiment has been run. They are factually incorrect in their opinions. The only thing money has to do is have all the properties of money.
They talk about gold being used in electronics. And what about before that? Put a gold bar and a chocolate bar in front of a 5 year old and then tell me about intrinsic value. They confuse intrinsic value with intrinsic scarcity and its obvious, on examination, when you compare their arguments with the data.

Inflation is calculated by CPI but is caused by increase money supply. But you are right that increasing the money supply by 2.5% does not cause 2.5% inflation.
It is by definition compounding. If it weren't, we'd calculate in absolute value not by percentage year over year.
Take 1M today. Go back 20 years, 2000 - 1M today has about as much purchasing power as 500k did back then. In 1980, its about the same as 250k. In 1960, its about the same as 125k. In 1940, its the same as about 62.5k. 
Go check. The numbers are only slightly off.

If you think that TA is bullshit then you are ignorant.
It does have problems. Some of it is subjective. Where do you draw your lines? Which moving average do you use? Which of the thousand methods of analysis do you use? Some methods flat out don't work and aren't predictive.
There are, however, resources that cite statistical evidence of types of patterns that tend to play out in one way or another.
So, if you want to say "TA is bullshit" then you've laid a blanket claim about something which you clearly haven't looked into. Are bollinger bands bullshit for predicting price movements? Seems like they are. Do descending triangles tend to break down? Seems like they do. So you'll need to pick out which patterns, exactly, you think are bullshit. I might agree with you. I might not. Depends on the evidence. There is a difference between people misapplying it and it being bullshit. People misapply quantum physics (Deepak Chopra looking at you). Doesn't make quantum physics bullshit.
It is very similar to poker. If you think poker is 100% gambling, then you probably just suck at it and don't understand it very well. Or that some people are "consistently luckier" than you. And like poker, understanding TA doesn't mean every trade will be profitable, like Phil Ivey doesn't mean you'll walk away a winner from every table.

Dollar cost average does not have to be on some specific date. You can also:
Every month, put a little in. But only buy on days when we've had two consecutive days of -3% or more. If, at the end of the month, no times qualified, go ahead and buy. This is just like buying at the end of every month but you have a chance to do better.

Zimbabwe dollars were mandated by law to be accepted, too. 


I would say that's about true. Gold isn't a currency either; base money may be a more correct way to describe both. But if Bitcoin can scale it could very easily be the new world reserve currency. If it can't scale, its still better than gold; albeit only slightly. I think of BTC like an IQ test. If you have way too much of it, you failed. If you don't have any, you failed.


How many of those rare things can be used by regular people to expatriate their net worth from China? I think this argument made more sense when it was 10 bucks and only traded on mtgox. 


Look, Bitcoin is a weird one. Most lifetimes don't see a new category of money start to take root. Maybe it fails, I don't know. But not owning any is insane if you do a risk adjusted calculation. If it fails, you go to zero. If it succeeds, we've got another 1000x+ in front of us over the next 50 years in purchasing power. I think more people will own it as a hedge just based on that line of reasoning. Miss Tesla? Great, catch the next one. Miss the new money we all use? Money is 1/2 of every transaction. There may be no next one.

I'll clarify. I disagree that anything has intrinsic value. Obviously things have a price; this is half of the equation though. If I don't value a Starbucks latte at 5 bucks then they have to change the price or I don't get to have their latte. None of this makes a latte intrinsically valuable. If you still disagree I'd like to know what you think intrinsic value means, exactly. 
Yes, there are probably more people who collect beanie babies. But beanie babies aren't fungible, can be seized, etc. There are categorically new things that you can do with Bitcoin and only with Bitcoin. You can't memorize a beanie baby and take it across any border you choose. You can't know if a beanie baby is authentic or not.
So. You may disagree with the price of Bitcoin, and that's fine, but its the far-and-away best network on which to do certain kinds of things that cannot be done otherwise. And if you don't find that valuable then whatever, you don't have to buy any. But many do think it is valuable.

You can't seize something if you can't prove someone has it. This is the same argument as "well exchanges got hacked so Bitcoin isn't hack proof." Incorrect. You can memorize a string of words that is worth billions of dollars. This was not true before Bitcoin. And if we invent mind reading we have bigger problems than monetary sovereignty. 


You are absolutely right that I am comparing the best case with the worst case. The best case of a bullet proof vest stops the worst case of a gun. Not everyone will have a gun pointed at them. Lets say 99.999% of people don't - this doesn't make bullet proof vests non-valuable. So if your argument is that Bitcoin costs too much for what it does... well, OK, you may be right. That's hard to judge and more up to the market than either of us to decide. But if you are arguing that Bitcoin has no value then I think you are wrong for the reasons I'm describing. 


Ya dollars are used for those things too. If you're going to do "bad things" you want to use the thing least possible for others to interact with to prevent you from doing "bad things." But there's no universal definition of bad things. In China free speech is a bad thing that you can't do. That Bitcoin has no overseers is the whole point. And all the other cryptos do suck, because of all the game theory involved. If you are running some proof of stake thing, you've taken out the bit where its expensive to generate a parallel shadow chain that you release when its convenient. If you're doing some XRP/Libra thing you can just seize or block traffics from all the nodes at the ISP level. Bitcoin is the only one with a hashrate that actually makes it immutable and censorship resistant. Its not perfect but its the closest one, and if it gets just a little bit bigger it will be truly unstoppable. I don't really see it as a payment network so much as a place to park your value, like people do with houses in London or gold or stocks. But its an easier calculation because its supply stays fixed while the population grows and we find new ways to mine gold, build new houses, and form new companies.

Banking works for a good number of people. Banking doesn't just mean sending money from A to B. It also means loans/credit, interest on holdings (not much), forex exchange, etc.

Look if you're bearish on Bitcoin don't buy any. It may go to zero, I don't know. I'm betting it goes higher not lower, though. Its in a ten year uptrend, so if you're guessing that doesn't continue during the next halving event, then you're guessing counter-trend. Sometimes counter-trend things happen. Not usually though.

Reread the article, this is exactly why their guidance is problematic. 
Taxes are due on forks and airdrops at the time of fork/air drop. Even if someone sweeps your funds, even if you didn't know you were airdropped a new token, the tokens being created - if you have access to them - is a taxable event for you.

He's just going to miss this one. And that's fine.
Bitcoin is a Swiss bank account for anyone, whether or not their government likes it. It is digital property rights where nobody can prove that you own the property. It is, hands down, the best way to expatriate your money from any country. Anyone who doesn't get why Bitcoin is a huge deal is missing understanding of something. And its hard to explain because you have to have pretty good mastery over game theory, cryptography, the history of money, politics, and probably a few other domains before it really clicks.

Ok, the Weimar republic then. All currencies not backed by anything inflate themselves to zero; remember that the British pound sterling was originally worth 12 ounces of silver. Whether it happens in 5 years or 50 aside.
Gold does zero transactions per second online and has a higher market cap than that of dollars. An on-chain transaction could cost 10k and Bitcoin would still make sense. I do not think people will use the lightning network at any point. But rather a custody solution that is itself underpinned by the lightning network. You can put a payment network on top of anything.
You can 100% convert your money from yuan to btc to dollars. Harder if you are worth billions, sure, but possible for millionaires at least.

@_date: 2019-10-25 00:32:30
Ok, lets do the math. There is about 3.9T of M1. There are 21M Bitcoin.
So if you own 21 BTC, you own 1/1 millionth of the total possible supply. Probably closer to double that since so much has been lost. But OK. To own 1/1 millionth of the total supply of USD, you'd need 3.9 million dollars. We're print about 150B a month in QE4, so in a few months you'll need 4 million USD to have 1/1 millionth of the total supply. This will continue for years to come. But there will only ever by 21 million BTC.

You are correct. Most people in most markets don't follow TA, they just buy or sell based on emotion or what CNN says. The "babble" is observations about when people sell based on emotion based on price action. It works _better_ in crypto because the investors in crypto are less sophisticated and because the market is thinner.
That you think its babble makes me think that you might have stayed in your position when we closed below the 200 day moving averages in early 2018. Because, you know, its all just babble. Look up fib retracements then look at 2018. Textbook. Which is great because most people haven't read the books. Gave the people who have lots of chances to get out.
@_date: 2019-10-25 14:30:45
Those are all arguments that have been addressed hundreds of times by hundreds of people now. You still have some weird fundamental misunderstanding of scarcity, too. Why stack sats? I don't know. Why stack dollars? I mean if Jeff Bezos has Billions of them, why should you care about 50k?
How you think of all this depends on why you think money has its value. If you think its coercion and men with guns, then no, none of this makes sense. Gold at 7T doesn't make any sense. Bitcoin doesn't make any sense. Only the U.S. dollar makes sense because we have the most men with the most guns.
If you think of these things as competing currencies then it makes more sense. Gold is 7T and inflates at 1.5% per year, but that inflation is nearly guaranteed to stay at that low rate and your counterparty risk is the trust others place in gold as a currency and that we don't find a huge pile at the bottom of the sea and change the inflation mechanics, things like this. But gold is natively physical, and using it in the modern economy requires trusting someone much smaller than a government not to rehypothecate or deny you access to your gold, etc. Or if you hold it physically you have to trust that someone will even want it. I can imagine a future where we pay for gas with Bitcoin on the Lightning Network. I cannot imagine a future where we pay for gas with flecks of gold on a scale at the register.
So the U.S. dollar has a market cap of about 3.8T and inflates at about 2.5% per year - higher inflation than gold and less market cap than gold. Gold, in this way, you can still think of as an international reserve currency, the existence of which keeps fiat moneys in line. This 2.5% inflation isn't an accident, its about as much as you can get away with without common folks noticing that prices are getting more expensive. So, OK, why do people hold money in it and not in gold? Well, first and foremost, they don't. More value is held in gold than in U.S. dollars. But more importantly it works fine for most people - it doesn't inflate at too high a rate, its natively digital, and any reasonable person will think that they can buy about as much stuff with it next year as they can this year. Your counterparty risk is counterfeit bills (negligible), that people will continue to want them (probable), that the Fed won't hyperinflate (hasn't so far - and if it does we're living in some kind of post apocalyptic world so why worry about it).
Well what is Bitcoin? Its natively digital and absolutely scarce. You don't have to trust that a Fed won't hyperinflate it. You don't have to trust that we won't find more of it at the bottom of the sea. You don't have to worry about your piece of the pie getting smaller over time. Your only concern is that people will continue to want it in the future - and since its competing with other currencies that don't have the properties it has I think this is a pretty safe bet. Altcoins don't have the network effects that Bitcoin has (neither in name recognition nor in actual on-the-internet processing power keeping those networks secure). And everyone looks at altcoins the same: "Ya, you should own some Bitcoin, but you should also own some xyz and abc" but everyone's xyz and abc is different. So you have this huge 2000 way venn diagram with Bitcoin in the middle. It has a bunch of other new-to-human properties too. You can reduce your net worth to a password you've memorized and nobody can prove you have it or don't have it. That's new. You can teleport it to anywhere on the planet instantly (more accurately, it exists everywhere and nowhere at once). That's new. You can program it. That's new. People who don't understand why Bitcoin is such a huge deal don't understand the internet. Yes, gold was money for 2000 years, but that was 2000 years where the internet didn't exist. The military used to have two domains of combat: land and sea. Then there were three: land, sea, and air. Then there were four: land, sea, air, and space. Now there are five: land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. If you think the internet is something that exists in the world then you are right, but only in strict semantics and not in implications. The internet is a completely new space where humans interact and a currency native to it is a huge deal.
And so that's why the paradigm is "different this time." Bitcoin isn't a company or some startup. Bitcoin is a new form of money. Bitcoin is a new form of money. Bitcoin is a new form of money. I said that three times so that maybe it will sink in a bit in its implications. What was the last new form of money? Like, new category of money. Gold? Then paper notes backed by gold? That's it, literally one invention in 10000+ years - and a shitty one at that, with paper notes that purported to be money; scarce because I say so. So its right that people are skeptical of it - they don't have anything "that its like" to point back to and see how it went last time. The last thing "that its like" is gold and that went pretty well. Now all that's left is to educate people on what money is and why Bitcoin matters. If you believe the theory in why people pick one monetary good over another, then Bitcoin isn't like the gun in how its going to change warfare; paper money might have been that. Bitcoin is thermonuclear weapons. And its not an investment per se, but at the same time its the investment opportunity of a lifetime (if it continues to gain adoption). More rare than that really - 99.999% of lifetimes do not see a new form of money, and money is half of every transaction.
It does not have to scale. It is a better gold than gold and does infinitely many more online transactions per second than gold ever will. You can put a payment network on top of anything, even BTC.

I'd need to go see what he was doing exactly. In my understanding of LN, he would need to sign every new transaction to invalidate old ones; so he'd know the most recent transaction because if he didn't, then the transaction didn't happen. Now if you lose your most recent transaction... then, ya, its kind of like losing your private keys. From skimming his transacript it sounds like he tried to use some kind of backup feature? Which, I don't know how that would work (and this is not me saying that it wouldn't).

I'll focus on what I think is your main argument. This notion of intrinsic value. First of all, I disagree that anything has intrinsic value. Nothing about a thing makes it valuable without humans with opinions to value it. Value is a negotiation between two or more valuers and depends on the worldview of the valuers, the context of the situation, and supply/demand. A chocolate bar is more valuable than a gold bar to a 5 year old. A glass of salt water has no value at sea. What's the title to a house worth in the Congo? Gold has an intrinsic number of atoms per mole but it does not have an intrinsic value. If it did, we could pull out a book somewhere, look it up, and all be forced to agree.
The intrinsic value of Bitcoin is the network of users that it has. People want it, whether or not you agree with them. You can send it without permission. It doesn't care about borders. Etc, etc. A bunch of stuff that I am sure you already know. What people don't seem to have a good grasp on is the fact that other blockchains do not have the same benefits of Bitcoin due to its hash rate or network effects. Every fork or competitor that I've seen so far that makes it "better" have really just failed to understand some part of the game theory and have created a weaker and less secure chain. The value intrinsic to Bitcoin is that its the one that is closest to delivering on its claims.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:10:37
Its also compounding. 2.5% per year makes the money supply double every 20 years. But printing money doesn't give it any velocity; real inflation comes all at once when people with lots of money start to lose faith and try to trade that money for hard assets. Printing 10T and putting it in an account doesn't matter. Printing 500B and giving it to someone who intends to spend it does matter.

The stock to flow ratio will soon be below that of gold and nobody can prove that you have or don't have Bitcoin. It is, hands down, the best way to store wealth where state actors are deliberately trying to change the rules to destroy wealth and transfer it to themselves. This is my thesis on why BTC does another hockeystick parabolic upswing. Maybe another 2 or 3 of them.
Its still a good investment because 95% of people don't understand it, and of the 5% that do, 95% of them don't want to wrap their money up in something political or have silly ideas about why gold is magic and why this snowball is about to start rolling back up hill.

Totally agree w/ all of that. 2x leverage is way too much for an asset that could realistically drop by 50%.

"The real problem with Bitcoin is whether it's a currency or an investment. It can't be both."
People who think this tend to think that dollars have some kind of divine right to be currency. Bitcoin is a kind of currency that has been around for a decade. Fiat is a kind of currency that have been around for 500 years. Gold is a kind of currency that has been around for millennia. Everything trades against everything. So if you are talking about the stability aspect of a currency, you have to say relative to what. If something can't become a currency that wasn't once a currency, then it is impossible that dollars were once not a currency and then became one, or that gold/silver were not once currencies but became them. They did, so you are wrong if you think this. Volatility is fine.
In block 1, 100% of the Bitcoin was held by one address. Its only been a decade, this may take another two decades for people to do all the things that absolute scarcity in an asset implies they will do. This next block reward halving may very well be a continuation of the bear market. But Bitcoin will be worth millions one day in any given fiat currency if for no other reason than that "millions one day" won't be much because we're going to keep printing more and inflation is a compounding.
Suppose Bitcoin tanks to 500 bucks? I'm going to have a boatload of it. Lots of other people who are like me will too. 
Suppose Bitcoin pumps to 20k? Everyone who thought we were going back to 500 will have to reevaluate because Bitcoin will be doing the opposite of what their world view predicted.
Long term bullish either way. Don't care how we get there.

BCH vs BTC is a shitty religion. Play both sides, nobody knows who the winner is going to be here. At best your turning your investments into sports betting if you think you've got it "figured out."

Why Monero and not Zcash? Why Zcash and not Dash? Why gold and not strontium 96?
Bitcoin is at the center of a 2000-way Venn diagram. "Ya, you should definitely own Bitcoin - but also gamble on these other 5 shitcoins that I bought a while back."
The question answers itself. Why Bitcoin? Because you're asking "why Bitcoin?" instead of "which cryptocurrency do I pick?" 
Strongest hashrate/most secure blockchain.
Longest existing blockchain.
On the news every other week.
Highest market cap.
Best development team.
The least centralized (and that's kind of the point).
Finally, its competing with the Fed and Gold for issuance policy. Not Venmo or PayPal for being a transaction network. You can put a payment network on top of anything. Being a store of value requires trust. I trust that BTC will be here in a decade. Monero... maybe? Probably? Hard to say. If LN works out it might not need to exist anymore. If you want to play penny slots, scroll to the bottom of CoinMarketCap and put 50 bucks into a dozen projects. If you want to expatriate your money from China, use Bitcoin. 
That's why Bitcoin.

Ya, totally. Like the other guy said though... there'd be a lot of buyers on the way down. Each new high brings with it a new floor. Bitcoin crashed from $30 down to $2 at one point; nobody expects it to ever see $2 again. Or $30 for that matter. Or $500... probably.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:39
Why don't they call Ethereum Classic just Ethereum? Because that's not what most people mean when they say Ethereum. If the market cap switches, then most people won't mean BTC when they say "Bitcoin" - they'll mean BCH.
P.S. however emotional you want to get about it, BCH is Bitcoin. So is BTG, for that matter. The only requirement for something to be Bitcoin is that it shares some common blockchain ancestry. Nobody gets to decide what flavor of Bitcoin is Bitcoin. The market decides that and its free to change its mind.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:12:12
Its much lower than that. As many as 35% are lost forever due to early mining/poor storage and another 5-10% or so are held by a small group of people. If Bitcoin is trading at 1M and you have 50 thousand of them, why would you ever cash out? So, maybe 12 million or so ever in circulation. Maybe 8 million in circulation now. And its safe to assume N% deflation per year due to death, carelessness, etc. Maybe .25%? Not sure, but not zero.

Ya, I could see that too. Different types of investors... acquiring way more of it. Right now there are lots of people putting in $500 hoping for the moon, maybe those people stop but we start getting billionaires putting 5% net worth in as a hedge against government control of money. Combined wealth of world's billionaires is ~6 trillion, so if 25% of them do this (that haven't yet) we're looking at a market cap increase of 150 billion just from them.

Quick, our arguments are losing on merit. Attack their character!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:52:00
My big concern is that there are two necessary transactions on-chain; if any part of the network degrades that will be a big spike to on-chain trading volumes.
Plus, its timelocked. So if you have a number of hostile nodes trying to disrupt the system they could create lots of transaction fees for people who use them.
Also, is it possible to create a multisig address and broadcast it to two lightning node operators to open channels and then doublespend (spend on each of their internal ledgers off-chain)?

I think that the on-chain bit of Bitcoin is overblown. I think that a completely workable situation is to think of on-chain Bitcoin like your government-proof savings account and services like Coinbase/Bitpay/whatever as your spending account. Like if your net worth is 10MM and you have 250k on Coinbase or whatever for spending at any given moment, transaction fees of a few hundred bucks are fine. However much it costs to expatriate your money from China, it will be cheaper using Bitcoin at almost any on-chain transaction rate (10 bucks, 10k, whatever the fees are it will mean that the network is big enough to justify those fees). 
I look at it as a hybrid payment network / store of value / investment. I think it will eat some but not all of the market share from all of those things, and that this is enough for it to grow quite a bit. And all it has to do to continue growing is to not be toppled by something else. Absolute scarcity is a weird thing and people seem to suck at thinking about the implications. I think that continues to play out with a few more bubbles as time passes. But if something really does topple it in market cap and stay there for any length of time, I think the jig is up. The idea of a digital store of value is dead because the detractors were right - its never safe to adopt because something "better" will just come along and wipe you out. I think this is unlikely though, but we'll see.

Don't try to time the market. If you are day trading, you should already know what to do or you shouldn't be day trading. If you are long Bitcoin, just buy some. You're as likely to get 10% less Bitcoin by waiting a week as you are to get 10% more. Also, hedge into Bitcoin Cash because there are some compelling arguments that it might steal the market in the next year. Might not, but might...
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:31:35
Ya, that's all in the weeds on where to draw the lines. If your position is that healthcare should be state sponsored, you can pick and choose data to make that seem super reasonable. If your position is that healthcare should be privatized, you can pick and choose data to make that seem super reasonable, too. I personally think that healthcare can't be a right because people aren't entitled to my labor, they are only entitled to me not interfering with their freedom. Suppose healthcare is a right, and literally zero people want to be doctors. Do we enslave people and force them to be doctors? It may sound absurd but we literally do this with the military because our rights don't matter if we can't defend them. If we're at war we will enslave people by drafting them if we don't have enough to conduct that war. From another angle, if you're 100, who should decide what health care is reasonable for you? What if you need a million dollar operation? I think healthcare is best left to the free market because everyone's health care requirements approach infinity as they age and if its all state sponsored, at some point, somebody has to say [insert reasonable sounding thing about how to deal with healthcare needs of the elderly] and life and death decisions like that shouldn't be up to politicians. Or imagine the very first heart transplant - after it was successful, you have maybe a dozen doctors even remotely qualified to do it and millions of people who need it. If healthcare is a right... then, what, the government decides who gets heart transplant number two? What if we invent nanobots and they're a buck a piece to create but with a billion of them they cure AIDS or whatever - and, you know, health care is a right, so... 
What makes the free market beautiful, to me, is that it sidesteps everyone's opinions. If we had to vote on whether or not to make Bitcoin, there'd be no Bitcoin. But we didn't - somebody just made it. And those who understood the value proposition before others reaped tons of rewards. Capital was successfully transferred from those who understood t he world and were able to create and adopt something new and positive from those who didn't quite see it yet. Ya, some people are born rich, fine. Some people are also Elon Musk.
Capitalism isn't a fair way to distribute healthcare, but Socialism can't be either. It seems, to me, like Capitalism is a more fair way to distribute it because those who add value to the system and create wealth for themselves get to have as much of it as they want. And there's a great profit motive for providing more of it, to more people, cheaper. You lose that if healthcare is a right. Just my opinion.

I think the first organization to put, say, 100k BTC up in a channel and allow everyone to connect to them for like .01% of the account value per month (then to transact for free) has a real good shot at being one of the internet banks of the future. Question is jurisdiction and who would risk so much BTC...

"The IRS explained that receipt of cryptocurrency from an airdrop generally occurs when it is recorded on the new distributed ledger, but receipt for tax purposes may occur later or, constructively, earlier, depending on when the taxpayer is able to exercise dominion and control over the new cryptocurrency. For example, an airdropped cryptocurrency might not be immediately credited to a taxpayer’s account at a cryptocurrency exchange that does not yet support that cryptocurrency. In that case, the taxpayer is treated as receiving the cryptocurrency later, once it is credited to the taxpayer’s account and the taxpayer is able to transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of it."
tl;dr - if there is a fork and you can control your new coins, its a taxable event.
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:50:40

I think whatever your currency is, psychologically, you should be able to buy a cheap meal for 1 to 100 units of it. I also think the terms shouldn't be laden with science. We're early adopters. To us, mili-this and centi-that is perfectly normal. If you're in Africa and your village has a phone and that phone is the bank, its better to abstract away as much implementation detail and science as possible (including the ways in which we speak about it).
If you need to know about the metric system or what a distributed ledger is to use bitcoin, then bitcoin is not going to be as widely adopted as it could be. If all you need to know is that your phone says you have 100,000 Satoshi and that a gallon of clean water costs 3000 Satoshi, we're doing OK. But it'd be better if your phone told you that you had 100 Naka and that 3 Naka was enough for a gallon of clean water (completely fictitious example to illustrate the point).

Its different because there's no counter-party risk. I think the topology of LN nodes must be hub and spoke for it to actually work. Some nodes are going to be much bigger than others, because there will be much more value in connecting to big nodes than to small nodes. So. Call them banks, supernodes, cryptomammoths for all it matters. Bank is probably not quite right because there is no real KYC or counter-party risk.

No major country is purely anything; socialism and capitalism exist on a spectrum. In a purely socialist society, the state would own all businesses. In a purely capitalist society, all businesses would be private (including police, libraries, etc). Its obvious to most people that pure versions of either can't work; socialism is great at distributing things but terrible at creating them. Capitalism is great at creating things but terrible at distributing them.
So usually when people say that they want "socialism" what they really mean is that they want to go further towards that end of the spectrum. Nobody that we need to take seriously wants your kids to have to distribute profits of their lemonade stand as a matter of law. Likewise nobody that we need to take seriously wants to privatize the military. The real argument is how we tune the dial in that spectrum.
With that out of the way we can say some interesting things. Look at economic freedom: 
"Economic freedom, or economic liberty, is the ability of people of a society to take economic actions."
I think we can agree that if you are not permitted by the state to start, say, a private medical clinic, you are less economically free than if you were able to do this.
From there, we can look at the index of economic freedom on a country-by-country basis. Its easy to conclude a few things: Scandinavian countries are economically free, despite whomever calling them "socialist" for whatever reasons. Countries that identify as Socialist are at the bottom of this list:
If you can cross the bridge and think that "more economically free = capitalist, less economically free = socialist" then agree, rationally, that we'd all rather live in a country on the top half of the economic freedom index than the bottom half, you can see why so many are members of "the cult of capitalism" even if its obvious on its face that pure capitalism (privatize the military) cannot work.

I like how your list has strictly pro-BTC arguments against strictly negative BCH arguments.
I also like how you list potential scaling problems as a con for BCH. As opposed to what? The actual scaling problems that BTC has now?
I'm 50/50 in both; if your treating Bitcoin like a religion... well, you're taking a much bigger risk than you have to.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:44:20
I don't know if I agree with this. Dumping 25k worth of BTC all at once could spike the BCH price and enact the flip. There's always going to be resistance at the bottom for BTC because it has the branding, but if BCH popped to 4k and BTC tanked to 2k from his trading (and all the panic buys / panic sells from the market movement)... well its all over for BTC, the only miners left would be ideologues who are OK with burning money for an ideal (few, I'd imagine). In a few months we could be calling BCH Bitcoin and BTC Bitcoin Classic.

I like your price predictions. I think that once we pass 20k we're probably weeks away from 30k-40k (who knows if it is 2020 or 2024). At that point a lot of people who assumed it had died already will have to take another hard look at it, and those with the liquidity and ability to get in aren't going to wait for them to play catch up. Same as 2017 when it passed 1k again.
Also 2nd Tone Vays. Dude gets a LOT of hate from people who pick and choose his calls. Just have to take his calls with the grain of salt that his primary motivation is wealth conservation, not gambling on every little top and bottom. If you got bullish the last time he flipped to bullish and bearish the last time he flipped bearish then you bought at like 800 and sold at like 14k (in 2018) and missed a whole lot of chop and freed your capital to grow in other assets. The vast majority did not do this well.

Are there examples of banned videos where the content didn't outright or vaguely suggest that prices were going to go up? Because if they are just banning lots of feel-good pumper videos I'm fine with it. If they are banning news I'm not fine with it. Price predictions are not news and if we avoid another BitConnect at the price of people having to learn TA elsewhere, great. This next bubble is going to wreck WAY more people IMO and its not great to see people lose their houses/etc over something they didn't understand.

I think this is the wrong question. Bitcoin isn't a kind of investment, its a kind of money. Its one I personally think every portfolio should have some exposure to. You should also have some small exposure to gold and U.S. dollars in your cash position, which is maybe 25% of your total net worth portfolio. Have maybe 25% of it be Bitcoin, 25% gold and 50% U.S. dollars). So if you're worth in total 100k excluding your home, have maybe 6.25k in Bitcoin, 6.25k in gold, and 12.5k in dollars just in case, then the rest in more traditional investments.
These are all numbers that make sense for some but not others. You do you. Not financial advice.

This. There are 2^256 possible outputs for a SHA256 hash. This is on the order of 10^80, which is just less than the number of atoms in the observable universe. 
However the other way to look at it is through the lens of the birthday paradox. You don't have to find a match for some particular output if all you care about is that each output not match any other output. Even then, though, you're looking at odds of around 1 in 10^38. 
So, the first part of the question: never. We will never generate all possible hashes. To the second part: never, we will never see collisions even if we look at the whole set of outputs.
Right now we are hashing at about 10^19 hashes per second or about 10^28 hashes per year. Lets call it 10^31 to give the network 1000x room to grow (we're spending most of the Earth's energy to mine Bitcoin at this point - maybe more, here I did not do the math). That's still 10^7 years of hashing for a 50% chance of collision, 10^6 years for a 1% chance of collision, 10^4 years for a 1 in 1 million chance of collision, and a one in one trillion chance per year of a collision otherwise (again, all this if we start hashing at 1000x our current rate tomorrow).

Those mining costs take into account lots of things and are costs to mine one Bitcoin in aggregate. Starting from zero, there's no way you could mine exactly one Bitcoin at that price. Much of that price is pulled down by the economics of scale and often those prices only factor for electricity cost ignoring all the other costs of running a mining business. 
You have to have cheap electricity, which not everyone does. You need to have a facility with good cooling. You need to have staff to maintain the hardware. Security to guard it. Part replacement costs, etc. Lots of hidden fees in there.
The big thing people don't seem to get, though, is the time value of money and the mechanics of Bitcoin. You can't take even a hundred trillion dollars and go mine 1,000,000 Bitcoins tomorrow or in the next week. And when you start mining you take on the risk that all of the math changes as more miners enter the space. And there are setup costs and costs to your personal time. Set up a mining farm? Months of your time. Buy 5,000 Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio if you're a family wealth manager or whatever? Minutes of your time.

How is it that something won't come along and replace gold as a unit of account? Eventually we'll discover rarer metals and those rarer metals will outcompete gold because it will be easier to transfer more value for cheaper fees (easier to carry 5 grams of strontium 96 than 100 oz of gold).
You are making a common category error. These are stores of value enabled by technology, not technology that happens to store value. Bitcoin is a categorically new kind of money. There's metal money - gold. Fiat money - pick your poison. And now there's natively digital money - Bitcoin, et al. When people talk about cryptocurrencies, it usually goes like this: "well obviously you should have some Bitcoin, but you should also gamble on these other 5 shitcoins I bought a while ago." Bitcoin is the commonality, the center of the 2000-way Venn diagram. Suppose something replaced Bitcoin. How did that go? What did everyone choose? Did they all, what, collapse to XRP? Dash? Monero? Why one over the other? Which one, exactly, will everyone all of a sudden realize is better than Bitcoin and also better than all the other competitors that are better than Bitcoin?
Nah, I don't think so. Bitcoin isn't competing with Venmo and PayPal for transaction fees. Its competing with gold and the Fed for policy around scarcity. It may seem silly, but you can put a payment network on top of anything. Dollars. Gold. Bitcoin. Bitcoin is weird because it is, itself, a payment network along with being a store of value. But the store of value component is wildly more interesting. You can buy coffee with gold without ever physically carrying gold, likewise you can buy coffee with Bitcoin without ever settling on the base chain. Lightning network, side chains, custody solutions, etc.

It will never be as easy as on-chain. Its on-chain with extra steps.
Eventually, though, all of that will be abstracted from end-users. Its already getting there. I think it will be a bigger and bigger story once adoption starts to pick up and transaction fees rise again. But right now, with fees relatively low, transacting on the lightning network is strictly worse than transacting on-chain (albeit marginally so).

I see it like the China trade deal. Trump can never call that good, otherwise he loses the bait for the market. The uncertainty is, in a weird way, good for the market. Stocks down? Trade deal is close! Stocks up? Cool!
Likewise with Bitcoin. Bitcoin down? BAKKT is close! Bitcoin up? Cool!
But now BAKKT is live and the hopium is gone and everyone has to come to the realization that the effects of BAKKT might take a few years to play out. Institutions that wanted BTC (and can even hold the stuff) weren't waiting for BAKKT.

Pick the first half of Bitcoin's life. There were tons of models that fit, until they didn't. Some said we'd be at a million bucks by now - because hey, the model. Finding a model that fits the current data isn't hard, and with Bitcoin there's not yet enough data to use a model predictively. Still bullish long term, short term who knows. Here's a prediction: up and to the right. But first maybe something else.

There is a direct correlation between the current market and the 2013-2015 market where it bounced around between 200 and 1000. Except now it will bounce around between 5000 and 10000. A few hundred days until the next halving, then a few hundred more for the mechanics of that halving to take root.
Plenty of time for the trend of "Bitcoin pumps, alts pump a little, Bitcoin tanks, alts tank a lot" to send all the shitcoins back down near zero and make it clear to those not yet in the space that these aren't just interchangeable and that Bitcoin is, actually, special.

Maybe, I mean you can't just blindly do it. You have to know a bit about TA, moving averages, previous support and resistance, etc. Most of the time I'll admit I don't know what its going to do next. But right now its clear to me that there is tons of support in the 6.5k area. A while back it was clear to me that once we broke 10k we were going at least to 12-13k.

I will say, you can reverse scalp on days when the price is obviously tanking and breaking supports. Like put in a sell order at 7800 and a buy at 7700 (gambling that if we hit the first we'll quickly hit the second). 
Most assets take the stairs up and the elevator down. Bitcoin takes the elevator up then jumps off the roof. But you can use that, if you're clever about it. Just think about dollars as the thing you are buying and selling, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the hard money (whether people get it or not yet).
