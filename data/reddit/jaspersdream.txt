I offered cause even if he has the code to run he may not know how to read and run code since is used through terminal, unless you know how to set it all up and get it going?

   - word pairs like "build" and "built", "woman" and "women", or "quick" and "quickly"
     not only make remembering the sentence difficult, but are also more error
     prone and more difficult to guess
Think pairs :/ ????
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:42:45
Yes but I was also referring to the people that are asking what a seed or paraphrase is even for or the fact that they don’t know what to do or where to try the words that they think, just saying. I get starting more wallets to block traces :) 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:10:53
Good fun tho I been at it 4hr a day minimum loll since the first day
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:39:55
hmm i tried corresponding the numbers with the numbered bips on but didnt find what i was looking for.. maybe of use to someone else..
 
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:06:44
I presumed you use the paraphrase and it would restore the wallet ?
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:14:16
Yeah a decent lot of holdings 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:50:01
Dunno did you have any leads that you wanted to share or try :) like ideas ? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:23:56
You enter it in a wallet and claim your prize do you even crypto ?
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:06:37
I will attain that if you stare long enough you’ll see ANDY written on the bottom //hence to infinity and beyond// I mean it may not be there but if you stare at the picture long enough you never know what you’ll see ����

Go bitcoin.org/white paper 
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:30:34
Finances are secured if the user has a paraphrase set, this whole puzzle shows how secure BTC wallets are there’s over 10k trying to brute force their way in, while the answers are all in front of them, so having your finances traced back to you will do what igsactly you leave yourself open to attacks that’s on you ? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:16:56
It’s 2am and I’m brute force cracking my way in &gt;:D with the words I have I’m sure I’m close, can’t be too far off surely. Let this run all night see In the morning I guess.
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:06:46
Sounds good free anytime now onwards 
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:22:39
I know where I’m meant to be focusing ���� oh im close.. the hints match what I’m finding.. anyone else think there close flick a message, only if you got something to bring to the table. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:22:29
I don’t mind people adding their BTC address at the bottom I just think it shows that enough aren’t even using the wallets, crypto bot links your wallet and it’s sad to show that your wallets empty but further more you’ve had no transactions on it, you support crypto but don’t use it hmm ��
Best of luck to those helping tho cheers, I don’t think I’m far off ��
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:41:47
I figured but it’s worth a crack, just how I think it goes based off the dates ;) 
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:48:41
Using a brute force python3 script with 28 bip words and imputed phase findings :) can pm if your using Linux to host the script, you’ll probably want to know code tho, simple but confusing. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:16:09
I’ve been learning a lot, and tbh if I don’t win I feel like this puzzle has been important to me to understanding crypto better in depth, like I’ve been in crypto quite a while now but not as deep, I feel like I’m making progress but also having fun researching a lot different things.
I’ve learnt about bip32, mnemonics and the importance, I’m come to understand how “Safe” btc can be, Ive learnt bruteforce cracking better, more about transaction tracing and a bunch of other cool shit, really appreciate the effort and thought put into the puzzle by the op and hopefully we get another puzzle out of it, reward even if crowd funded would be awesome. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:41:36
Your not on the write path for the clues then... 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:07:49
Yeah an 20k the other month you kinda sound like a weak handed panic seller 
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:50:04
Although he also never said they were in the right order like someone linked me to the Forest Finn treasure the other night, he refers to them being able to find it if they started in the right order, the maps there’s thus the answer also. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:13:47
Ohkay new thought anyone tried to font size organise the words ?  
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:29:25
Ummmm no... lol 
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:40:26
I think that this also has to do with transactions being so big and also “honest block” being written the way is, I think that we need a sentence not written in bip which leads to the bip answer 
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:58:33
The fact that the extra prizes hidden amongst this is confusing, there’s certain wallet seeds in here that will lead up in the write direction but also give the OP the heads up someone is close. 
I think that to infinity and beyond leads to the X cuts the “map” in half, with the =&gt; which lines up with the cuts leads to answer in this half.
The +1 and -1 is talking about blocks when someone is attacking them, this is the original hint given In the INSTRUCTIONS that the puzzle lead back to the underlying security features.
This also leads me other facts another hint which I’m keeping quite on..
But yet again it leads back to private and public key(‘s) which I have a strong feeling is in the seed (pairs but also oppersites).
I tried matching the dates and other numbers to their assigned bip32 words, but this I felt let me down.
Tried running brute force on the words I felt most inclined with (still running nothing so far, can pass on details in pm if y’all request it (Linux)) 
Clue four leads to what I was saying before about keys and also I think paper is a seed word in their for some reason.
Clue 7 I’m not to sure on.
Clue 3 I’m sure has to do with being written in C
Hmm idk throwing ideas up, like or don’t :) 
00212121 backwards gives the hexidecimal 0xb8f470
Which may also be of use
Not all clues may be in the right order 
Pm if you want to try share thoughts 
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:30:20
Hmm I did think about that but also didn’t wanna mess to far with it 
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:40:54
Also a common font tho 
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:13:37
Which leads to my other thought which order do the clues go 
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:08:35
Flick a pm then and drop a hint ahh, it’s 1am here and I got work at 7am rofl 
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:22:11
201 mean anything to anyone ��
And why is the c in cpu
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:36:49
I’m not 100% sure not at my laptop atm but it’s no to close to the router so isn’t running to High, still a checking I think 1k seeds (invalid) per 50s or so coming back with say 5-10 valid’s per batch then writes to excel :) still getting use to it and will make some tweaks 
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:14:46
If I’m using the bip32 mnemonic part on iancolemans site and I enter in part of my words and it’s coming up with wallets as I change words am I close ?? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:33:03
Also missing the x marks home or whatever it says also 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:02:25
Had tried running these words via brute force with paraphrase set sections to no avail once I get a close phrase and less to brute force it’ll crack 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:47:38
did anyone see the guys wallet total balance whom added to the pot... 
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:00:23
Why is try almost open in 9/11/12 ? Couldn’t see why that would go in those slots. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:15:54
Yeah that was my thought, but attack early is also in a c 
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:34:39
I believe that has to do with the “lost transactions costs ALMOST users”, odd way of saying it 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:41:33
anyone looked into it being a hashed SHA256?  marks the spot and -1 is 256.. maybe thinking its a puzzle inside a puzzle ?
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:37:19
Could be a hash ? 
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:05:29
Links?
