More FUD. The subpoenas were issued almost 2 months ago. Bloomberg has already updated with the Dec. 6th issuance date.

It makes it go down. Short sellers exert downward pressure on the price. They "borrow" BTC selling it expecting to buy it lower and then repay those BTC to the lender after covering their short position. I think futures trading is going to initially bring increased volatility and some vicious short squeeze action.

Can you explain this statement in simpler layman terms?

This is not true in the U.S. Under section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code a taxpayer is allowed to exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint return filers) of the gain from the sale (or exchange) of property owned and used as a principal residence for at least two of the five years before the sale.

I was trying to explain the short concept in simple terms. I wasn't speaking literally as to how short positions in futures contracts are created. The whole concept of a futures contract is that it is a derivative transaction with no underlying asset or obligation to deliver or accept an asset/commodity/share/coin. The point here is that for the first time in BTC's trading history we are about to see the ability to short BTC in volume never seen before due solely to BTC being traded on futures exchanges.

Paragraph one is the very definition of a weak hand.
Paragraph two is the very definition of FOMO with a sprinkle of weak hand fairy dust.
Paragraph three is pretending you know what it takes to be a day trader.
Paragraph four should be the only paragraph in the post.

True in absolute terms but they are net sellers for as long as they hold their short position. That could be a short or long term time frame until they cover and net out their short position.

Congrats. I'm on my way to joining. Plan to get to the 21 club before I buy any more alts. Thinking about dumping my ETN once my ICO wallet gets released and then flipping it into bitcoin.

I'm worried that there is big institutional money out there seeing BTC as the GOAT short play. Futures contracts will enable them to execute those short positions.

What hourly rate are you willing to pay to pursue this cause of action? Or are you looking for a contingency relationship? Can't decide whether to invest in your cause of action or just buy more BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:41
Buy more. This is a ghostbusters crossing the streams event. It'll shake out just fine. Bch up 6k in minutes? Short half life for Bch up here.

My plan has been and continues to be to just keep buying little bits and pieces to slowly and patiently accumulate.
