Except when you reply some angry shit to some kid on youtube and then 10 years from now its used against you. With this also comes censorship, people will be less likely to discuss controversial topics out of fear.

I wish I could have but its taking Quadriga forever to verify my info and I already maxed my weekly coinbase limit.

You must have been sending bitcoin from coinbase to somewhere against their rules such as: HYIP's, gambling websites, etc. If you read their rules they can disable your account for doing that stuff. If you must do sketchy stuff then I suggest you send your funds to blockchain.info first.

Get a paper wallet, keeping it on an exchange is riskey since technically you don't own the bitcoin and if they get compromised its all gone.

That's okay man, you're not alone. Forget the past because it can't be changed. A guy I know bought a bunch back in 2011 and he ended up selling it for really cheap, I'm sure he beats himself up everyday too.

See this is the damn problem, any reasoning you can come up with in your head to buy buy buy you come up with just as many reasons to not
