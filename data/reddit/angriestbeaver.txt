Well, if you're a far right nationalist who's against Democracy and discriminates against non-white and secularists, then I'd see why you'd have a problem with the charity. Oh yes, you probably think public education is "liberal brainwashing". Tough titties.

I'm in agreement we should overturn citizens united end money in politics.

There's nothing. Just an anti-semitic conspiracy theory peddled on a couple subreddits known for making up bullshit and have a loose grip on reality. I'll let you guess which ones. The irony is he's one of the more philanthropic billionaires.

I don't know enough about JP to criticize him. If he helps some people to better their lives, fantastic. As has been pointed out several times in this post and cited, he often has contradicting stances. The climate science denial is a huge red flag too. When it was brought up, you went full tirade.
 "Climate change isn't gospel, why can't we question it? It's almost like you don't want it to be questioned"
He's not a climate scientist. As far as I know, he doesn't have any degrees in any hard sciences. It doesn't mean he's not smart or capable in his field, but on some topics, he is clearly acting pseudo-intellectual.

The irony here is you're defending JP in the same religious way you're accusing him of. I don't know much about JP, but people who follow him closely really can't take criticism and project a ton of insecurity in my experience.

Well, those people are assholes. I don't know what to tell you. I don't think u/cryptonewsguy is one of those assholes though.
