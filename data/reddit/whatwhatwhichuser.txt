That is hilarious!

I think that website is being hit hard. It's just showing me a fork... lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:30:23
I see. How come miners switch to BTH to mine an alt? Surely it's cheaper to mine ETH or LTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:19:14
How are they fucked if they moved to BCH, made gains and then moved back to BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:12:54
who is big will?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:21:30
That's what LTC is for!
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:11:42
LTC seems more steady. I don't give financial recommendations though.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:26
Any good videos on limits and stops using gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:32:26
I can buy her? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:11:18
Hmm... I am normally good at hodling but this time... this time feels different
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:24:50
why 300%
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:43:46
Why are these tx even legit/allowed?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:23:06
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:29:42
What's causing people to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:18:02
usd or eur?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:14:23
so basically at any price..  If it holds, then it'll bounce. If not, it'll go lower.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:42
I'd give BTC. Giving BitcoinCash would be like if your Aunt knew you liked ActionMan but got you some random toy instead thinking it was the same
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:18:58
Wow haha thats a dumbass bug
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:19:43
You can't unfortunately. It would only work if you bought before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:00
By who? How are they doing empty tx? Are they paying fees?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:33
Before you buy next time, zoom out, make sure the price isn't an ATH
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:45
How about now??
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:31:26
I'm not signed up for any way to buy BTH and I am going to bed now.. lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:36:32
10 full bucks?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:42:13
how much?
