It's ok.

They needed much more than $40.000. I'm not saying the community didn't help in a significant way, they just weren't the only ones.

Other sources state 80-120.000 would be the total amount necessary, they used donations to fill in the gap.

The Dogecoin community donated only a part of the money needed.
That being said, the community is nice.

It's just kinda ignorant to go claiming Dogecoin 'sent two teams to the Olympics'.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:47:48
I've been supporting Dogecoin from the start, I'm just annoyed that some people claim the community was the sole reason (yes y'all make it sound like that) the team got enough funding.

You're talking about inflation as a result of coins being added. What about inflation because of greed (people asking more for the same product because it's selling well) ?
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:12:29
As you said, inflation is based on CPI, so how could CPI outpace inflation?
All I was trying to say is that Bitcoin is not immune to the underlying factors of inflation, which include more than just quantitative easing. 
You're arguing that inflation is solely related to the amout of currency available. I guess that's just where we'll have to agree to disagree.
EDIT: Just some links, food for thought

Price elasticity is a microeconomic event that contributes to general inflation. Like I said: Inflation doesn't happen by magic, and it's not only caused by quantitive easing.
If prices of products go up, that's inflation. You can single out a product and analyze why it became more expensive. It might be a higher profit margin without cutting costs. For another product it might be because resources became more expensive. 
But in the end, when we take a holistic look, we see inflation.

Which also causes (derived) inflation. 
EDIT: Maybe I'll clarify myself. People say Bitcoin will be immune to inflation because no new coins will be created. The quantity of coins is just one part of inflation.

Sure, but isn't it a bit weird to talk about BTC's immunity to inflation when it will only happen in extreme cases. If BTC would become a world wide standard coin then yes. But let's face it, that's not a question of when. And it would mean a whole set of different problems.
My whole point of these comments were to discuss the different situations in which inflation with BTC can happen. Inflation is not only determined by the quantity of available coins. 
Inflation is also something that doesn't happen magically. It's a macro economic effect which has micro economic causes, such as greed.

But how will the buying power change? If the price of a coin goes up then you need more local currency to buy the same goods. Meaning inflation. The buying power is still linked to local currencies. Meaning that bitcoin itself doesn't have intrinsic buying power as its linked to the buying power of another currency. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:13:22
So what if I want to charge more money for the same product just because I can? Because that's also a cause of general inflation.

You are correct when talking about usd. But what if something is worth 1 btc at $250 and the next year it's worth 1 btc at $252.5. That 1% can be considered inflation as ultimately the price of the product went up even though it's still 1 btc
