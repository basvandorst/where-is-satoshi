Nice ad hominem.
You still haven't told me why they are incorrect other than them being "unnecessary" and "stylistically unattractive".
Many grammatically correct phrases are unnecessary. 
Edit: I looked at your history
[error 1: spelled and spelt are both valid](
[error 2: something can't be "super unique".  Unique means "one-of-a-kind".](
[error 3:"has college figured out" means that he understands college](
[error 4 &amp; 5: "It's" is a contraction for "it is". "It's" is possessive. "Can't" is a contraction and requires and apostrophe] (
[error 6: "Know that's its" should be "know that it's"]( (This one might be a typo)
[error 7: "Your" should be "you're".](
[error 8: "You're" should be "your".](
[error 9: "Your" should be "you're".](
[error 10: The second "you're" should be "your".](
I can keep going if you like.
Based on the ad hominems and anger present in many of your comments, I have deduced that you are either 14 years old and/or need some sort of medical treatment.

What? I've known about "firstly", "secondly" for years. "First" and "second" are superior choices in my opinion, but that doesn't change the fact that using "firstly" is grammatically correct.
Why did you use "enumerating" instead of "listing"? "Listing" is a perfectly good word.
Style and grammar are two different things.

"Firstly" is a valid word...
As is "secondly", "thirdly", "fourthly", etc.

Reads like a penis enhancer ad.
