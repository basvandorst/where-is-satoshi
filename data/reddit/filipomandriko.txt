So bitcoin is unusable.  NICE!  That's how you get it to grow.  That's for sure.

Lightning requires bigger blocks therefore we have to have bigger blocks. Simple.  Anyone who says different has no plan for bitcoin to scale and wants it to fail.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:43:51
If they never get in a block then they don't exist other than in private databases...PERIOD.  
Transactions HAVE TO GO IN A BLOCK EVENTUALLY.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:44:52
No, you've just bought into NULLC insanity.  Core wants to destroy bitcoin.   Dont' worry though...the alts are coming.  Blockstream has done their job and bitcoin will be surpassed and forgotten.
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:37:03
You're just pushing propaganda to get Bitcoin to fail.  Lightning requires larger blocks so you HAVE TO HAVE LARGER BLOCKS.  PERIOD.  That's all there is to that.  
Let's say you could put as many transactions as you like in 1MB which is absurd...when is Lightning getting here?  
So now you have a solution that will never arrive that requires larger blocks anyhow.  Jesus don't be daft. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:43:04


Ok...but still those offchain solutions HAVE TO BE PUT ON CHAIN!!  So they aren't even real solutions.

How are you getting 400 bitcoin total?
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:40:17
It's too late for that.  That wasn't in the original agreement and we're past the trust thresh hold with Core.  They are a private company that screwed over miners and everyone once and will do it again and again.  
Honestly I don't care as much every day because I've decided it's likely too late anyhow and have diversified over half of my bitcoins into alts.  
If bitcoin ever sees above a 2k price I'll be shocked truthfully.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:19:20
Also, truth is, there's NO FUCKING NEED TO HANG ON TO TRANSACTIONS FOREVER.  Hash them at certain checkpoints and fuck them...done.  If people want to hold onto them, they can.  If the hash matches up...you know it's valid.  Easy.  
Now bring on the fucking large blocks so we can move on.
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:31:17
This is just...embarrassing.  Also, the finite argument doesn't work because bitcoin can be infinitely divisible if it needs to be.  You could NEVER have that easily in the past.
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:29:14
Even Core admits Lightning is going to require MUCH larger blocks.  You don't even know what you represent dumb ass.  
Most people have sold a portion of their bitcoin.  If Core had followed through with the Hong Kong agreement, Bitcoin would be pushing well over 2k now.
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:37:58
IT STILL REQUIRES LARGER BLOCKS.  What is with you people?
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:14:47
What numbers, your dumb ass blockchain space numbers?  Yeah...I addressed that off the fucking bat.  There is absolutely no need to hold onto old ass transactions.  None, you hash the blockchain at a certain height and discard it.  Done.  There's no need to hold on to old useless data.  If someone wants to hold onto that, they can but do it on their own...just check it against the hashes at whatever height they're holding onto.
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:38:46
Well since it doesn't exist.  It doesn't work to be honest with you.  But yes, I understand the concept behind payment channels.  STILL IT REQUIRES LARGER BLOCKS.  
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:08:18
Payment channels DO NOT require Segwit.  Sorry, strawman.  Also, AS I KEEP SAYING, Lightning STILL REQUIRES LARGER BLOCKS.  
So, here's what's GOING to happen, either unlimited goes through or bitcoin fails.  Period.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:17:24
All transactions must eventually go in a block therefore the blocksize HAS to increase.  Anyone that says differently is a liar.  Period.
