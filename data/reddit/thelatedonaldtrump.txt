If you want to sell products and receive Bitcoin for it, Bitcoin Cash is your only option. Unless you sell diamonds or something so expensive that a 20 - 30 dollar fee per transaction is not a problem. 
Or you can wait until Bitcoin Core also increases the blocksize.

Yeah well when you starter hodling at 5 usd or you started hodling at 20 000 usd that kinds of  different. One hodler is not one hodler. When you started hodling is what matters. If you start holding when Bitcoin is worth 10 000 000 dollars per coin you are probably not going to get rich of Bitcoin.  And Bitcoin got value at first buy somebody willing to buy two pizza's with 10 000 BTC and then people willing to buy it to use it to buy drugs with. That's how the value took of, that was people NOT hodling at all. So if everybody hodles then it does not work.  So everybody that comes after me needs to hodl stronger than me so I can sleep at night ... and you can carry the burden. That's what hodling is really about.

That would mean trying to steal the OpenBazaar brand like how Bitcoin Cash tried to steal the Bitcoin brand?

0 confirmations so far on the banchain. Reddit needs at least 1.

Oh yeah I forgot that saying something negative about BTC should be a bannable offense.  Something like:  "I think BTC will not make a better world". Now let's see if I get banned for it.

Bitcoin vets would have learned from MtGox 2013 and sold around at least a good chunk of  coins between 15 000 and 20 000 either after 15 000 and before the 20 000 or before it went down below 15 000 again. When MtGox started buying up coins to pay back customers their coins the price went from 200 to 1000 in a very short time. If your objective is to get as many Bitcoin as possible, it's very rational to sell at high points and buy back more at low points. Bitcoin will always have value and the target is like a million per coin or some but there is really no law saying it will never drop back down below a certain point. Getting to that million point can take 20 years because crazy unexpected stuff can happen in the future that nobody ever thought was possible. You know like bcash taking over or something. It's totally insane and realistically speaking it can not happen. But people also thought they would see aliens land on earth before Trump would get president.

Why are you trolling? 
The date on that tx is yesterday.

Bitcoin is a currency and payment system, not an investment. When everybody believes that BItcoin is an investment and acts on that belief that Bitcoin will go to zero.

I would give you 5 USD in BTC for boldly speaking the truth but this sub banned the bot I have the account with. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:53:14
Yeah because nobody lost money the last time there was a drop. Back in those days it was just a game played with fake money.

I have said this many times before but Bitcoin is bleeding edge technology and is not ment to be used at this stage by every dumbwit on the internet. Leave Bitcoin usages to the people that know what they are doing. Eventually Bitcoin in maybe 5 or 10 years will reach maturity. Until then use other crypto or maybe just use fiat.  Bitcoin development is very hard to do right and we can only do it right once. So your other crypto won't survive the unknown future, hell even fiat won't survive. But Brother Bitcoin, you can always count on him.  If we have to go slow we have to go slow. Better to do it right the first time then to be a shitcoin. Amirite? And for the less fortunate users there is always paypal and visa.

Actually if you are really smart you can beat roulette very easily. See here is how it works, every time you loose you play again but double the investment. Eventually this means that you will be able to buy a Lambo. Because of math. Same with Bitcoin, it works because of math .. and so it's mathematically impossible for Bitcoin to crash down to zero. What we see now is a very healthy correction, In the next couple of months bitcoin will got to 40 and 50K because it's in the algorithm. All this FUD is really sad.
