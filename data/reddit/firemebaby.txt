Unfortunately it's always been my belief that decentralized democracy always leads toward centralization. People just naturally don't like democracy and always push for centralized overhead to push their agendas.
Bitcoin could thrive, but it relies on people actually believing in the economic principles, which won't happen.

Not really. Crypto is new and 99% of investors don't really understand it. It's like realizing that rocks could be used as money.
For a while everyone is going to use everything, but gold and silver stand out for their unique properties. And even if something better comes up after that, gold and silver will still maintain value since "value" is just a socially accepted norm.
Let people understand and use crypto more, we will see a convergence on the primary coins.

Transaction fee highs are temporary, and driven solely by supply and demand. You're paying for the computing power to remain anonymous and ensure proof of transaction. This will change after the UASF.
I see no reason who BTC can't replace Fiat. You can live solely on BTC now, and even if a tiny section of the economy starts using crypto it will be possible to use BTC without ever converting to Fiat. This will force price stabilization.

They have more real value than Fiat. I don't want to compete with gold for "wtf do I need when shtf?!". I just want to establish an alternative to Fiat which doesn't require me to trust a government, or a bank or anyone for that matter.
When I own a BTC, I directly own something that the entire planet says has value. It's not a promise or an IOU and I don't have to entrust it to another company to use it.
Keep gold, we need it if SHTF. Otherwise let's push for an alternative to Fiat.

I have a nice guy who rents out to me I convinced to accept BTC. I can shop at Walmart using BTC (just a phone app to buy a gift card), etc.
Transaction fees are a growing pains, as I said. Transaction fees will always exist though, because the compute power others give to you has value. Much like third parties like Visa or MasterCard have value and charge you a transaction fee.
Why are you focusing on the many coins aspect again? There are currently two coins that are big for spending, and many others aren't even there to be used as standard currency. Half the new coins are ETH blockchains.
Take a coin like golem for instance. It has 'value' sure, but it is not even meant to be used as currency in the same since BTC is. It is meant to track and reward computation in distributed application networks. 
Many of these coins are trash, and will always be seen as trash. Many of these coins aren't even supposed to be currencies, and many do not related to currency in the same sense. The fact that people may use them to store value is incidental. They will never be accepted at POS.
The express purpose of BTC is to be a store of value and it is the coin people recognize has having value. That is what we should focus on. It's a limited supply, distributed,l and trustless. If I have to pay. 2-3% transaction fee for those properties then yay, I'm already paying that.   
 Edit: also, other than price fluctuations what risk would supermarkets take on?

Well, i'm going to start out with 10% of my paycheck and move up every few months to make sure I can handle it. I have an emergency fund in fiat in case I am unable to use BTC for some reason...
I'm betting on bitcoin... 2800 seems high, but if bitcoin is in it for the longrun then "time in the market beats timing the market".

It's a completely new economy. Currencies don't become stable overnight.
Bitcoin will become more stable as more people use it, which will take some time.

Crypto is still a form of cash. Most people don't want the responsibility of keeping and securing their own private keys, just like most people don't want the responsibility of keeping and protecting their cash.
Crypto doesn't get around the debt society either. Banks will still run by affording debt to others even in a fully crypto system, only with smart contracts and a secure Leger system it may make banks for effective.
You have a 21 million cap on bitcoin, but if ever takes hold the coins + IOU debt will be much, much more than 21 million.
I can see it now. "Get your own credit wallet !"

I believe that would be a market cap larger than all money supply currently available.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:04:15
Wouldn't that make it uncomfortable to use as a currency though? I was hoping Bitcoin could be resistant to non-market driven inflation, but lost coins seems to suggest otherwise.

Interesting... I took a quick look at their android app and dismissed the idea. I have a (maybe naive) tendency to judge a company based on whether or not their applications look professional.
I'll research bitwage more, thank you for sharing your experience!

It's a threat to online intermediaries. Banks were not in trouble before digital when everyone used cash. Banks will not be in trouble after the digital goes cash-like

I mean, money only has value if we agree that it does. literally sticks can be used as money. There will be an continuous deployment of new coins for the rest of time, over time people will start viewing most as sticks.

That's what turns me off. Generally I assume if a company is legit then they care about actually making a  good consumer facing product. 
Do you know any other ways to do what I want?
