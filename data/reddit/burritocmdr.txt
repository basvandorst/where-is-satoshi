We've been in a crazy bull market run the past several years. I've had a Vanguard 401k only for the past 4 yrs and it's performed fantastically. But I'm bracing myself for the first bear market and how it will hold up. Not too worried, I've got many years to go until retirement.

Same with GOOG, I’d convinced myself that the IPO price of $90 or whatever was too expensive.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I think he gambled on Tim Cook aggressively buying back stock using their massive cash horde. Doesn't look like Icahn's jedi mind trick is working.

Yes I would say as much. If you don't trust Mint with your coinbase account then why would you give them credentials to your bank account and credit cards?

Wondering the same thing, my mortgage rate is around 3%. No reason at all to pay it off, or even pay over minimum when I'm making well over that rate in the stock market. The only thing I did a few yrs ago was pay off enough to get out of PMI payments.
But yea, I know people who just hate having any kind of debt. It's a mindset thing.

Nevermind the emotional rollercoaster of going through several bitcoin crashes and watching all your gainz disappear. You'd be kicking yourself for not selling when you had the chance. And the next rally, you remember that painful lesson and sell when it doubles or triples before it crashes again. Yea, no one in their right mind buys a bunch of BTC at $54 and holds all the way to $10k.

Don’t worry, even if you had, probably would have sold it all when it hit $100

Yea pretty much did the same. After BTC about tripled after buying last June, I decided to cash in. I’m not greedy. My ETH more than doubled as well and I profited off the free BCH fork. It’s all good! I built a new gaming pc and put the rest into some stocks.
