They can only theoretically shut down US mining.  Not miners and nodes across the globe.

Lol ok goofy.  I still own btc.  Just collecting my profit and asking some Qs.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:03:29
As in Eddie would go
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:56:12
This is the bigger mistake
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:49:07
Who believes this will happen?  690 dollars? Wtf?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:44:06
Yes sold some, not all.  Lol. I still care about btc.  Nice question dodge tho.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:52:09
Not sure if serious
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:11:21

Don't have enough info to have an independent opinion.  I know this sub was generally against it, claimed it was some sort of coup.  It seemed like a step towards centralization, not sure who really benefitted from it.  Also, Apparently BCH are all shills and most altcoins are shitcoins that flatline when BTC spikes (lol sad but true).
I'm just a brother tryna make sense of it all.

If I lived in DC I would.  I only visit occasionally.

Different exchanges - different transaction book - different demand
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:47:33
Thank you.  Sounds like these are acknowledged problems with potential fixes, but nothing concrete yet.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:22:33
That makes sense.  I frankly don't understand the arguments against it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:41:45
In that case, it sucks that it got cancelled.  People were celebrating it being cancelled on here tho...
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:31:41
Genuinely curious how this can happen.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:45:31
Hi transaction fees and multi-hour waiting times are also not considered decent "liquidity" imo
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:38:50
lol tx
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:48:49
It is supposed to be currency, not real estate

Black woman being mugged by a white man. Just lol at this propaganda.
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:34:05
It doesn't.  It's a cause for some concern, but it keeps rising so idk.
