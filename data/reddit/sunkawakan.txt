BTW "robo" = "theft" in spanish.
Robocoin? The first thought I had was: really? What a bad name for an ATM!
Spanish is the second language spoken by number of native speakers in the world. (chinese is 1st and english 3rd).
Seems that he/them tought it was a good name and when someone told him/them what is the meaning in spanish he/they just did not care enough.

Meanwhile, [OpenBazaar]( and [Darkwallet]( have multisignature donation addresses shown over SSL (HTTPS).
Full disclosure/ad: yesterday we opened [a bitcoin-only store]( selling OpenBazaar t-shirts and donating 50% of the tee selling price to the OpenBazaar project. HTTPS only and [we have earned an A+ rating on the qualys SSL test](

The only products we sell now are [OpenBazaar t-shirts]( :)
And [we donate 50% of each t-shirt]( selling price to the OpenBazaar project :)
Our [OpenBazaar node]( is not open yet, because of some [nasty bug]( We'll wait for the beta 0.3.2.

At least in Spain, it is legal tender and all banks must accept it. [Already happened]( with 5,000€ in 1 cent coins (700 Kg). They refused to collect the last 600€ because it was closing time.

You may stop using that phone now and [try to recover]( the wallet/private keys.

On OpenBazaar, if there is no dispute then there is no fee. The [notary may not know what the price was]( for that transaction. There are some free notaries right now on OpenBazaar.

If you do right click on his page a popup appears with the message "Sorry, not sharing images!" Nice, thank you "Doctor". Now I have to use "print screen" to do that :(
Or if you want to open a new tab (Ctrl-T), the message is "The key is not available." Haha, sure
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:20:17
Can confirm, tried it. Neat and way faster than any exchange. Good job!
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:37:24
Nice, thanks! I love the warnings on the manual :D
You may create a file with all the users on this post, remove dupes, count them and use random.org to pick a number, ignoring the number choosed by the user.
I may write a shell script to do this if you want.

	# Get our random number from random.org
	WINNER_NUMBER=`curl "
	# Select the winner from the list

I thought that the Namecoin blockchain was almost as strong as the Bitcoin one.
I like the idea, but do not fully understand why is more desirable than just using Namecoin.
