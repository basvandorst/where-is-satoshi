I can - but I have to head to bed soon, honey.
Let's go through it, though, real quick.
So, 750 GH/s is 112.50 USD on Genesis Mining's website, right? You can see that [here](
Now, your daily fees are 0.00028 USD per GH/s - so:
**0.00028 x 750 = 0.21 USD**
We're going to pay 0.21 USD a day, for maintenance. This goes towards repairing the hardware, upgrading it, controller updates, paying the workers, security, housing the stuff...all that jazz. 
Now, we'll use the calculator you are fond of: ['CryptoCompare'.]( You're going to make 0.3828 profits a day, but we need to deduct our maintenance fee from that, right?
 **0.3828 - 0.21 = 0.1728**
Let's round that down to just 0.17 cents profit. It's nicer on the eyes, don't you think?
So, you initially paid 112.50 USD - you're going to want to get that back. 
**112.50 USD / 0.17 USD = 661.764**
**661 days**, or **1.81 years**.
Or, **0.17 USD x 661 = 112.37 USD**.
We're a few cents short, but I rounded down for the sake of simplicity - you get the idea, though. 
Now, that's just assuming the price of BTC stays the same - but BTC is always going up. You might get lucky, and the coin might be worth 3000 per BTC. You might not get lucky - the coins might go down to 300 per BTC (this is the time to *buy, buy, buy*). 
That's what I mean with, it's a gamble. But you do break even. It just takes time. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:38:25
Finally, a voice of reason!
We can't control the difficulty. It's out of our control. All we can do is offer you the option to mine without any of the frustration of setting up your own miners - cloud mining is meant for people who want to experience the *gamble* of mining, without any of the legwork. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:18:59
Actually, we do say that on our website. Here's a [screenshot]( but you'll also see the costs and benefits comparison chart if you scroll down [here](
Please, don't lie. I really *hate* liars. 
You're letting anger fuel your argument, instead of logic. Take a step back, take a breather. 
Believe me, if the 'whole fucking business model' was meant to 'scam noobs', I wouldn't be here. But I am. Why? Because they don't scam people, they don't lie, and they're doing everything in their power to be kind and offer people what they want - cloud mining - but then people like you come in, and make us really reconsider. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:12:09
55 USD sent your way, [proof]( That's from my personal wallet, not a company one, just in case people are going to accuse me of doing a publicity stunt.
I know, it's frustrating. But there's not really much we can do with BTC's profitability; gone are the days of mining 50-coin blocks on a CPU and making bank. All we can do is offer a steady contract for people who *want* to buy hash power straight, and who *want* the experience of mining, without actually doing any of the setup. 
Eventually, you do ROI. It's just that, telling people they'd ROI in three-four years, sometimes six, just isn't enough. They want their profits *now*.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:29:48
No, it's really, *really* not. It's meant to be competitive with mining on your *own* hardware - which it is. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:03:29
What you're asking to do is [chargeback fraud]( And I can guarantee you, that won't happen - you never brought a return of investment. You brought hash power. Did you get the hash power that was provided for you, on a consistent, daily basis? Was there any downtime, any time when your miner was offline? Any at all? No?
Then you got what you paid for.
I'm sorry, but people who abuse the return policies really bug the shit out of me. I'm sorry you feel scammed, but Genesis Mining offered you a cloud mining contract that gave you a set amount of hash power, for a set amount. You got that. 
You might get a refund because of good will, but you just threatened to go to a lawyer and start a class action lawsuit - I think any good will I had was quickly erased.
Please understand - I know you feel frustrated. I really wish I could do more, but you were given exactly what you brought. No where did we promise you a return of investment. No where did we even *mention* that you would get a return of investment.
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:41:58
Thank you, hon. I really hope you have a great night, and get some good sleep, and have a wonderful week. It's Valentine's Day, so go treat yourself to some discount chocolate!
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:37:09
Because it is.
You don't sell your own hardware for a 'profit', and it will NEVER cover the cost of running your miner. Ever. Mining is expensive, it costs a pretty penny. What do you pay for electricity? Let's do the math. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:18:33
No, your first Reddit post was [25 days ago.](
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:31:33
What do you think we could do to be 'less shady'? I'm open to suggestions. I'm listening.
Please understand - we cannot guarantee you a profit. We're doing everything in our power to ensure customers understand *what* the Bitcoin mining fee is for, and that they may not ROI. Remember, this is meant to compete against mining with your own hardware - not buying Bitcoin outright. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:40:14
People give their money because they want hash power. That's it. They buy a set amount of hash power, they get that hash power. 
Some people want to mine Bitcoin, but it's not profitable to do so on their own, due to the cost of the initial hardware (1200+ USD for a good ASIC miner); the electricity cost; the software setup; the maintenance; and the eventual damage of the hardware (fans die, they need replacing; chips need re-soldering occasionally, etc. etc).
This is not a get rich quick scheme, and yes, it most definitely is comparative to home mining - remember, you're not mining on a GPU with Bitcoin. You are mining on an ASIC. And you won't ever sell them to 'cover your cost'. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:00:19
It - it won't at all. How would it? You get a payout every day of 4 USD (give or take a few cents). Your daily fee is .21 cents. That leaves you with 3.79 USD profit.
Keep in mind, these numbers are based on the 16 TH/s contract. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:06:34
It won't, though.
The initial investment is 1200+ USD for a good ASIC, right?
Don't forget the shipping + import fees. Let's round it up to about 1500 USD.
Now, in Denmark, you'll pay about EUR 0.34 [pulled from here](
 So, 16 TH/s, 2400 W power consumption, at 0.304 KW/h ($) nets you...
[-9.34 USD]( a day. Hm. Oh dear. 
If you don't pay for electricity, by all means, go ahead. Then it's profitable for you.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:39:48
I'm really sorry you feel we're scamming you, I think your mind's made up, so there's probably nothing I can do to convince you otherwise - all I can say is this:
We're offering cloud mining as an option for people who want to mine Bitcoin, but don't want to run their own hardware. You're comparing it to buying Bitcoin outright (i.e. making a profit), when you're meant to be comparing it to buying your own ASIC, and running it from home, 24/7. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:26:41
I'm sorry you felt you were a *victim*, but I need to remind you that Genesis Mining clearly states you need to do the research to ensure that this is what you *really* want to spend your money on.
The problem is you are comparing their contract to buying Bitcoin directly. It's not meant to be comparable to that - it's meant to be comparable to *mining* on your own hardware. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:43:34
Oh, you're right! My bad. I had assumed your 'call to community' action was linked to the 'CAL' argument.
The chargeback fraud argument is *entirely* based on the CAL argument - it wouldn't happen. It just would be thrown out of court.
So, disregard *all* of this - I suck cocks, and owe you a beer. What's your BTC address? 
I do work for Genesis Mining - I stated it a few times. The problem is that it gets very frustrating for everyone when we offer a product - straight hash power - and people get angry because they're not making profit. 
I am passionate about them - because there's a lot going on behind the scenes that the community doesn't see, or that never gets attention. Like how we stay up until 6 am answering trolls on Reddit. Or how we spend hours working on open source software that has no financial benefit to us, and actually encourages people to mine on their own hardware - rather than with the cloud mining contracts.
I pose this: would you rather a company that has been vetted by Forbes, CNBC, The International Business Times and all those fancy press sites, to host cloud mining contracts? I mean, people are going to buy it. At least this way, they're going with someone who's legitimate, has been vetted by consumer reports, and has a track record of offering exactly what you pay for.
P.S. I don't drink beer...what do they usually cost? =P
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:35:37
The same [calculator you used]( - he brought 16 TH, correct? 
That's about 1970 USD. 
He's got 1.18 BTC currently - about 1190 USD.
He needs to make 780 USD to successfully break even.
And his wallet shows a daily payout of 0.003 BTC - give or take a few bits. That's about 4 USD a day. 
780 / 4 = 195 days. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:47:13
Sigh. There's no reasoning with you. You're just filled with hatred and anger.
If you read the text, you would see that it compares against home mining. But alas, you did not.
You asked me:


And I showed you where. 
No, our company isn't loathed - you're just angry and taking it out on me. But that's okay.
It's okay to be angry.
I forgive you.
I really hope you have an amazing night. I've got to go work on some stuff for [sgminer-gm]( - you know, that *horrible* thing we gave the community for free to trick them into mining on their own hardware - but if you have any questions and would like to speak to me in a calm, logical manner, do feel free to reply.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:57:49
They don't invest Bitcoin (upfront), so how do they lose Bitcoin? 
They do *not* encourage customers to reinvest the 'scraps' into contracts. That's the community. We have no control over that. We allow it, but we don't say on our website, "HEY! DO THIS TO GET A RETURN!"
What would you suggest? A complete rewrite of the website? Could you point out exactly what part of the website you think should be rewritten? I will look into it.
As I have said many times, but I'll repeat here: it's meant to be compared to mining on your own hardware. You make more from mining with Genesis Mining than you would mining with your own hardware (provided you pay for electricity in your country). 
If you're comparing it to buying Bitcoin from an exchange - well, duh. Of course it seems bad. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:06:23
Ugh, yeah. I understand. 
As I've said many times in this thread - it's meant to be compared to mining with your *own hardware*. It's certainly a step up from that. 
The fees are actually listed in our 'Maintenance Fee' section - here's the [screenshot.]( I'm not sure if you missed it, or if they didn't have it listed before I joined the company - I'm going to go through our website snapshots and see if I can find it. Do you have a rough estimate of when you purchased your contract? Like, a month and year to work with? 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:13:31
Let's use the mining calculator again that you liked before.
[Here]( - 0.38 USD profit, per day. 
Your fees are 0.21 USD per day.
That's 0.17 cents profit. You'd ROI in two-ish years. That's...not bad for the cost of two AAA games. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:56:39
They decrease for all contracts. And what do you consider profitable? When are you trying to ROI? In a year? Three? Five?
If you're planning on making back your initial investment in a few months - you're mining the wrong coin. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:04:20
I don't think we can do anything else to lower the fees any more. It's why we push customers to do their research and make sure that this is truly what they want.
You can ROI - it just depends on how impatient you are. If you're looking for 180 day ROI - no. Bitcoin mining won't get you that, and I really suggest looking into altcoins, instead.
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:24:21
Don't lie! 
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:21:14
Alright, guys. There’s a lot of anger and misinformation so I’m going to step in here and post.
**Disclaimer: I work for Genesis Mining.**
I’m not a miner. I’m a cryptographer. I’m the person who’s making the software on your miners run fast. I’m also the other half of the [Wolf9466/Wolf0]( persona. I’ve been in this game for a long time.
Now that’s out of the way, let’s get down to brass tax:
Cloud mining is *not for you.*
Cloud mining is meant for people who can not run their own hardware, but want to experience mining. It is *not* meant for the average person looking to make a quick buck. More to the point, it is *not* meant for people who directly want their BTC to translate to USD. Everyone who is hoping for to make it rich - you missed that train. You won’t profit that way.
Genesis Mining offers it. They don’t force anyone to buy it. For some people, it is more profitable than buying BTC outright - if the cost of BTC skyrockets overnight, say, 0.005 for 5000 USD, you’ve definitely got an ROI. Do you understand what I’m saying?
It’s a gamble. It will always be a gamble.
Bitcoin Mining is currently for people who enjoy that gamble. It’s only a waste of money if you directly interpret Bitcoin’s value as it’s USD cost. It's meant to be comparable to mining on your own hardware.
As for being a scam - heh. Do you really think the company that’s been featured in [Forbes]( on [Reuters]( the [International Buisness Times]( and [CNBC]( is a scam? I mean, do you really think companies who hold their journalistic integrity to the highest standard would interview or host articles supporting a scam company?
It is not Genesis Mining’s fault that you have not made a ROI - they do everything they can to make sure customers *read* and *research* and *decide* that this contract is for them. Just because you don’t make a profit doesn’t make something a scam. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:15:10
Sorry, not with 700 GH/s. I was going off the previous guys 16 TH/s. 
So for 700 GH/s it's a lot lower. It's 0.38 cents earned a day, and 0.21 cents taken from fees - so, 17 cents profit. You'd ROI in one year. The trick is to NOT SPEND THE BITCOIN. Wait until it skyrockets in price. HODL it!
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:43:39
I'm really sorry you feel this is a scam, I wish I could do something to convince you otherwise, but summed up what I wanted to say perfectly:
You got hashrate (and then some, for free!); it's not our fault that ZCash crashed, and the difficulty skyrocketed. Take your anger out on the market, not out on us. We push, and push, and *push* for interested customers to do their own research, but unfortunately, not everyone listens to us. 
P.S. Just because you didn't get ROI, doesn't mean we're a scam. Please, stop calling things a scam just because you don't make a profit. Shakespeare wouldn't be very happy if he saw you butchering the English language like that! 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:13:51
No, we're really not. 
You said your daily fees eat up most of the BTC reward.
You get 38 cents a day in USD. 
You pay 21 cents a day (the daily fee), for 750 GH/s. 
That still leaves you with 17 cents profit. Or, 63 USD profit, per year. So you'd ROI (you said you pay 105 right?) in two-ish years.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:34:27
We can't predict the difficulty, hon. All we can do is use calculators. 
[Here's the calculator](
You're correct though - you wouldn't ROI in one year, if you deduct the mining fee. But what's worth 62 USD now, may be worth 109 USD tomorrow. ^^
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:31:36
Nah, consider it my apology for snapping at you, honey. I should have checked the comments. I hope you can forgive me. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:19:59
Hey It's really late here in Sweden - 6am, actually. I've been up trying to help folks out in this thread but I'm getting pretty tired, so I'm going to call it a night.
Give me a PM if you want some more assistance. Also, don't hesitate to tell me what you pay for electricity - we can probably work out, then, if you'd ROI from buying a miner, and mining, or if it's smarter to just buy a contract.
*yawn* I'm exhausted. Have a good night, Thanks for taking the time to talk with us at Genesis Mining! 
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:49:35
Except they are profitable - for plenty of people. 
Like this [guy](
Or maybe [this one](
Oh look, [another](
Hell, even [Bits Be Trippin']( took a look at us.
They might not be now, but in the beginning, a lot of customers made  *bank*. We offer it because, whether you like it or not, people will buy mining contracts - at least this way, we ensure they actually get what they pay for - hash rate. That's it. They pay for hash, they get hash. We're not running off with their coins. You can see our farms. Hell, you can look any of us up on BitCoinTalk, on GitHub, you can find us on Facebook!
Yes, it is a joke for most miners. But again, this isn't meant for most miners who have the capability of running their own hardware - it's meant for people who want to enjoy the gamble of mining, without any of the stress of setting up a mining rig and maintaining it.
We can't say that they'd never be profitable, because that would be a lie. Some people do profit, and they continue to post on Youtube, Facebook and Twitter, with proof, but none of that matters in the heat of the moment, does it?
We do link to exchanges; and we won't lie.
As for 'they're never going to be profitable': they're not going to be profitable in a few days, no. They would be, in a few years. It's a hell of a lot faster than if you were running your own hardware at home. 
And that's what it is meant to be compared to: mining from *home*. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:08:33
Yes, that's very true. But the entire point is that Genesis Mining always has the latest hardware - e.g. while you're on an SP20, they're on the SP45. They don't charge you anything extra. It might cost you 1500 USD to buy the latest ASIC, but you get it included in your contract - free of charge. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:28:49
The-the daily fees do decrease. They have, many times over. The last time was December 13th, at 0.00035 USD per GH/s; and currently we're at [0.00028 USD per GH/s]( 
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:50:10
Well, I'd certainly hope they're not a scam - otherwise, fuck, what mess have I gotten myself into?!
Hi! Community Manager here at Genesis Mining (among other things). Is there anything I can do to assuage your fears that we're not a scam? I can offer [selfies with the Monero developers]( [selfies with Vitalik Buterin]( and [naked photographs of our CEO]( Take your pick!
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:18:33
That'd be Genesis Mining that they visited. They mine a bit of everything! 
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:55:31
It does change daily, yes. This thread was four months ago.
