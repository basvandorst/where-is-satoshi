"Oh wait it can't be used as a currency.  I'm going to lose most of my money.  This was a horrible investment idea"
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:07:27
For every purchase?  This greatly diminishes the capabilities to be seriously used as a currency.

Fundamentally diminished the intrinsic value leaving bitcoin little more than a volatile novelty speculative investment.

US government just declared it must be taxed as property making it virtually  useless as a currency in the US.  The intrinsic value has been significantly damaged in my opinion.   Its much more speculative now.  Still value in other countries and black market though .

The value is based on the dynamic realties of the various factors effecting its usefulness.  Not past patterns.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:38:47
And when it drops more buy more.  Repeat until homeless.

Gold has intrinsic value as a semiconductor and for making jewelry.

Gone full retard.

Where does bitcoins value come from then?  All the talk was about its value as a new money.  If it's just an asset then why not gold?  What's the advantage?  As an asset it sucks because its so volatile.

Neobee can profit from recent Valuenet price drops to decrease their debt.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:28:47
What's the coincidence?  Fundamentals have changed and the value is collapsing.  That didn't happen last year.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:23:48
The Dow and S&amp;P are way up overall this year.  Also regardless of when you entered the stock market this year, you couldn't be down more than 15%.

No it's April.

While the article sounds silly it raises an interesting point.  You are not supposed to travel with more than US 10,000 without declaring it.   If someone had a phone or laptop with a bitcoin wallet holding more than 10,000 US its virtually the same thing as carrying that amount of cash.  Failure to declare it could get you in big trouble.  The countermeasure to this is luggage inspection.  But you can't see bitcoin because its virtual.  So what to do?  Software/systems inspections? Ugh.. but I wouldn't be shocked if that's not far off.
Bitcoin is probably useful to criminals looking to leave the country and sneak out with like half a million in cash.

This also isn't a stock

The next century isn't for like 85 years man.

To the ground!!
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:09:09
Most of these people came on after seeing people make millions when bitcoin surged to over $1,000.   Everyone jumped on the ship too late as usual.  So now what.  I think in a year or so if it does t really take off a lot of people will start pulling out.

Annnnd this is the first incident that is part of a bigger plan that is the next big scam on Americans.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:38:31
So people that did bitcoin transactions prior to 2013 need to go back and file an amended return for 2012 ( or earlier) returns?
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:57:49
I sold at 600.  Zen as fuck.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:58:08
So past performance is a predictor of future results?
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:41:23
How about Valuenet.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:02:00
So bitcoin use is decreasing?
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:14:35
Isn't the ruling making bitcoin taxable as property effective for tax year 2014 making this theory nonsense?
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:49:04
Valuenet has more meaning.  Spread the word.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:05:12
Test the IRS. They'll seize your assets man.  The party is pretty much over.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:55:22
Is their a copyright on the name bitcoin?  How about registering vakuenet as a DNS?
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:52:45
It has lost attributes it had when it was $1,000.  It had a lot of potential as a future currency.  Since then, China's legal stance and the US's IRS ruling put up such huge barriers as a legal currency so as to make it no longer useful in that capacity.  But it has value as an asset to store money right?  Well its extremely volatile which is not a quality you want in an asset.  As various debacles have
 shown us, its also susceptible to huge losses from being hacked or simply losing keys and losing the money.  Its an amazing technology and in the future some of these issues could be resolved, bit at this point in time the value is dead in the water.

The fundamental environment has changed.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:52:27
I don't think that's gonna change either.

It sure as hell didn't today.

Didn't the WV twins purchase like a billion dollars in Bitcoin for the purpose of packing up for sale through the ETF?   If they can't run this ETF they are gonna unload these shares most likely.

Bitcoin is crashing.  Get out now.
