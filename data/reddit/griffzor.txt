You shouldn’t have to wait two hours. Once it’s on chain it’ll go through. I’ve paid with debit card and not had the transaction complete or show up at all until three days later. Needless to say I didn’t stay at the store. At least with crypto the store could see the transaction on the block chain

Either is possible, I don’t think anyone saw Ripple even becoming number 2, people have been hating on it for years yet here it is. I’ll never buy even .01 Ripple because fuck that coin but you can’t deny it has went against many expectations. I don’t claim to know which coin will become number one but with the current state of things, I don’t think bitcoin will stay on top for very much longer.
Or it could forever, that’s why I didn’t use strong words because at the end of the day we’re all guessing.

Yeah I know about that sadly it isn’t an option on Breadwallet as far as I know which is what I use for hot wallet. Until edge is released which seems promising. I’m just bewildered that you can make a transaction come to you, do you just change fees to so low they’ll never possibly go through?

Some believe that people who bought futures contracts manipulated the price up beforehand and then downward after futures went live so they could profit off the price spike and then off their contracts of which they could then buy more due to the previous profits. If that’s true who knows. Bitcoin could’ve also just shot up past the level where it belonged, with the rise it had there was really no indication of support levels and the market wasn’t too happy about it so now it’s basically finding it’s footing again. Also as much as I love and support bitcoin if I were buying into crypto today and saw the network fees I’d be very pushed away by it. I get Segwit exists and LN is coming but I wouldn’t if I just started, and reading a bunch of articles and learning a ton of new stuff doesn’t sound appealing if I could just buy Ethereum Litecoin or even Bitcoin Cash because they’re new they don’t know the problems and sketchiness behind it and it has low fees so it’s appealing. People are also susceptible to news stories of which there’s been many bad ones recently. Everyone I know who knows nothing about crypto has mentioned to me how Korea banned it, but then they haven’t seen the articles about that actually being false.
There’s a lot of reasons the price could’ve went down and futures may have played a part in it but I wouldn’t say that they caused everything.

Not enough to be significant. Paper money takes less than a dollar to make for each bill. Bitcoin takes thousands for each one and that number will continue to go up as the difficulty increases. It’s similar to mining precious metals in that sense, which are commodities.

Yep, all the card does is connect through Coinbase and immediately sell your bitcoin so you’re taxed the same as you would be for buying and selling. Can claim a loss if you’re in the scenario you mentioned above as well.
The only complication is that you’re supposed to follow a FIFO guideline for trading so you can’t (technically) have a separate wallet for long term holding and then have your Coinbase wallet only for spending so you could withdraw from your separate wallet after a year and pay long term capital gains taxes which is slightly annoying but not a big deal to me. Something to consider though

Well I’m talking about using my visa debit card when it oddly took three days.

Coinbase isn’t great but it’s not awful either. I’d recommend GDAX if you want to save on exchange fees if you stick with Coinbase, they’re owned by the same people so you can use the same account. Also with GDAX you can send bitcoin out and they pay the fee I believe, which is a nice bonus.
The complaints about Coinbase come in when someone has issues because unlike other exchanges Coinbase won’t halt new sign ups and has had trouble scaling and therefor has inexistent customer service. But Coinbase and GDAX have both run smooth for me for the most part. It’s up to you if you want to run the risk of running into the problems with them. With that being said I only use Coinbase at this point to fund my Shift card if that says anything to you, but I don’t want to shit on them as most customers have a pleasant experience.
Gemini is better for getting into altcoins though as well as many other large exchanges: Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:55:20
Bitcoin is made to be mined at close to a certain rate and the difficulty will adjust with new miners or less miners. If China were to disappear from mining then either pool sizes will shrink and each share found will simply give each person more bitcoin because there’s less people to share with or say the size stays the same, but the difficulty goes down to account for a smaller hashrate so that pool is more likely to find a block at that point than they were before and people will get paid more frequently and earn more.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:37:52
If you’re asking whether you should transfer coins to GDAX, you shouldn’t for storage purposes, look into how to make a wallet. If you do want to switch them to GDAX it’s as easy as logging into GDAX using your Coinbase login info and hitting deposit then choosing to deposit from Coinbase account.
GDAX charges no fees for limit orders so it’s better to buy from there but keep your coins on a wallet that gives you a 12 word mnemonic phrase which you can use to access your private keys. Private keys and 12 word phrase are very important to ensure you can always get your BTC out of the wallet.

$35 a week isn’t much of your income so I’d say do it and maybe even try to save a separate $35 a week hard cash. I also used Qapital when I first started saving because it just saves rounds up to the nearest dollar every time you make a debit card purchase and it built up. Obviously the bitcoin has likelihood to go crazy but you should always save traditionally so you can be sure you will have x amount by whatever date.

Yeah they’d lose tons of money if they did that. Even the richest company wouldn’t. And if they did no one would know if they don’t announce it and if they did the supply more than likely wouldn’t be heavily affected. And if it was the price would then go up as supply dropped.

As much as I like GDAX, withdrawals are generally slow, I was shocked the other day when my withdrawal immediately appeared on blockchain. If it didn’t send though go to “accounts” and it should still show up there it just may not be available right now. That happened with a cash deposit recently, it took like 5 hours to get it back so I could withdraw it though. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:23:59

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:40:53
The most important thing to know is that an exchange isn’t a wallet, they basically owe you that bitcoin. You should know how to recover your wallet and stuff, which is pretty simple. There’s a lot of stuff out there to look into though, you could educate yourself on blockchain technology more and maybe read the bitcoin white paper to understand why it is that people believe it will continue to rise and why it’s seen as a revolution of sorts. If you’re just interested in holding it though just make sure you don’t expose yourself to potential security threats, I lost $4000 not long ago simply due to not taking the right precautions and considering the security of the computer I was using, so I personally can’t stress the importance of security enough.
But absolutely, a paper wallet is comparable in security and I’d recommend holding it on one of those until you get a hardware wallet as those are the most secure option.

Fiat money is currency not backed by anything. Which is most of the larger national currencies
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:43:22
If you can't get an antminer from bitmain I believe it's cheaper to go with cloud mining. Make sure not to use any random sites though, stick with like Genesis and Hash flare if you buy a contract.
It's not a scam, a lot of people say "if they could make that much money mining why would they sell it?" and it's because you never know how much money you could end up making mining. Could make a killing, but the difficulty could skyrocket leaving you in the dust or the price could go down drastically and you are the one losing out while they already profited. I use Hash flare and it's about 20% more expensive to buy the contact compared to the normal price of an antminer s9, as well as some fees, but so far (is only been one month) I've made $500 with my 8TH contract that I spent about $1000 on and so I decided to buy more with that. It's debatable whether or not you'll turn a large profit at the end of the year, and as many people say you could make more money simply investing and holding. Just gotta do the math, and use Mycryptobuddy's calculator because while it isn't perfect it at least tries to account for difficulty changes, which most calculators don't.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:08:43

I don’t think you’d be affected. I’m assuming it’s purchases over $20,000 (?) if I’m wrong, if they do contact you you’d most likely have to just explain your situation, and they may check to see if you ever suddenly come into $30,000 but I imagine you’ll be safe.

It has had a downward trend for more than one day before. I remember it happening like a month ago. It went slowly down for a few years straight at one point. I'm not saying don't do what you want but considering how utterly wrong your statement is I'd think about maybe being more patient because it's only the beginning of the third day. It's also possible it's correcting after a 20x year but it will probably go back up. Pull backs are healthy.

For holding long term it’s more than likely going to rise even if it does drop a couple thousand it’ll probably bounce back and you’ll be in the profit. The bubble has popped before and we’re still going strong. While you have to accept that it all could go to shit it’s a lot stronger now than it was before which is what I feel like a lot of uneducated people base their opinion on. Also it’s important to know it’s not the same as a stock so the comparison your girlfriend made is a little ineffective, bitcoin isn’t a company so you aren’t buying a part of it like a stock and many people, myself included, believe that in order to be truly widespread it’ll have to reach around $1 million. I’d say put some money into it but not all, just do some research to understand the technology more before pulling the trigger. Especially if you’ll invest more than a grand make sure you have a safe wallet and stuff.

I’ve now bought about $4k worth of stuff on purse.io, connected my CB account to avoid fees. Love using that site. Sadly I don’t use it anywhere else (anymore) but I also bought my computer and other mining parts from Newegg with bitcoin in the past when the fees weren’t so outrageous.

It’s an okay wallet. The problem with Exodus is that while it is safe itself, you run the risk of losing coins due to a virus on your computer, that happened to me recently and I lost about $4000.
So if you trust yourself yes Exodus is great, I use Breadwallet on iOS personally because I trust iOS more.
But if you plan to just hold and not sell for a while I’d highly recommend looking into a paper wallet.
As far as safety goes I’d rank wallets as such: desktop&lt;mobile&lt;electrum on tails OS&lt;paper wallet&lt;hardware wallet.

You get an amount of the forked coin equal to the amount of real bitcoin you have. It's not the same coin so it isn't dilution and the coins will most likely be worthless. Bitcoin gold is worth $300. So for every $17k you have in bitcoin you could sell the bitcoin gold for $300. Or the forked coin may not sell at all, or sell for $5 because it's nothing but a knock off coin.
I think forks will bring trouble to bitcoin because it confuses new people sadly, but hopefully people will realize that forking isn't going to work. I also saw a thing about futures I believe, which stated that forked coins can't even apply for something like that unless they change the name or add FORK to the name, putting them even more behind bitcoin.

I have a lot of my wealth because I put in money I had been saving up for a computer at $4000, now I’ve bought that computer and kept the rest of my savings in btc because at this point it’s not much of a loss in my opinion as I’ve already profited enough to buy what I was aiming for.
I won’t say the exact number I currently have, but I’m 20 and pay no rent or bills and will soon be making about $1200 a month of which I plan to put about $600 more in per month and $200 into acorns for mutual funds because they charge no monthly fee for college students.

It’s went up around 40% each month recently and 1200% this year so 20k isn’t necessarily the furthest away. Unless an extra $1k in about two months isn’t a lot of money to him.

Electrum is known to be safe but I’d add 2FA as it’s simple to add and a strong layer of protection. I’d personally create a paper wallet to hold coins until you get a hardware wallet as it’s very easy to create and just as secure (in my opinion) as a hardware wallet as long as you trust yourself to not lose it.
Security is important to think about but some people are very paranoid. In reality it’s safe to store on any well known wallet that will allow you access to your private keys as long as your computer or phone is safe. I’ve held &gt;1 btc on my breadwallet with no issues whatsoever.
If you’re really worried though I’d virus scan your computer before creating a paper wallet and then follow a YouTube video guide on how to create one.

That’s why everyone says to get a wallet where you control the private keys.
However it makes sense for exchanges to do that for trading purposes. Imagine if you had to pay a btc network fee while using an exchange for trading, that would be brutal.
It’s something we must accept and I believe it’s not that different from traditional stock exchanges where they recognize you as the owner but it’s technically not yours it’s their’s.

in some special circumstances depending on your location.
i’ve noticed there’s two types of people with bitcoin: those who see it as the new gold, aka a store of value; and those who believe it will take over fiat currencies.
one day we may be able to, but if it stays so simple and quick to turn into USD it may instead one day stabilize and become the other option.
with the fees it currently has it is more likely to be a store of value, but if they can implement lower fees I’d like to see it be spendable on things like you mentioned.

Yeah that’s right. Just make sure you do a limit order on GDAX so there’s no fees. You can set it for $.01 less than the market price if you want it immediately. It’ll take a while to buy through bank account though which is the only way to avoid fees, but if you plan to hold it shouldn’t matter.

Bitcoin Core is safe. Any wallet that allows you access to private key(s) is good.
Bitcoin Core I believe has you run a full node though which is a whole other process.
You could do a paper wallet for long term, you could use Electrum, some people like exodus because it’s prettier and easy but I’ve never tried it.
I use breadwallet on mobile and a paper wallet.

Sorry I’ve been at work, that shouldn’t cause any issues though that I’ve heard of. It should be the same as buying it in the US as it’s the same platform.
Sign up, verify identity, and you’re good to go.

DCA with whatever you can afford is best for long term with least stress, but don’t bank on bitcoin because it can go down so prepare for it’s failure just in case.

If you’re using iOS I can personally recommend bread wallet as like I said I’ve used it to store a decent amount of BTC safely. iOS is also a safe operating system which is the only reason I store it on my phone.

I’d like to think I will but I try to stay realistic, and if it does only 50% of what it did this year I’ll be happy, with that I should make an extra $30k this year with the meager amount I invest. Not too bad for a 20 year old student so I’d probably take some profits and leave the rest in.
Of course I’ve thought about the math it would take for me to make a million, and it’s not entirely out of the question but still admittedly unlikely. It’d have to take about 3 years for bitcoin to hit 1 million and I’d most likely be on par with that by then. That’s also considering my biweekly investments stay the same, whereas they’ll most likely increase by the end of three years.

Did you mean you have used them?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:09
I’ve used Bitfinex and been able to withdraw and stuff but if the tether things ends up fucking them over then everything could be lost. At the moment it’s no more than speculation on whether or not it will. I’d still recommend switching to Bitmex if it’s available for you or like Bittrex instead which also offers margin I believe.

I was very happy to see that as well. Also appreciated him shouting out a Ledger Nano for safety, spreading the word about securely storing bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:39:41
Well that’s good then, it should be no issue the only positive to gdax over any exchange is no fees on limit orders.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:37:44
I’ve tried shorting bitcoin and made a small increase on my holdings over the past few months (think 10%). However I’ve also lost some trades otherwise I’d be up much much much more.
What is undeniable though is that it’s went up 40% or so the last few months is fiat value, so even if you buy right now and it goes down to 8500 the next second in one month when it’s back up to 11k, then 14k the next month, and so on you won’t be so disappointed.
You have to be patient and accept losses. I personally believe it will continue to rise similarly to how it has been so buying at this point wouldn’t scare me a lot. If you wait a day or two for a dip, I foresee one coming, however if it doesn’t you’ll still likely end up profiting well by the end of 30 days.

From my few months of seeing what other people use I would stick with:
Mycelium, Bread, or Jaxx
All available for iOS and Android to my knowledge.

I don’t think it’s too late if bitcoin is to succeed. I do foresee a drop but I think it’ll pass this point at some point even if it drops back to 4K
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:13:07
I know this is late but just about every wallet gives you a 12 or 24 word key that will allow you to recover it if lost. Say I have my bitcoin stored on an iPhone wallet, I upgrade my phone and sell my old one but stupidly forget to transfer bitcoin off of my wallet.
I open up a wallet app, hit import wallet, and I can use my 12 word key to recover my bitcoin onto the new device.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:04:18
Yes the 12 words are very important and should be kept private

Can’t you lock a wallet and so when you input your private key you then need a password? Could swear that’s how it was when I swept my paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:06:38
Private keys are just generated randomly and I don’t think there’s any sort of database that has every private key that’s been made because that wouldn’t be secure. So it’s possible just not likely because of the amount of possible private keys. Satoshi probably has a password on his though if I had to imagine
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:07:24
Okay so I thought I understood it relatively well I just haven’t looked into it much because, well I don’t use a paper wallet. The private key on my old paper wallet was like another access route if I had the password as well, but there would also be a direct private key? Or am I just overthinking what you said
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:15:26
I don’t get why people keep saying “why tell your wife about your crytpo.” I can only speak for myself and my friends but usually a person’s SO is like their best friend. I told my girlfriend about crypto because we share a house and talk all the time. The system is messed up and it shouldn’t be a question whether she gets any of his crypto, but people shouldn’t hide things from their wives in fear of them using it against them, if you do that you’re probably not in a good relationship.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:38:09
I know that the odds are small that’s why I said it’s possible not likely. But can’t you put a password on your wallet? I could swear when I wiped my paper wallet there was a password after I input private key
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:28:10
Credit card lets you buy on Coinbase easily. There are less fees on their platform gdax with bank deposit though but bank deposit isn’t instant. Those are what I use.
You will have to get your account verified first but it didn’t take me long personally, only like 15 minutes. But I’ve seen other people say differently.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:18:19
I’m sure you can find bitcoin enthusiasts on any sub but it would more than likely be against the subs rules to post bitcoin related topics unless it’s a sub about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:05:24
Probably not until microchipping becomes more acceptable amongst people. Right now I agree that it’ll most likely be in our future but most people don’t like it at the moment.
Also finger prints can be faked and if we’re talking about actually having money on your arm that seems like something people would do
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:22:15
Okay. So the private key on my encrypted paper wallet was just an encrypted version of the REAL key that would then be accessed through the password?
Sorry for all the questions I’m just trying to learn tonight lol
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:16:24
Yes mining constantly becomes less profitable because of difficulty increases unless the price keeps up with the increase in difficulty. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:18:57
So the paper key, the 12 words they gave me, is my private key?
I haven’t purchased a hardware wallet yet, but I plan to eventually, I’m just still in college so until I’m at a more significant amount invested I’m trying to be secure for less than what a hardware wallet will cost me. I’ll look into making a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:44:46
You bought a certain amount of bitcoin, whatever value it is at you still own that amount of bitcoin. So yes unless I misunderstood the question
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:02:08
I don’t care how much money that person made at least I will never be seen in something that ugly

Coinbase is good as an exchange it’s just not advised to store your coins there as they don’t provide your private keys
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:21:35
I use Coinbase, but they also own GDAX which I’ve seen a lot of people recommend as they have smaller fees, however I haven’t tried it yet. I have had no problems withdrawing from Coinbase it just takes the standard few days in order to withdraw to your bank account.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:25:41
I mean I just have a different opinion I guess, but that seems like too much hassle. Don’t tell her now but then how does he explain the large sum of money in the future? She can take him back to court at any time, my mom sure did lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:20:02
I mean I just don’t think it’s a good idea to see your S/O as someone who is out to get you. If you have a lot of money get a prenup, if you make a lot of money while with that person it’d be quite odd to just hide it from them. Then you can’t spend any of the money
