When each puts in their .5 btc, is there an actual blockchain trx?  
  
Also, will LN be generic in that I can put .5 btc into my channel, then did it at, say, 20 different stores/vendors over the course of a few months it will? Or do I need to have a channel open for every single vendor I want to do business with? 
  
The latter seems like it would be MORE inefficient than what we have now because you have to guess how much you might use with that vendor and also have two extra trx for opening/closing the channel.

If you really need it to go through, send another trx (to yourself) using the change output from that transaction, with a higher sat/byte, say 140. The miners will see the new trx dependant on the first and mine the first just to get to the second. It's happened to me before.

Thanks for the explanation. In the example where btc goes to 100,000... It sounds like you've lost 80k, not made 2K. If btc happens to outpace the futures consistently, then you were better off just holding btc. I see how this limits risk, though, and allows you to consistently make a profit.

When they go to settle, isn't this going to result in giant transactions on the blockchain with many too/from addresses, essentially boosting the fee and making the lightning network expensive anyway? The only way I see this gaining any efficiency for bitcoin is if someone is doing transactions with the same person (probably a business) every day or every week. Most cases will be business right? when they try to settle, they will have massive transactions from hundreds of different users on LN, and each user will have a small from trx.  
  
I assume I'm missing some aspect here?

@_date: 2017-08-20 12:26:47
He's saying America is better then England
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:16:23
We'd be lucky to have an internet to move on at that point

I asked a bartender last night if they took bitcoin and she asked "What's Bitcoin...oh is that like a Facebook thing?"... She hadn't even heard of it.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:30:19
My man.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:02:52
I sent it to myself.
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:29:35
Why do you have to wait two blocks
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:11:53
Well every time I wanted to buy more and thought I would if it pulled back... It hasn't. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:03:33
The only time I've bought Bitcoin was when I thought the price was way too high at the time. So far, no regrets!!
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:56:54
Boy did you miss out on some drama!!
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:41:45
Why would it automatically trigger on the other fork? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:15:58
The hash? You're awesome... Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:11:04
Holy shit I think I am too
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:47:13
Better buy $20 of funions and reinvest $180.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:04:17
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:26:52
Then that's not even a hard fork, right? Your just duplicating btc trx on another chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:34:16
Can't you recreate myccelium with the word phrase on another phone (without pin)
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:07:22

Go to r/btc, you'll learn all about the ensuing death spiral.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:20
The comments in this thread confirm my suspicions about this sub. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:30:10
I unloaded the same way. The price there is propped up by day traders trying to play the dumps that happen whenever a block is mined
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:56:05
The amount released decreases every few years.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:53:53
So theoretically the one being mined fastest? What if someone changes The mining algorithm so some shit variation quickly becomes the longest chain after the split? 
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:54:37
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:25:45
But there will be over 20 billion people by the time all Bitcoin is mined
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:28:03
I don't even know how to buy shot with normal cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:08:22

@_date: 2017-11-11 04:58:47
This isn't even something you need to prove. You can send mycelium trx for &lt;$1. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:00:24
Mine says "system uneable to broadcast trx" or something, but only with $0.02 fees. Anything ~$0.20 or bigger gets broadcasted.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:29:15
Absolutely. I'm still buying every few days. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:34:08
Other methods of heating don't create btc
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:02:58
Not great for buying a meal, but it's not like these asshats bitching about paying $20 to move $$. Though most of them are in the place that shall not be mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:21:52
The app
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:21:05
Depending how much you are investing, take the frequency of trx amounts into account
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:28:38
This is the most fucked up thing I've ever seen. Nobody expected you to actually do this. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:45:54
Doesn't this just mean their dollar conversion is wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:42:34
Scaling is THE critical task at hand. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:50:16
It's still Trump's fault. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:38:13
They're mad because it's true
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:41:23
I meant 20 billion people 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:36:26
Pretty sure musk could make his own coinbase instead
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:38:25
If you don't buy Bitcoin, are you gambling?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:06:02
No, he said you were
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:06:12
Your a real gem of a human
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:58:06
I said "to me" as in how I perceive it. I perceive missed opportunity costs as losses. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:16:14
Thanks for an actual response instead of being a dick like everyone else!
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:51:17
To me, missing perceived future profits is a loss
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:24
Pretty nice house

This will be a feature of decentralized crpto currencies. Get used to it.

It's not stupid to not initially have knowledge. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:09:27
I would not tell her. If you have to, don't use exact numbers. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:19:14
Thanks. Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:07:22
Bill Nye is also preaching that it's normal to change genders. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:44:48

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:20:41
Yeah I was just noticing they are all out of order
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:04:29
Absolutely worth it just for learning how to buy and hold
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:13:08
Delta is more smooth. Blockfolio didn't refresh on its own.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:21:47
Blockfolio doesn't refresh when I pull up the app, I have to close and reopen. With Delta I don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:24:39
That inspired me... Just bought $500 more
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:29:11
Are you trying to leave or ride it out?
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:30:10
Are they still waiting for the flippeming?

If they shut off immigration it will be much better for them than EU

There aren't as many of us Trump supporters in here as you think, op.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:28:22
What do you mean by you people? Quit marginalizing those who sold their 8mb block coin after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:29:00
To avoid overhead fees you should buy $300/month
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:41:08
But r/dollar doesn't even exist

Ok so you know the time length when you lend them
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:34:56
That's the basic premise of all investments, yes.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:05:32
Half a million currently shorted? No way...

And the alt right doesn't give a fuck what you think of it
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:30:47
Try with fake money first. Keep a fake balance and write down your trading prices as well as why you made each decision to trade. See if your decision making skills are good.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:37:06
It's 2018, why wouldn't you

Mfw I regret not talking an equity loan on my house
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:59:13
Which country/cities is this easiest in?
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:08:10
This.... I've made see money off alts but would have made more just staying in btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:10:03
In America, that is a figure of speech, not a literal behavior (necessarily)

Don't feel bad for anyone cheering for btc to have a "death spiral"
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:05:26
I was probably going to eat it one way or the other so fuck it
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:37:43
Forget to switch accounts? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:00:46
Agreed.

This is a flat out false claim, you are taking his statements out of context... Why should anyone listen to someone who believes media and can't reason/look into something themselves?
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:07:19
The average IQ.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:49:10
If you waited until $1500 to "panic sell" then that is a feat in itself.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:39:36
A side of beef?
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:20:55
I'm in the same boat right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:19:26
Depends entirely on your total wealth, current income, and day to day expenses. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:38:00
Thanks for actually answering my question. Apparently half the people here are rude bastards. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:07:52
You're truly an idiot
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:13:40
In general, you don't tell anyone how much money you have, ever. Not even your wife. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:23:34
Learn how the technology and blockchain work. Once I realized how btc actually works I couldn't stop myself from buying it. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:13:47
Very fake currency
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:32:32
You close yourself off from a lot of donors who don't do crypto
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:34:59
How can it be worthless, isn't it just current bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:53:20
Yeah, focus on a Swype discrepancy.

What the fuck does that have to do with anything?

"technical analysis"
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:50:13
Fuck you, if I really thought the price would suffer permanently I wouldn't be asking about the safety of holding would I? Why have the currency at all if normal people who don't fully understand everything about the software can't even ask about it? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:43:17
If I hold, and two chains persist, do I just have btc + btu indefinitely?
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:56:28
If they know your wallet address can't they track everything anyway?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:58:11
Livid over 11$?
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:54:47
Sounds like mycelium is also up to speed...
  
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:00:58
If you just hold, won't your legacy coins become segwit anyway? Why do you have to exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:06:13
Your retarded. I think that's the second time you've called me a troll when I wasn't trolling. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:24:15
If segwit can't die, are the only two options having a split chain or else legacy dies?
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:40:00
Thanks, I can't be the only one with a subpar understanding who wants to make sure holding is fine.
