Well tranditional Socialism refers to state socialism and libertarian socialism refers to anarcho-communism. There's also reformism and revolutionary-socialism. With the progression of Karl Marx and what he (and most socialist socialist today rally for) envisioned was the perfect state running an economy where everyone got equal outcome in life. The problem with that is it has to be enforce using the threat of violence over a nation. 
Libertarian Socialists or anarcho-communists would believe that the people should be the ones enforcing equal outcome and that everyone should do their bit to ensure others follow. (In my opinion this is much harder and way more unachievable).
I personally am in the middle with anarcho-sydicalism backed by crypto-anarchy and social credit. It allows for free market but it also places a high value of public needs so that it insentivises people to provide social services for others in the exchange of social credit which can be used like money. We already have systems like this in place so it's the only thing I've seen with actual potential. Poly centric law would be put in place of state law and "arbitrators" aka judges would have social reputation that is public so that you can have a choice of seeing whivh judge has the most fair settlements. There's a lot more that can be talk about the problems that may come up, but I feel the burden of proof is always on the person arguing for the removal of state, when we just take for granted that government works. When it clearly doesn't.
