Wow, a de-centralised wallet, immune to raids ?!

Someone send him some beggar-coin to his bowl-wallet.

But they would have to catch them first. And if they could, then it wouldn't be 'concealed'.

Me too. I'm planning the same. BTC succeeds as an investment but fails as a viable currency (considering all the time it has had). I just hope i'm out before the bubble pops.

At this rate, even Western Union is cheaper, and I'm not even in the US.

It will dip. They always do.

Talk about comedy, there's a nude milf image just below this on my reddit feed.

A million what though ?

There was a fork and anyone who had bitcoin got the equivalent bitcash.

Jeez, to think what kind of influence he used to have over markets around the globe . When I get to that age, I'm just gonna keep my gob shut.

My Jedi mind tricks don't work here.

This is ridiculous.
Twice I overpaid via BitPay.
The first time was BitGuard $7.xx, ended up as $14.?? via BitPay.
The second time,
$26.80 at site
$28.?? on mis-leading BitPay portal panel.
$32.95 actually sent by wallet.
What the hell??

"..you can buy fractions of a bitcoin"
'er, Okayy... So do you want a blowjob or don't you ?'
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:30:38
Er, because it's not really your wallet ?

They're not all on their dream holidays by the pool ?

Governments can control gold.

You got free entertainment, what more do you want ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:35:16
Should've said 4 cents.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:33:31
But all the shitcoins are doing the same, so what's the difference ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:21:10
Wrong sub, -&gt; r/jokes.

He thought you had a cold.

Many accept fiat. It's getting it back that's the problem. A lot of them are scams, they don't sit on deposits, they use it for something else.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:16:25
A hundred pound is not a lot, even back then.
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:46:19
No way. Chinese govt is dead against bitcoin. No one there would dare do such a thing.

Futures market pricing depends on Rational Pricing. Since there is no interest rate with BTC, time is not a factor. The only other variable left over (apart from Expectation) is Arbitrage. Therefore the price differerence reflects the amount you need to pay to get your cash from Mt.Gox to another market.
