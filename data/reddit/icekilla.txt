The dollar value has steadily decreased. Every month the banks get bailed out with printed money. You know what happens when someone prints money. And gives it out? Prints more and gives more? The dollar is falling(value) compare it to other currency's and tell me how its faired.

Im confused by this:" Department in order to get a clear answer, declaring that since Bitcoin is classified as a property by the IRS, it cannot be traded for alcohol."
Hows it property? Lol we cant physically hold the "bit" we cant throw it at each other... its a currency... so dolla bills cant be used to buy shit?

How do you feel with the drop in value from China making it illegal there to use that tender.? Do you feel if the value will climb back up? Or a steady decline is what will happen?
