You are what I dislike about this sub . . . this is not analysis.  
  
You throw out some isolated facts, gathered from the front pages of the FT / WSJ / etc as cover for you knowing what you're talking about.  
  
1. Yes the Swiss National Bank made a huge profit. But this is a rare event, and it recently lost a lot as well. Have a look [here]( But that aside, just because it made a huge profit, is not proof that it is buying bitcoin. This is your opinion, with *no evidence*. Pure supposition.   
  
2. China have not started to purchase oil with Yuan, that is their long-term goal. What they did is launch a Yuan based futures contract for [crude oil]( This is a major concern for the dollar, as China is hoping to move the world from being dollar dependent, to being yuan dependent. *HOWEVER* this is a good 50-100 years away. And no . . . dollars won't be 'removed' from the market, what crap. There will be less demand for dollars. Big difference. Where did you get your Econ training? But you don't answer with a yuan denominated world would be bullish for bitcoin? You assume that this transition happens instantly. But if it happens gradually, like happened when we moved off the British Pound, then it may have zero impact on bitcoin.  
  
3. US has a lot of debt, it will implode . . . EU is fucked . . . this is not analysis. Both may remain true for another 100 years. Then what? You advising people here to hold bitcoin for 100yrs? For their grandchildren sure, but as an investment strategy, that's pretty fucking stupid advised. Have you seen [Japan's debt-to-GDP]( Well it is at 240% more than double that of the US and has been over 200% for more than a decade. As Japan will most likely do, the US may well do as well, simply monetise the debt. With no implosion. Others are pushing for a global debt jubilee. Who knows? But, implosion is not the only route. But my analysis doesn't support what you are trying to sell.
    
4. It has a true chance of becoming a gold competitor? Yeah, based on that great insight, it also has a true chance of not becoming a competitor. I happen to be bullish BTC long-term, but I'm not so narrow in my thinking. At this point, we do not know.   
  
Personally, I believe crypto is here to stay, in one form or another. Now whether that it bitcoin or some other successor, who knows? I think it is likely bitcoin but more as an alternative asset, and a few others serving as currencies.  
  
But please, unless you can offer real and original analysis, don't spew news headlines to look smart.

Yes because you can't get passed the chip on your shoulder to have a discussion, which doesn't involve hating on bankers. They suck, we get it.  
  
So can we discuss the fact that Japan hasn't official recognise bitcoin as legal tender?  
  
No, because you are like a one cell amoeba, who can only repeat words given to him by someone else. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:38:28
No one said it "needs" to be recognised. People like you are so boring. Broken records, not capable of a normal conversation. We get it, bitcoin will fuck banking. Able to hold a conversation on anything else? No. Ever had an original thought? No.

To stay on task:  
  
We agree, credentials are not relevant.  
  
So let me ask you this: why does average Joe feel unqualified to weigh in on technical medical decisions, or say, the technicalities of building a bridge, but when it comes to matters of economics, everyone knows the answer?  
  
The point I was trying (poorly) to make, is that people in general, form opinions regarding economics, without being properly informed. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:35:43
I have stated MANY times, that:  
  
1. I am pro-crypto   
2. Disagree with fractional reserve banking  
  
But the people "running" the system, are not doing it to "scam" people. It is a system which has developed, which they (wrongly) believe is the right system. Believe it or not, I  know many economists, who deeply want to make the world better, and in actual fact, despite their efforts being misguided, spend most of their working life to improve the system.  
  
Remind me, what do you do? Ah yes, call all economists and bankers frauds, and buy bitcoin.   
  
Ooohhhh you rebel you! Massive contribution there.   
  
Tell you what, when you can understand why you cannot forecast non-linear dynamical systems, then come back to me with your critiques of modern finance.  
  
Until then, shut the fuck up you ignorant loser.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:45:42
What an idiotic and irrelevant comment.  
Him having shorted the pound, had nothing to do with his belief regarding fiat currency.

You're all the same broken records . . . fiat dead, take down the banks blah blah blah. Not a single original thought.  
  
EDIT: I am actually pro-crypto, it is just not my religion.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:51:02
1. I never assumed this subreddit was full of economists, that is your false assumption. But when people try make economics based arguments, I kinda assume they know economics. This was less of an assumption on my part, than basic logic. I don't debate issues on physics, because I am not a physicist. Maybe don't debate the merits of a deflationary system, if you have no clue what you're talking about? 
  
2. So can we move away from fiats becoming obsolete? You keep on returning to this, I never once claimed this would happen. So if we assume fiats remain the dominant currencies, why could a crypto not succeed? I see none.
  
3. Yes, there are real technical limitations to bitcoin become a means of payment, which is personally why I believe it is more likely to operate as a 'commodity' than currency, gold vs. USD. If / when volatility is no longer an issue, then store of value is not an issue. This is demand / adoption dependent. Will volatility be resolved . . . this is a guess. I believe it will be, over time. If it is resolved, then price and hence value, will be far more stable. 
  
4. There is massive competition in the crypto eco system currently, with many coins working to resolve the limitations / constraints of bitcoin. I think it is a little naive to believe that not a single contender will emerge as a potential mainstream digital settlement currency. Can cryptos currently compete with traditional payment networks? No. But there is enough money and collective IQ being thrown at the problem, that the odds of a positive outcome are rather high.

My issue was, with how people 'agree' with ideas, when they are not 'qualified' to assess the merits of the idea.

You obviously don't read anything outside of this sub . . . because some of the biggest names in finance are busy setting up crypto funds. Here we have [George Soros]( then we have [Novogratz]( who hired a Goldman exec for a crypto fund.  
  
Remind me again how mainstream finance is 'shunning' it? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:25:47
You confuse what they say in public, and what they are doing behind the scenes.  
  
The Bank of England has an entire department dedicated to crypto currencies. The ECB has research teams on this. There are many crypto focused funds being created.  
  
I don't argue that they plan to adopt tomorrow. And the volatility IS an issue, but increased adoption will lead to a drop in volatility, and as that happens, more mainstream finance peeps will come in line.  
  
Still early days in my opinion, but my point is, that it is being looked at very closely, way more than 5yrs ago. That everyone in finance does not agree, does not change this fact.  
  
You cannot convert an ENTIRE industry overnight.

Straw man argument.  
AND I never got a response to my initial question.  
  
Let me put it to you another way:  
  
If we're going to debate the risk of running a particle accelerator, should we let Joe from down the road, with a 5th grade education, decide if it is safe or not?  
  
Or I know, the neurosurgeon won't decide if it is safe to operate or not, no no, we'll ask the husband who is a CPA, if the doctor should open the wife's head up.    
  
You know, because of all the stuff you said . . .

That wasn't my point . . . a PhD quantum physicist may make a point about quantum entanglement, and I say "I agree" but am I qualified to agree?  
  
Lay people never venture into fields like engineering, or physics, or medicine, to offer their opinions, yet somehow, everyone has a PhD in economics suddenly.  
  
And for the record, one can both be educated in economics, and agree the system is broken. But then at least, you are doing it from a basis of fact.
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:15:39
You have an ability to avoid key points (intentional or not)?  
And to say a lot without saying anything.

All the best.  
  
P.S. I didn't bother reading your 4 points, not worth it, because you fall into the category of individual devoid of original thought, but rather, resorts to regurgitating work you have read. Ad hominem? Yip. And I am fine with that. In Taleb form, I call an idiot an idiot. I challenge real insight, not garbage. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:22:55
Currently, yes.  
But I believe long-term volatility will dissipate.  
Broad adoption will happen, and once the majority of a crypto currency is used and not simply held, then it will function more like a traditional currency.

Sure, go with that . . .   
  
Has nothing to do with the fact that you've never studied or read Friedman's work, never knew about the k% rule, but feel 'qualified' to debate the merits of a deflationary paradigm.  
  
Oh, hey . . . I've never studied physics, but I think quantum mechanics is BS. Look how smart I am?  
  
As per Taleb: you're a schmuck, I don't waste my time with schmucks. Educated yourself first, then come back to me.  
  
I don't debate random fools on the road, or on reddit.

Good day Sir.

Honestly? Too much invested in the system, and too much inertia.  
I don't think it changes until the system collapses under its own weight.  
  
After x amount of financial crises, people will have had enough, and change will be forced. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:58:43
So . . . I'm actually an economist, and am well aware of the issues concerning deflation.  
  
To be clear, I am not arguing that it will become a national currency, i.e. replacing the USD or EUR for instance.  
  
But, I do believe that a crypto currency (whether it is bitcoin or another one) will become a means of payment (once volatility drops).  
  
Or a 'currency' becomes an alternate asset class, but again with low volatility, and being used as a means of payment.  
  
But as to the 'deflationary' issue, I have often thought about this. Inflation pushes us to spend now, sure (in simplistic terms). And yes, in a deflationary paradigm there is a push to spend later. *BUT* and for me there is a big but. If the entire system is deflationary, people cannot delay purchasing indefinitely. If I need a car . . . I may hold off a month, or a year . . . but what, I will wait 50yrs? House? If I need a shirt, or a new suit, will I wait forever to purchase it?  
  
My belief is, that the delayed spending related to deflation, is when it takes place within a paradigm of inflation. But if the dominant paradigm is deflation, people will be forced to spend out of need.  
  
The truth of the matter is, we have never 'tested' (for obvious reasons) a deflationary paradigm and seen how the system adjusts. 
  
Also . . . the truth of a fixed-growth-rate money supply, as suggested by Friedman, is in and off itself, not entirely deflationary. Rather, it allows for periods of inflation and deflation, as prices fluctuate around the growth of money supply. So some areas of the economy will show inflation, others deflation.  
  
I am not aware of any literature which purports to show or prove (even theoretically) that a fixed-growth money supply leads to overall and constant deflation? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:00:19
and are either intentionally missing the point, or unintentionally, I suspect the latter. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:52:35
You're like a dog with a bone, and blinkers. Just as bad as all the pro cryptos-no-matter-what.  
I was engaging in an intellectual discussion.
  
1. I never said cryptos would replace fiats.  
2. I never said a deflationary paradigm would replace an inflationary paradigm.   
3. You also skip over many of my more salient points, such as Friedman's k% rule. I'll assume you're not formally educated in economics? I say this simple because, you are making 'economic' arguments, but simply ignored a reference to one of our greatest economic minds?   
  
I see no reason why a deflationary paradigm would not work (assuming we started with it, or could displace an inflationary one).  
There is a lot to be said for Friedman's rule, and again, it by no means implies that deflation is a constant state.  
Look into it.  
  
*EDIT*: Who said anything about the USD failing? When it drops out of favour, most likely it with be the CNY to take over. But again, you've completely skimmed over my general argument as to why deflation may not necessarily be as bad as it is made out to be, and how the issues with deflation, may well only be an issue in an inflation paradigm.  
  
Whether bitcoin (or another crypto?) becomes a 'currency' (i.e. means of payment, low volatility etc) and functions as an adjunct to other fiats, or becomes a 'commodity' and functions as an adjunct to gold . . . who knows? Time will tell.

I know how the system works, I actually studied it, and work in it, and also happen to be critical of it (I do not support fractional reserve banking). I also believe we should follow Friedman's idea of the k%  money growth rule (an idea taken forward in some form by most crypto currencies). But then you get into the whole velocity of money issue, not to mention potential pitfalls of endless deflation (see Japan).   
  
But my question was, if the OP who wrote the comment, has any clue what they're talking about? They agreed? Ok. Are they informed enough to agree?  
  
Or just a sheep nodding his head? Because that is my impression of 80% of the people in this sub - the closest they have come to studying economics, is looking up the definition in the dictionary.
