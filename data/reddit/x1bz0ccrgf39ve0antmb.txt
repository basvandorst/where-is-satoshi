You can also not prove shit and buy/transact BTC without thinking like thousands of people do every day.
Then you ARE fucked because you choose a public ledger. Enjoy your blacklisted coins.

Classic example of SHUM. 
This is why I'm never going to try spend BTC or any other surveillance coin, you're just ASKING for trouble. Surveillance coins like BTC should be secret investments and nothing more.

More LN users = lower fees.
Basically nobody is using it yet so this is as high as fees will get.

Eth doesn't seem that great to me, when i tried to sell all my eth last year i was left with 0.05 Eth i am unable to move... It doesn't do a good job at functioning like money imo, also there is no privacy which is creepy and depressing. Eth is basically a giant surveillance machine for the government right now.

This is why Monero exists. A good example of how a public ledger can screw you.
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:41:36


Dynamic blocksize apparently.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:07:45


With Monero the network capacity flexes up under pressure, and fees actually become lower with more usage. (This is the opposite of how BTC works, where increases in usage just make things slower and more expensive.) Monero could handle all of today's bitcoin traffic without building a queue and perhaps with lower fees.

Any chance of an FDroid release?
Apps i can only get through Google Play are creepy. :(

How do you get these fees in Australia when buying BTC?
Every place i know of charges an arm and a leg for moving BTC, it sucks.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:37:10
List exactly what wallets and exactly what exchanges NOW.
No good at all saying "urrrhhhh there's lower fees, you're just not doing it right!". Actually explain how you useless fuckers.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:47:08
Is there ANY real advice out there on how to get these low fees?
*crickets chirping*
Edit: So there is still absolutely nowhere in OZ to experience these low fees. :(
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:33:08
Uhh, spoiler alert, you reveal your BTC balance simply by using BTC.
If you want to hide how much crypto you have that's more of an XMR thing.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:15:33


Okay smart guy, please explain how i get on Bittrex without using a Google script. Oww wait i can't...


There are a lot of websites and services that literally won't work without 3rd party Google scripts. So yes.


Being able to watch Youtube? So how do i contact someone on their Google phone without Google knowing? That's another question you haven't been able to answer. :P
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:26:02
It's incredibly similar to BTC, i would prefer an alt that did something new like ETH or XMR.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:04:39
Easier said then done, google has trackers in most websites, a lot of exchanges don't run without google scripts, +80% of phones have Google spyware on them, they own youtube, and soon they'll have cameras in cars all over the street.
How can you avoid them completely? You can't. A public blockchain isn't going to do anything to protect you from them, Google will track every single thing you ever do with BTC, and they'll do it for the tiniest amount of money.

Will we see intentional suppression of security tools like we see with big email providers? (gmail)
Email honestly sucks, yet we are so entrenched in it. :(

People who do not wish to use cuckware made by Facebook.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:10:18
By standing near other people with Google phones/cars? For wanting to access the internet? So you expect me to never leave the house or talk to anyone else ever again and never access the websites other people are interested in?
You're a legit spastic if you think you can just 'avoid' Google and live a normal life.

It doesn't, at all. The title of this thread is stupid.

Can i get a link for these last 2?

Signal &gt; Whatsapp
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:25:56


Umm, it should be noted BTC has extremely bad privacy at the moment. It's practically a surveillance tool that will be used by governments and big data brokers to spy on you in ways never done before. Want to obfuscate your BTC history? It's difficult, traditional tumblers only swap your blacklisted coin for other blacklisted coin.
LN may have some good privacy features, eventually. But that's years away.
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:02:45
I'm sure more than 0.00001% of your nation is on Signal, it's probably like ~0.01%. Try converting people, at least the ones you care about. :)
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:40:03


It's neither. The kind of world your suggesting we live in is pretty fucked up, what stops:
- Big data brokers like Facebook/Google stalking me through the blockchain and selling financial data about me?
- My family peering into my finances without my consent.
- Businesses changing there prices on me to target my income level.
- The pizza dude that just came to my house seeing that i have 1 million bucks worth of btc hidden in a Ledger under my mattress.
We need blockchains with a similar amount of privacy to old school cash, and i worry Bitcoin might never be that private.
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:24:36
Usually they get swapped into the XMR chain and disappear after that.
This isn't a BTC feature though, it's using another anon coin to rinse a public one. Which works, but you have to realize BTC cannot do this trick on its own.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:05:32
Avoid all that botnet shit bro.

Good time to remind everyone Microsoft is a PRISM partner and a component of big brother.
What is M$ doing with BCH? Seems inappropriate such a guilty company should be allowed anywhere near existing blockchains.

They probably want to backdoor it like all their modern CPUs.

Why anyone would want such a terrible device in their homes is beyond me. You realize Amazon is a government surveillance partner right? And this thing listens to everything in your home?
I'd feel very unwelcome if i walked into a home and saw one of these things, i would have to ask that it be taken outside or the batteries be remove or I'd have to leave.
If you own one of these then %$ you, for real, there's a lot of bad shit in the world and you're just a part of it. You're device is bad and you should feel bad!

Note BTC is one of the least private ways you can pay for a VPN. Those gift cards you see in store are better.
