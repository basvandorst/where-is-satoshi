I did read about P2Pool, but the problem with that is friction.  From what I understand, it's a lot more work and overhead to implement that than to just join a pool.   My suggestion was to take P2Pool, or something like that, and bake it into the protocol itself.   That way you can attach your miner to the network in the same manner that nodes attach to the network, but you don't have to set up a full node.  If there's no way to easily allow miners to just join the bitcoin network itself as a pool, then user-operated pools can still be used but at least there would no longer be an incentive to join the biggest pool, since every miner/pool active gets a share of the awarded block.

The music industry backs artists that they believe will be popular.  They only make money when they actually promote artists that have talent, charisma, and the ability to put on a good concert, etc and create music that people actually want to listen to.  They can't take someone with no talent, who writes music that no one wants to listen to, and make them into a top selling artist just because they make a bigger chunk of the profits off him.  Just like they can't kill kill a top artist's success by refusing to sell their records.

Yes, over time bad performance could affect value, but what I'm saying is that performance loss due to lack of hashpower is not going to happen in the first place.   If bitcoin is more profitable to mine than bitcoin2x, then at least some miners will mine it, which will eventually force even the most dedicated hold outs to mine it as well, or continue to suffer financial losses and be outcompeted.

I have the same problem.  Since you can't withdraw anything without getting basic verification, best not to deposit anything there until they get that fixed.

UPDATE:  I was able to verify today using SMS.  I think there SMS feature was just down yesterday.   According to this  they will start accepting BCC deposits in a few hours, though you won't be able to trade them before 20 confirms on the BCC blockchain.

No, because they don't have that power.  That assumes the value of the coin is just the percentage of hash power is allocated to it.  If that were the case, the miners could have made their darling BCH into a success and siphoned away all the value of bitcoin by simply moving all their hash power to it.

Joe Rogan should bring Andreas Antonopolous on again on his next episode, so he can debunk Peter's arguments.  It would be even better if he had them on together.

What, and you think Roger does?   Bitcoin early adopters seem to fall into 3 main categories:
1) Cryptography / cypherpunk geeks
2) Libertarian / austrian economist / goldbug types
3) Right-place-at-the-right-time silk road druggies
A lot of the devs are both  and   Trace and Roger are clearly just  and in Roger's case maybe a little

Why can't you send a separate BTC transaction for each separate address in the source wallet?  If the transaction amount exactly matches the balance of an address in the wallet(minus fees), then it should source it from just the one address right?  
If for some reason the wallet logic does not source the transaction by preferring a single address, then alternatively, on Ledger Nano S (and I assume the other popular HD wallets) you can use the backup phrase on an offline computer with a copy of one of the BIP44 web applications (copied via USB) to get your list of addresses and public/private keys, which can then be imported into a software wallet with coin control.

Can you not use this tool  to get your private keys using the backup recovery phrase?  I believe there are similar tools on github.   I believe all you would have to do is:
1. Save the entire website as an HTML page
2. Copy it via USB to an offline only computer
3. Load it in the browser on the offline computer
4. Enter your backup recovery phrase
5. Save a copy of the addresses and private keys extracted from the tool to a file.
6. Import the addresses and private keys into electrum or something for more fine grained control over the transactions, or 
You can use  to create the transactions manually on your desktop, and then run a copy of  on your offline computer to sign the transaction, copy to USB, and broadcast on the online computer.

BitInstant has finally resolved my issue, and sent the missing funds to my MTGox account.   I recently tried their service again.   This time I used the send funds to bitcoin address option.   It worked well, and I had my money in less than 30 minutes.  Their transaction page however, does not tell you what the purchase price will be.  I was able to find out by reading through the blog posts on their site that they buy it from MTGox at the market price as soon as the order goes through.   If you use their service make sure you double check all the information you enter, most importantly your account number (or bitcoin address), and your email address.  There's not really anything they are doing to validate the data so be extra cautious.

8 days since I submitted this and no resolution.   They gave me an MTGox coupon code which did NOT work, and have not responded to me since then.   I contacted MTGox about the coupon code, and they acknowledged there was a problem, but said that BitInstant would have to resolve it, and that they've forwarded it to BitInstant.  No response so far from BitInstant.   I have sent a PM to the bitinstant user on reddit as well, with all my info, and no response.   Multiple emails to their support as well.   Supposedly some users are getting helped, but there are many more like myself who have been ignored for days.   My order ID is 47989a7d-3a7c-486f-9058-1bb06326dc20.

I have sent you two PM's, one 10 days ago, one earlier today, both ignored.   Is the secret to getting a response posting publicly?   I tried that too, but maybe just not enough times.   I was issued an MTGox coupon code last week, which did not work.  I suspect you guys issued it for the wrong account number, or the coupon was just invalid, I don't know.   I contacted MTGox and they said they forwarded the issue to you, and that BitInstant would need to issue me another coupon code, as there was a problem with the first one.   My Order ID is 47989a7d-3a7c-486f-9058-1bb06326dc20.  It has been over 10 days now.

I have not yet had my $500 deposit credited, and it has been over a week.  This is my order ID 47989a7d-3a7c-486f-9058-1bb06326dc20.  It would be great to get this resolved today finally.

I double checked my spam folder, and unfortunately there were no messages from Bitinstant (or MTGox).   I have received emails from both companies before without it going to spam, but I will keep checking spam folder anyway.  They just aren't responding right now.  When did you last deal with them?  I had sent another deposit through them two weeks earlier, and it went through just fine.  Never even needed to deal with their support until this last Thursday.

Is this really a big deal?  The pool doesn't represent a single entity.   Its total hashrate is the aggregate of many individuals and/or small companies who voluntarily contribute their hashing power to the pool.   Should btcguild go rogue or get compromised, wouldn't most members immediately leave and join another pool?
