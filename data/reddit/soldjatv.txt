you sell now you loose, its far from crashing anytime soon it will spike back up, I'm still holding but I mean longterm if it continue like that and nobody fix it asap I believe btrash will win because it has better functionality upgrade doing well with transactions they could later on develop the lightning and implemented and mainly because its corrupted. Bitcoin cap is 220b and btrash is 40b these mafia can easily pour more billions into btrash to win the fight.

maybe block size increase and then add 2and layer solution like LN in btrash isn'T functionally better than btc ? we all want bitcoin to win, but we know who control the market, btc millionaires, hodlers don't have enough power to fight against btrash a corrupted coin supported by the big players.

 i don't think a 200B+ currency that dropped almost 50% in value can be that trusted. 
Btrash is corruped by government and big players they can easely win the fight by pouring billions in it and btc hodlers have no power against them. and btc is useless rn.
