The theft showed everyone that the big companies in Bitcoin will do what takes the least amount of effort. Everyone knew Bitfinex wasn't secure and ran with the bare minimum. And it was the most popular! Mostly because the customers themselves will do the least amount of effort also. Any time your Bitcoin is exposed to the internet you are at risk of losing it. For a currency whose main purpose is to be used with the Internet this seems pretty damn worthless. You can keep your coins in cold storage and you'll be able to gain a lot more "collectibles" as the small pool of individuals into this hobby realize they're worth the same as Beanie Babies. Widespread adoption isn't happening.

Apples and Oranges. You can cancel credit card or dispute transactions. That's a main "feature" of Bitcoin to not make that possible.

This isn't an update we know all this.

What does any of this mean for crypto? Is it bad for Bitcoin or is it just bad for Jihan?

By nature the difficulty resets to the hashpower of the network. Was it not the purpose to distribute these miners to the general public? Aside from the BCash incident Bitmain has been nothing but selfish and a bad actor in the Bitcoin space.

Good mathing thanks for the discussion. Still a lot to consider moving forward.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:17:42
Ok I think I see. Looking at the graph linked I'm the article then the next two in line are BTC.top and Slushpool. They currently sit at 10% but losing Bitmain may accelerate them to 50+%?

Lots of fear. In the trading collective of people are noticing less confidence they the price will rise. I say it's a collective because they are all individuals like you all scared about a drop in price. But that doesn't mean it will or won't. The advice I got the other day was if you are relying on that money to live then sell it to pay bills or have an emergency fund that's not in bitcoin. Otherwise when it drops and you sell the traders got free money. Listen to the first rule though and don't put your grocery money in Bitcoin.

What if it's the other way around and Bitcoin was the guinea pig? There was brief discussion on here about changing the POW to return power to the people running GPUs. That's already the case on Litecoin. ASICs exist, but I think the general public could still compete there. Seems like a chance to spread out consensus.

Technically every day brings us closer to an announcement so lets keep posing it every single frickin day.
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:07:23
Twelve hours gone by and no announcement. Try posting again tomorrow it'll be right.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:26:10
I submitted this exact same thing two days ago and it was removed. Guess some guy on twitter has to say it in order to talk about it.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:44:50
Seems like it's on purpose to create a frenzy. About makes me want to quit Bitcoin altogether when all these exchanges do is let us down.

Logging in for the fourth time now. Keep seeing "access token revoked" on the app and then having to go through everything to allow device access all over again.

It makes sense to me. Otherwise I'm linking my bank account to Bitstamp which I am not certain of the legality. CB when it works sends money right to my bank account.

The best thing might be killing off this stupid meme. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:18:47
I read that on the back. To avoid this do you just call and cancel?
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:40:13
Hope you got 'em bro.

I've been having problems all morning. Just after reading this post it came back for a moment, but now getting time out errors again.
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:29:11
This is .01 value afterwards right?

IDK gotta be pretty dense to assume there is no sensitive info here
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:33:08
Haven't seen the movie. Should this have spoiler tag? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:35:42
Probably is and this ass spoiled it
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:53:18
When has this happened before? Oh you're so wise to be a seasoned veteran of a drop two times larger than the whole of the ATH in 2015. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:18:08
Does this make sense? Coinbase is against higher blocks and its because they have to pay more fees and that impacts their business? As an individual, higher fees don't bother me. I support long term solutions. 
There are measures within Bitcoin to support change and voting through installing the software of the node you support. (And through mining? Correct me.) I consider them to be separate groups that have their own agendas. In the meeting it gave me confidence as a (probably too heavily) invested individual that they had come to see the same path with minimal impact on usability and price. 
Maybe I'm too conservative but beyond short term higher fees I don't see any need for change.

Never had it before. Thanks for the cheer. See you next year!
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:09:29
Any other Bitcoin apps out there on the App store (not including Wallets) that people know about? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:26:41
Thanks. So this means unless they have greater than %50 hashpower (unlikely) there's no way they will become the longest chain and "undo" transactions from the Segwit chain?
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:55:40
Would you mind explaining what promise? I'm aware that BIP 91 has pushed into effect that will reduce the threshold for "consensus". (and rejects blocks not signaling segwit?) Seems like there's still a trick up their sleeve that won't reach even the lower threshold.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:08:47
Please explain. Are you just saying as a technicality that BCC would therefore be an altcoin and not a "fork"? Because even then I think you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:49:46
Quick! Post the up guy now for some sweet easy karma! 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:17:05
Why should I gossip? Your post says nothing about them and I've never heard of them.
