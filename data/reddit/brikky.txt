I mean I'm glad their support helped you out, but it's pretty shitty it has to come to this to get a solution. Especially with such a large amount being put at risk.

There are exchanges here, but the government is making it harder and harder to buy bitcoin - especially locally. If you have an international bank account sure it's easy, but harder if you don't.
Besides that lots of exchanges have their websites blocked - even Chinese ones. 
Compounded by the fact that bitcoin has been officially banned like what, 5-6 times now? I wouldn't be surprised if greater lengths are taken to prevent its growth.

I had a smaller withdrawal go through after 3 days. I originally signed up thinking they were US based as a way to get money out of China. The second time was just poor brainpower and I forgot they weren't based in the US because it had been a few months.

There are anonymous ways to get them. An exchange is not one - they're designed to serve the masses and as such have to protect their butts legally.
The main reason it's taking so long is because all of the exchanges are being inundated with new signups jumping on the hype.

Netflix is blocked in China. Bitcoin is already a grey area, let's not tempt fate.

Bitcoin is most certainly censored in China.
It's getting harder and harder to buy as well, as the government doesn't like the idea of people being able to quickly, easily, and cheaply send money out of country.

I just started using bitcoin and they were listed in an (old) article somewhere as a BC/USD exchange. :c
