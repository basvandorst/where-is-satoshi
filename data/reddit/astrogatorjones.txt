That's like, uh, your opinion man. 
But really, you don't get to decide what is valuable to the public. The public does so by allocating resources through market exchanges. And currently, the public seems to disagree with you that Bitcoin doesn't need this much energy to run, since people are allocating resources in a way that enables this to happen.

I live in São Paulo and been using exchanges for the last 4 years. I have never heard of them
