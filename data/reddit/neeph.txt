An idea: What if the age of the coins was linked with the exchange rate? Newer coins that are used to fund the exchange account are automatically worth less than older coins, and are traded with a relative discount below the standard rate.
This will discourage traders from buying and selling, and encourage veterans to share the wealth and build an economy.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:05:30
Free market, sure, but why do we need this volatility at this stage? The current situation does not represent true supply and demand.
Mt. Gox is merely a gambling site at the moment. It's a fun game, to watch as well as to take part of, but I prefer lower prices, more stability, more people exchanging coins by doing commerce and consumption.
@_date: 2013-03-22 11:07:08

I'm in NYC for a week, returning home tomorrow, and I just came back from the EVR club. I'm a bit too old for a dance club on a Friday night, and the $100 minimum bar tap price was a little ridiculous, but I'm really glad I went there and helped the Bitcoin economy a bit.
It was really funny on the way in, the guards didn't know what I was talking about, and they referred me to Alex (a different one, not the owner), who smiled and told them "oh, it's this Bitcoin thing that Alex is doing", then took me inside and whispered something into the sexy bartender's ear and told me she'd take care of me. 
The payment process was smooth. Alex was so geeked out, I guess, that he asked someone to take a picture of us when I came to pay the bill. I just scanned a QR code off his mini iPad using my blockchain.info wallet app. I only had like 0.43BTC on me (worth about $60) so I paid the rest with my credit card, which actually took longer to process. 
Anyway, it was a good feeling. Glad I did it.

Whoa. 
First of all, first time I heard about [Colored Coins]( Very creative! I've read a little about Fellow Traveler's ideas, and I find the Open Transactions / Smart Property field very interesting. I'm also a big fan of Meni Rosenfeld, who spearheads the Israeli bitcoin scene.
I find myself amazed, again and again, day after day, about the possibilities bitcoin and the block chain enable.

Since some of the repeated nonces are used in the same transaction, shouldn't there be a sanity check to make sure it doesn't happen? It may be extremely rare, but even a perfect RNG can spit out the same value twice in a row.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:15:43
Mining a block couldn't have taken less than 10 minutes back then, or are you referring to GPU mining at minimum difficulty?
On that note, how much time would it have taken a time traveller, armed  a 60GH/s ASIC miner, to mine 2016 blocks at minimum difficulty, and what would be the difficulty increase?
To take it even further, how many blocks would have been mined during the first 24 hours with today's total hashing power when starting at minimum difficulty?
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:46:29
I think we need, and deserve, an alternative exchange that bans bots. Exchange rate on this site will vary very slowly, and people will place long standing asks/bids. We are not at HFT age yet, changing the price at this frequency brings more damage than value.
Why do we need to compete against machines in order to exchange coins (the only thing that enables the expansion of Bitcoin adoption), where in reality it's a group of people who want to convert bitcoin income to fiat, and vice versa.
