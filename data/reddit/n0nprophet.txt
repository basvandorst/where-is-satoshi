Yes, it's a great payment network for tech savvy early adopters, like your friend I would assume. What can your average person do with bitcoin that makes it compelling for them?

A good point, but of the top 15 countries in terms of remittance volume, Coinbase only operates in 3, all of which are developed European countries (France, Spain, and Belgium). Also some of these countries only accept payment via credit card (with CC fees), and not bank accounts. With time this will improve. But my point is that we could be developing actual uses for Bitcoin that would increase adoption, rather than just wait for big players to expand to other countries. Because if you can actually use BTC to do something, you don't need to worry as much about cashing out.

Actually, banks pay premiums themselves to receive FDIC coverage, but it is priced more much more cheaply than it should be for the risk they take on, and the FDIC didn't even require premiums from banks between 1996-2006 because there had been no panics. FDIC coverage makes it cheaper for banks to take risks since their depositors will be protected no matter what (up to $250,000), which leads to excessive risk, which the taxpayer eventually has to pay for when a crash happens.
TL;DR - taxes never pay directly for FDIC coverage, but taxpayers do have to pay for market crashes that are somewhat encouraged by FDIC coverage.

This requires the artist to get enough tips to make it worth their time, which is one hurdle. Then if they accept tips but just cash out, how much progress has really been made?
My main point is that people's approach is to try to shove bitcoin into someone's hands. But why would someone want to join a payment network that their friends don't use and that they can only buy things through gift cards or at select retailers. You're making someone's life more complicated and the benefit is not that great (yet). If you give people something that they can only do with bitcoin that is novel or more useful than having $5 USD, then there's actually a reason to start using it.

Thank you! I tried to get this point across recently, there needs to be more things you can actually do with bitcoin that takes advantage of its features, rather than just an alternative payment network that your friends and most businesses don't yet accept.
And just fyi, Open Bazaar has made it clear in many posts that they really do not need donations, but they desperately need some developers to help them out since it's an all volunteer project.

It seems that they offer merchants the option to pay ("absorb") the fee, or pass on to the customer, which is where the 0% fee quote comes from.

Sean's Outpost started in late March 2013, so that's about a year and 4 months ago. Nonprofit tax returns (Form 990) can take a while to be filed and released to the public. Currently, neither Guidestar nor Citizen Audit have any information on Sean's Outpost that I can find, which itself is not much of a red flag since it's a new organization. What this does mean is that, for now, any information regarding transparency has to come directly from Sean's Outpost itself until the tax documents are released.
So, the option is to wait to see the tax returns which could take a few months, or ask Sean's Outpost directly, which is what OP is doing.

I can use it at any store, a vending machine, a massage chair, give it to a friend or stranger, use it to get on a ride at a fair, etc. And I can do this with no inconvenience, and everyone is used to it. To do the same with bitcoin requires explaining complicated tech and hoping someone accepts it. 
I'm a big bitcoin fan, I'm just saying that since we're so early in bitcoin's life, one way to get more adoption is to create games, websites, and services that provide value to individuals beyond just a payment network.  
Something that you can do and enjoy for a small amount of money. Tipping is great, but there's a still a void for what you can USE or DO with bitcoins, rather than just send them around.

High frequency trading creates huge risks in our system and creates extremely little value for doing so to anyone other than the highly technical speculative traders. I fully support taxing traders that makes tons of automated trades per minute. This is not targeted at bitcoin at all, and if we do our jobs well communicating with the public, then bitcoin will be exempt.

So what you're suggesting is that it's a good idea to pay a street team to pester people into buying a digital currency that they can't use for anything in their daily life?
This really is absurd. I'm very hopeful for Bitcoin's potential, but as of now, there is almost zero utility for the average person. Zero. Bitcoin is amazing as an idea, but for any practical purpose, it's way too young and undeveloped. I've never run into bitcoin in my daily life, and I don't believe others do frequently either, it's something you have to seek out. Until compelling use cases exist, user adoption will not happen.

In many cases, you're right, traditional payment systems are quicker or easier. But simply checking out with a shopping cart? With a coinbase login or simple copy paste, it's much faster than correcting any autofill mistakes or having to create an acocunt with a site and typing in credit card info in some cases. Sorry, just not on the same page with you here.

One of the best bitcoin videos I've seen! It avoids the trap of trying to explain how Bitcoin works (mining, hash functions, etc.) and instead says why it all matters.

$30,000 over 2 years, so more like 2.2% or so I'd guess
