True but...until it collapses, which can also happen without any good reason.

Exactly what I wanted to post lol

Margin trading at kraken for example, super high risk though.

One of the arguments for BTC vs alts is its strong security, the downside its energycosts.
Is the high energy cost of bitcoins Proof-of-Work actually required for its level of security?

You have an optimistic world view ;)

Does anyone have a good source on why PoW was the only solution from the perspective of Satochi?

Hmm, I still think it is a waste. A waste is a waste even if there is plenty of a resource. Don't pretend energy is free and without impact on our climate. 
Having said that, I don't really think waste is a real problem, just a PR problem, which is in turn a significant problem on the road to adoption.
I am just surprised and a little sceptical when I hear that no altcoin of the 2000+ is capable of implementing an algorithm that can ensure equal security without wasting energy.

You give examples of useful work , a trade for a service you directly want. PoW is not useful in and of itself. It is presumably necessary to ensure security though. I doubt it is still valuable if security can be achieved without it just as well?

Interesting, I can see using Blockchain for voting/impeaching, but how exactly would it replace government representatives?

bitcoin will eventually act as gold: people will buy it as a guaranteed value same or increase.

The worth of BTC should rise accordingly with sparsity, so the transaction fee should give plenty revenue by then.

Probably bitcoin wasn't acknowledged as money at the time of the gox. So there weren't laws for lost potential profit written for btc yet that you can call upon.

Strange, I see a common pattern where volume soars right after a crash.Then, after volume drops, the price starts to rise, keeping low volume. My guess is that few people are initiating or selling during this phase.
