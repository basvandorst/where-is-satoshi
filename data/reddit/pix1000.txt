i doubt these protesters have much money in the banks to begin with, so it won't do much,
it will only matter when billionaires start moving money out of banks
ive been doing a bank run since 2014 when i got into bitcoin, every paycheck ive been slowly converting all my money into bitcoin

as much as i love bitcoin, in the many many years of having a bank account i have never paid any bank fees,
ive always keep 10 grand in my account and they bypass the fees if you hold that much in your bank
its always the poor people that always had to pay fees
i always wondered if they were eventually going to get rid of those fees for customers that always held money in the bank, that way they could make more profits, 
i never understood how they would be able to accomplish that without customers taking their money out, 
but putting negatives interest rates and charging people by the amount of money they have inside their bank account is genius and getting rid of cash is even more genius, makes their profits maximize even more 
in the past i would say - if it comes to that here, then i would be forced to take the majority of my money out of the bank and into cash and hide it somewhere in my house,  if they banned cash, id be screwed!
in this present time - it's starting not to matter as i am already doing my best to move my money out of the banking system and into bitcoin, and the spending money for my daily things i am using a coinbase account, im looking to get their coinbase debit card also, 
offline bitcoin as a saving account and coinbase as like a chequing account,
would rather help coinbase then any bank,
the banks are on their way down unless they start adding bitcoin accounts
times are good

I wonder if she found this out all on her own or she was trained to understand this. It seems like she was taught to say this and memorize it and picked because she is a child.
Either way she is completely right. 
I really think the politicians can't do much about it. The banking system is so big and perfected and has been going for decades that it's power is unstoppable. 
It possible that the current politicians are being blackmailed and the good people have been reluctant to even get into politics so it leaves us with terrible people who get into politics who are either black mailed or are generally evil and don't care.
The banking system has almost all of the countries in the world and hollywood keeps people entertained. 
It was extremely easy to keep the system going without problems before the internet was invented. 
Thanks to the internet more people around the world people are becoming aware. 
It getting harder and harder to keep the current banking system in place and the truth is slowly coming out. 
It's very scary and sometimes keeps me awake at night knowing what is really going on. 
We can't defeat them even with guns. The militaires around the world will keep order and they don't have a clue either. They are just doing their job.
Everyone is just doing their job and they system keeps going around in a circle
I think the best thing to do is keep using Bitcoin and get yourself out of the system. 
Bitcoin is hope

i figured it out,   they changed it,  there is no "new" button anymore
now you go to the "Receive" tab
then type in "Label"  and press the "Request payment" button
that's it, 
then it will appear in the "Window" "Receiving addresses" area

I keep a couple of grand on one of the exchanges, I haven't had time to get it off the exchange. yes it's not safe but if I loose it it's not the end of the world. I'll have to do it soon. I'm just not sure where to put it.

i put most of my savings in bitcoin years ago, although i didn't have much savings to begin with
but ya i could cash out now and not have to worry about money, although i never really did worry about money to begin with as ive always lived way below my means
i'm past "cashing out" thats not on my goals anymore, instead i just buy things with it, gift cards or stores online that accept bitcoin, mostly i just buy amazon gift cards with bitcoin and then buy whatever i need on amazon using my gift card, 
i most likely will never cash out and continue using bitcoin

i have some sources that schiff has been an insider and has been paid for many years by the government/wall street to keep promoting gold because gold is no longer relevant as a word reserve currency and only used to make easy money from suckers

paypal is right, but i'm not sure what paypal's plan is, 
also, i think coinbase is on it's way to getting a banking licence,  once this happens the banks are in big trouble, they're going to be forced to adapt or start loosing even more customers,  
banks are not doing anything now except close people's account who use bitcoin, 
even tho im not a big fan of coinbase, they are helping bitcoin succeed, especially for the people who can't secure their own bitcoins,
i keep a little bitcoin on coinbase, but the majority is offline secured, and im slowly moving my savings out of my bank, i would advise other to start doing this too

i've owned 1 for a long time, but the problem is i can't spend it or i won't be able to say that i own a full bitcoin anymore..
i can't sleep at night because of this, even if it goes up to 1 million i still wouldn't dare spend it,  i should've bought 2 but now i can't afford to buy another one,
it's my status symbol
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:32:33

thanks for the link, you helped me,  its upgraded now
i figured it out
1. i downloaded and installed java11 with open djk, on the website i picked,  openJDK 11 LTS and HotSpot
2. downloaded the jar file from  , in my case at this time it was the: eclair-node-gui-0.3.1-6906ecb.jar
3. create a "run-eclair.bat" file and putting the following inside of it:
start /B javaw -Declair.datadir=C:\path\to
ode\datadir -jar C:\path\to\eclair-node-gui-0.3-2a89cf7.jar
which in my case it was:
start /B javaw -Declair.datadir=C:\Users\john\.eclair -jar C:\Users\john\Desktop\MyNodeEclair\eclair-node-gui-0.3.1-6906ecb.jar
i did this by creating a text "run-eclair.txt" then renaming it to "run-eclair.bat"
4. start bitcoin-core double click the "run-eclair.bat"
that's all!  and eclair started up, 
this was an upgrade for me,  i am now running the lastest version, 
eventually im going to change it to a linux machine, not a big fan of windows
hope this helps someone else
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:58:04

if  not, i might have to ditch windows10 and run it on linux
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:43:41
