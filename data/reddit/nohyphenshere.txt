It's hard to hold in mind what the process is like for those who aren't familiar with it. And, becoming familiar requires Youtube videos, Wikipedia pages, Google searches.
Try the experiment some day, of asking a friend to withdraw $20 from a bitcoin machine with no instruction.
First of all, there are like, two or three machines in my city, and two of them look sketchy as hell.
In terms of apps, I'm using BRD, and on the basis of the UI, I can see no indication whatsoever about how I'll convert bitcoins to cash from a machine, when the time comes.
This stuff would be an absolute shitshow, if we were talking about ATM machines. With bitcoin, it's completely accepted. (By the nerds and enthusiasts you use it, but not by 99% of the planet.)

I'm completely new to Bitcoin, and I'm astonished by how atrocious it is to actually use the currency — both with the tools of apps, and physical machines in my city.
It leaves me wondering just who uses this currency in a practical way, and how.

I'm using BRD for iPhone.
Tell me how a user goes from the deceptively pretty first screen, to locating something that means "exchange bitcoin for cash", and tell me how they're made aware of how that interconnects with a physical bitcoin machine.
The failure to even see the problem stems from nerds' inability (by definition) to think about what the process entails, for the humans on the other end of their tool.
Tell me how they do that *without* a Google search, leading from one morass to another, themselves written by nerds using 7 terms that the reader with a basic inquiry couldn't possibly be familiar with.
