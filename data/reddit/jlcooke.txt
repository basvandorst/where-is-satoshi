The bitcoin network is under a denial of service attack. The attack is in the form of someone or group spamming the network with very high fee transactions and starving out all others (you)
If the attacker is a major miner (bitmain/ant miner) - they can expect to get 1/4 to 1/2 of those fees back into their own pocket. 
This kind of attack is probably NOT short term. 
Bitcoin cash isn’t invulnerable either. They’re blocks at only 8x larger so the difficulty is only 8x more.

the people and firms that trade for a living (and to afford the living of dozens of people in an office in downtown NYC) have enough money at stake to put buy/ask bids in the futures markets and the BTC markets to ensure they make money no matter what happens.
The really big players (whales) can even MAKE things happen to ensure they make money.  There are laws (regulations) to prevent abuses - but bitcoin is not regulated.

You need a prime curve (analog of prime numbers, but instead of doing grade school math, you're doing "addition" with x,y points in a specific elliptic equation) to have a basis for elliptic curve crypto.
So it goes, that they say used a known and efficient way to "pick the next random point in the curve" until they've found a "prime" point under the curve to use as the basis for the key.
One would ask "if all points are equal, why not use digits of Pi and increment by 1 until a match is found?"  But that's actually not as safe as one might think.
One could ask the open community to post their own randomly generated 128/256 bit keys by midnight UTC time and XOR them all together and use that at the starting point for the march towards the first prime basis point.

Right now, it sounds like the BoC is concerned about anything that isn't the CAD since they can't control inflation.  In the past, USD bills are not accepted by businesses because they can't cash them in at the bank.
But PayPal and BitCoin (as mentioned by BoC) make that irrelevant.  So forcing the CAD as the currency of a nation is becoming more difficult.
So they're going to look into what they can do in the face of the competition. Yes, they used that C-word.
They're are smart people at the bank.  But this is a sideways shift in thinking - they may be out of their element and will seek external advice.
They can't ban it - just will not work.  So they'll (CRA - Cannuck IRS) have to monitor the blockchain and track all wallets back to Canadian citizens and businesses as they do with stocks bought/sold in New York and Hong Kong.
Since all transactions are on the blockchain, they can track all revenue and enforce taxation in CAD based on equivalent value.  Achieving some measure of closing the loop on BTC-CAD.

Late reply - but Xi-squared works for anything where you are testing actual results against expected results.
Trick with electronic RNGs is if they pass through a un-biasing step (crunch through MD5, AES or some crypto primitive) you can't tell.
I have a avalanche zenor-diode RNG device which generated true randomness (semi-conductor and manufacturing and environmental and quantum factors all at play) but the output is not "statistically white".
It's random, it's just the outputs are not evenly distributed across all possible values.  Which is OK, as long as you recognize that you're getting (conservatively) 0.1 bits of entropy for every bit of output.  So, collecting 1280 bits of output and hashing it through MD5 down to 128 bits is good (or 2560 output bits and use SHA256 to reduce to 256bits).
For dice, this not an acceptable solution.  You need the dice to be random (your hand plus a table to throw them down on is good) *and* statistically white or unbiased.  That's where Xi-Squared against a [1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6] expectation comes in.

Some hashrate calculations based on block generation
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:38:25
If they have 40% of the hash rate - it's a simple stochastic calculation on what the value of letting $25k in fees go in order to collect $40k later.  Their high %-age of the hash rate pool lowers their variance enough that they can make these kinds of moves when mempool is deep but mempool growth is low (North America is sleeping).

And this: 
See what mining a block will do to the mempool - it takes the high-fee transactions first.  Basically - lots of people are moving bitcoin right now.
If I were a miner - I'd keep a butt load of BTC around and keep moving it back and forth, back and forth to congest the mempool and drive up transaction fees.

@_date: 2017-08-25 13:51:06
Answer: game theory.
Same reason why miner would send lots of bitcoin between addresses they already own to fill the mempool.
... it drives up transaction fees and thus profit for miners.
If you have 40% of the BTC hashrate your variance is lower than anyone else and you make more money.
They are operating exactly as an unfettered market should --&gt; they are chasing profits.

there have been deflationary currencies in the past.  The result was everyone was deliberately starving themselves and holding off on almost all spending because it was the smartest move for them personally.

Math says:
* if 5% of blocks start signalling "no" to segwit now - 58% chance of lock-in
* If 4% than it goes up 99%
* If 6% than it goes down to 4.3%
Right now it looks like 100% all-round.  If any miner does not signal things get **interesting**

I would too.  But thing is - miners don't answer to markets in that way.  So no exchange or OTC buyers would buy their coins - hardly.
Look - the longer this run of BIP91 signalling continues the window of opportunity for this kind of move closes.  And it's closing fast.  They'd have to start making a move in the next 4 hours.
So - sleep well.  It's looking good.

OK.  So it's a "warning" message plunked into the "error" field.  Unconventional, shall we say.  Fine.
The bigger issue this presents is ... Why TF are the miners (presumably) running software that is non-production?  That is, not released to the rest of the network?
This is very bad software development practice.  Imagine HTC/Google, Microsoft or Apple releasing apps in their marketplace not supported by their devices.

micro payments use case is dead then?
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:18:48
Correct me if I'm wrong - but there are 2 popular way to get paid.
PPS and PPNLS.
PPS - Pay Per Share: you get paid for work you do even if the work you did expired.
PPNLS - Pay Per 'N' Last Shares: mostly a BTCGuild thing, attempts to prevent pool-hopping where users try to get work done on a block just before it pays out.
** please add more **
Each payout method is then given a percentage fee by the pool operator to cover their costs and profit.
I'm new to this, and I've gone with BTCGuild.  Why?  Donno, they felt good to me at the time.  I may change my mind later.

Logic fail. If they were doing this, their USD/BTC price would be going down, driving up prices elsewhere.
Edit:  If there was a run on MtGox, their USD/BTC price would be going to zero as people will do anything to sell their USD for BTC and run away.
Edit: Another way a run *could* appear, is if everyone is hell-bent on getting USD out to pay for their ASICs ... or there is a greedy BTC buyer ... of (conspiracy) MtGox is cooking the orderbook to get more BTC in their accounts before going under ... but that's not arbitrage.

See what I tried to do with MD5CRK back in the day.
I made Applet, C, and Assembly versions on various platforms and promised a $10,000 prize for the person who found a collision in MD5.  4 months later some researchers found it.
Difficulty in finding a collision by cycle-finding in SHA256 compared to MD5 is roughly equal to the difficulty in finding a collision in MD5 compared to computing a single MD5 hash.  2^64 times harder.
Make the bounty for SHA256 collision big enough and watch  researchers go at it.

In Canada, as I imagine the US, Capital Gains come in to play.
If you spent $100 USD to buy 1 BTC, and used it to buy $150 worth of goods - you made $50 in capital gains which should be declared and taxes accounted for in your next tax filing.
That's how to do it by the book in Canada and probably the US.  Just stop asking about bitcoin, and pretend it was baseball cards.

It can't happen.  It's like going at the speed of light.  You can get C-0.002 close to it, spend 2x as much effort to move you forward to C-0.001, but reaching exactly C would take infinite energy.
OK - this doesn't work for SHA-256 collisions since the output space is finite (2^256) but it so far away this analogy works well.
Another way to see it:  imagine it took every computer and ASIC in the world working for 1 year to produce 1 block and the difficulty went up 100%.  The next block would take 2 years and so on.

A private key looks almost like a public key.  If you have this key, you have access to your wallet.  Your balance is actually stored in the distributed blockchain (the bit torrent like ledger of all bitcoin transactions).

Bitcoin. Will either be worthless or emmencely expensive in the future. 
This use case with the speed of transactions is an example of how "banksters" will keep on doing what they're doi g but have a really great way to get it done. 
Image when BTC is the medium for inter bank exchanges (central bank loans, motagage transfers, international corporate office fund transfers etc). 
It would be a very fast and efficient method compared to the pale pushing that goes on today. 
But it would still be the banks who do most of the exchanging. 
Reality of such exchanges is the bank would keep a post of BTC just to facilitate international transfers (add 1,000 BTC, subtract 1,003 BTC)
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:47:02
Good explanations.
But governments like their currencies because they can control supply at will.  They can easily increase supply (QE and/or "printing") or decrease supply (Quantitative Tightening and/or "burning").
Greece *wished* they had their own currency to manipulate.  The alternative is clearly worse in that case.
More BTC can only come from mining (hard) while less BTC can only come from someone destroying their private key (easy).
Don't be confused with someone cornering the market (holding large percent of BTC and refusing to trade to drive up the price).
This is why I few BTC as a commodity and not a currency.  "Liquid property" someone called it.  "Frictionless commodity" etc are all good as well.

This is the problem with deflationary currency (or commodities).
You make more money holding it than using it.  And so, there is less available for others to purchased, etc etc.
Until some large holder decides to "take profits" and sell an ass ton on the market.
Then another and another. etc etc.
Until Bitcoins become like gold.  Where basically the price of 1oz of gold == cost to mine 1oz of gold.
