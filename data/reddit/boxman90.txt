Bitfinex showed 3 times before they have no idea what the fuck they're doing, so yes you will get a haircut if you stay there. Next time it could be 100%.

The purpose was to hit all stop-buys, while selling on the way up. After that, the empty order-book made the price crash back and overcorrect due to panic.

One day you will learn about the mechanics of pump and dump, padawan. My guess is someone DID have inside information, namely ETF denied, but decided to play the market based on the anticipation it had built up in the last few months.
Don't be surprised later.

tl;dr Pump&amp;dump

I'm just saying, if it's abusable in the short-term and they decide not to do that, someone else will, regardless of who kills the goose that laid golden eggs..
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:22:37
They're a company, not a charity. They will do whatever makes the most profit. I know it's unpopular to say so, but if Bitcoin can be abused like this, that's Bitcoin's flaw and Bitcoin's flaw alone.
If this company suddenly starts being a charity case for 'the good of bitcoin', another company will stand up and forcibly take this maximum profit if at all feasible.

These are just the Chinese drawing some arbitrary chart, we know from history their volume figures are nowhere near to be trusted and god knows on what kind of reserves and manipulation those things run.
Just be aware that with the touch of a button they could put this train in reverse. It's entirely in the control of those exchange operators. Know what you're playing with.

Oooh what's this? Deleted? Why :)
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:15:49
Below 30k. All their volume has been fake for years due to insane leverage and 0 fees. Without China's fake volume, no more bubble in the future unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-01-23 07:07:40


@_date: 2017-01-22 21:46:27
Did you even look at the charts?
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:50:58
Yeah but that's not going to happen. China drove this thing for the past 3+ years on false volume, and you can't deny that. Take away China, and you're left with a scared Western market. Probably a long-term bear-market of multiple years before we see any recovery.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:07:17
You're deluding yourself but that's okay.
Chinese traders are speculators first and foremost, interested in BTC mainly because with the leverage and 0%-fees it was an unregulated casino on steroids. Nothing ever indicated Chinese were long-term holders. The volume is a psychological tool. 
Trading fees are great, just not great for the price at all. Stop kidding yourself.

Schedule the upgrade for a time when there's no major up- or downtrend? Bitcoin was flatline for several days 3 times last month, and flatline for several 12h periods many more times throughout October. Yet they choose to do their upgrade at the absolute apex of the uptrend, when it's the steepest it's been in the past 4 months?
Rationalize that. The updates were not critical.
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:52:53
The large movements were not over, not by a long shot. Do you not see the graphs? They somehow managed to plan it exactly in the largest drop of the past few months.
I really don't mind the price swings. Don't need a scapegoat either, for I lost no money on this drop. I'm just saying that it's a bit coincidental that Bitfinex managed to put all their past downtimes exactly in the middle of the biggest moves for months.
That's not conspiracy, that's just an observation.
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:00:00
Bitfinex announced 'planned maintenance' and intentionally drove down the price with FUD by delaying a few times. Gotta make back that lost cash somehow, right? :D
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:11:29
Every time I read comments like these, I'm convincing myself we're already at the "delusion" stage.
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:49:11
Lol 'a bit'? We went all the way back to &lt;200 after MtGox.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:21:49


This. I had moved my USD from BitFinEx to Kraken to get out of the sinking ship (gap was only 15 bucks back then), and when I wanted to buy into a large sell order, with millisecond prescision the sell-order was gone when I inserted my market buy. Luckily I always set them as limit orders, otherwise I'd have had over 7$ of slippage.
Needless to say, I removed my money from there again.

Strap in for M0ON BoYS!
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:47:13
It's more likely than not. I am a big believer in "all the information is shown in the market price already". Which means that with a 100$ discrepancy, fishy shit is going on to say the least. If there were actual proper outlooks of Bitfinex being honest and able to pay fiat, we would've seen the premium diminishing, not increasing.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:26:29
Yeaaaaaah why would you not say which bank exactly if you make such post? Smells like FUD. I withdrew 2 days ago through SEPA and it went fine.
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:47:07
You're preaching to the choir bro, read my previous posts in this comment tree. I think it is not possible and/or there's massive fraud going on at Bitfinex, or the arb gap would've been closed already.
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:57:08
You're forgetting one thing - if it were actually possible, the arbitrage gap would've been closed weeks ago. The market usually reflects all available information - including possible arbitrage routes.
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:37:44
In **the** bank or in **your Bitfinex / iFinex** bank accounts?
With all the shade being thrown around, better be crispy clear. I'm sure your lawyer looks over everything before you post, so let's go down this rabbit hole.
Is there enough USD in the bank accounts in ownership of - and in control of - Bitfinex and iFinex combined to cover every dollar on Bitfinex and every Tether?
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:31:02
Public proof or this is nothing but FUD. Also name the exact bank.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:48:22
I withdraw my USD with Sepa and it gets converted to EUR along the way. USD is not blocked in Bitstamp, is my point.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:20:09
**Asset to liability coverage ratio is &gt; 1** 
 
I mean come on, couldn't be more clear-cut why he chose this wording right?
**Tether has no legal liabilities. They transfered their real debt to Tether, where they have 0 obligations to pay them off**
The money is gone, guys. Tether is a ponzi where only those who get out first will get anything at all.

As if there aren't hundreds if not thousands of individuals who are capable of easily gobbling up those millions in arb. Doesn't have to be done alone. If it were possible, Taiwanese traders would've done it already for the easiest buck in their lives.
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:02:21
Of course the prices of the other exchanges are more meaningful. I'm not sure what you mean exactly. Yes, USDT is sketchy and so is Bitfinex. It reeks of fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:20:03
Most if not everyone on fora, reddit and the internet discussing bitcoin will predominantly be doing so because of the **price**.
I think the fraction of people actually buying bitcoin because they think it has merit *at this moment* is very low. All others are just speculating and hoping the price goes up. Hardly anybody really uses it.

"But Tether is not connected to Bitfinex, it only has the same overshadowing company technically"

You grossly overestimate the influence of BTC on an economy the size of China's.

If you forgot your encryption password there is nothing you can do. The encryption cannot be broken. If it could, the system would not be safe and your money would not have value.

Did you ask that when it was going up too? :D 
Take a look at the chart. How long has it been going up? Well there's your answer for what *might* be possible, but downwards.
Good luck!

I have said the same thing multiple times. They literally **always** lag when there's volatility, to the point of having tens of seconds of delay in executing orders. Also, there have been multiple reports of them frontrunning their orderbook.
I am 99% sure it is intentional, so they can frontrun their book in times of volatility.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:08:04
So manage your finances better. You ought to know that Bitcoin is an immature unregulated market (= zero guarantees) and it's been clear all exchanges have been dropping the ball. Just don't expect to be able to turn BTC into Fiat within a day, and manage your finances accordingly.

It's near impossible to gather proof of that as a customer. But I have had walls disappear the INSTANT I put in a limit-order to buy it. Had I made it a market order, I would have had ~15 USD of slippage. More people have reported this.
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:17:46

Yeah, except this time around Bitcoin is actually running at max capacity with insane fees and cannot go mainstream without a scaling solution. Bitcoin atm doesn't work as intended. (full blocks, mining cartel, unable to reach consensus).

The reason your statement is so insane is that we only crossed 2000 1 month ago, AND we're at the top of 'the Bitcoin fractal'. Unless "things are actually different this time" of course.

You do realize that nowhere near close to $12B flowed out during this drop, nor in during the rise, right?
