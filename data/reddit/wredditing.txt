Actually, that figure was just BTC/USD, I haven't looked at the other trading pairs. Just wanted to prove that they are indeed making a fair chunk of profit. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:06:57
Hence the 'over'. Roughly looking at the charts they traded approx 5m BTC during that period. Their avg fee is 0.25% considering both sides of the trade. I'm not sure what the average price from Jan-Aug was (maybe $500) but you get the picture. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:00:48
They've pulled over $5m in fees since the turn of the year, so yes they are making money.

I think you misunderstood my point. 
If TPTB had their way we would not have Reddit or easy access to any information that furthers our education. I did not refer to posting on Reddit as serfdom nor would I. Not to say that there are not serfs on Reddit.

Great points!


Isn't that pretty much what is happening right now in almost every country. Gates and TPTB force their agenda every minute of every day. 
Bitcoin represents freedom, they prefer serfdom.

This. If you don't hold it you don't own it. You don't leave all your crypto on exchanges for the same reason. At any time, for any reason, any of these exchanges / companies can go broke and your electronic gold can go up in smoke so to speak. Plus there is great satisfaction in taking delivery of the shiny stuff, just don't paw it too much.

Actually I think it is quite the opposite. I have seen Shawn (Storj CEO) hijack Sia comments multiple times. Go look at the Sia AMA on r/iama for a prime example. 
I can tell you from experience with both that Sia is by far the better tech. True decentralisation and they control their own destiny with their own blockchain.

@_date: 2016-06-24 11:13:47
Brilliant! 
First thing that came into my head was that it was like Sia, but Storj is a similar reference. Secure p2p storage is going to be huge imo. 
Sia is releasing v1.0 on 28th June, so I think they are further along than Storj. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:01:19
Are you saying Storj is out of Beta? I thought it was still Beta and that Sia was releasing v1.0 on 28 June?

Forget the banks, they will ask too many questions and most probably not consider your crypto as secure collateral. 
Check out SALT (Secure Automated Lending Technology). Crypto backed loans. Their whitepaper just dropped this week:

You could always ditch the conventional cloud storage and use Sia to cut costs further, I believe they are currently somewhere around $2/TB/month. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:10:59
I guess it all comes down to your personal belief in what the crypto you hold can achieve (eventually it won't be just BTC that can be used as collateral). 
If you think your crypto is going to appreciate over the term of the loan, then it makes complete sense to borrow. I think that is where this becomes attractive. 
Regarding addressing depreciation - well this is your risk. You could easily collateralise with 5x depending on how risk averse you are. They certainly need to spell out the dangers of low collateralisation
 and potential liquidation. I think it's reasonable that they don't walk you through the potential appreciation, because, well, you should be aware of that, and they may not want to be seen by the likes of the SEC as promoting a speculative instrument.

How is the ETF coming along? 
Not really expecting any meaningful answer. My guess is that it will be approved just as we begin the rally for the halvening. That way, you good folks can be scapegoated when the bubble pops. The media frenzy will be entertaining at least. Good work on the exchange, I may migrate over if it becomes available in my place of residence.

Thank you for this. 
It seems like amongst all the 'debating' that this point has been lost.

Don't worry. Claims will not be finalised for months yet if we are lucky. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:22:32
My understanding is that anyone who submitted a claim for both BTC and fiat has still not had their claim accepted or rejected. 
No fiat claims have been accepted or rejected. There seems to be quite a high number of fraudulent USD claims which is driving up the total value to ¥2,695,239,249,594 JPY.
Out of all of the time that passed (2 years??) we are still no closer to finding the missing coins. All of the reports I have read are speculative. Yes, there is a strong possibility Mark knows what happened to them, but we still have no concrete facts regarding them!

Currently as it stands, the evidence points to CW as being a fraud. Until he provides proof, which is quite simply achieved, then he is not Satoshi imo.   
I hope he proves me wrong so we can just end all this nonsense. Until then, sharpen the pitchforks! 
At least it is a distraction from the blocksize shambles.

@_date: 2016-05-03 03:34:49
Is that comment legitimate? 
I have never looked into David Kleiman's involvement in Bitcoin beyond CW's claims last time.
Why would his father (if it is him) be commenting on that article at that time, requesting that information? Considering this was just after the crash started at Mt.Gox. Bitcoin would have been heavily featured in the MSM at that time.
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:14:07
It would probably be a good idea to sticky a thread with information debunking CW's proof of being Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:09:35
Yes, that is what I was referring to. 
It's such a shame that with all the macro economical tragedies currently ongoing (Greece, Venezuela, half of Europe, etc.) that awareness might have increased substantially.

David is one of the developers of Sia (decentralised storage). 
I think they are pretty close to releasing v1.0. Worth checking out if curious.

Exactly the reason why people are using Bitcoin.


Comments are outdated. Also, didn't Coinjar just release a debit card? 
Edit: Grammar.
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:09:56
Actually I think I agree with the OP's sentiment. 
Although he has taken the quote slightly out of context, the first line of text still has the reader assume that Bitcoin is hitting a limit of mintage (not blocksize). 
The rest of it is just nonsensical FUD. 
This article isn't meant for you or I. The general public who will gobble it up.
EDIT: Also, there is no doubt they are a bunch of idiots.
@_date: 2015-03-26 04:00:42

Cheers, I guess if they were in this situation while in Mexico it would be an option with BTC. That sounds like a really easy way to transfer funds.

I think the main issue is that my parents may find it difficult coming to terms with the technology, as will many people of their generation. I believe this is the main barrier to entry for many people. Hopefully in the near future the technology will become more user friendly, in fact I am 100% confident it will. 
I will choose to use WU for a couple of reasons:
1. There are no Bitcoin ATM's at their location. I think I could guide them through downloading and installing a wallet on their phone pretty easily.
2. I am reluctant to sell my BTC at the current market price (not the LBC price). 
The price WU are quoting me is pretty damn expensive and I am not happy, but as you said I am in a pinch.
Just to note - I will be calling them when they return home and introduce them to BTC properly and get them wallets. At a minimum they could store some funds for emergencies like this.

@_date: 2015-02-01 06:01:16
Actually it is not fake. I had looked into neither option prior to posting this. I have never used WU or LBC. 
It is looking like I will use WU mainly because I would like to hold my BTC. It is costly for me to rebuy due to my location. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:11:57
Not sure why you are replying to me. I never, nor would ever request proof of that. I stated that the OP of a story I read was called out about it being BS. I had no part in it. 
Your comment on the other hand, although maybe meant to be sarcastic, reads as though you are requesting proof.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:20:59
I remember reading a post somewhere about the incident I think being referred to here. From what I remember it was about a bloke going out to the back shed with a shotgun and not coming back. It read like complete BS and the OP was called out on it. Don't think I bothered to even finish reading the thread after.
