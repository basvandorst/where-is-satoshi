Well maybe that's a bit high... but maybe it will someday be worth 0,1$? that would be cool 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:30:27
Yeah, maybe I'll just keep chasing that 1 coin, who knows. 
but if the price goes up that high I cant complain :)

I Dont think he paid directly with bitcoins though.. but I Agree- i Always pay with bitcoins when i can!!

I guess you could 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:52:31
I guess I could but I'm afraid I'm a fairly bad day-trader...
It's a big gamble and I think its very hard to predict the bitcoin price from day to day. I will stick to my plan, it might take a little bit longer but its the safest route.

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:56:25
