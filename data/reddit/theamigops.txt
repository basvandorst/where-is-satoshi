Haha I was being sarcastic in my title

Yep it is, I drew this on my Note 3 with Autodesk Sketchbook.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:36:27
Yeah I agree, but I'm not too upset about it. Even given a thousand chances this is just how it worked out. Just a metaphorically expensive lesson to watch out for emerging tech in the future

Some will wish for $300 at $600. Could be worse, I sold all my Litecoin the day before it hit $150.

And if Charlie does this as a volunteer, it would only make him that much more respected in history ~~books~~ pdfs.

So what you're saying is what you're saying will happen?

If I remember correctly I only ran it for a couple minutes because I had no idea what I was doing. Little did I know
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:14:44
Well, have you been hodling like you promised?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:41:47
[Roight here!](
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:48:18
Nice try, RoJudas
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:42:36
I find your lack of faith disturbing. Haha, but yes, I'll more than likely be drawing Andreas. I just don't want to offend him because I respect him so much.
But yep, I have no concerns offending Ver.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:05:16
You're awesome! Thanks so much!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:47:22
Haha thank you!!!

How many people do you personally know that have over $100 invested in crypto? Imagine the market cap when the lightning network is released and you can literally buy coffee at Starbucks instantly for no fee.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:47:12
My people! ��
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:21:50
I did, and you're way too generous. Seriously, I love this community.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:47:12
You're amazing! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:59:44
Well I agree about fees and speeds. But I have hope.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:13:19
Very good
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:02:01
I was only being sarcastic. Trying to open up a paradox that was already there
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:08:47
Is your comment financial advice?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:35:49
I agree, but keep in mind I'm not a financial advisor
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:45:50
I definitely want to! Especially with LTC's performance recently.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:40:55
Wow, not a bad thing to stumble upon if you ask me
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:38:32
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:23:59
I'm sorry :(
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:38:01
Andreas is next if we hit 25,000 by the end of December!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:47:03
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:38:04
Possibly because mass adoption it considered a good thing

Greed will only bring you pain. Mark my words

I've read through some of it. He does elaborate some details which may suggest that, although a billion dollar currency being pinned on your shoulders overnight would definitely make you want to understand Bitcoin at a deeper level. Especially being that he is an engineer.

I had an account already, but it already gifted me the $10. I was never referred to coinbase or anything either so it just tossed me he money out of nowhere. Not complaining or anything, it was just very confusing

It's just under treasoncoin and sacrilegecoin
