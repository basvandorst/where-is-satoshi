This is why you don't share your balance with anyone. Just like your paycheck it's nobodies business. As for your problem right now, I can see maybe going a little under market for someone you know. The price he's proposing is ridiculous though and he knows it. You're not greedy or an asshole for saying no to this. If he throws a fit about it, you'll know how great a friend he truly is.

I had send a friend some money over paypal earlier today. We were confused as to what happened when it came up short. Then shortly after we both shrugged it off as it was a small amount I read this. I find it interesting that I have to read about policy updated like this on here versus them informing me.

I've booked a lot of my multi destination flights with them in the past and had a fairly positive experience. So seeing this puts a smile on me face. If this keeps up I'll practically not have to use fiat anymore.

I'll admit that I got a little nervous. It seems be be recovering "slowly" now.

It corrected within a matter of seconds pushing it back to a all time high. We'll see how it goes, I'm riding it out for a little bit either way.

While I haven't set things up yet, I've recently jumped into Bitcoin with the intend as using it as the primary payment services for my freelance work. I'm also looking at moving somewhere under a student visa in the near future. Due to work restrictions that come with that, Bitcoin would allow me to work anywhere in the world for anyone. Expanding my market enabling me to earn a living during my studies without the hassle of currency exchanges, timely wire-transfers and extra fees. 
Hoping to completely relaunch my portfolio in the near future.
