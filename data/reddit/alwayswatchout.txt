Thats just made it easier to steal

I believe theres nothing wrong with memory but its on your head to memorise it and make some sort of story from the 24 word phrase (if im wrong plz correct me) on the basis of your imagination. I dont think its too much of a bother of revising the seed every couple of weeks especially when you see the bitcoin news now and again.
Theres no security guranteed but you can only make do with the tools youve got.
@_date: 2018-08-26 22:50:15

@_date: 2019-08-02 21:12:38

@_date: 2019-06-23 22:50:25
Same thing. I wanna get more!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:14:07
Lol dw, given brexit we are probably going to be, in terms of pound being less value than against USD, be a bigger number than the dollar
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:12:22
Yeah thats cause our currency is MORE valuable than USD (but not as valuable as Bitcoin, ;)
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:40:51
Same here!
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:28:47
There was an article where if you have got 0.28btc then you are part of the 1 percent
Do you think thats a good starting point?
Edit: in theory i have also got 1 btc value wise but its split between btc and 3 altcoins
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:26:50
Mmmmm, SNICKERRRRRRSSS.....drooling
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:16:10

Thank you
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:24:14
I bought btc from coinbase pro instead of coinbase and there was a 6 or 7% price difference between the 2.
Can anyone explain?
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:56:41
When will it come out?
Do u know
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:49:26
Dont u mean 21 million club?
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:39:48
Easy to use for an idiot tech newbie like me?
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:45:53
Hard to believe 4 million coins are lost... 
Then again humans are stupid sometimes
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:37:01
Same here please lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:51:19
If u check the markets on cb pro, you should see the btc GBP market as well
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:36:33
When i did it, it was a lot bigger
£3188 Pro vs £2955 ish on CB
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:46:47
Ok, cheers!
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:43:50
Thanks for speaking your mind here.
I only bought some in december 2017 (only a bit that is affordable) and since then ive been buying the dip
This crash will only make it easier for me to keep on buying.
My target is to reach 2.1 btc before the next halvening
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:43:56
For about 30 mins 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:25:27
Year is wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:54:41
Thank you sir but see the coinbase to coinbase pro, is that hard (as in actually registering for coinbase pro, cause i had issues eith its predecessor)
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:24:20
Not sure if your being serious or not. Nonetheless thanks so much for the offer. But I can not afford to pay that much right now. I would not dare to make a counter offer on here for fear of insulting you.
Thus, thanks soo much for the offer but i cant do it right now.
(If you wanna discuss it further, you can always PM me)
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:10:41
Still not reached 85 percent decline.
I wanna buy more!!!
@_date: 2018-07-07 22:38:11
Only £5 worth of bitcoin... i guess its a start
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:54:07
Insurance policy is pennies
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:10:30
£12  :D
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:48:25
Woah, didnt realise that. (Tbh i bought it because i got a new job which means money coming in so... thats why)
@_date: 2018-07-08 10:44:53
What car is it?
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:55:09
are there any other books you would recommended or is it just the Bob Volman's books? 
long story short: I've traded on CFD(still a newbie) on a particular platform and I've lost some real money(£2,300) doing that but I have also, at 1 point, managed to make more pretend(from £1800 to £9000 over 8 months whilst being an engineering student) money over a long period of time. 
The reason I say this is because I am confident that I can get my money back but with more studying. So, once again, any other books you would recommended or is just those 2?
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:47:02
Is there any coin in the cryptocurrency(even bitcoin if its still possible) or indeed anything thats worth taking an interest into right now that one day will become huge?
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:24:10
Hodl the coins until winter or if you want, have a look into the bitcoin technology, see why people believe into bitcoin, technology etc and then decide if you want to sell it
Hope this helps :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:32:25
Thank you very much for your reply. I will bear that lesson into mind (learning 1 method and becoming a master at it)
Once again, thanks very much for your reply and all the best for the future 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:33:57
Dont keep it on an exchange!!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:47:44
Depends on the ppl behind the advertisment.
In this case, its being promoted by etoro who make money on ppl speculating asset prices Inc Bitcoin
