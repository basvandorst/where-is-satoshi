Well some investment and trading strategies have been disastrous with bitcoin. As much money as I have made its nothing on if I had just bought $100 of BTC at $4 and held on to $800. yeah buy and hold is a typical strategy but becomes harder when the asset is increasing in value by thousands of percent
So that $100 could have been $320000. But some people are gonna are gonna make $900, some $20000 and others a cool couple of hundred k. We know who had the better outcome but not who was the smartest

Since when are derivatives basic financial instruments? Yes they can be simple. But they can also be pretty complicated. certain swaps for example and typically derivatives have no place in the novices portfolio

At some point you have an odd source of money connecting to you *unless* you launder the money
A *mixing service* is not quite the same as money laundering. SD may funtion as a mixing service, to obtain "clean" coins from dirty ones. But a mixing service is analogous to structuring not money laundering
If you need to launder money you should probably go and do that instead of fucking around on satoshidice and gambling the funds you earned/stole
The simplest example I can think of is this scenario. You have stolen some bitcoins/fiat/(have money obtained by specific illegal activity) and you want to get the money into your bank account. The point of money laundering is that you can turn around and say I got the cash doing *this* legitimate recorded and possibly even taxed activity.
Having mystery clean bitcoins is useless when you cant explain how you got them to the taxman when you are cashing them in. And having lots of cash is the exact same problem

Could not agree more. They trusted BTC with a suspect entity. Anyone that was not born into the BTC world yesterday knows that past trust is sure as hell not an indicator of future reliability. And gox had frankly been stinking for ages

Just because a group of people are running "a PR campaign" does not mean that it requires one. A video on a website is not a campaign.
The very fact that there is an active subbreddit as well as countless forums about it shows that **there are a lot of people that understand it and know what it is**. Not to be insulting, but how is this not obvious? 
If you want to take it upon yourself to popularize the currency that is your decision, it is not necessarily the correct decision.


Yes most governments allow their currencies to be legal. Shocker. I was just trying to clarify your comment


I mean plenty of people invested in Iceland before the financial crisis, they nationalized the banks, kept most of the money and are still a legitimate Government


Um not easily? BTC had only bad press from the start. Drugs, money laundering, drugs and hitmen. Those US senators have been gunning for BTC/Silk Road for over a year and a half. And is the US going to stop me (not in US) from buying them? As long as there is supply and demand they will be traded
More to the point BTC is supposed to be an alternative decentralised currency. Its **designed** to be seperate from and unregulated by governments and financial institutions.
I would rather my government not take an official stance on bitcoin, if they did they would be made illegal or taxed. If they were taxed thier status would likely not be given as favorable tax status as for trading wine, gold or antiques

Quite rude in my opinion. And you clearly put yourself on a pedestal. And your on the internet for fucks sake, grow up.
You have not really understood or replied to any of my comments.
In that specific context i meant that it would be hard for a government to make something like bitcoin illegal and its not very likely. And i said that **IF** my government decided to take an official stance on bitcoin. Do i have to stop and explain probabilities to you here? That it would likely be make illegal or taxed. I literally meant you should learn to read properly
@_date: 2012-11-29 13:50:36


So they do not make trades for you! Its not algorithmic trading (or high-frequency trading). Its a tipping service for BTC trading. They derive the tips using algorithms.
How you then trade off the tips is up to you, you could in theory write something to take the tips and bet them on mtgox as they come in, you would need something like a virtual sms number i assume tho
To OP: Definitely more interested in the algorithms and indicators then the tipping service itself. Looking forward to checking it out

@_date: 2012-12-19 17:59:11


I completely agree with you but this is done regularly by many. Yes transactions can be analysed and forking/looping is basically useless. Anonymity only really becomes an issue if you want to get a large amount of illegitimate coins into a bank account (and thus potentially linking your entities). 
But plenty of people will be happy to buy or spend "dirty" BTC, wallets can be sent avoiding a transaction entirely
@_date: 2012-12-19 16:00:48
So they could potentially match some of my anonymous entities to each other, big whoop. They could never match me to a transaction that I didn't want them to
Also there are plenty of technically sophisticated criminals

I didn't write your first rambling essay that contained many innacurate and irrelevant topics and of course


I never said mine did, you said your did, grassroots campaign and all.
You seem to be obsessed with PR. As i said those smear campaigns have been done and will continue to pop up again. Banks two, they can be unethical jerks and will be, guaranteed.
PR, government, fiat currencies and bitcoin only exist because people believe in them. That's my point Gummint's not necessarily safe, especially depending on where you live in the world. There's plenty of people all over the world believing in bitcoin.


I said it could make them illegal, they can't regulate or easily tax them so its the most likely option. Learn to read properly

I completely agree
In the other thread (which he links to) he said




Tipping services with no transparency whatsoever are common in financial trading, they are normally done on a subscription basis. I have never seen a financial tipping service even mention what indicators it is actually using for the tips. Mainly because if the system works and they tell you how it works why would you subscribe?

@_date: 2013-03-20 12:48:42
Well does it matter to you?
Keep it in your home currency if you do not want to be exposed to foreign exchange risk. So you are only concerned with the exchange rate between your currency and BTC.
You might make more money betting in a different currency but that currency would have to appreciate against yours, nothing to do with BTC exchange rates.
So I'm british, if i have a USD/BTC bet and the pound falls my bet is worth less (pounds), despite no change in the USD/BTC rate
You could always hedge the currency risk but that will cost money and provide no benefit to just betting in your own currency

But I come to to read about bitocoin not to answer noobs, i see no reason why we should cater to them. If they are interested in bitcoin then read up about it, thats what i did. The most we should be doing is create our own FAQ and keep that updated with common questions
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:11:50

@_date: 2013-02-07 15:00:30
I'm often confused by the arguments about why bitcoin not having a central bank is a bad thing. I mean we have had countries come so so close to bankruptcy (Iceland) and artificially kept out of bankruptcy (Greece) in just the last what 3-4 years? Clearly central banks or at least their monetary policies (possibly lack of) can negatively affect the value of the currency
@_date: 2013-01-08 13:01:48


Yeah cause we all know the banks strictly adhere to KYC. I mean its not like major banks (HSBC and UBS) have been intentionally allowing drug and terrorist funds to be laundered
And how much money is laundered globally through banks, its enough to make bitcoin (and especially silk road) look irrelevant by comparison.
Just to clarify im not disagreeing with you, just that banks are 2 faced asswipes. Also LIBOR rigging, fukin aswipes.
I think the fees are the main thing, no-one wants to give up a nice transaction fee.
I would also imagine that they would rather you start a debit/credit account with the possibility of going overdrawn, etc (just more fees really)
@_date: 2013-01-10 16:24:58

I didnt think any exchanges are currently regulated in any way. I know intersango (EUR/GBP) were trying to get FSA regulated but the exchage is basically dead now.
A cash for BTC exchange is fiat based and could not be subject to AML (And this is why i think of bitcoin as the new digital cash), they exist, i have a hand in one, not illegal or (specifally) taxed yet!
Its the banks responsibility to monitor their (the exchanges) accounts for potential money laundering activity. But most likely the accounts are just shut as soon as they are linked to bitcoin, the banks hate bitcoin exchange accounts.
Oh a brilliant new (and single?) example is Bitcoin-Central which has entered into a partnership with payment processor Aqoba and French bank Credit Mutuel Arkéa, enabling it to create accounts to hold the bitcoin currency. I believe any funds they receive should be subject to AML by law, how they plan to take BTC deposits i dont know!

I would give a general PSA that you should not be using derivatives if you do not fully understand them. Personally I think the biggest problem is counter party risk.

Oh no no, i have supported many an apple device, laptops mostly. All from technically impaired friends and family that insist on buying apple despite my admonishing's. I'm not blindly saying i will never buy an apple produt, I WILL never buy an apple product. Its not just the tech and cost, even for the field its a fairly unethical and environmentally irresponsible company.
I'v been working in IT for over 6 years, developing for 3. I have a few close colleagues that are either all apple or just like a particular device, these are people that I count on and respect. Even they have not been able to give me a cohesive argument for why I should buy any apple product. And more and more I think they just like the complete apple infrastructure, despite its inferiorities. But im seeing increasingly less apple devices in the office recently, we had a complete fanboy swich sides over in the last few weeks. laptop, tablet and phone, hes a tinkerer and now hes setteled in hes much happier.
Iv got a quad core desktop win 7 desktop that can run some decent VMs, brand spanking new thinkpad running ubuntu, rasberry pi (rasbien), htc desire and nexus 7 (android). You could not pay me to change any to the apple equivalent (if available), even with upgrades. The functionality I have is amazing, if its possible I can do it. Completely free and legally, apart from possibly a pirate version of photoshop but i hardly use it and c'mon!

@_date: 2013-01-08 14:51:31


well this was in response to your question "How exactly would you launder money with a Bitcoin debit card?"
I did not say it cant be done other ways, there are many other ways!
But you describe typical (and basic) money laundering, really nothing to do with BTC. I think thats key to the how do you launder *with* BTC, BTC has to be part of the obscuration proccess. Otherwise you are just laundering cash


Im not sure what your point is? Im assuming thats about giving the card to someone? You would give them the loading address/key as well. They are giving you "legitimate" money and you are giving them spendable (but dirty) money.
edit: Just wanted to add that im only talking about money laundering and money laundering using BTC, not laundering BTC (al la bitlaundry) but that could obviously be useful for the former
@_date: 2013-01-23 11:18:16

But I am desperately exited to get my 4 module, with PSU (completely ready to go). Which apparently has already cleared customs

There are legit mixing services. And certain tor black markets mix automatically and aren't checking for stolen coins. You wouldn't even have to purchase anything and the site I am thinking of moves millions of USD a week
Or sell for fiat, or buy drugs/guns/services and sell them for fiat. Launder fiat normally
I actually struggle to see how anyone can get caught doing stuff like this

So stashing nazi art is fine as long as I am using BTC?
What the hell is wrong with you? That's stolen art of huge cultural significance, you are literally endorsing BTC for obfuscating illegal criminal practises. Now I think theoretical discussions on anonymity and pseudoanonymity are great but lets not give tips to fucking nazis
And no not related to BTC

I work in finance, plenty of people know and use bitcoin themselves. Bitcoin has been favored by day traders since very early on. the investment communities that know about bitcoin love bitcoin because its been doing so well

You can miss some significant swings off mt gox
If you look at the charts, [mt gox]( vs [btc24](
they should be near identical but no, obviously that can be advantageous, giving arbitrage opportunities. But when BTC drops you actually want it to drop, not for the market to hang in anticipation of the BTC price rising

Obviously batch 3 is sold out, so that could be a problem for you. I did not pass and dropped 100 BTC yesterday. Although my estimates don't look quite as rosy as yours (Best to be pessimistic IMO), but it may just pay for itself in 2-3 months


So obvious but I've still got to stress that the company has taken god knows how many orders, not produced anything of significance ever and are *still* taking orders. If you believe they will deliver then go for it but for the love of god don't put ANY faith in their estimates. That's why I went for the avalon, they have the only track record with ASICs

I'v got a good few coins, 60ish? But I'm now considering having BTC as a permanent allocation in my financial portfolio and would probably buy another 60 (at today's prices) for around a £5000 GBP allocation (i'm british)
But I've made so much off BTC the last year (trading/exchange/arbitrage) It's just hard to care about any ongoing risk
EDIT:You can also look into the BTC based security exchanges like bitfunder, etc. To invest with bitcoins.
Also I'm partial to a bit of P2P lending and love BTCJAM for that

I did see this in many comments on the forums. USD value refunds only but they will refund by which payment method was used. personally i think thats a real punch in the nads for people who paid in BTC. Its understandable but customers have been severely misled, a refund almost doesn't cut it. And there must be people outside the US hit further by the change in USD to their currency.

But wont the only advantage be the slot capacity? I'd imagine its cheaper to just buy a good value mobo that has not been designed for bitcoin. I mean, your better off with a free/dirt cheap old mobo if all the work is going on in the PCI-E cards anyway
And the monarch looks like a terrible investment anyways

Your legislation can get as strict as it likes it will not affect how the rest of the world, specifically individuals go about their business.
Theoretically if it were to happen I would mine them anonymously, as is already possible. Animosity is key to various services surrounding bitcoin and is already in place. 
I do not consider the US a threat to my bitcoin trade in any way
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:03:30
I have not and will not connect an exchange to my bank account. I prefer to fund online exchanges through cash exchanges and then either sell the BTC for cash or goods and services. Mostly to maintain anonymity.
But I made back (and cashed out) many times my original investments already so I care a lot less about the value of the BTC I have remaining

Well you could simply load your card with BTC obtained by illicit means and spend it. This is assuming these cards are anonymous. 
Or you could swap the loaded card for a seemingly legitimate transaction (say i pretend to buy a TV off you, you actually give me the card). You now have clean cash in your bank account, i have anonymous prepaid card.
These are simple examples

I would agree completely, all this drama is really pissing me off. Im in on a BTCFPGA 72GH and at christmas they said there was a positive update coming and still on target. I think they had already claimed to have some or a working chip. a week or 2 later and its a 2 month delay, selling the company, tom has gone into meltdown. WTF?

That's a fair point and the PSA is obviously advising you not to use such a device for mining. But I meant my original comment quite literally. Personally i would never buy an apple product and I think a real laptop might have survived

They charge 0.3% if you were market making vs 0.95% (I'm sure that used to be lower) if you are buying at the bid or selling at the ask price
I thought it was a great idea in practice. Its just a shame intersango cant get a uk bank account up for more than a month, haven't used them since my bank (barclays) locked my account for a week after trying to make a SEPA transfer online. Barclays tried to convince me I had a computer virus (seriously, a virus that my browser can detect that only acts maliciously when i try to do a SEPA transfer), so i was like fine ill use a different computer. Sorry sir it appears that computer is also infected. After a week someone at barclays "broke character" and said that intersango were being investigated (by them) and i should just to stop trying to send them money. The sepa transfer charges aren't cheap either.
But if your only transferring BTC in and out and only "market making" then it could work well

I prefer things like bitcoin-otc or local bitcoins. you could always use bitbargain or mt gox
I like to do as much in person and community as possible, i think for GBP BTC my transactions are off exchange in cash, exclusively. At least since my bank account was blocked trying to fund intersango with a SEPA transaction. They kept telling me i had a virus on my computer, it took me 2 days to get it unlocked. I then stupidly tried it again and of course my work computer was also infected with a virus, locked for a few more days. really it was the barclays waiting music that got to me most
But really that was the best thing that could have happened because i had to find other ways and i ended up meeting some great people that are just as passionate as bitcoin as i am and also can ping me a loan if im desperate!
