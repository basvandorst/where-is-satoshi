What if they actually couldn't get the clearance even if they wanted to?

Gemini works for me, but has seemingly arbitrary rules to determine daily limits and is very slow to withdraw. Still better than Coinbase hands down.

100 Antminer S9s should put you over a petahash per second for $210,000 not counting electricity, cooling, maintenance, etc. At the current difficulty and price you could reasonably expect around $1000 per day.
Edit: sorry I think I misread your question. Multiple my previous estimates by 2000.

I am a medium tier trader at around $500 per day and just had too many problems with Coinbase. For example they are too slow, ask for too much personal info, double spend my coins and refund the wrong amounts. Compared this to Gemini that gives you immediate credit to trade with only a small delay in withdrawals and you see why I prefer one over the other. I would be suspicious of anyone who says Coinbase is good and ask them for specific examples.

I have a hypothesis they do this on purpose when their algorithm predicts a price increase because they refund the dollar amount rather than the coins.

You could start by showing the development timeline from 2009 until now with a focus on mining.

There will inevitably be lost coins just like sunken treasure in the ocean.

Sorry mate, I'm afraid you missed my point. I believe Coinbase is timing their transactions to benefit from the volatility. Don't forget they trade in dollars, not coins. For example, they made a double deposit into my account of exactly 1 coin. Several days later they withdrew the previous dollar value NOT the single coin. By that time, the price had fallen so I lost over 100,000 bits. WTF Coinbase?

I made several (unanswered) inquiries to their customer support and can't think of a single other modern company with less availability.
