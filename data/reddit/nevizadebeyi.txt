10% return for you means 10% interest for the borrower, which is insanely high for any loan let alone a business loan. Banks will always have better rates but they just don’t lend to businesses that are very likely to default and/or can’t collateralize. This is why I’m struggling to understand what you mean by suggesting the loans you give return greater than stocks. 
The core tenant of finance is “higher risk, higher reward.” If you’re getting 10%+ return on a loan that’s because it’s extremely risky (if even after its collateralized and the rate is *that* high for a borrower - it means they have bad credit history or some serious underlying issue). The point of a diversified portfolio is to minimize the riskiness while increasing return, with you’re hypothetical trucking example the max upside is 10% but the max downside is totally defaulting on your investment (-100%). That’s pretty damn risky to me...especially since you can’t short a loan and they aren’t liquid like equities or debt traded on the stock exchange. 
Good luck, I hope micro-lending works for you but as a general rule of thumb it’s a terrible idea for diversifying a portfolio. Do it if you want to help small businesses and have cash to burn.

Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t believe vanguard has a FOREX fund either, which is essentially what cryptos would fall into. 
The whole point of vanguard funds is to cover the entire traditional market or segments of it and lowest cost to provide peace of mind, sensible, rational investing. It’s not a casino and returns are not expected to move wildly in either direction. 
Vanguard funds are a nice old tugboat steaming along...cryptos are the formula 1 speed machines that are awesome to watch but when they blow a tire or hit the curb too soon they crash out and burn.

Currencies are regulated by central banks...the banks determine interest rates between banks and the production or destruction of currency in circulation (this controls inflation and deflation). So, “fiat” currencies actually are somewhat immune to volatility...if they have a strong central bank setting sound financial policies. 
By definition cryptos are meant to be decentralized and unregulated, volatility will always be their hallmark. This is why they can never be a store of value and why they will never be widely accepted currency...how does Amazon or Target determine how much bitcoin a T-shirt costs? How often do the stores need to adjust that price based on the changing value of bitcoin?
With a dollar you can set the price and leave it for years...with bitcoin that price will need to be adjusted dozens of times an hour.

Golds been a human obsession for the last 15,000+ years, wait until bitcoin is at least 25 before you start shit talking it. 
The communists, Fascists, and Free Market Capitalists all loved the stuff. The Muslims, Christians, and Jews all went crazy for it. Wars have been fought for it and wars have been lost because there wasn’t enough of it. Palaces are adorned with it, people wrap it around their appendages, and our smartphones depend on it. 
Ah yes, Gold. How we love you so...

Isn’t this more about fraud protection though? once a scammer uses your CC to but $1,000 worth of crypto and then removes that to offline storage, it’s gone. The bank is at risk of losing a lot of money and being gamed by scammers both ways (ie someone claims their card is stolen and used to buy BTC, they then get a refund from capital one, but they were the one to original buy the BTC so now they have a $1,000 refund from cap one and $1,000 of BTC).

Yes to diversifying: yes to commodities (gold, silver), yes to stocks (mutual funds/ETFS rule the world), hell the fuck no to micro-lending. 
Very very few investors make any return at all on P2P micro-lending and many lose their investments as well. OP would see a better return (and guaranteed positive return) buying 30 year T-bills or putting some cash in an ally bank high-yield...note I’m not endorsing those 2 options, just emphasizing why micro-lending is not a legitimate way to diversify a portfolio. It’s an unknown beta (risk factor) with no historic performance/analyst reports to base any strategy off of.

You can’t “quote” something that isn’t actually a quote at all...
Did you think that was an argument you just made? Because I presented some basic concepts of finance and you just quoted something no one said.

Not really correct, Monte Carlo simulations use random probability to run every “possible” scenario based on the data inputs. They simply take the criteria that can cause an outcome and run *every* possible manipulation of that criteria. 
They are more reliable with established past performance because the criteria are better understood, but with an unknown asset like BTC we still don’t know what criteria drive price and by how much it has done so in the past. 
Monte Carlo Simulation makes little sense when evaluating cryptos.

The irony is that in order for Bitcoin to actually serve its intended purpose and be decentralized currency that Cana cruelly be *used*, the supply must increase. If the supply increases then the price will drop...
So if you’re in bitcoin because you believe it’ll one day be the currency of the internet then you’ll probably be happy in a few years, but if you’re in bitcoin because you think it’s going to hit $1mil and you’ll be able to buy a yacht...then you’re clueless. 
And of course, if bitcoin never serves its purpose then it’ll always remain a weird commodity online that goes up and down wildly. The threat of regulation will always be real and talk of a bubble bursting will never go away. The only positive future bitcoin can have is if it becomes an actually usable currency, but this removes all the “investor” buzz and just turns bitcoin into another option for FOREX traders to play with.

If the word “somewhat” threw you off I could elaborate...currency volatility is not dependent on investor sentiment but rather the strength or weakness of a nations economy. National debt for starters will impact currency rates, defaulting on the debt will tank a currency. 
But if the USD tanks the global economy goes with it...so it’s a catch 22. You can’t really see the USD move up or down by 600% and not have global financial collapse.

Is there ever a point where you’ll reconsider this strategy? I’m just curious to understand the logic behind the “double down” method, since it doesn’t really exist with equities or most other investments. Usually an investor will set a valuation on an asset they buy and reassess their investing strategy based on how the market moves. 
Doubling down does exist in gambling but that’s a moot point I’d suppose. 
Do you just believe the value of BTC is endless/much much higher than the market says it is and so you’ll keep buying until it hits your valuation? What is that point? How have you determined that valuation other than optimism?

Why would the value of the dollar matter for most investors or consumers? The real value is still the same, it’ll buy you more or less the same as last year on this day (excluding 3% inflation). The dollar is not a store of value it’s transactional, dollar to dollar transactions are unaffected - this may in theory make products more expensive in the US if they were imported from a country who’s currency became more expensive but typically companies eat the loss in profit to maintain prices (if the foods are elastic and price determines demand). 
FOREX is very complicated economics and finance, a trash article claiming “hooray the value of the dollar dropped by XX%!” means absolutely nothing. Not to mention the dollars price moves *in relation* to other currencies...so this means European exports are likely to decrease or European countries will lose profit (either way it’s not good for big European companies). It makes little sense to discuss currency rates like this. 
But once bitcoin has stabilized and existed/become adopted for a few decades then it can be added to the list of FOREX options for companies engaged in international trade to work with.

What site is this? And what do you mean by “the rate” is lower than banks but higher than stocks? Banks always have lower returns than the market, although no stock has any defined rate of return. If you mean in general, assuming you’re referring to the average return of the S&amp;P500 then I find it extremely hard to believe...

At what point will people admit they’re worried? It’s ok, this isn’t a cult (allegedly), it’s a sub discussing investing in a new technology. You can have faith in bitcoin and believe it’s the best out there, but this doesn’t mean it’ll make you as rich as you dream. Plenty of superior techs have failed, not saying bitcoin will though. 
On the flip side at least now we can put to rest this notion that bitcoin or other cryptos are “stores of value” let alone stores better than gold or other established commodities. It’s nonsense, a stores job is to store...to preserve your net worth. Cryptos fluctuate wildly and defeat the purpose. 
Cryptos are the riskiest investment out there right now and no one knows what will happen, let’s just stop pretending we’re all optimistic and excited for a rebound. It may come, it may not, we may not even benefit from it if we need to cash out for some reason before the rally.

The purchasing power of the USD in the US market is unchanged, the US inflation rate is around 3% and has been since Regan. Therefore, as currency, the USD is exactly as it was at the start of 2017...now as an investment? Yeah, bad year for FOREX traders. 
Is bitcoin an investment or a currency replacement designed to overthrow the centralized banks today and provide a truly universal means to buy things? If it’s a currency, this is a meaningless post...bitcoin is less usable today than on January 1st. If it’s an investment, bitcoin had a great year. 
Bitcoin needs to figure out what bitcoin is and then it can decide how well it performed against its actual alternatives. The USD is not a bitcoin alternative (currency), most people buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for USD. Think of bitcoin as an alternative to Gold or Mutual Funds.

FOMO should *never* ever, **ever**, drive investment strategy. Neither should unrealistic expectations of getting rich by outsmarting an intelligent market. 
Only invest if you believe in the underlying assets, if you believe that you’re backing a winning worse (and hopefully you use some facts and research to support that belief). Don’t just buy something because it’s gotten more expensive recently and you want it to keep going. 
So, buy bitcoin if you believe in the mission and understand the barriers/risks to its success. Do not buy bitcoin simply because it’s price has been going up for the past 4 years overall...
If you don’t know *why* it’s price has gone up, don’t buy. Eventually bitcoin will reach a cap but if you’re ignorant of the fact you’ll have no idea what to do.

Put $200 in, and in the best case that money goes to $2000. This is the absolute absolute extremely absolute high that money could ever conceivably get. It’ll never happen, like ever, but let’s just say that happens. 
What will happen now? Is a poor man who risked $200 he needs today suddenly rich because he’s made $1,800? Take out 15% in tax and he’s at $1,530 - a nice little chunk and more than $200 obviously but...not life changing by any means. 
In the meantime the poor man doesn’t have $200 to pay towards food or rent, they don’t have that money to stay alive today. They’ve also just risked the money on something hat may very well be less than $200 at the moment that man needs the cash - emergencies happen, let’s say in a month he needs all the money he has and has to sell for $190 (not considering transaction fees). Now what? 
People without money to lose should never throw it at such risky investments...save that cash, put it into a 401K, put it in a CD, open an *Ally Bank* account and make close to inflation in interest. Do not throw it at bitcoin because you heard that’s hot right now...

I said the inflation rate was 3%, over 4 years...yeah that’s 12% so you’ll notice. But had you stayed in the US, invested money and earned *at least* 3% interest every year, and been employed at a decent company that increases salary by at least inflation every year...then what I said is still true. 
Inflation is not a wild concept, it’s actually historically low in the US these last few decades. 
Prices are a product of supply and demand as well as inflation, and if they go up in the US they go up everywhere. This includes bitcoin purchasing power by the way...if bitcoin were stable and usable like normal currency you’d see this.

Are you suggesting that I’m somehow oblivious to the life I’ve actually lived the last year? My money buys the same amount of food, rent, and alcohol as it did on January 1st. My investments have all given me healthy return in more dollars as well...
This is real purchasing power...nothing has been plummeting...other than bitcoin this month of course. But when it comes to what you can use bitcoin for *without* using any other currency (and especially USD), the problem is clear. You are limited severely. You cannot go to buy groceries or gas or a house or anything at all worth buying with just bitcoin alone. And the value of bitcoin to USD has been wildly fluctuating for the last 5 years...
This is not the purpose of a currency, which is intended to provide individuals with the power to purchase goods and services they need.
