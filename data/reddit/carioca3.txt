The bigger effects of deflation are usually on investment and growth. Why should I invest in a new business when I can just sit on my ass and make a safe 2-3% doing nothing? (or whatever the deflationary rate is.) 
Loans are also troublesome in a deflationary economy due to no new money creation. The maximum investment spending is whatever I have, I cannot get a loan from a bank because they would be maintaining 100% reserve requirements. (any lower and there would be money creation, creating inflation.)

Didn't they test large amounts of hardware on the network before sending to customers? Couldn't they have tested it on the test network? I guess an equivalent would be a gold mining company taking preorders for equipment then using that equipment to mine all the gold that is easy to access. After all the easy gold is mined they  deliver the equipment to customers; win win for the equipment supplier and lose-lose for the customer.

You make the assumption that more people will want bitcoins in the future. With all the scams (pirate40) and hacks happening with no way to recover stolen funds it is likely that more and more people will give up on bitcoin as a "real" currency.

They sold far below market value? How is that possible? If the price is at 130 and I put in a sell order at 100 it will sell at the highest bid price (130) not 100. A large sell order like this will likely bring down the price as the highest bids get fulfilled and it moves to lower bids, bringing the market value down lower. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:15:19
They don't want to because Avalon has a monopoly on ASIC at the moment. For every ASIC that is sold the network hashrate goes up and the profit generated for each ASIC goes down. They don't want to sell more because it will make their ASICs worth less and it will expose them to additional risks. Once a competitor starts selling ASICs (i.e. BFL) Avalon will sell their ASICs as fast as possible because everyday their product is worth less than the day before due to BFL ASICs increasing the hashrate.

Perfect! Is it implemented yet? I want to make a middleman payment service that when in an equal dispute will side with the buyer. I think a lot of bitcoiners will like having buyer protection even if they have to pay a small fee, especially with all the likely ASICScams popping up. Maybe I'll put the fee on the seller side so it is "hidden" from the buyer and does not influence their purchase decisions. This will greatly increase trust in the bitcoin community!

I assume you mean a p2p bitcoin/PM exchange and not a physical exchange that stores the gold on your behalf? Because if it is the later you will still run into regulation issues. 
Anyways, the transaction costs are too high to make it feasible. Cost of shipping, storage, price volatility, shipping insurance, escrow fees, scams, etc. make it very inefficient. It would be easier to just follow regulations and make a legit money transfer business. As far as I know there have been no seizures of bank accounts or exchanges that followed all money transfer rules and regulations.

True, but for 5x more profit and less risk it is worth it.


True, but the max dividend is not as high as you think. Only 3600 bitcoins are generated each day and the max ASICMiner can get is 1764 (49%) which gives a max dividend of 0.03087 btc a week per share assuming 0% operating costs.

According to his own source:


* the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power;
* the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;
* sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;  
* interest rates, wages, and prices are linked to a price index; 
* and the cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches, or exceeds, 100%.

All difficulty estimates are WAY too low. The technology for ASICs has been developed so mass production will be very cheap. I estimate the difficulty will be ~1,450,000,000 once ASICs are easy to get.  
Calculations:   
Cost of ASIC: 1300  
Expected ROI on high risk investment: 30% (390 USD a year)   
Profit Required for 30% ROI: 1.06 USD a day    
Power cost (620 W @ 0.1 kWh): 1.49 a day  
Daily Revenue @ 1.45 billion diff: 2.55 USD  
Therefore at current prices a difficulty of 1.45 billion will be where ASIC miners are making "normal" profits. Anything below this value there is an incentive to purchase more ASICs and add more hash power to the network.

Avalon is not shipping a lot of units because they have a monopoly will get more profit per unit (and in total) by limiting the supply. By shipping only a few units they keep the difficulty low and buyers will be willing to pay a lot more for an ASIC. Once BFL starts shipping the flood gates will open because Avalon and BFL will be trying to sell as many units as possible before the difficulty increases too much.
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:07:35

Buyer side risk. With bitcoin all the risk is on the buyer side which, unless it offers additional benefits over fiat (i.e. lower price), will never catch on. Why is this a problem? As a buyer I cannot hedge my risk because I'm only buying 1 item. Whereas a seller can; if he sells 1000 items and is scammed 1% of the time he just increases the price ~1% and absorb the risk.

Mining coins does not increase wealth, it only decreases the value of each coin, the aggregate value of the bitcoin economy is the same. Look at it this way:  
* World economy prebitcoin = 1000 dollars  
* Bitcoin comes along and 100 dollars goes into the exchange   
Bitcoin economy(100 coins @ 1 dollar)  is now worth 100 dollars and World-exbitcoin is worth 900   
* Bitcoin economy grows to 200 coins (from mining), due to the increase in supply the value drops to 0.5 dollars each. The bitcoin economy is worth 100 and World-exbitcoin is worth 900. If the miners attract new buyers and they pay $1 a coin the value of the bitcoin economy is now worth 200 and world-exbitcoin only 800.  
The world economy has stayed the same. It is still worth 1000 dollars. There has been no new wealth created, it is only changing hands.

Are people/bots using large buy/sell walls to push the market price? For example: Place a huge sell wall @ 150 or so. Small time sellers who don't want to wait for the wall to fall sell at 149. More sellers try and underbid the 149 sellers driving the price down more to around ~140. The large sell wall moves its position to 140 and the process repeats itself. 
Once the price drops low enough the big fish buys a bunch of bitcoins and places a large buy wall to stop the market from dropping. The momentum follows the opposite pattern resulting in the bitcoin price recovering.
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:54:20

Yes, there is a long term incentive but we would need all exchanges to regulate in order for it to work.

I really wish someone would make a list of goods and services that are cheaper/easier with bitcoin. There are too many posts where people are doing day-to-day tasks with bitcoin when it would be much easier to just use fiat. (i.e. buying a giftcard with btc and using it at a restaurant.)  
Thank you for sharing this. Bitcoin has a clear advantage in this instance (10% cheaper!)

Am I the only person who has never had a problem with paypal? I've been scammed multiple times on eBay and every time paypal has refunded my money (both on buyer and seller side.) Sure, there are fees, but I am happy to pay those for buyer/seller protection. If I ever need to transfer money to someone I trust I just use venmo (no fee instant transfer.)   
Bitcoin is great, in theory, but right now and for the majority of bitcoin's history it has had high volatility with high barriers to entry. (compared to the current system.)

Good point. That is a very large incentive. On the flip side he could be "cooking the books" with higher and higher dividends to increase share price and then sell off.

You can write off 6360 USD in loses on your tax return. Actually, I'm not even sure if you can do that, best to ask a CPA.

We can greatly lower the energy usage by eliminating block rewards and allowing miners to only take transaction fees. This will greatly lower the network hash rate (and energy) but lower security as a 51% attack is much easier. One possible solution is establish a bunch of non-profit ASICmining companies to start hashing if it is detected that a 51% attack is about to happen. They will mine at a loss to protect the network.

If you're going to use paypal sell through eBay. That way you will get seller protection.

Good analysis but far off. Personally I think ASICMiner shares are OVERvalued. Here's why:  
* Current dividends are near their highest for ASICMiner shares because very few ASICs are on the market. As more ASICs arrive hash power will go up and dividends will drop
 
* Dividends will be cut in half next block halving 
* ASICMiner shares are very high risk. What is stopping them from issuing more shares or cutting the dividend? Nothing, it is an unregulated market.
* More profitable substitutes are available. I can spend 1600 and build a GPU miner that will profit ~70 USD a week after power costs or I can buy 1600 of ASICMiner shares (~5.3 shares) and get around 12.80 USD a week (based on a 0.02 dividend.) 
* Lower risk substitutes are available. A GPU Miner can be resold used for near its original buy price. If bitcoin crashes around ~70% (after depreciation, eBay fees, etc.) of your investment can be recouped.

3600 New coins are generated through mining each day. Each one is worth ~120 USD. This means that there is approximately 432,000 USD worth of bitcoins to be mined each day. As long as there is a profit to be made people will continue to add miners to the network. The total electricity cost is independent of ASIC miners or GPU miners, it is dependent on the value of bitcoin.

GPU miners have a better return. 1600 USD can buy you a miner that generates 70 USD a week after energy costs. 1600 USD in ASICMiner shares will get you 16 USD a week. ASICMiner shares are unregulated so the dividend can be cut or more shares issued.

15 dollar minimum fee for bank deposits? Seems expensive...

My solution: use paypal/credit card when you're buying something and bitcoin if you're selling.
I never understood why people would use bitcoins for everyday things when they could use a credit card for the same transaction and gain cash back + buyer protection.

I love it. Bitcoin is like the wild wild west. Banks getting robbed, individuals getting robbed and no way to recover the funds. Unless bitcoin becomes worthless these attacks will continue to get more sophisticated.

100% unregulated market with an unknown person in china who we know very little about. He has had a history of being honest but there is nothing in place to keep him honest nor are there any (direct) consequences if he was to become dishonest.

It is a zero sum game. No new wealth was created, it is only changing hands.

I'm glad this finally happened. Too many people/bots were using huge bid walls to manipulate the market. Unfortunately for those of us who have btc holdings this is a bad thing in the short term. The wall that fell was being used to prop the value of btc up by creating a price floor, now that it's gone the price of btc is free to move up or down easier. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:07:19
On the aggregate no one wins trading bitcoin; it is a zero sum game.

Bitspend has a fee...

Except if you get scammed on ebay you can do a chargeback. It would be more like a bitmit vendor with a 100% rating, no verified ID, and no escrow.

On the flip side his hardware has a much higher resell value compared to AM shares in the event of a crash. I just sold my 5870 for 160 bucks on eBay and I paid 225 for it ~3 years ago.

Agreed. However, the biggest problem with bitcoin is the high volatility of the currency. New development and projects are easy to encourage because there is a monetary incentive. In order to reduce volatility the exchanges need to reduce HFT and try to curb market manipulation (i.e. painting the tape, pump and dump, etc.) There is no incentive for the exchanges to do this because it will reduce total transaction volume and result in less money for the exchanges.

It will go parabolic. ASICs only have a high profitability for ASIC producers due to the high ROI for miners. The majority of the ASIC dev cost is in engineering and development; it is very cheap to replicate once designed. Now that there are a few chip producers they will sell as quickly as possible while the ROI on ASICs is high and they can command a premium. This will cause a buttload of new miners to enter the network increasing the hashrate exponentially.

a very bad way actually. Pretty much guarantees their gains will be taxed.
