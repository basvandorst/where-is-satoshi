Makes me NOT want to make any transactions until you hire more people. All I see are complaints about coinbase.

coinbase has lots of negative reviews. I looked into it. Be careful. they dont have enough employees to run the company smoothly. 
You buy and it takes weeks to get them in your wallet. I would not recommend them. I did create an account and found out the hard way. Use localbitcoins.com , they charge an upfront fee of a few dollars but you get them instantly.

NSA wants bitcoin to go away. Why would a group of wanna'be's want to bring down bitcoin?

everyone should try requesting payment to see if he sends off bits and pieces to [those who request it]( Like the Minnesota man who tossed out dollars into the middle of the mall of america

Next time ASK REDDITORS
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:09:06
its free to join. You hookup with someone local and meet at a pre arranged local and time. Then exchange usually cash for some bitcoins. Make sure you bring   a print out of your wallet id, or something they can scan , or even your laptop at a coffee shop. It takes seconds to transfer them over to your wallet ifyou have internet access

gee, so many negative reviews from reddit :P
