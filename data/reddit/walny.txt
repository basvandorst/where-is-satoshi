no wallet is a command line argument, no gui then compiling from /src/build-unix should be what you're after. there should be lots of stuff for you to read in /doc

i can vouch for quickbt..
its actually an ideal solution for someone starting out because there is minimal hassle in the verification process of its customers and the amounts are limited to under a few hundred dollars a day so if you do mess something up you wont lose the farm.
if you're looking for a real (larger) investment down the road i'd avoid the big exchanges as well and find someone willing to make a personal exchange for better price. be sure you are comfortable with transactions by this point and make sure you're aware of unconfirmed transactions, double spends etc..

unless its a btm. most machines actually only sell bitcoin and accept cash. those that dispense cash buying bitcoin are often empty.

nope.. if you're mining and score a block you can send part of the reward as a coinbase transaction.. thus avoiding the need for any fees.. but your recipient is stuck waiting 100 confirms before being able to spend it heh.

200 Franc note is much better.. more readily spendable and still creates a nice wad for walking around money.

tweeting downtime with sub 24h notice is hardly acceptable.
if you're alright with this than you're a hindrance to widespread acceptance.
