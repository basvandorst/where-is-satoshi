Actually you can seize illegals' remittances already, just Obama etc do not use the law.  Federal banking regulation states that any bank transfer to a foreign bank entity must be able to identify the person making the transfer.  Illegals have no ID, so if enacted will not be able to send wires to the central bank of mexico.

The price isn't rocketing up fast, so I do not expect a quick downturn.  Steadiness is best.

Trump was pointing out the audacity that the feds print money that could pay off foreign debt, not that he would actually do that.  I believe he has said all along he want's to renegotiate the debt, which is something he has had lots of practice doing.

BS on the reason US interest rates rose because of economic recovery.  They rose (if you can call 0.25% a rise) to hide the failing economy.

So the few thousands they lost while it was in a limit order was their/my fault?  I know people that lost their funds because they were stuck and lost in transfer.

My folks lost a few thousand $$$ worth thanks to Karpeles.  Im am surprised by anyone who doesn't want to line up and kick him in the ass.
