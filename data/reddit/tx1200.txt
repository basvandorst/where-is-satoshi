I didn't buy any of my hardware. My dad owns a big company. They've all gone for vacation and I built the PCs there including the server. I just installed nice hash and ran it on 50 different pcs

@_date: 2017-06-11 11:22:05

Sorry but the link doesn't even work. It's just keeping me in a infinite loading screen

So in conclusion, I can continue mining with my bitoasis account and within a week's time or so, I'll recive payments.?

I built every pc there. It's either a hackintosh with Windows on bootcamp or its just pure windows 
Most of they have 750 or 750 ti's
So yes. I am Gpu mining.

Cool. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:00:49
Am sorry but I can't. Mining is the only way I can put myself thru collage. I don't have money for investment either. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:24:46
Electricity isn't a concern where I live. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:00:03
Are u sure about this? My bit oasis account has 15 dollars and this is the outcome of 4 days. If u insist on this, I will switch my main pc to mine to my nice hash account and transfer it to some other account later on 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:41:13
So can I continue using bit oasis or switch to nice hashs wallet
