Thanks. Please consider an upvote of the meta post, if you agree. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:41:48
Honestly not trying to... is there any wording changes you would suggest to reduce confusion? I really am just trying to promote my app... 
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:06:13
Where? I couldn't find any previous meta posts.

Thanks! Stay tuned for an announcement in the next few weels about my app... and go bitcoin!

Currently, though the accused has protection against self incrimination, US law says that the accused can be required to divulge "knowledge" - a handwriting sample, DNA, fingerprint - I presume that the court might see a private key as fitting that mould.

I'm developing a bitcoin app for iOS... anyone that would like to help support it, I'm accepting tips, if this is a good tippable thing. And a bit of wisdom... in two days, Nov. 6, it will have been exactly 4 years since the bitcoin market cap topped 1M. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:22:30
Thank you, kind sir!

That meta post suggested things I dont - being able to trade reputation for bitcoin, using it as a bounty, etc. I didn't suggest that. I highlighted its use as a way to show appreciation.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:46:19
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:07:53
Not really - though I do try to tell them why bitcoin is awesome all the time.

Thanks for the compliments - really appreciate it. I will keep you posted on CryptoCalc's future.

The app is CryptoCalc and CryptoCalcLite - a simple iOS bitcoin price ticker and converter, with 23 world currencies.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:31:59
Great, let me know what you think! As for the other question - I annoy them to no end at school with my Bitcoin evangelism :D! 
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:34:50
Swift - I taught myself, with help from youtube and r/swift.

How is it different from paper wallets?

Try [CryptoCalc ]( It is an iOS app with bitcoin prices, conversions, and 23 world currencies. Full disclosure: I am the developer of it. Also, I am 14 years old, so it might not yet be as great as other options - but please check it out!

@_date: 2015-01-17 12:26:49
I think it's worth it - it's fun and makes money. I would suggest [raywenderlich.com] has great tutorials, and use [stackoverflow.com] and r/swift for questions. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:06:22
How sturdy is it? Does it feel like it could be easily broken in day-to-day carrying?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:21:03
Thanks - appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:37:25
How would you respond to this sentiment?
Why should I use bitcoin? As a non-libertarian/non-criminal/non-anarchist, what is in it for me? How would you convince me to use bitcoin, when the current system of handing over paper for my morning coffee works just fine?
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:54:34
I have to mention the Alzheimer's association of America - alz.org. They are doing some really great stuff. Also - happy Tuesday!
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:42:00
Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:20:54
Honestly, I am 14, though there is probably nothing I can do to convince you. And for promoting my app - granted. I do that on Reddit. However, you will also find non-CryptoCalc stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:09:06
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:40:14
There's also a free version (CryptoCalcLite), and 99 cents is the cheapest I can make a non-free app. That said, I'm not in it to make huge gobs of money - I did it for fun, and as a first coding project.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:01:45
Ah. Thanks for looking - appreciate it. Why you use windows phone is a different matter... kidding! Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:20:29
Once I learn Java, I will make an android version.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:41:17
Yes - it's guaranteed. After the last block mined, bitcoin will switch solely to paying miners with transaction fees
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:05:01
Working on better graphics for version 2 - appreciate the feedback.
@_date: 2015-05-19 11:57:25
I C your objective with those jokes.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:08:54
My app relies on a simple idea: many Bitcoin price apps suck. If one is just trying to check in on the price, why should they care about the last day's trade volume? If one is trying to price their merchandise in bitcoin, they really don't care about hash rate. Graphs are great - until you have to swipe through confusing graph after confusing graph just to check on your investment. So, CryptoCalc is just simplicity - the bitcoin price, plus easy conversions, in 23 world currencies. It is just what you need to know, the Bitcoin price, without distractions.
Though it is always a struggle between homework and programming :D I am working on a version 2, which will feature a revamped UI, more crypto (and fiat) currencies, and more. I hope it can be "the app" that people pull out of their pocket when they want price - and that will happen as it gets better and better.
So, to complete this "elevator pitch", why should you care? Well, first of all, you are downloading an app with great ease of use, etc. You are supporting better future versions. You are supporting my future projects (Can't say too much, but I am working on a solution for Alzheimer's caregivers and another bitcoin project). And you are getting a great app that will only get better as time goes on.
@_date: 2015-05-19 11:53:40
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:11:45
How would you respond to this sentiment I hear often?
The US dollar works just fine for me. Why should I use BTC? What does it have for me, an everyday person who just wants to buy my morning coffee? As a non-libertarian/anarchist/person who needs anonymity, what is in it for me? Why should I care, when from my perspective, the current system in which I hand over paper to by my morning coffee works just fine?
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:41:27
There is a bitcoin address in the app - for now sitting empty, but I am hopeful people will send bitcoin :D! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:04:09
Uhh... Have we forgotten the Bitcoin foundation? They seem to be a pretty important group! Thanks, and all this will go towards my bitcoin app that is in development.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:34:52
Just a hobby... But it is fun! Thanks for the urls - I'll keep you posted on CryptoCalc.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:21:51
Not quite yet. Turns out "swift developer" is not the ladies magnet I thought it would be : D !
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:17:48

So cool - another 14 year old developer!!! I really started serious programming 2 years ago, with Python. This summer, I taught myself swift (BEST. LANGUAGE. EVER). This app is native swift. What are the names of some of your apps? I want to check them out 
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:28:01
Great response - optimistic, but reasonable and attainable. Thanks. And there is nothing wrong with moons! :D
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:06:13
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:35:38
Yeah, was not trying to be cliche - thought it would be a fun, useful first coding project. As for open sourcing - I like it!
@_date: 2015-05-19 11:53:26
I started with scratch (look it up), then moved to Python, and then Swift. I find that I learn better through actual development, compared to reading books.

@_date: 2015-01-03 20:13:42
And where do you see Bitcoin being in 10 years? The currency of the world, bye bye fiat? Or used in tandem with the dollar? Possibly as the "back end" money transfer system of many banks? As an investment, as a store of wealth? Basically - Where do you want BTC to go?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:05:25
Yay! Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:41:48
Thanks so much.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:27:35
iOS would let you do that... And that is a good idea for version 2
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:51:27
It's pretty fun and easy to pick up... Give it a try! Also, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:52:38

@_date: 2015-01-17 02:42:23

You did one of my translations, right? Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-03-02 12:54:10
The issue I see is that it punishes small miners. Many people get into bitcoin through mining - and why would you start mining if you had to send bitcoins you didn't have somewhere?
@_date: 2015-03-03 12:57:36
Why not XBT? ISO rules state that international currencies should start with X..
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:41:04
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:54:50
My guess would be that they don't have to buy any - the flow in (through people depositing bitcoin/selling bitcoin) probably is equal, on average, to the amount going out (people buying bitcoins)
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:34:35
Yep, as long as the app only knows the public key! You could give everyone in the world a public key, and no one would be able to spend it, as the private key is needed to spend.
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:33:56
Appreciate it! This will all go towards future development.
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:26:37
So it is like reddit karma, but in real life?
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:51:35
Other than being decentralized, is there any advantage to such a system?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:52:35
Thanks for doing this! They all look like worthy charities.
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:55:58
I use breadwallet.... The private key is stored on the device, so it is not cloud based.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:58:42
Oh no, realized that my comment accidentally got posted twice, and you tipped both. Have one of the tips back - spread the bitcoin to others. 100 bits
