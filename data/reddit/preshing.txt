That's true. But I didn't claim those three properties make bitcoins valuable. I claimed that they make bitcoins effective at distributing wealth. Clearly, if bitcoins did not have all three properties, they would not be effective at that.
At the end of the day, what makes bitcoins (or anything else) valuable is that other people want them. When Satoshi mined the first bitcoins, they had the same three properties, but nobody wanted them. So, in the beginning, they were perfectly worthless. Today, things are different.

m฿ doesn't look so bad to me.
μ฿ is pretty strange though.

That's supposed to be true in theory, but it doesn't appear true in the current reality...
Right now the [network hashrate]( is 13 million GH/s and doubling every month. By next summer it will be 832 million GH/s. Let's say Ghash.io's hash rate is X, and that somehow, a million individuals start mining at 10 GH/s each as a result of your campaign. How much of a dent does that put in Ghash.io's power by next summer?
(X / 832) / (X / 842)
About 1%.

Not too convinced by "alienating outsiders"... In my experience, people competent enough to handle money can handle fractions. I think people are just averse to buying anything that went up 10x in value in six months.

You are so right. Fixed now.

Is it really individuals contributing to that growth at this point, or is it big enterprises with giant datacenters?
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:41:01
Thanks. If you spot any other flaws, please let me know and I'll try to correct them.

Pretty funny, but Mark Karpeles was not involved with Mt. Gox back in those days. That must have been Jed McCaleb.

What mining hardware do you use?

Perhaps for some, the sentiment is that they just won't convert them back to cash.

He's simply not incentivized to get his facts straight. Being wrong costs him nothing.

So for you, it's totally cool to observe that women aren't interested in IT, but it's not cool to observe they aren't interested in Bitcoin?

With respect (I didn't downvote you), not sure if you're kidding yourself or if you just haven't looked at the math. Individuals have already lost against mining datacenters, I think. The best we can do is hope for either (a) enough independent datacenters such that no single one takes control (b) somebody starts giving away free terahash ASICs to individual users (c) some kind of solution within the Bitcoin protocol itself. I make this point because I'm interested in a solution as you, but it has to be a real one.

I paid in Bitcoin at a restaurant ("Montreal Poutine") earlier this year. The transaction was received in seconds, then I left.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:47:08
I can't agree that the statement is false. Only one person can spend the bitcoins. That's ownership, aka. possession.
That's part of the fun of Bitcoin. It challenges our assumptions of what it means to "own" something.

As a programmer, when I first learned that Bitcoin was a "distributed public ledger", that wasn't enough to give me confidence that it was secure enough to pay money for them. Right away, I knew there are a lot of weak ways to implement such a ledger. I had to understand the Bitcoin breakthrough, and learn more about the implementation, to gain that confidence.

We were discussing whether individual miners can collectively prevent a 51% attack from cex.io, not whether they can profit.
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:07:41
You're right. I realized this mistake some months ago, but didn't bother fixing it because the article wasn't popular. I did a quick edit to fix it just now; will do another pass over the weekend to make it better.
I think at the time I wrote this, I confused full nodes with light nodes. (Don't remember the link I got the data from.)

Also not gonna happen because nobody in the world is going to Bitcoin-tip a Youtube video! It's a completely unrealistic idea. I can't believe the OP wrote "huge impact". He/she is dreaming.

Don't worry. The private keys I "concealed" were all fake. :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:59:21
You are correct. According to [Blockchain.info]( there have been 420125 bitcoins mined in the last 90 days. That's one block every 7.712 minutes. That's because by the end of one difficulty period, the [network hash rate]( tends to be about double what it was at the beginning of the previous difficulty period.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:45:42
I have no idea what that means but I love it.
