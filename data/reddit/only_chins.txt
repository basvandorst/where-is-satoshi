Any idea when we will see a tor browser version?

I AM UNDERGOING EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUE RIGHT NOW WITH THEM.
I ordered 3 items as Christmas gifts, they only delivered one.
Here is the other two that have not arrived yet:
 --&gt; whiskey.
 --&gt; iPad Air.
It would be great if someone, anyone, would just recognise that these invoices exist - I feel like I am going mad by repeating myself all the time and getting no acknowledgment!!
The main problem lies in that there were two invoices for the iPad, the second one here  has expired, but they are choosing to focus on this one rather than the others which have been paid for.
I have Bitpay telling me on an email thread that the fault lies most likely with all4btc.com, and I have a reply from all4btc's manager saying he does not understand, is on holiday in Vietnam, will defer to Bitpay rather than '*potential customers*' and that I should defer to an employee to resolve the matter. I would be a lot more understanding about their situation if I had just been given an apology from the start.
FWIW, I am a returning customer and have been satisfied with their service on other occasions, but when it goes wrong like in this case, it clearly shows what truly *awful* customer service they are capable of. All I want is my money back or the products I ordered. Right now, I cant really forget the disappointment of my family members who did not receive their Christmas gifts.
**TL;DR:** OP, sorry for hijacking the thread a little, its more than relevant to your issue :)
