He lives in a country for a year and thinks he understands the market? Yeah right. I am Filipino living in the Philippines for over 4 decades and am a socially active individual and has extensive knowledge of what's going on in the economy and in society. 
We have a LOT of these guys who come here (I don't want to sound discriminatory, but it is a reality we all know and live with), see cheap labor and great beaches and women who will throw themselves at their feet, and pose themselves as saviors of the poor or the economy or, in this case, using new buzzwords  like "the unbanked" or "underbanked". Filipinos are very jaded when it comes to these things. 
I've been watching Bitcoin closely and I can tell you outright, it is nowhere near the level of adoption in the west. Not even close. Not because we need more people like Ron Hose, whoever he is, but because Filipinos are technologically averse and, to be honest, too poor to even think about Bitcoin. More than half the 100 million population live on about $2.00 a DAY. 
I am not saying Bitcoin has no chance here, it does. But not the way these guys think it will. The "unbanked" here are also "un-smartphoned" and "un-interneted". No, just because you are selling P200 worth of Bitcoin, it doesn't mean people will buy and use it to buy shit online because that's a week's worth of rice for the whole family. 
Bitcoin's greatest contribution to the Philippine market and the world will be to give entrepreneurial Filipinos and the Overseas Filipino workers a more level playing field. These are the people who are working hard to uplift themselves from the pervasive poverty surrounding everything here, and there are millions of them. People who will actively seek it will benefit the most. "Unbanked"and "Underbanked" are meaningless words. 
There are about 12 million overseas Filipino workers. They contribute a huge part of the GDP of the country and are using Western union and the like to send money home, getting raped 7-18% depending on how small the amount they are sending home. The poorer you are, the more you pay. THAT'S where Bitcoin will play a big part. 
TL;DR: I am a Filipino, born and raised, and I think that article is bullshit and just promoting their own interests using meaningless buzzwords and was very uninformed.

Over 10 million Filipinos are working overseas, remitting more money ($20++ Billion annually) than any other country except india and china, and those countries have ten times more people. Our biggest export is labor. And, a lot of uneducated people from the provinces go to Manila to work as maids or other blue collar jobs that pay $1-$2 a day, and they send most of this money to their families in the province so they can survive. And western union takes 7-18%. 
There is no middle class here. If you make more than $500 A MONTH, you're probably in the upper 5% of the population. Minimum wage here is $250 a month, and most of the biggest employers make sure people never get regularized and remain contractual so they never have to be paid more than minimum. 
Internet penetration is a more than 10% though. Internet shops that charge .25 cents (P10) US per hour. You can buy prepaid data for your semi-smart phone with internet capability for P30 unlimited use for a week or so.

You're right about the ID's. Most people don't even have cars ,why would they have a drivers license. They never travel, why would they have a passport. 
But surprisingly, mobile phone penetration in the Philippines is 100%. There are more than 100 million sim cards in use in the Philippines right now as some people have more than one phone. Prepaid sim cards are the reason for this. Filipinos can "load" their sim cards for one week unlimited use using the same network for about P30 (.75 Cents US) and even do the same thing with data to use the internet. Phones are cheap too, with china just around the corner. 
Bitcoin is pretty much impractical, for now, for 90% of Filipinos. but 10% of Filipinos is still 10 million people! That's a lot of people who can be tapped into using bitcoin not for online shopping or as a store of value, but for other more practical uses like remittance.

People can't go to the bank and open one because most of them are too poor. That's the reality. Bank requirements are very restrictive. Multiple official government ID's are required, good luck if you don't have a passport or drivers license. To put it into perspective, more than 50 million Filipinos live on $2 a day. 
The numbers are actually a lot worse than that. These "bank accounts" take into consideration payroll accounts and the like. Actual deposit/savings accounts are far far lower in number. I am from the Philippines, born and raised, and know first hand the situation here. The people who wrote this article are obviously not from here and have barely scratched the surface of what they are talking about.

Damn right.

Pretty sure it is not a coincidence that the same company (used by 93% of Koreans) got a coveted online banking license that allows them to operate bamks without physical locations.
