what is bitwala?

Is it possible to generate a paper wallet without any computer program? So I don't need to trust any code that I can't read.
Edit.: Same question goes for wallet seeds. What is the easiest way to use your own entropy source without relying on computer code?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:05:28
wow thanks!

Nice! Did not know such service existed. That would have helped me some months ago when I had to make a payment to a company in another country for some items that I have purchased. In my country such payment is very expensive and burocratic as here we have very strict controls against capital flight.
Can I also use your app like a normal bitcoin wallet which I own the keys and does it benefit from segwit?

Dunno if it's ok but I have a question about the lightning network: When two or more parties open a payment channel, do they need to commit bitcoin to it and does it stay commited (unspendable for other purposes) until the channel is closed?

The “network cost” is not percent based.

I bought one of [this](
I know it is not profitable. I just wanted to get involved on btc the most I can. I barely know what I am doing but I managed to follow the tutoriais and mine 1000 satoshis :P

Bitcoin threatens the classical banking system and it is called a fraud by them. Bcash threatens bitcoin and it is called a fraud by bitcoin supporters. I see a little Jamie Dimon inside of you.
I am not bcash supporter btw.

What do you mean by switching? You can already use whatever unit you want.

Can anyone post a noob friendly tutorial on how to mine with CPU/GPU?
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:41:51
But I guess they all already have distributed networks, no?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:54:02
Thanks, I now get it... but does it really increasing the block size to 2x increase resource usage that much? Any estimation on what would be the minimum hardware requirements?
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:14:55
Funny to see him saying that bcash is third largest crypto by market cap while its now fourth and dropping.

Can someone explain how a private blockchain would work? Wouldn’t it be simply a distribited database?

What is the xapo volume/influence on the market? I have no idea.

What was the poll result?
270 is expected for a fb group and is a good enough sample for the 21k population, it is statistics... Are you aware of how many people are interviewed in a presidential poll? It's certainly less than 0,01% of the population and with that the results can be accerted within a well desirable certainty.
Of course their opinion will not represent 100% of the population but I would assume that over 90% agreement can be considered a wide concensus.

No one is taking away people's freedom of choice lol

Average computer user here. Can someone ELI5 why the software is so resource intensive? In my mind it is only keeping track and verifying blocks of information with the size of 1MB maximum, and the rest of the blocks are just using storage space...
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:31:09
Where do you see they presuming to represent many? They clearly state who are the signatories to this statement. The interpretation of "how many they represent" is up to the reader.

Already installed and made a test run and it's ok.
Will start 24/7 running only when the fork nears. That is not a problem right?

Bitcoin is a failure, people can’t divide.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:35:33
If it ever hit those prices you will be probably transacting with bitcoin only and “cashing out” bitcoin won’t be a thing
