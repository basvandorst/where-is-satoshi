@_date: 2017-08-29 14:58:23
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:01:47
Anyone know any realworld reason why this is happening? Lost a lot of confidence reading info in this sub lately about the internal issues...more than when reading r/btc
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:14:12
the  EU did this ages  ago...which drove up the price 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:46:40
isn't your name about another subreddit?
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:50:29
not my video....but their is correlation in most cases
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:48:20
dont give into trolls chill man....try this chill music place 
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:08:28
na look at the underlined one
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:59:26
when youve been wanting to go in at 2400 but r/investing told you to never get into this
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:47:40
Hey you must be born in 1989
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:20:27

@_date: 2017-08-28 05:11:05
Anyone have any idea of How much market cap could vietnam potentially contribute?
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:05:30
That one is different
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:37:10
sorry cant find it rn but i am 100% sure they bought in the thousands
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:45:38
yep...pretty hypocritical gotta agree
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:51:42
Thanks a lot man :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:51:37
you will be downvoted..that is a fact whether you post it here or at r/btc....but this is as real as it gets.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:17:19
Pretty good ..but where do you source this information?also the permissions required seems excessive
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:06:23
Pretty much...they single handedly effected dash and ripple over the last week
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:01:13
This or bubble bursting ..
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:36:35
Did you post it on r/gifs yet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:19:53
This entire music scene is filled with meme potential..its halarious
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:47:02
But wat most dont understand is that this rally is heavily credited to the upcoming fork more than anything else...the new derivative market helped tho
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:38:04
its accurate except for "Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent " thats not true for smaller $(&lt;10K). Something like Stellar Lumen or Litecoin would be considered cheap for smaller $(few cents at max compared to &gt;$25 with bitcoin when congested) and speedwise much faster for transactions.

'some trolls on reddit' HEY THATS US
This was really well written though
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:13:41
And its pumping...guess its working out well for him. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:14:06
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:25:33
Its fine
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:51:18
I did not know that...thanks for the info. But answer the request. Explain why you think this
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:16:34
i only find worth going to for actual news
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:00:25
Better to send new ppl to the second sub...the people there are more informative
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:58:41
its all right man...sometimes the extra sleep is healthy :)
Editt: Its approaching 4am here...who am I kidding :(
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:18:43
reddit isn't really anonymous but eh
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:43:50
I agree that this article ia odd but i do think that in some countries that want more control they would pay news orgs to tell ppl the 'dangers' of btc
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:01:50
why not just use those exchanges with zero fees?
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:53:46
mb foreign exchanges..but Korean bithump has the largest marketcap on bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:57:14
I think r/btc has a tipping bot. You can post it there too
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:42:56
So....i will assume you are. I know what you mean by monitor. Maybe you can make a tieba post about how to move bitcoin to a wallet like Jaxx? Or..whatever is the most popular btc hangout
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:53:46
mb foreign exchanges..but Korean bithump has the largest marketcap on bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:27:54
supposedly 4K was a good margin, dont know now but id guess its still reasonable
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:24:24
And there will be a sprinkle in the middle for those smart enough to dodge drop 1 and 2
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:51:15
And r/cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:30:17
All right cheers
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:16:21
Stop jumping shit just because hes the one getting screwed over and not you. We means everyone in crypto...if people see news articles of this guys huge ibvestment he made for crypto and all the failure it brought now because of the ban...less people will want to get into it fearing their own gov may do this.
Bad news is always bad news...unless you want to buy
Edit: this sounded aggressive..wasnt at attack btw
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:18:00
um there are so many of them. The japanese ones are really really popular. You can see the largest ones on coinmarketcap under (zero-fees)
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:26:09
i like your point but the key difference is that illegals are hard for everyone and quite mainstream whereas something that hasnt really reached mainstream or easy for people in other countries will just push them away....
Anyway what purpose will bitcoin really give china? They already do most economical things via alipay which is pretty integrated in their country. Much better than anything we have of comparison like paypal. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:23:08
Do you happen to be from China? If so what do other chinese people that in crypto feel now? I see you seem to like btc but would you be able to give the real truth?
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:21:44
That is probably correct :)
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:28:00
expect the best from others on the internet...except when browsing 4chan
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:20:51
Yeah technical discussion tend to fit that sub better than this one...
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:41:11
Bless whoever passed the bill...anyone know who formed it ? Gotta find my candidate to vote
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:59:27
I like your thinking but this is a speculative market where your investing something in....if google was to stop being available tommorow i wouldnt personally make a loss. Id just switch browser
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:55:26
i feel like the btc and crypto community as a whole has this opportunity to actually make it moon
what is working for us?
1, This report
2. Support from certain mainstream media like CNBC(oddly mb), our own news orgs like cointelegram and bitcoinnews(pls turn off adblock on these...we need them as much as they need us)
3, Geopolitcal tension creating FUD(would suck too but something good about it)
4, Possibility of China regulation being successful which would get the msg out to the ppl there to get on board
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:11:19
Korea already have btc investors who do this for their clients..
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:12:01
But they should create a seperate currency to btc though....or just a less crowded one.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:54:46
If you want someone to hold onto them :) "If you need...if you need"
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:15:51
Lol thanks a lot for your input man much appreciated. Hope you are on r/cryptocurrency too. A lot of insightful people there too. Could always use more insight. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:57:06
there is a meme outside the bitcoin community that every bad situation is considered 'a good thing for bitcoin'...but the reality is like what you said its bad news....Western news sources are blindly credited JPMorgan saying he caused this...he did very little to sway my thought but when an exchange closes it makes sense 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:28:59
Yeah definitely allows freedom to think for urself...to be individual..decentralised /s
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:56:16
They announced this a while ago.they are supporting btc and eth under the app right now
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:13:20
Its a slow starter sub but eh some hit some miss i guess
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:26:09

@_date: 2017-09-16 13:22:46
So how could i get into private stocks? Say a research firm
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:18:00
um there are so many of them. The japanese ones are really really popular. You can see the largest ones on coinmarketcap under (zero-fees)
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:50:12
For a speculation market youre kinda right...wish there were big whales here though to listen..
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:19:26
Thats amazing...a lot of ppl dont just struggle to understand what it is..but like me, struggle to understand how to get thru the minor hurdles to legally get into it, what you should be aware of etc.
Could you post this as a post in this sub and at r/btc?
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:10:49
I mean most coins have an intrinsic purpose they are trying to be. WTC for RFID. Neo for chinese based Ethereum with significant customisation. Xmr for actual security and privacy. Factom for business and housing(already in use in china). Firstblood for esports...etc. Just because they arent bitcoin does not make them intrinsicly bad. What does is having coins that are just there for competition than innovation. Eg. Bch 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:51:22
I like your hopeful logic but its incorrect imo. If the worlds largest rising crypto market for the nearest future can't access the market..then the demand for said crypto will diminish.

What is your bitcoin address? Kind redditors will chip in some support
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:50:18

@_date: 2017-10-02 23:50:47
not to a paper...probably a wallet though
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:47:30
Huh i used to dislike the mods..but now i approve. 
Dude your spilling hate without any grounding. Atleast edit your post to reflect an argument as to why other than 'their government is bad' and them being out is good...tell us why you think that atleast.
Chinese people come to this sub speaking a foreign language to look for answers..not threats
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:59:15
You can use ARK crypto's smartbridge to bridge between different ALTS with bitcoin so yeah y not
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:08:25
I said to a friend...three days later hes discussing it with a friend talking about its potential and getting in
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:43:45
No i mean as an investor..cant anyone get into it like btc?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:04:30
dude...just an FYI this recent ban has more to with the recent stealing of people's money by a chinese exchange and Chinese ICO's which triggered all of this to happen than just a pump and dump game
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:53:42
Looks at korea..
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:52:57
Oh my bad cheers for that

@_date: 2017-09-15 14:01:50
why not just use those exchanges with zero fees?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:18:43
reddit isn't really anonymous but eh
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:18:24
How would you answer that statement? I had someone ask that
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:17:44
Yes...i though..woah is that him?
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:55:33
Who cares its moniess
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:35:12
But it would be even be worth the costs at that point? Wouldnt it be more profitable to go for Waltonchain, VTC or LTC
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:21:21
It is slow...something likeLTC is used for transactiona
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:08:52
All my alts :( i lost more than i gained
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:43:34
Put up a post on tieba or something where people on reddit here can help them through...prefer something we dont need to create an account
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:19:47
You should check out google trends and the massive rise in interest of bitcoin from south africa
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:10:09
I think thats kinda looking at it pessimistic...but these are just opinions dont go to his twitter and leave hate comments..its his opinion just like the rest of us

Japan will steal koreas momentum in my opinion. Since you are here, how widespread is bitcoin in korea?
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:13:07
Man it doesnt matter just post it tgere..this is really valuable info that could help someone and yes you can definitely post self authored things
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:23:39
Ive never use electron wallet but perhaps if u really need try a different wallet? Else just reinstall the wallet could just be a bug

No they are completely different. Their purpose is diferent and supported by different people. Afaik segwit2x was proposed a lot earlier and planned for unlike bgold

i browse both subs and they both simultaneously fill with hate comments and advice too
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:17:00
You should post this when the americans wake up..this is front page worthy.
Also add your dads public key, so that people who wish to donate such as myself can.

A bank in th EU did this at the startof the year and pumped the price up so much
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:37:45
Dont argue with people that only have think about their vested interests...everyone here will just tell u to get on btc and nothing else because thats wat they are doing. Do what you want and dont bother trying to reason, its just a waste of your time
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:56:20
I cant find the source but there was some bank in eu ...i wonder if it was the reserve that bought a lot in plan to sell it to hackers who hack their data or something along that
