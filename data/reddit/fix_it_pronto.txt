You're right "coinbase" will probably never add any other option besides bitcoin. The new fiat wallet doesn't even exist to me and you. Let's cover our eyes together!  I'm sure they love passing up all the money the other exchanges make from fees on shitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:08:55
I know it's hilarious losing money on something you want to believe in  isn't it? LOL hilarious. LOLWAT? Right? 
No I chose to use bitcoin because it was most used and widely accepted.  And to test the water out. No other reasons. I don't think those other coins are superior. I'm not even sure what to make of them. I was just suggesting they might add them and you took offense to the idea.
I don't really care if any coin goes to the moon because I don't have a huge stake in digital currency. If the prices stabilized maybe appreciating in value over time i might use digital currency for banking and holding. (store of value) but right now all of them are too risky to do so. 
So i mainly buy bitcoin to use and get rid of like a money order. Pretty much done testing the water out for storing value in any coin long term for awhile. I only hold the bitcoin I lost money on purchasing hoping to get what I paid for it back when I buy a something off of Dell, Newegg or Microsoft. So in a sense I'm a long term holder of bitcoin.

What if they add another foreign currency you can convert to besides USD from bitcoin? What if they allow me to convert my bitcoin to Yen? Will this upset you to? 
I hope you do comeback to upvote me when they do add more conversion options.
And like i said before I only use bitcoin right now and still hold some bitcoin but not for waiting to get rich quick reasons. I hold it mainly to use it. I'm really not heavily invested in any outcome like you probably are, but continue deflecting. Personally i don't get the alt coin stuff nor do i want to be bothered downloading additional software wallets or use coins that serve no purpose. Most look scammy to me. But I can see the other exchanges making money. So naturally i think coinbase wants to too.
I would short em all with USD if given the option. :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:44:28
Yes, i think they will keep the brokerage services for places they can't operate an exchange yet. 
I'm hoping they charge lower fees for the exchange itself. No huge fees to move in and out of bitcoin would be awesome.
But of course it's all speculation at this point. Maybe there won't be any new features and just a re-branding of services they already offer. Who knows.
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:58:37
True bottom won't happen until all the get rich investors bail. All they do is eat up the little guy trying to send a few dollars to his poor family. 
If the price rises a few hundred you will sell while little guy who just bought to send is left even broker than before. 
Which hurts bitcoin in the long run because users who actually use it for what it is intended don't want to suffer. They rather spend it on small fees instead of losing a huge chunk of their money in a normal transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:04:14
You make a solid point. Why would the rocket go to the moon where a bitcoin flag is already planted if not to add another coin flag?
From a competition standpoint, It makes sense for them to add litecoin and dogecoin since other exchanges offer them. Of course this is not what most in the bitcoin community want to hear right now., but I think if this is what this is all about it wont impede the success of bitcoin. Anything that connects to bitcoin can only help it.

Why stop at USD? I think they plan to add more currency options that is all. Maybe it's not for some other coin right now, but what if it is for another foreign currency? Currency markets rake in huge sums of money.

This means they will no longer be brokers.  I wonder what kind of exchange it will be.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:46:24
For what it's worth I hope bitcoin goes to moon (wherever that may be) and stays there without anymore crashes or huge price swings so it can finally function as a currency. 
The Newegg deals and overtock acceptance and the possibility of Amazon are what kept me intrigued. I was hoping for Amazon being added the most though, but gift cards. Microsoft and Dell are good enough right now I guess.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:22:53
Great deflationary currency to buy and hold! LOL at everyone who bought at $300 and had to wait days  to use only to only find out they lost a shit ton of purchasing power! 
I'm sure the new users of this great technology will use again!  I know! maybe we need more exchanges so whales can dump and dump some more then rebuy and screw over the little guy!

Sorry for the confusion about bits. Some genius came up with that idea. They thought the zeros after the decimal place was too confusing for noobs. I guess they were wrong.

Just make sure to come back and upvote when they add another currency to convert to whether it be Yen or another digital currency.
It might not happen monday but I have feeling they will allow people to convert to any currency and hold it. I think they will eventually morph into a etrade/banking style type site of all the currencies of the world.

Not apart of the litecoin or dogecoin community, but continue deflecting. I joined this sub because I use bitcoin and like to keep on top of the news that might affect what little I do have in bitcoin when planning to buy or use  bitcoin. 
The price crash caused by speculators and people trying to get rich off of it like yourself hurt the amount I did have in bitcoin at the time.  You know buying it for a certain price then waiting to use it and the price crashes before your very eyes really makes you look at it differently. I hope the price goes back to where it was so I can finally purchase the stuff I wanted off of newegg and not lose a whole lot of money. 
Just glad I didn't buy more at the time when huge dumpers were selling their get rich stake in bitcoin like some who are blinded. So continue your pump.
If you read my first post I was very pissed off at the price crashing. Now you know why.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:39:21
Sorry to disappoint you, but I only hold bitcoin long term.
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:10:08
I disagree. I think coinbase is moving towards trading and banking. They see all the money bitfinex, okcoin, btc-e and the rest are making.
I have a feeling they want to be it all. 
exchange + banking + merchant processor. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:58:53
Have you not been paying attention to the other exchanges and the features they have been adding? Okcoin and others make a shit load on btc to usd to ltc. I think coinbase wants to be more than just a seller of bitcoin. They probably want futures trading hence the USD wallet.  More options = More revenue. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:57:49
Their site seems to go offline a lot during high volatility. Look at their support

Lot's of people claiming they couldn't sell and missed a opportunity to buy on last drop. I would hate to be holding on that site.

I never heard anyone advocating for a reckless or rushed different hard fork to be implemented every week for bitcoin which seems to be the case with ETH. 
The bitcoin big blockers have been asking for the same hashed out, long discussed and easy to implement hard fork for OVER **2 years**. Not exactly a reckless hard fork is it?
So i guess this means bitcoin will never have a hard fork in its lifetime? Because every hard fork is reckless?
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:25:08
The main reason they want to regulate bitcoin services is not because of bitcoin itself. It's because of fiat money going in and out. They don't care about the I.O.U. or money order part.
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:21:23
because they like making money. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:19:01
Sigh, sorry wrong again, but it looks like most of the top exchanges are complying according to a thread on the FRONT PAGE of r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:18:01
Of course its not for everyone. You can't just advertise your mom and pop store on a billboard in New York's Times Square for free. It costs millions of dollars a year.
It's not that expensive for a company that wants to do business in one of the most populated places in the world and by far the most connected. It's more for the big players.
It's the cost of doing business.

No it wont. The ones that comply will make more money than the ones that don't.  There will always be ones that comply assuming their is demand for bitcoin in NY. Which there is.
Imagine a major credit card company just saying forget one of the most financial oriented populated areas in the world.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:45:50
 Well judging by all the negative bad fork censor bitcoin news in this sub  and current price trend that is reflecting uncertainty. Id say the safest option is using one of the popular bitcoin payment processors and converting directly to fiat and then converting it back only if you need it.  
But that is just my unpopular opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:02:14
Not really, It's meant and structured to protect NY citizens from unprofessional Magic The Gathering type exchanges from what I have read. 
I don't think it goes too far for any financial institution or service that holds vast sums of money for people. I bet local banks have much stricter regulations and higher fees to entry.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:55:25
i might buy back in when it bottoms which might be months away depending if and when any good news about bitcoin happens which there is none right now. i don't see the price hitting 300 again for a long time anyway.  Id rather lose 20 on each coin instead of 50 or more.
waiting till fork at least.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:04:15
Because history tells us that no regulation and deregulation when it comes to banking is a bad idea.

Hmmm had no idea they only dealt manly with EUR. I'm not familiar with the site. So i guess it wouldn't matter if they complied or not since its manly a regional company.
And NY is not a small market.

I don't think the Spammer is losing that much money if his transactions never get confirmed and dropped from network. He just rebroadcasts the same transaction with low fee in a endless loop and money is returned in a few days. rinse repeat. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:08:23
My main point was about the cost of doing business in some places and the cost of doing business when you run a financial service that is open to the public. It's not about the regulations. The regulations come with the territory when you want to run a financial service that handles millions of dollars and users. That shouldn't even be up for debate.
Exchanges shouldn't be considered small start up companies or run like it. They should be considered and treated the same as major brick and mortar banks holding customer funds. And I'm pretty sure those banks have to comply with similar regulations, probably even a longer list of ones.
Not draconian in the least.
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:39:26
You're right I shouldn't have used such a low number to prove a point. But,  most of these users you speak of are just using it at approved libraries and schools I highly doubt they are browsing r/bitcoin. The other users in cuba are not citizens, they are mostly tourists on vacation staying at pricey hotels looking for directions and places to eat.  
I don't even think home internet connections are a thing yet in cuba. The majority of people that live in cuba don't have easy access to the internet. You think they are running bitcoin nodes from a cafe or library?
Bitcoin is not going to take off anytime soon in cuba. Not unless internet is widely available and people can afford it.
from wiki
The Internet in Cuba is among the most tightly controlled in the world. It is characterized by a low number of connections, limited bandwidth, censorship, and high cost.
The cost of Internet access is $4.50 per hour (or CUC$0.60 for domestic intranet access and CUC$1.50 for email), which is still high in a country where state salaries average $20 a month.
my point still stands.
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:52:21
Yes, from what I have learned today you have to wait until your unconfirmed transaction disappears from the network. Which can take a few days. Check blockchain.info to make sure its gone. Make sure you don't open your wallet while connected otherwise it will resend the same transaction and you will have to wait again. Once it disappears from network rescan blockchain offline so the unconfirmed transactions don't show up in your wallet. Then resend with higher fee. 
I'm still looking for better solutions I'm SOL with my mobile wallet. I'm going to have to import.
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:35:53
stomp your feet all you want but the ones that comply will still make more money and expand faster than the ones that don't. You can't ignore a economic hub like new york and expect to grow faster than the ones that do comply.

Yes they do. 
Click the last page, pick any transaction and wait a few hours then refresh page POOF gone. 
Unconfirmed transactions don't stay in mempool forever on average a few days. They only reappear if the transaction gets rebroadcast.

They will be dropped after a few days if not confirmed. Your wallet will rebroadcast the same transaction unless you resend with a higher fee or double spend (which there are guides on doing this but takes awhile figuring out).  
So you're SOL unless 
* spammer stops spamming
* you get lucky and miners accept it. 
* Bitcoin devs implement a fix to prevent this massive spam back log problem.
* you wait and resend with higher fee hoping the fee is high enough that go around.

Sorry but every business has to respect individual state laws or country laws and or pay fees and taxes to do business within those territories.  It's the nature of the game. AND this why lobbyists exist.
Look at the major tech companies like Google and Microsoft and all the legal hoops they have to jump through within other countries.

I don't even think cuba has more than a couple internet users at any given time if that. Only the privileged have it and can only use certain things.
I watched a documentary recently that said their internet is expensive and slow as shit. 99 percent of the public don't have internet or a computer. They have basic phones not smart phones that have to use the only mobile phone company that exists in cuba.
Let me repeat that ONLY one phone company exists in cuba which is government controlled.
