Depends on the country.

It was the only thing with numbers I could find :p
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:11:11
I'll probaly put it somewhere in the streets.

I think he means less than 1% of the population of developed countries have Bitcoin.

I just ate my first pizza payed with bitcoin. Pizza never tasted this good.

Yeah, its even quicker than Ideal. No fuzzing around with TAN codes or authenticators. Just send your btc to the given address and the payment is done. And 1 euro cheaper aswell!
