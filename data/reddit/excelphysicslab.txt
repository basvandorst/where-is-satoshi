Did I just read: "Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin exchange"? God these guys didn't do their homework.
PayPal, a leading forex. &lt;- sounds dumb doesn't it?

Our Kickstarter's doing fine, I was just surprised at the lack of response from the Bitcoin community.

If by "private solutions" you mean companies like PayPal. Please read:

Square Cash solves two of those three issues.

No, because it's not integrated with Kickstarter's pledge system since Kickstarter does not officially support Bitcoin. I will, however, be posting updates to the total amount pledge via Bitcoin on the front page.

We choose to enable Bitcoin pledges because we wanted to support Bitcoin. Our Kickstarter is already 300% over our goal but we wanted to add Bitcoin support so that social media and normal Kickstarter backers can grow accustomed to seeing Bitcoins on Kickstarter.
We obtained permission from Kickstarter HQ to add Bitcoin pledges for our campaign. It wasn't a walk in the park but we thought fellow BTCers would appreciate the effort.

Thanks for your support!

Pulled out of Gox and into an anonymously operated exchange. Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Smart.

We were able to accept bitcoin as a funding source by setting up BitPay with our Shopify store so bitcoin users can back our Kickstarter.

People rant on about how no chargebacks are a feature when in fact it's a liability. It tilts the advantages so heavily towards the seller that buyers are facing disproportionate risks when making a purchase.
The only solution? Regulation. But wait, BTC hates regulation! Well, the only way to ever provide consumer protection is through regulated 3rd parties that moderate all transactions.
The problem? Due to the inherent one directional nature of BTC transactions, 3rd parties face higher risks than Visa/Mastercard where the latter can pressure merchants and bank accounts for chargebacks. You can't pressure a wallet to spit money back. This results in higher transaction fees by BTC 3rd parties to cover the higher risk. Thus eliminating all advantages to BTC in the first place.

I think it got moved during the last edit. It's fixed now.

As you've pointed out, we're 3X over our goal. I'm not doing this for money, I'm trying to encourage the adoption of bitcoin on Kickstarter. I wanted to establish better credibility for bitcoin by showing creators that a successful Kickstarter project is supporting it. I've also broken barriers to entry by showing that Kickstarter allows projects to accept bitcoin. Is that reason enough for you to care? Because I care about bitcoin, otherwise I wouldn't have 10 BTC in cold storage.

This place looks amazing!

They allowed it under the condition that I don't embed the bitcoin logo on the project. My plan was that once other project creators saw the benefit of accepting bitcoin, they too would accept it for their projects.

I really need to point out to people that PayPal IS regulated. You guys don't really think a company that deals with that much money and has a huge potential to support money laundering goes unregulated right?

In 4 years you're going to wish you put two dollars of bitcoin and a picture of a dollar bill in that envelope.

Are you implying escrow isn't regulated?
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:34:36
It's on the top of the page "We Are Now Accepting Bitcoin! Pledge Here!"
Kickstarter HQ forbid us to add a bitcoin logo, if you have ideas to make it more visible let me know.

Do you remember this one website called Myspace and its first mover advantage? What ever happened to that site? Oh right, Facebook.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:23:26
No one's making a prophetic prediction, just saying that first mover advantages isn't as significant as people make it seem and that there are also first mover disadvantages.

But what about all the "dead" bitcoins held by Satoshi? That's 10% of all bitcoins that will likely never be in circulation.

In my world Engineered solutions must actually be developed by someone with the title.

I think you haven't grasped the size of JP Morgan. It's litigation fund is 23 billion dollars. Aka we can cash out the entire market cap of cryptocurrencies and JP Morgan's litigation fund alone is large enough to sue us three times over.

Sorry, but you're not important enough to tackle Chase. Even the Feds aren't powerful enough to go after them.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:02:11
I'm just saying everyone using cryptocurrencies could leave Chase and they won't give a damn.
