I feel that the off chain transaction fees will be relatively low, but moving to on chain will be the same thus negating the whole addition of LN altogether

A project that I'm interested in has their token built on the ethereum blockchain. This same question was brought up about why use your own token instead of eth and the answer was very solid. Say one day ethereum blockchain fails or there is another blockchain with better features / security, instead of having to rebuild their platform to used a new blockchain tokens, they simply update their framework and that's it, does not effect current holders tokens, no swaps or hard forks etc. They call it blockchain agnostic.

Unfortunately you are looking at bitcoin through investors eyes and lose sight of what it's actually accomplishing. Regardless of what the price is or what you think it's worth, there will be alot of counties in the future that will move to bitcoin due it being better than their current national currency. This by itself will cause bitcoin to go up in value alone.

I agree with this. I think this will literally bring hundreds of billions of new money into the market very soon

As much as I would love to see Andreas on these panels, it will never happen. He is too vocal with his hate towards US government officials and would never be invited. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:19:31
I agree
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:56:02
He is not as rich as you think he is as he had spent all of his bitcoin up until a few months back when he was given a large donation amount of BTC, trying to live off of what he had advocating and speaking to public audiences. The man is as genuine as they come.

This is not an issue. That is like saying that child porn images that cross through an internet network would mean every service provider would be fined and held accountable for "allowing traffic" the data packets of the image to pass through their network. No one can view the image that is stored on the blockchain just as much as someone can view the image from data packets (outside of packet sniffing but thats another conversation)

I second third and fourth this

I think Andreas antonopoulos said something like this when asked about regulation and that the good would far outweigh the bad thus no regulation would be needed
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:15:22
This needs to go viral

But at what point should we be worried that it's reached the point of no return and won't recover? No FUD just being realistic 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:33:21
So the fact that article was from 2014 and hadn't happend since and Andreas saying "not a worry anymore" makes me feel like it is a non issue at this point

Question is.... Are we ready? Last time exchanges got fucked because of the new registrations and couldn't handle the volume. Bitcoin was super slow and high fees due to amount of transactions... Can we say for sure we are ready to open the flood gates?
