Perhaps you don't agree with segwit / LN, but this was meant to deal with scaling. So something was definitely done (agreed it took a long time).


You're making a logical leap. First of all, scaling had two schools of thought, and no consensus could be made. Is there a similar situation with regards to fungibility? If so, I wasn't aware and would like to hear more about it. If not, then the situations are not analogous. 
Secondly, who decides what is life and death exactly? I could make an argument that fungibility is necessary for the coin to succeed. Again, youre making a lot of assumptions -- it's not factual.

im unclear about your position from reading your comments on this thread, are you pro or anti larger blocks?
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:07:03
That would be more credible coming from someone on the inside. You're simply just making a guess -- we know that greg maxwell thinks fungibility is important, so it's probably a safer assumption that this has been discussed.

Lol at people who refer to themselves as "IT professionals"
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:58:55
why so aggressive?
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:12:32
yeah, i misunderstood earlier, thanks for the clarification
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:47:09
I mean that kind of shows that this issue trying to be solved for already is a major problem simply due to the fact that there are a ton of blocks. I'm not sure how much the 1mb increase would exacerbate the situation.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:06:28
youre not addressing my point though -- more nodes won't enter the space because they won't be able to mine profitably. Any node that can enter now and couldn't before due to the 1MB block size difference probably wont be able to invest enough in hashrate to make money from mining. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:18:45
What exactly is incentivizing miners to do this (im assuming that data doesn't pay out transaction fees..)? They could instead be including other transactions that actually do pay out some fee. 
Are they simply foregoing lower fees to try and get higher fees in the future?
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:39:27
dont really buy into this argument. i agree certain "enhancements" might not be worth it, but I would weight privacy / fungibility much more than just a nice to have / random feature. 
do you not think fungibility is important? why not? how do you think decisions should be made as to what's important and what is not? I imagine consensus must be reached to try and make a change -- has this been already discussed / voted upon with regards to fungibility / privacy? 
What characteristics of segwit made it necessary to update the protocol, and exactly why does it not apply to fungibility?
I'd like a more specific and detailed answer as to why this feature wasn't deemed important enough. Or perhaps technically infeasible. Generic arguments of "we can't just add every feature" are easy to make and don't answer the question.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:35:46
That's completely your opinion though, which is exactly why I think were seeing this differently, and also why I'm asking who makes the decisions about something being life or death. How does that decision get made, and why exactly did fungibility not make that cut? (I've asked this a few times now with no response, so it suggests that you're just making an assumption here.)
As to why I think fungibility is much more than a nice to have:
I think that the possibility that in the future some coins I own are deemed worthless because they were initially used in some criminal activity could destroy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:03:47
Thanks for the response and the link.


I did not realize this was the case -- I assumed segwit simply helped use more of the 1MB block for transactions. So with segwit now activated, block sizes are now also 2 MB? 
In response to your link, I understand the importance of needing more full nodes. However, I don't really agree that people aren't running a node due to block size. Given just how large the blockchain has gotten, it seems pretty difficult already to set up a full node, especially since there isn't a direct financial incentive to do so. 


To make sure I'm understanding this correctly, I'm assuming this means that most blocks are not filling up to the 1MB size anyways, so increasing to 2MB doesn't add much. If true, I think that's a fair point. Out of curiosity though, can you explain more about not wanting to support micro-transactions? I think there is merit to the argument that as more merchants accept bitcoin for payments, they will be incentivized to set up full nodes to ensure they are getting paid. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:25:48
I understand this generic argument. However, I'd be interested in a more technical justification as to why adding these specific features to the protocol itself would not be feasible.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:29:17
Who is adding these spam transactions? Why would they pay fees on it?
If the thought is that miners are including these fake transactions to themselves to garner support for 2x, it means that they are taking short term profit losses in the hope that 2x gets passed. Is there any evidence of this?
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:53:24
you're missing my point. I would like to know if this has been discussed and what exactly the disagreements were. 
You keep saying that people can't agree which is why it hasn't happened. Show me where they haven't agreed about this specific feature.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:22:35


Well I'm saying the number of blocks is already so large making it difficult to set up a full node anyways. I don't know that the increase from 1 =&gt; 2MB would really deter more people, I believe those people are already deterred (coupled with the fact that there's no direct financial incentive).
Thanks for the response, it has cleared some things up for me. One last question -- is it still true that most blocks are not full? If so, what exactly is driving up fee prices?
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:23:33


Yeah I've heard that used as the reason it would be centralizing. But that statement alone doesn't really convince me. I'm still failing to see how the 1 MB increase will cause that. Are there some back of the envelope calculations people are using to make this argument? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:26:56
I'd argue that fungibility is critical to the long term survival of the coin. Perhaps you don't agree. 
I can see merit to the argument that we can effectively achieve fungibility through second layer solutions, so it doesn't make sense to change the base protocol which would be riskier. 
However, if a lot of people don't use those second layer solutions (let's say I use a wallet that doesn't use privacy features), then it would defeat the purpose.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:09:10
ah got it, thanks for the clarification
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:50:53
the cost in bandwidth from 1MB to 2 MB seems negligible. 


I don't understand this argument. Are you suggesting that decreasing block size will allow for more miners to enter the space and as a result make it more decentralized? Hashrate still comes into play and those people that can now enter due to a decrease in block size probably wouldn't be able to mine profitably, suggesting that they will stop mining.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:06:39
I understand both sides of the debate on large vs small blocks. However, I don't know what the arguments against fungibility are -- can you share them?
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:15:46


Would it need to be a hard fork? Technically it would be more restrictive with what types of blocks are accepted, so it seems to me like it could be implemented as a soft fork. Maybe I'm missing something. 


Yes all transactions up to now would be of the legacy type, but at least we could enforce privacy from that point forward.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:25:03
If I'm not mistaken, that's exactly how soft-forks work:
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:59:24
Let's ignore what is foolish or not. If miners do what they are signaling, that chain will have the majority hash rate. Im interested in exploring exactly how that will play out.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:55:30


I think 1 could be true, I just don't see why we can't do both?


EDIT: OK i think you mean miners that are don't upgrade will be rejecting the new 2 MB blocks. Sure, but even with the lightning network I believe there is a lot of coordination that will need to happen as well.


Sure, I'm just not understanding why we are so against the increase now (along with adding segwit).


I'm pretty sure that's true today though isn't it?


Seems like a fork will be happening though anyways.


Be thankful to Satoshi Nakamoto for building a strong foundation and the others who pitched in! Let's innovate further!
Completely agreed. I hate the argument that segwit / lightning isn't part of satoshis original vision. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:11:04
Can you explain what spam is exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:31:32


I'm a bit unclear as to what you mean by impossible, can you explain?
Last time most exchanges said they'd support both or just btc. In this case we don't know exactly what an exchange like coinbase would do (given that they signed the nya)
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:11:37
If it gets majority hashrate (I agree this might not happen), and there is no replay protection, what exactly would happen to the coins that we currently have? 
I'm not interested in getting into a political argument here -- I understand the general negative sentiment against 2x in this sub (I don't support it either), I just want to understand what exactly will happen in a given scenario. Which coin would exchanges list as BTC? Is there a possibility that the 2x coin becomes btc in the event of majority hashrate moving to it?
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:06:12


There's a huge risk with this though, given lack of replay protection. I tend to think that segwit2x won't actually happen, but in the event that it does with majority hashpower, I think there are concerns that need to be thought through. I don't think the answer is as simple as that no exchange would dare to do that.

I live / work in silicon valley. All of my friends have heard about bitcoin, but only a few understand how it works and its actual value proposition.
I was introduced to bitcoin by a friend a few years ago, but only started seriously learning about it (and as a result investing in it) 3 months ago. 
I work at a large tech company in the bay area and there are crypto mailing lists which people are pretty active on, so there definitely is a non-trivial amount of interest / adoption (big name people in SV such as bill gates and chamath palihapitiya have been bitcoin proponents for a while now). The number of bitcoin hedge-funds and startups is increasing a lot this year as well. But I would say it's still in the early-ish adoption phase.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:10:28


Yeah that's a good point. Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:47:02
in a scenario where there is no replay protection and majority hashrate is mining segwit2x -- meaning that the segwit2x chain will be "longer" and thus the winner, what does that mean for our coins? are you saying wallets / exchanges will be ignoring the miners on segwit2x as well?
