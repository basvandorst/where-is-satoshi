I also believe this fire won't destroy it entirely (at least not this time), but it still doesn't make sense to just do nothing.
It is just like when our house is on fire, &amp; one of our roommates come to us &amp; say: "Sit back &amp; relax. Anyway it's only the kitchen &amp; the room downstairs which are affected, not our room."
That roommate feels this way because unconsciously the person mayn't take this house/Earth to be our home or taking others as our family.
If our home is on fire &amp; there is nothing we can do or something that is beyond us, then we should sit back &amp; enjoy the rare burning scene. However if there is something we can do, I don’t see why we shouldn't  take our actions. 
In fact beside financial aid there are other ways to help, like spreading this message to our friends &amp; family.  :)

The percentage that I heard was that it produces around 20% of total oxygen, could you show me the evidence of your claim. I'd like to learn more:)

I did learn a lot from all of you guys above. As the scholar in the article link above said: “Keeping the Amazon rainforest largely intact matters for carbon dioxide and climate reasons (as well as many other reasons), it does not matter for oxygen reasons.” I think whether it is a propaganda or how much percentage of oxygen it produces, but it is still important to protect our environment :)

Thanks for your info, but I think it doesn’t mean we should sit back and do nothing right? :)

According to [this]( the 1st commercial flight to Mars would be in 2021, I doubt Bitcoin‘s price will be high enough for us to go to Mars. 50 years later may be possible if you are still hodling BTC :)

Indeed it will be more disastrous to see plankton dying compared to burning forest, but i guess no humans can survive to witness it. Btw forest fire can kill oceanic plankton too. [

It’s true humans tend to create problems &amp; then try to find solutions to fix it. Embarrassing to say: I did it myself too. Haha

Thanks for your data, do you mind to elaborate?
