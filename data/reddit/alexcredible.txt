That's ridiculous lol
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:01:49
Well, like I said elsewhere, 


A choice implies the user pulled the change themselves. This is a push transaction - developers are making the change and users are forced to accept the change or change their existing process.
That's ruling by decree and I don't think Bitcoin is about that.

I've been using Bitcoin since 2013

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:31:13


Why don't you put your resources into my business? 
I don't need to add Bitcoin to my business. I was going to add it because it was a win/win. This is a loss for me so I won't be doing it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:00:33


If the UX changes it's not a choice. The user is the user because they use the application. That's why I recommended a configuration item. That would give the user a true choice without them having to take on any additional knowledge or process.
I appreciate you ponting out Electrum. I think that's going to be the right way forward. I'm glad we have competing implementations to salvage user choices. It's still very alarming that a team of devs working on censorship resistant money would censor a business in this way.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:53:50
I'm sorry you see it that way
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:08:26
I would say that marketing has got Bitcoin to where it is today. Especially over the past five years, or so.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:24:31
It doesn't matter if they had issues. They've had issues in other places, too.
You made your appeal to authority. It failed. What now?
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:02:01
This is fun now:
Because I have more experience with crypto than people like you
See if you can figure out what to do with that =)
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:13:04
Ok, Coinbase. Now what?
Edit: After Coinbase - Purse.io and any other company running Bcoin for their business
So now what?
Edit 2: I am whinging because I want to launch my business with Bitcoin support and BIP70 is the only feasible way to do it. Bip21 is not a secure replacement. This is not about Bitpay. It's about my business. 
If no one uses it then it shouldn't be a priority for removal. Dead code costs nothing. Especially if it's not actually dead code and businesses can derive value from it.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:13:36
That's like saying 'suicide is a choice' because anyone can do it at any time but we choose not to -- see you have a choice.
It's software. Don't conflate it. If you remove a feature people use you're breaking someone's process.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:26:39
Hey thanks for putting some of your time towards this.
I'll try to speak to the spirit of each part and please correct me. I only want to reduce tangents.


No, I've only brought up Bitpay here in response to others. I am against the developers choosing features for users.




What have the costs been so far? I'm just not familiar with the amount of change that has gone into BIP70 since it was added in 2013, I think.


I'm actually not. To run my business I will need to rely on developers implementing the protocol for me. 
What I am perceiving as the spirit of your message is basically that not enough people use it to justify the developer burden.
So you bring up Bitpay running their payment processor on it. Is that usage or is that not usage? It seems to change depending on each paragraphs framing. E.g. "Bitpay is using it, but Bitpay is also not using it"
I also have plans on implementing a business that uses the payment protocol because I cannot afford to spend countless hours offering customer service to users who over or under spend. 
This means I drop support for Bitcoin. So we can point to businesses making money from it. We can point to businesses that want to use it. Why do the devs get to dictate to us which tech is good for our business?


Is this fair? If you stop supporting a feature you leave the user to die or update. That's usually called steering by business folks. What makes it different here?
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:29:21
It's really sad that people like you are in crypto
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:39:19
To be clear, I do not care about Bitpay or the opinions of its CEO.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:37:20
I don't care about your reddit posts.
Post cryptographic proof or gtfo.
Stop CSW'ing. Post a signature or you can't.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:14:56
The ones making the changes I reference
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:49:43
Thanks again. I think we're getting to the spirit of it.


Yeah I agree with this. I did not know Bitcoin development was owned by anyone. E.g. I do not believe you (or me) own Bitcoin. Devs steering like this alarms me.


I appreciate the recommendation but this still comes down to devs deciding for me what is best in my application. 


Because I don't have time to go back and change working software that is becoming unworkable because a dev felt like making it unworkable. You can't base a business on that.
Could you please take a second and explain what the costs of maintaining BIP70 have been that I asked about? You cited it as the primary reason for dropping support. What is the cost?
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:25:37
No. Move the goal post as much as you want. When you answer my question or make it relevant to my OP I'll get back to you.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:38:26
Maybe you just don't know the difference between Crypto and banking?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:53:30
That doesn't sound like anything a user can or wants to do. Why would I want to do any of that just to send a payment? Let's pretend I dig holes for a living and interact with the internet through a smartphone.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:33:28
So far this has been night/day.
This is like the sub used to be and is what I remember about the good days of Bitcointalk
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:07:54
I completely agree with you.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:00:56
I measure success in a number of ways. In this respect, 
Bitpay is successful because 
1. It helped bootstrap Bitcoin with an early use case, 
2. Traction with big name customers when Bitcoin was only associate with DNM
3. The amount of open source code they released helped build the ecosystem from 2011ish to 2014ish and some even today.
4. All of the developers that have worked at Bitpay and moved on to other projects that have seeded this entire ecosystem.
How do you measure success? And how does measuring success impact my choice when a technology is censored like this?
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:28:48
I've literally provided a signed message from an address that dates back to 2013. Can you do one better than that?
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:07:56
I would take a team of average developers working together over any 'rockstar' expert developer any day.
Especially in a system as intricate and esoteric as Bitcoin. It's a phenomenal breakthrough and it was designed so the entire would could work together on it. It's a shame so many are so afraid to learn the technology they trade their sovereignty away to other people before ever experiencing it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:08:22
What does that prove?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:54:01
I didn't know it was an insult not to be a business owner
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:52:01
He told me to put my resources into open source. I built a career on it first. Now I'm building a business. It was certainly reflective but you would have to read the entire thing.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:33:24
This is not about Bitpay
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:29:45
I am definitely going to support bch now, yeah
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:09:20
Sign a message or gtfo
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:37:55
I guess a lot has changed.
Five years ago people understood that businesses using this technology feed value back into the ecosystem. Usage is utility.
The opportunity cost of hiring a dev vs spending on marketing, sales or product is obvious. I don't think you've ran a business before =)
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:30:24
I haven't ordered anything. I don't want them making my platform decisions.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:06:46
You should try to avoid hero worship in crypto. You can verify everything yourself. You should strengthen yourself instead.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:52:48
Then you can't. Stop lying on the Internet keyboard warrior
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:15:46


Point to it
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:42:11
Regardless of where they put it, that's their prerogative. Another competitor with 1:1 features could also not charge it and the user would see the diff in price.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:30:56
That's fair to point out.
I think it's their decision to gouge on fees or not. That's part of competition. That goes back to the user choice I point out in my post. At least with Bitcoin transactions I can see the Bitpay is gouging me and then move to a competitor.
What I dislike about this move is that it removes my ability to choose and I do not see how removing my ability as a user to choose serves Bitcoin's narrative as censorship resistant money when the core developers are the ones removing my features.
Is there a Bitpay competitor that can take advantage or Bitpays gouging to win their customers?
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:58:51
It was my understanding based on a Bitpay blog post that BIP 70 was reducing their customer service burden because users would send incorrect amounts to their invoices?
Here is that blog post: 
Do I misunderstand the feature? And what does this change with respect to censoring a piece of technology like in my OP?
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:14:34
Well I guess you can read the thread again
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:57:15
Yeah it doesn't match up. If Bitpay is so bad then it should be easy competition to take out.
BIP70 is a part of the Bitcoin protocol as of 2013. I don't understand why these devs get to change the protocol like this. It's too top-down to be considered Bitcoin to me.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:16:03


You are no authority
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:33:08
I can understand why the uninitiated would get confused with a simple signature and convolute it with CSW.
If you ever want to actually learn the technology send me a message
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:01:58
Point to where I made a demand
Point to these contributors outside of Blockstream
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:16:43
You can't or won't so you aren't worth the time =)
You're in the CSW tier of users.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:34:43
They control this fork of the protocol
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:10:27
That's a shame to see Paypal promoted
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:35:05
Fair points but I think you split hairs. There will eventually be a time where that client is no longer supported and the user will be forced to change. 
Also, new fixes and updates will not be pushed to older versions, there are no LTS versions planned for BIP 70 from Blockstream, to my knowledge. 
So I think I agree with you if you meet me in the middle and admit that this breaks the user's best practices wto security since they will be unable to update their client.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:11:50
So older clients cannot be backwards compatible with new features. New features can be backwards compatible with old features, though.
Voluntarism has apparently left the discussion as the majority of Blockstream core devs are on the same payroll. So being paid to donate your time is kind of... I dunno, is 'hand wavy' accurate here?
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:22:13
It doesn't matter if you used it. You made an appeal to authority. It failed. What now
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:55:51


Sorry you started out by pointing out Bitpay used it, are you saying they don't now?


This would require every user compile their own binaries. By definition, a user is someone who does not do that.


I don't think that qualifies you to speak to the esoteries of payment processors when held up against a company like Bitpay.
How does any of this relate to my OP? You've lost me in the weeds. Could you tie it back in to the censorship somehow?
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:32:52
I am talking about user choice and I am asking why the developers are censoring features to remove my choices.
I am sorry you are trying to steer this into something about Bitpay. I am more concerned for every company that would use the payment protocol and having it available to me as a user and ensuring developers don't choose for me.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:11:23
Sure, BIP70 is not vulnerable to MITM attacks and the user cannot change the amount like in BIP21. 
There are two compelling reasons to use BIP70 over BIP21. 
It's nice to finally get into a technical discussion. Let me know what you think
