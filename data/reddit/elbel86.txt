They also don't ever verify you. I submitted my documents in June, emailed support several times over the next 2 or 3 months and was always told to just wait a week or two more because they are behind.
I gave up months ago and have never heard anything else from them.

That could be.  He probably thought bitcoin was the name of the company behind the app.

Should have used his face for this one too.

I did get a response to my ticket, just telling me that they are backed up and hope to get to it soon.

Verified within minutes? I've been waiting since June 16th. Reached out to customer service on July 30th and they said they've been busy and would get to it soon. Never heard anything since.

I sure hope so. Can't wait to buy more!

I've wanted to try Gemini.  In fact I opened an account and submitted my ID on June 12th and I'm still waiting to be verified.  When I log in it says please allow two weeks for the verification process, but its been nearly 2 months.  I tried emailing support a few days ago, so we'll see where that gets me.
