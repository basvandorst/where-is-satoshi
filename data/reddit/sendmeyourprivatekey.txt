I can understand the sentiment to some extent but most people simply don't understand if they haven't ever lived in a country that has universal health care.  
I live in Germany and as you might know we have pretty high taxes, for example we have sales tax of 19% and income taxes on up to 50% in the highest bracket. At first that sounds ridiculous but I think that our society as a whole profits from that as long as the taxes are used in the right way.  
If I am sick I can always go to the doctor no matter how poor I am. In america I would probably be really poor after receiving cancer treatment.  
It is no secret that poverty creates crime and crime is expensive for the state. My point is that after all not having universal health care is more expensive than having it. It's the same with education. Sure, education is expensive as fuck and we need to have taxes to pay for it but in the end not having education would be even more expensive since uneducated people commit more crimes which again costs the government money fighting it.  
The US is such a rich country, yet there are so many poor people and I think it's a shame. The average standard of living is way higher in countries that have health care and better education. Americans are simply stuck in their ways that taxes equals theft but that's not surprising if you see how much money is invested in going to war instead of helping the uneducated and poor
@_date: 2015-06-26 12:28:45
That is true but my point that a sudden sickness puts you into debt still stands.

Gdp per capita hasnt much to do with the quality of life of the average person.  
My point is that in the us the wealth is unequally distributed so gdp per capita isn't important if only a few are really really rich but many others are still poor 
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:41:36
Sounds really cool! Someone has to be the first, maybe in a few years you can tell everyone that you were one of the first bitcoin professors. Good luck to you
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:27:30
it is but in the end even the richer people who pay the taxes profit from a society in which people don't have to die in debt if they get cancer.  
Seriously, just look at the high rate of crimes in the US and compare them to crimes in european countries with higher taxes and universal health care (and yes, I'm implying that there is some sort of correlation)  
Denying the poor the possibility of going to the doctor is cruel and inhumane, there is no other way to put it. Especially if a country is as rich as the US. Besides that society as a whole profits when people aren't forced into debt when they have cancer or other diseases.  
The problem with money is that it is way too easy to make more money if you already have lots of it in contrast to escaping poverty.  
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:08:52
Tell me, why shouldn't a sub be "bipolar". There are over 150.000 subscriptions on this subreddit so it shouldn't be surprising that there is more than one opinion. In the end reddit exists for discussing shit like that

Not a really good argument. What's important for a currency is the buying power and the buying power of bitcoin today is lower than for example yesterday.

Reading mnw comments makes me think that he really is a narcissistic douchebag. If he admitted he fucked up he could save his reputation but he only talks about how great he is and how the others probably would have scammed him as well. Whether he is right or wrong, he still acts really douchey

Well, to be fair while most people are greedy here, we still shape the future a tiny bit by not giving the government a part of our money. Its not like were freedom fighters or something but by buying and holding bitcoin we take away some of the governments power.

here you go, bro: 
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:17:04
Exactly. And bitcoin won't improve if we only talk about the positive sides and neglect the negatives. I mean let's take a video game for example, how would you improve it? By constantly talking about how awesome it is or by looking at the faults in said game and trying to fix them? I personally hate what r/bitcoin has become. People like Op who see bitcoin as their religion who can't even accept constructive criticism destroy this subreddit because everyone who says something negative is automatically a troll. Fuck that

Regular money just produces a lot of friction when sent. Look at paypal or credit card fees, they are insane while bitcoin transactions are pretty cheap. Little example, I owed a friend of mine in america 60€ but to send them via paypal would have been pretty expensive. I just sent him the amount of bitcoin which instantly arrived and that is a huge strength of btc. Another awesome thing about bitcoin is that it can be used anonoumosly which is good for porn for example (maybe thatll convince your dad haha). Besides that btc is a pretty good investment for long term storage of wealth similar to gold

Yeah, you can't repeat it enough because people will abuse almost every substance (hell, even food gets abused a lot) so it is very important to also tell people the dangers of the drugs. I take psychedelics myself and think everyone should decide for themselves but drugs always have some dangers with them

Exactly the typical circlejerk type of headline Ive seen in r/bitcoin for years. It really annoys me that so many r/bitcoin users feel the need to pump their own investment.
