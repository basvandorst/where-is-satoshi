How is it freedom? What advantages does bitcoin provide that gold or other tangible, non fiat, forms of currency provide?

I never said linux was a fad, but fundamentally linux and bitcoin are so incredibly different. Linux adoption and evolution doesn't have any intrinsic and individual control involved with its progression. In order for bitcoin to gain adoption like linux has it would need a free and accessible distribution, which is fundamentally contrary to what bitcoin...well...is...as I understand it at least. You dismiss alt-coins so quickly but I just don't see what separates bitcoin from them other than a black market bubble. Am I missing something?

Hyperbole is definitely something I'm not unfamiliar with, obviously. Although if you were to have looked not but a page deeper into my comment history you would have seen a comment thread about genuine question of the value of bitcoin. I'm not going to pretend, nor hide my trepidation and criticisms of online currency, but I discuss them not because of outright dismissal, but merely to figure out what all the fuss is about.

Open source is something I'm a huge proponent of, that being said being open source doesn't make something intrinsically better. From what I understand the backend of bitcoin as it stands processing transactions is totally carried by the mining community, of which it is now unfeasible for the average user to do. So without the backbone of large mining groups to update the blockchain bitcoin crawls to a stop. How is that not a bureaucracy? It's still economically viable for those systems to keep running but what about in 5 years? or 10? It's fantastic that an African kid can use bitcoin but how do they get coin in the first place? Furthermore, how do they turn their coin into something other than 1s and 0s?

Why shouldn't I? I'm at a loss on both sides of the coin, There's no way I can outright dismiss bitcoin because as it stands the blockchain is worth millions, but as someone who's both used bitcoin at near it's inception and seen where its gone from then I can't help but be left with the question. Where does it go from here? I'm genuinely asking for opinions on where people expect bitcoin to be in 50 years.

That is an...interesting...presumption. In order for that to happen fiat currencies across the globe would have to be eliminated and bitcoin would have to be the primary monetary system, which from a historical and logical perspective is just...impossible. It's a very neat idea though.

As an avid linux user this I understand, but the problem is in order to cultivate value you need mass appropriation. Linux is wonderful, but the only reason it exists is because it's free. Bitcoin requires a monetary investment. Bitcoin may be used in 1000 places I'm not aware of, but what will keep it from being just a fleeting fad? Doubly so with all of the competing "coins" out there?

That doesn't make any sense, Bitcoin isn't a function subscript that can operate autonomously without human interaction. Are you trying to say that using bitcoin isn't logical?

Can you elborate on how bitcoin is open it innovation? My understanding is that its not much different from current digital payment methods other than that it's not tied to a single bank/credit card/currency. How can/does bitcoin change online commerce other than create another series of 1s and 0s that will eventually get changed tangible currency?

Why?
