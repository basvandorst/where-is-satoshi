6000 is completely doable I've never been good at guessing time frames.
A month ago I though it was [only going to hit .5 fib]( on this dip but with this new timeline .618 lines up better.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:56:15
What makes you say that?

[babypips]( is full of great FREE resources and I can't recommend their educational courses enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:46:36
Happy to help, with so much new money coming into Crypto right now with the recent ATH, education is going to be everyone's greatest tool.

Holding strong according to what chart?
Edit: drilled down a bit from the day charts I look at to a 1hr chart and actually feel it's not holding strong as volume has dropped from the past couple couple periods.

GDAX w/ a buy order at .618 fib retracement (~4800).

Are you ready for all the panic selling after this cat bounces?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:02:02
As sure as one can be trying to predict the future lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:29:44
Sorry, I'm not tracking. How do you see fib being fluid?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:28:12
There isn't currently a fast option with TXs stacking up the way they are.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:34:57
I don't think it's going that low. I posted this on another thread:
I'm holding out till .618 fib to buy in which is what the last major dips (June &amp; Sept) hit before finding resistance. Support trend lines also support this prediction. $5400 at .5 fib is going to be tough support to break through as well though.
With BTC currently at $6800 if feels just like a bull trap imo.
Plan your trade and trade your plan.

[Baby Pips]( will be your best friend for learning more about trading. 
If you're looking more long term/HODLing I'd recommend learning more about Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) as an investment strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:18:46
Why not? If you're looking to enter or exit just set up your buy/sell order.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:22:41
Personally I believe it's a bull trap. Time will tell though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:09:07
Oh yeah, it is [definitely not looking good](
At what price do you think the bottom will be?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:57:11
Don't get too excited about this dead cat/bull trap
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:56
No, .618 fib retracement for BTCUSD pair.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:29
Only $38 above 5600. What do you think will happen at .5 fib? dead cat or reversal?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:01:20
[0.65% of addresses own 87.67% of BTC](
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:09:34
In their defense, 30 min chart shows a dragonfly doji but current volume is way to high imo to indicate reversal as well as a dragonfly being a weak reversal signal in and of itself.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:43:13
Agree w/ ya but at a bit lower price till reversal. A lot of these people here are just under-educated and haven't taken the time to learn TA or any other analysis and go at it recklessly. Without discipline I see a lot of panic selling happening in the coming weeks.

Correction in this sense is referring to a drop in price due to overvaluation 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:06:58
lol for real
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:03:30
Dead cat...
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:06:00
I went from the swing Sept 14. 
Here's [what I'm currently looking at]( on Trading View. 
Oct 11 looked like it could have made head and shoulders for reversal but volume didn't line up and of course never passed the neck line (5400) instead smashing through the resistance line I had drawn from Mar 31 to Sept 1. 
The line at 6250 was anticipated resistance is the price from difference from 7/16 to 9/1 added to the low at 9/15 and the resistance line at 7800 is the same except using % of growth from the same time period for the last bull run instead of price.
I'm thinking the surge through the resistance line I had drawn is due to S2X greed and FOMO. Overall, I pay the most attention to TA but that's generally when fundamentals come to bite me in the ass. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:52:24
You made a good call with price crashing into 6k yesterday though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:03:58
I completely agree which is why instead of price I think it's much more useful for those making long term investments to work on time instead as I'm sure we all have enough confidence in BTC enough for it to not disappear and that it will only go up. This is not me endorsing running without a stop loss however.
The question is, how high will it go.
At a distance of 15.13" to the moon it would take 2.46B dollar bills to go from the earth to the moon if you want to moon in the literal sense. :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:10:22
Couldn't agree more

Here's an earlier comment w/ my personal analysis:

.382 isn't too far, I'm holding out for .618 fib retracement though. This puts it right in line with the June and Sept dip and the support trend line.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:52:43
Agreed, seems like a bull trap to me.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:11:43
Just the same dangers as not holding your private keys like with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:27:02
Just check fib retracement levels. My bet is .618
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:19:36
Historically, going lower than .618 fib would be remarkable. .618 is where the dips in June and Sept found support and rallied to new ATH.
I think going lower than the pre swell low would be extremely significant and confidence shattering as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:42:35
Agreed, I think we're gonna bounce around between .382 and .5 for a bit trapping more bulls before heading down further.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:51:45
Thanks and I haven't as Trading View only goes back 2 yrs for me. Looking at a daily chart for TA I personally don't feel using the word historically is discrediting reversals that happened 3-4 yrs ago though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:48:39
Same, put in a buy order around 5k as well.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:00:22
To the moon!
