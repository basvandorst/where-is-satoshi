Well, I've been in BTC for years, so perhaps my perspective is different. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:27:57
BTC was like $5800 just two months ago. 
Relax, people. 
We're fine.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:36:32
My guess is that the temporary drop was due to people on exchanges panicking because they don't understand how futures work.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:49:32
If you, like many, believe that BTC has a bright future next year, then yes..adding now makes sense. Capital gains, depending on where you live, often gets lower after holding your investment for a period of time (usually one year or more). However, you're paying the gains tax based upon how much you have gained during that period of time. So adding more BTC will, as long as it appreciates, increase your tax in proportion to the gain. Whether adding increases/decreases your cost basis obviously depends upon whether you buy at a higher/lower price than your present cost basis.
In the best of all worlds, you are going to get a better ROI when buying an appreciating asset at lower prices (such as when it dips).
For the sake of simplicity:
Scenario 1-- Say you own 5BTC and your cost basis is 10k in 2017, it goes to 20k in 2018 and you sell. Your tax is based upon that 50k profit.
Scenario 2-- Say you own 5BTC and your cost basis is 10k in 2017, but you buy two more BTC around this time at 15k. It goes to 20k in 2018 and you sell. Your cost basis is 11,428.57/BTC (5/7*10000)+(2/7*15000) =11,428.57
Your profit is now 7*11,428.57 = 80000, so you would pay tax on that $80,000.

I'm guessing you're new-ish to BTC? I can't speak for others, but having been through this stuff for nearly five years now, I'm not even bothered by the dips. This is nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:30:37
You can tell by the way that it is.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:27:01
lots of edgy teenagers (hopefully)
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:20:45
They can't regulate the world, so I'm not sure what people expect to come from this. Perhaps they scrutinize US-based platforms, but those aren't the biggest exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:04:40
I know, which is why I said most think it will be announced today.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:43:37
I think it is on the 11th, but everyone expects it today
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:17:46
Interesting...I didn't know that was the default, which is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:52:54
This is a fantastic tip...
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:21:27
They're having a sale due to the hurricane - only $150k instead of $250k...OR just buy a home there worth at least $400k, which you can sell back after 5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:07:26
Riskier than real estate? Forex? Options? Margin trading? 
I mean, this is some serious doom-and-gloom from a concern troll.
As long as grey haired men are in charge, the system won't change. 
It's so frustrating that every time BTC seems to take a step toward mass-adoption, one of these people starts preaching about how awful bitcoin is. Fortunately the CME and NASDAQ are taking a step forward.
There's no way there could be any ulterior motive behind such comments, right?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:03:49
Yeah, not sure I see why this is a big deal...I mean, Trezor and Ledger also have BCH wallets next to BTC, so what's the problem? 
(Note: I also dumped my BCH when it came out, [snif], and I'm firmly in the BTC is the real Bitcoin camp, but I'd like to think we have more constructive ways to use our time to promote Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:06:02
Good point!
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:54:08
For comparison Apple = $900 billion. We still have a looong way to go. Remember that next time someone mentions 'tulip bulbs' or 'bubble'. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:38:43
The problem is that there is a huge economic disequilibrium in this situation. 
This isn't some Ayn Rand scenario where individuals are acting on their own behalf, but quite the opposite. A custodian/trustee is acting on the orders of a government to sell on behalf of those who were affected by the 'hack'. 
Those people are being reimbursed at something like $400/btc rather than being given the underlying vehicle to do what they like with it. Many people think that is a horribly inelegant solution that is only worsened by the reckless approach to selling the asset...he panic sold at $6k. 
The guy is a lawyer, not a trader. 
He's sitting on a powder keg of +166,000 BTC...what's his next move? 
Only he and the exchanges know, and there's nothing to stop them from, as someone else mentioned, front-running the transactions. 
Even if they don't, Kobayashi alone can flatten the entire crypto market for years and he doesn't have any incentive to do otherwise because they aren't his coins...he's just doing what the government has instructed him to do.
But yeah, free market and all that.

This didn't age well after only a few hours.
@_date: 2018-03-08 00:03:32
Yes, of course, but I'm talking about the dip from 19k. It absolutely coincided with the dump that took us down over 65%
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:08:42
I have no 'losses' mate...not sure where you got that idea.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:10:06
I think Fiverr accepts bitcoin...tons of options there.

@_date: 2017-09-25 22:39:14
Ah, my fault...I was thinking in terms of buying/cashing out 1 bitcoin not $1k, and it appears that I accidentally conflated the two.
Yes, you're correct. The $1k, in this case would be what one would pay the capital gains on. So, $250 comes out of that come tax time.
Either way, cashing out a BTC profit (whether whole or fractional) to buy something incurs a hefty capital gains tax, which, imho, isn't always advantageous, especially if the goal is to 'buy the dips' and 'sell at an ath'.

Paging Tim Draper
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:52:35
Good for you, but my country isn't that way, so capital gains would be enormous.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:46:05
If only it was that easy to time the market. As you may know, there are a lot of us here who don't want to deal with the enormous tax expenses that come with short term capital gains rates. (You may find a different attitude over at r/cryptotraders)
If you sell your stack you've just bought yourself a major tax bill...then you rebuy lower, and repeat...congrats, another tax bill...do that 5-10x/yr and you're going to pay loads of tax. 
I'd rather just push money into BTC every month and accumulate more that way, but that's just me.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:57:25
Great article...thanks for sharing
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:02:02
Nice job mate...simple, intuitive design. Any plans to add more coins in the near future. I feel like this is something I can share with my skeptical-about-crypto-friends that will help them quantify the opportunity cost.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:20:50
You forgot the other (used) stuff in the photo that would normally set you back about $650 if you had to buy it on Craigslist or eBay.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:38:19
Fully agree...whether in the form of a 'bank' or some other type of trusted, insured, custodian, the average person isn't ready for a Trezor. I see posts every week from typical users along the lines of: 'Help! I accidentally sent (crypto) to the wrong address.'
I can't imagine my fairly tech-savvy friends, let alone my parents, keeping up with forks, exchanges, hardware updates, etc. I think we're a long, long way off before there is anything even closely resembling widespread adoption.
Keep in mind that internet access and literacy rates around the world vary by an enormous amount...crypto needs to have a much simpler user interface before it is able to surmount that hurdle.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:53:53
That was atrociously bad. There was no 'debate'. It was three smug Bloomberg commentators berating BTC and being dismissive of any possible value. Predictably: the words "Tulips" "Ponzi" "Bubble" "Dot com IPOs" and "Criminal activity" were tossed in to punctuate their points. 
This was a hastily cobbled together sideshow pandering to their viewers who are heavily invested in traditional asset classes.  
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:54:47
There are probably a lot of people out there who held round numbers of BTC (10, 50, 100, 200), who said 'once it hits $5k, I'm cashing out'. 
Still, unless you really need the money, why on earth would you sell? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:47:43
Why would it have a purchase value of $800? 
You buy at $4k
You sell at $5k
Profit = $1k
Tax@ 25% ($250)
Remaining profit $750
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:54:51
what leads you to that conclusion?
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:48:26
Meh, the SEC doesn't seem impressed with past ETF proposals...I think we're a long way off before one gets the green light. If/when an etf is approved, there will definitely be a spike to anticipate new trading volume. Then, when it is actually listed, look out, because the first quarter of trading should see a lot of new money in the space.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:11:54
Yes, now you owe short term capital gains. That would be a terrible financial move because you're taxed at the same rate as your income tax. So, if you have a moderately-decent professional role, you're now paying a 25% (or higher) premium to buy that same item.
Ex: You buy BTC at $4k, then when it goes to $5k sometime in the next 12 mos, you cash out $1k to buy something, but you're now going to owe $250 come tax time, not to mention that the money you used from your paycheck to buy the BTC in the first place has already been taxed.
Also, sometimes the next dip doesn't dip as low as your initial buy, which, in this case, is $4k. So say it only dips back to $4.5k, now you've also raised your cost basis.
Any time you sell your BTC, you're going to be taxed...it doesn't matter that you bought something with it...once you sell/exchange it for something else, you owe capital gains on the difference between your purchase and sale price.
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:59:27
If only. 
US citizens have to pay capital gains tax (and income tax) regardless of where they are in the world. There is no geographical amnesty.
It also doesn't matter if it is BTC, USD, EUR, or gold coins.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:48:31
Good grief. This has got to be a joke.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:50:35
Because not all of us are traders. Some of us are investors. We bought for the long haul, we hold and add to our position systematically. 
Trying to time the market is easier said than done. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:24:41
Ask Japan...it's legal tender there.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:18:32
So you're selling because you fear 2x in November? Not judging, just trying to clarify.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:29:40
I think the only way a BTC addition to Square would be feasible is if Square was willing to heighten their own risk profile by offering merchants a 'price guarantee' of some sort. 
If Square would get comfortable with the same sort of risk exposure that Overstock has, it could definitely work. They could simply establish a small risk management desk by hiring a couple seasoned futures traders to hedge their BTC positions. 
As adoption increases, it may help to smooth out some of BTC's volatility.

Richard Heart?
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:00:58
I feel the same way about the 'cash out' phrase. There are a lot of young/immature proponents of BTC, but let's be even-handed here: there's life outside of the noob 'traders' on reddit and 4chan. 
There's serious activity in BTC from hedge funds, billionaire investors, financial markets, and nations like Japan that consider BTC legal currency. Heck, the SEC/CFTC/IRS and Senate consider cryptocurrency to be more than just magic internet money; a point that should give pause to skeptics.
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:19:56
Curious, why do you claim trade war fears are 'playing into it now'? Is this your own assessment or based upon something you've read? 
I can understand why trade wars influence the price of certain commodities and goods, but BTC doesn't function in the same way, and, if anything, it has often played the role of a deflationary investment vehicle. You really believe that the average BTC buyer is concerned about a trade war so they are keeping their money in the bank instead?
Not trying to sound harsh...I just don't think the normie invasion of late 2017 was comprised of people conversant in international economics and the regulatory environment surrounding financial markets and institutions.

@_date: 2018-12-12 00:50:59
I nearly forgot about how frustrated new entrants were by being unable to buy due to understaffed exchanges...unanswered support tickets everywhere...what a mess that was. (I'm looking at you, Coinbase)
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:46:12
Absolutely...$1700-ish isn't out of the question in the next 6 mos given past corrections.
