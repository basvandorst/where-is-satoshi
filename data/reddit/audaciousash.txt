"TOKYO: Taro Aso, Japan's deputy prime minister and finance minister, on Friday said he always thought bitcoin was suspect and said the country might take action following the apparent collapse of a Tokyo-based exchange for the virtual currency.
Taro Aso's comments came after chief US central banker Janet Yellen said the Federal Reserve had no powers to control the unit, which she said would be very difficult to regulate.
Aso said he had foreseen difficulties for the crypto-currency, which is generated by complex chains of interaction among a huge network of computers around the planet.
"I was thinking that this sort of thing won't last long," said Aso, 73. "I was thinking it would collapse sometime."
"Japan is overwhelmingly advanced in this field. In this sense, I was thinking since before that we might face a situation where Japan has to act, but I'd say it came earlier than I thought."
