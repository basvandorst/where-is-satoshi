@_date: 2018-01-12 22:25:42
I think you're missing the broader point that if coinbase can ruin it for everybody it wasn't good tech. If it was good tech than coinbase would be the one suffering while everyone else benefited. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:50:56
Itt: people buying and using Bitcoin are attacked as spammers.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:08:19
So why hasn't core built a layer that can mitigate coinbase usage? You are right that backbone providers added layers of new tech, but these new layers attracted the major users, and didn't sacrifice the new users for the sake of the old. If the layer can't actually speed things up then why is it implemented. If Comcast told you that your fiber was held to 14.4k because someone across town was still on dial up would that seem like they had implemented a good well thought out solution?
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:29:19
No, coinbase being on 14.4k (analogy) has slowed the entire network, not just 1 user to 1 user.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:42:32
It *is* working
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:46:43
Ah I see, so what you're saying is the internet increase the block size? So to speak anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:59:12
If one company can expose the weakness of an entire ecosystem maybe the tech isn't so immutable after all.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:33:57
Adoption isn't the measure in this problem it's Tx per unit of time. It would seem at this point the smart thing to do would be for the coin with the greater adoption but the slow tx time and high cost to implement the proven solution of the coin with the faster tx time and lower cost.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:52:46
Well then by logic measure Bitcoin cash has a greater adoption since they are processing more transactions per unit of time. Currently if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:56:37
Except that the other coin increased the block size and the transactions are 1 penny. So it would seem that that was the fix to the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:17:29
No way. You might could disable their aol account, or kick them from a bbs, but you could not disrupt the entire system. And if you could it would indicate a flaw in the system.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:38:48
You've got it wrong way round. Internet is the global service, Coinbase is the ISP. Its like one ISP blaming another ISP for their own slow speeds, when their networks don't overlap at all. Gemini is not coinbase, but a Gemini TX w Bitcoin Legacy is just as slow and expensive as a coinbase TX with Bitcoin Legacy, because the system they are both running on is flawed. If SegWit was a good solution it wouldn't require 100% adoption to function. The height of hubris, for any type of product developer, is to assume that people will use your product just  because you say so. If you can't go in to a project design understanding that fact, that not everyone will get on board, and design with that factor in mind, your methodology is flawed from the beginning.  The chain split allowed for the market to decide which direction to go. The entrenched side has price dominance, but they can't spend this money anywhere. It quite reminds me of the south pacific islands where the huge stones sit in one place and they write different owners names on them. I don't know how the legacy people get away with it. Imagine Microsoft shipping a version of Office that doesn't function and then blaming Oracle for the problems. Its asinine.

You guys are so toxic. You should be supporting both chains. Calling people bitches etc...so lame. Trump style tactics, and ultimately achieves nothing but make you look scared. If you really think one chain has immutable value over the other why the need to write anything at all? Hodl both chains, work on improving all crypto, and profit.

This whole thing is such a terrible analogy

Gish gallop.
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:41:23
The issue with his particular analogy is that they have left out that the family owns a gold mine with 1000x their current debt in gold in it. Also this family owns more guns than any other family in town to protect its gold mine with, and make sure everybody wants to buy their gold.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:38:36
Yes exactly

Lol why dont you see if anyone will pay a $5 fee to order a $10 dish at your restaurant?
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:45:41
Theres not always room, there is a theoretical limit somewhere, 1mb is not it. And the actual price is much lower than what 1mb sets an artificial price at. But its an interesting thought experiment. As far as security the BCH blockchain has a much higher functional limit and it is still secure. So apparently at least this limit remains secure and lowers price and therefore barriers to use.
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:46:20
Both would seem to be rather important lol

Also not accurate. You don't need 16 CPUs or 16 power supplies. You need a bigger HD which are stilling falling according to Moore's law and are dirt friggin cheap man!
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:01:11
Yeah maybe so, but if that one node can process 100x the tx of the 8 1mb which would you rather have lol. Yes I get that a Honda Civic uses less gas than a Corvette and?
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:08:45
Well I assume they owned legacy Bitcoin at the split? Possible they didn't I suppose.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:49:48
So miners need 8gb of ram, or the amount included in some mobile phones. Got it. What's the problem again?
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:50:35
No not period, data storage is not on a linear price scale, period.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:43:06
I guess thats a no then?
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:42:35
I really don't know how to respond to your suggestion that you need 16x the ram to process a a 16mb block vs a 1mb 1. And either way I've got something like 100x that ram on this phone here I'm on and 1000x that on a desktop PC.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:44:35
I mean it's literally worth less in the sense of dollars, but I think the utility value is higher with BCH. What BTC has propping up the value is Goodwill capital and PR. Those are not immutable values. BTC also has higher adoption which greatly adds to the value.

Muslims follow edicts about as well as everyone else. In other words any Muslims who wanted Bitcoin had it already before Sharia law approved it. Also fuck all religious laws including Sharia.
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:35:05
I think simple math dictates the network will soon handle approx 32x the traffic of the legacy network, with no backbone changes. One little value in one line of code.

Not if they are sourced from a deity. Only philosophies that are man made require change. If there is a god you mean he didn't know about electricity at the time?

I don't see how that's relevant? Many people may not have a 400v electric car charger in their garage either, that doesn't mean the electric car is dead end tech? Look at future states.

Besides the fact that if it needs adaptation it obviously is not divine in nature lol

See what I mean? It's mental gymnastics around the actual Koran, is there some excerpt in the book about social acceptance? Anyone who is not in it has nothing to do with halal or Haram.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:47:45
Are you just making this stuff on the fly? There's no hardware limitation on larger blocks for mobile wallets,the hardware limitation for full nodes is met for $100 at current prices, and 2mbs down might be the average speed but it's not the average BTC node runner speed.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:33:34
Omg guys give it up, this thing is dead in the water. There may be some new tech that comes out that is superior to larger blocks, but at this point larger blocks is the scaling solution. 150k? There are dozens of us, dozens!
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:37:02
Who makes the rules of a religion? If its not a god then wtf does anyone care? You said humans hadn't harnessed electricity when the Quran was written. If the Quran, or any other book for that matter, was influenced by a divine power the divine power would possess knowledge not available to the people. The fact that none of this was conveyed on the Quran, or any other holy book, is evidence that they don't have any divine influence. In short who actually gives a fuck if some backward ass fucks think Bitcoin is haram or halal, if they are fucking dumb enough to care they shouldn't be involved in crypto.

So the British pound is linked to their economic output? Ok. And the Swiss franc. Also you said it right in the comment: intelligent management. Remember the 80000 peso cokes? Nondilutable, non nationstate currency is a great thing. Explain Venezuela right now? Currency is in no way intrinsically tied to the economic value of the issuing countries economy, and quite often departs from it substantially.
