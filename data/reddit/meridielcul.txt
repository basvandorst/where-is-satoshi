ahem, your argument works only for altcoins that use the same hash function as bitcoin... and there are ALOT that don't

yeah... I'm no business man but it seems to me that you actually have to plan carefully how cash flow will work; if cash only goes out but never comes in you'll finish the funding money quite quick

sorry but if there ever was an altcoin that is not useless, that is ethereum
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:59:06
so MultiBit is a scam

And where will you get all the cash to pay the recieving philipinos then?

"easiest" reason (occam's razor) being that it is a scam, and that those change addresses are really owned by the dev. Why else wouldn't you fix such a critical bug? It basically makes the whole software useless

there's no difference IMHO... the fact that they *could* do bad things is a bad thing,

wat? can someone ELI5? what do they have to fix?
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:39:40
You and your logic...
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:35:06
you can't expect to handle such fundamental financial details in the heat of the moment, without having a well thought and detailed strategy beforehand.... that seems a recipe for disaster ala NeoBee

Why in the world would you trust a website with your bitcoin in the first place? That's of course stupid

if someone's a fool, he's a fool, and you can't save him from loosing money, he'll loose it elsewhere anyways. actually, loosing money might be the only way for him to stop being a fool... it's a tuition fee ;)
