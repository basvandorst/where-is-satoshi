The problem is the first four letters BITC are too close to BITCH, and the system spits it out automatically.  Silly, but they need some kind of algo to reject near-to-profanity.  Yours is just a casualty in the war of the words, sad really.

Murder is a made-up crime, too.

Tongue in cheek jab at your oversimplification.


To the system under which you have made your money - its taxpayers - the other law abiding companies, etc.


Morality is a point of view. The line at which we draw right/wrong is an arbitrary expression of any given society.


Are the funds being moved between countries, states, nations, currencies?  Do these places have the same lines drawn regarding morality?  If not, an ethical question has been raised.  Money is never *simply* moved, its ripple effect correlates with its size.  But laws, justice, are not just about size, they are about creating a deterrent to a behavior which has the potential to be destabilizing to the economy as a whole. 
Without a stable government, historically, human beings have forgotten the absolute immorality of murder, rape, assault, theft and the other *more clear* moral questions.

Numbers are *just* numbers and words are *just* words right?  You are trying to mix these two worlds.  "Victim-less" is a disingenuous phrase to apply to the financial world.  
"Accountability" is a more appropriate term. Money laundering is an attempt to evade accountability after turning a profit, similar (but not exactly) like a "criminal" might evade "justice" after killing a "victim".

In that case you need to speak to someone who has the authority to override the automatic system, and that person then needs the motivation to heed your request based on reason/decency over not wanting to draw attention to his/her person.
