My wife says, " why you waste money, is a stupid scam" I say "no no no! Is BITCONNECT!"
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:31:34
Cfds are a scam
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:56:21
Well down to $4k, even $2k for a few years. I wouldn't give up on it until it goes under $1k.
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:34:32
Nah, I SODL'd some. Down to $7k pls so I can re-buy. Then up to $1m
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:37:12
$667,600 worth. Not bad.

Triangle break upside: [Apollo!](
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:48:08
We'll that'd be nice.
Buy we're breaking out of this descending triangle. And on the upside... so that's cool
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:15:46
Oh yes. It is an inevitability! Triangle break upside. [Neil Armstrong!](
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:18:01
It's broken the descending triangle. Buy buy buy !
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:12:04
Or Icarus?
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:51:23
Bull Run incoming. ��!
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:19:19
It broke the descending triangle. It will slowly become a bull run.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:50:26
But it did break the descending triangle, hmmmm?
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:20:15
Fukin fiat shill
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:56:30
That dip is still too expensive.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:08:32
Everyone's just waiting for it to hit $2k so they can go all in.
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:57:59
And it's in an open source glass bowl so you can see all the layers.
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:53:10
More time. It'll go down to $2k sometime in the next 6 months. Then up to $100k in a few years.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:06:59
It's an omen. BuyBuyBuy!
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:09:09
Yeah Bitcoin, go home. You live at 40,000 US Dollar street. I'll call you a cab.

He told me he's applied for astronaut training at spaceX.

Ooo, such malice.

 = SKYNET CONFIRMED!
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:39:10
What a bull comment. ��⤴️��
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:26:40
Oh it will, either in the next few months at ~$6k, or in the next few years at ~$2k, but it will start to climb back up. Then it will go through $10k again, then it will surge to $100k. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:23:27
As Elon said, why go up when we can go down??

Does lightning network count as batching? How has the number of btc per transaction changed?
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:15:51
Or they're promoting 42coin
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:52:00
Fiat won't cease to exist, it will just become less and less valuable. The value of Bitcoin will be compared to things like property, gold and the stock market.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:52:13






@_date: 2018-11-13 00:38:08
Yeah, didn't you hear? He enrolled in a spaceX astronaut training program. There's been some delay getting the rocket approved, but when it's all ready he's going to the moon!
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:13:21
Im waiting for the $2k before I buy back in. Another couple of months...
Then ��⬆️��
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:22:23
To the Moon!?
No, no, no! 
It's a Journey to the Centre of the Earth!
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:02:47
No, it's time to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:02:20
Just buy now. Then sell at $200k in 8 months, or a couple of years.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:55:50
Look at [the last 5 years.] ( Each time the price punches through another order of magnitude ($10, $100, $1k) the price surges then corrects.  
 Now the price is trending down, and it will slowly start to come back up untill it surges again to $100k. Maybe in 6 months, maybe in 3 years, then onwards to $1m.  
 This cycle might bottom out at $6k or $2k. If it goes lower than that we have problems, but it's a long way off that.  
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:37:03
Well cryptocurrency will be fully adopted by the state at some point, it hasn't been yet. Like any social technology, from religions to schools and universities, the state eventually takes it over and ruins it. It will happen to Bitcoin. That's when to sell and buy space exploration stocks.
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:53:31
No, it's true I tell you! 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:01:06
So a guaranteed 70% loss. Cool.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:16:32
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:36:43
Oh, it's leveling out. Then it will start to increase again, until it's over $10k again, then zoop, $100k. 3 months, or 3 years, idk but it's on track.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:41:40
[Yep] ( bitcoin is no longer the only cryptocurrency, welcome to the competitive market!
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:15:11
About $2k, see the [log chart]( When it went thru $1k the first time, it crashed down to $200. When it first went thru $100 it crashed back to $60 but when it went thru $10 it crashed back to $2. This is not unprecedented. Stick to your thesis, set a stop loss in case and chill the fuck out.
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:03:36
Maybe a Bitcoin would make a good Chinese New year present?
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:19:05


The new year will begin in 12 hours on New year's eve. Question is, what timezone are we using? UTC or US? Pacific or eastern?

Apples are about $3 a kilo, in season.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:01:28
I concur.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:01:05
Down to $2k, slowly, then back up to $5k by the end of the year. After that, at increase up to $200k before the next bubble pop.
