I mean, yea, I suppose?  I don't live in an area where that sort of thing is an issue.
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:55:08
Sure, and I can see that.  On the flip side of that, anyone who is almost never home and leaves lights and AC off is using next to no power and paying the same, and one could argue this person is being taken advantage of.  I would argue that neither is the case, but rather that both parties knowingly signed an agreement wherein the lessor pays for the electricity and charges the lessee a flat rate for it, and that the onus is on *both* parties to decide whether or not that's a reasonable rate.
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:46:44

I'm thinking in the event someone lives somewhere that the cost of electricity is rolled into rent, e.g. a dorm or some apartment complexes (especially near universities).
@_date: 2015-06-05 05:58:19
I mean, unless that's in the lease it's hardly valid.  And if it is, there should be a clause where you get a refund if you use a small amount.  This is why most places have you pay for your own electricity, even if they cover waste, water, and sewage (at least afaik most places do).
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:33:54

I think it largely depends on the people who are getting married.  I gave my friends bitcoin (paper wallet) for their wedding a couple months ago and they seemed completely fine with it, but part of that is that they were also moving to a much smaller place so giving them a *thing* felt like it would end up being redundant.  Cash is considered to be tacky, but gift cards not so much, so I likened it in concept to a gift card.  They were certainly amused by it if nothing else :)

Right, exactly!  But if I want to buy something from a friend, I give him cash, he gives me the thing, no transaction fee.  I'm just saying that if money transmission can be done without a middleman who's in it for profit, then why not?  I use a credit card almost every day, because it's convenient.  I accept that there are fees for that (though I don't usually see them unless I don't pay off the balance before interest happens), but I'd happily use an alternative that did not have said fees.

My thoughts exactly.  An increase in supply on exchanges without an equivalent increase in demand will necessarily cause price drops.  There are probably other factors at play though, and I have no concept of the volume of transactions bitpay et al are covering.

Sales tax is state by state, and the law on interstate ordering/shipping is a bit gray, so companies can get away with not paying sales tax (and thus not charging you for it) if they don't have offices in your state, or something to that effect.
Sales tax also varies from state to state, as does state income tax.  I can't remember off the top of my head, but I know there are places where you can benefit from living in one state and driving 10 minutes or so to another to do your shopping, such that the state you live in has no state-level income tax, and the state you shop in has no sales tax.  Pretty hilarious, really.

That said, owning does have its hidden expenses everywhere.  On the other hand, you *own* the place.  If we assume for simplicity that the value of the place does not change (obviously it will, but again, for simplicity), then as long as you're paying less in interest on your mortgage plus upkeep to keep the home's value exactly the same as when you bought it than you were paying in rent, I'd consider it a net gain.  Obviously that's *way* oversimplified, but...

Well, if people buying bitcoin for the purpose of spending it on something balances with companies receiving it and immediately selling it, then on the whole the few people who already hold spending it on those companies and not buying more would explain the drops...

@_date: 2014-08-03 13:19:03
Well, for now you're probably right.  This is not actually a bad thing, it just could become one if it plays out wrong.  The problem is that there's a bit of a chicken-egg problem.  Major retailers can't accept bitcoin directly if they can't use it to pay suppliers and bills.  If their suppliers don't accept bitcoin, then they need an easy way to convert bitcoin to fiat (USD in this case).
I hope to see as more businesses start accepting bitcoin that their suppliers might start accepting it as well, and so on, to the point where businesses that accept it don't *need* to convert it to fiat on receipt.  That said, this cannot happen overnight in the world we live in, as much as we wish it could.  Have patience, my son.

@_date: 2014-08-28 10:48:45
Well...so that introduces a whole new problem, right?  SMS, if done right, has some measure of easy crypto: the user doesn't know he/she has the secret, but can communicate securely with the network.  
Frankly the *ideal* solution is for each person "eligible" (I put that in quotes to emphasize that it's a nebulous term) to sign up with (in-person or via some otherwise trusted method) some service that will forget him/her as soon as it sends btc to the address the person signed up with.  The thing is: that's not feasible.  Like I said, if the cell networks are set up well there, SMS is a perfectly reasonable idea.  You would, however, want to make sure that users transfer their btc to a different account *eventually* because I don't think the cell networks use anything amazing -- I wanna say they do 64-bit symmetric key?  I could be way off base there, though...
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:33:57
True, but having both so that one can facilitate both types of transaction is tedious at best, and thus bitcoin can only benefit from greater ease of use in f2f transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:33:59
Ah, the classic gotcha of the internet.
Honestly, I've gotten the impression that many people don't realize that one can hold bitcoins without a service like coinbase et al.  So no, I did not read that as sarcastic.

@_date: 2014-11-30 01:01:19
To address your last question about recurring transactions:
The problem with that is that bitcoin uses "push" style payment.  Unlike a credit card where you give someone your card number and he "pulls" an amount, with bitcoin the recipient gives *you* an address and you "push" the amount.  As a result of this, recurring transactions would either need to be managed by a third party (where the user would have to store a set amount anyway) or by the users themselves.
I've contacted services like [Subbable]( and [Patreon]( in the past about accepting bitcoin, and while it would seem they're looking into it, it's not a trivial thing.  The best I can come up with off the top of my head is that I would have an account with one, let's say patreon, and I would refill that with bitcoin once in a while.  The service would then send the desired donations to where I've subscribed, either at a set day each month, an individual day for each sub, or whatever.
I think that could work, but it is admittedly a bit clunky.  Basically changetip but with recurring donation.
Feel free to comment if you have any other questions, I'll do my best to answer them!  I actually only learned a lot of this fairly recently when I joined the development team for Monero (a mostly similar cryptocurrency.

Well, the thing is, to do something like this on this scale is largely improbable to go well.  I'd love to see it go off without any issue, but I just can't see it happening.  Maybe I'm jaded from my time spent in the security industry ;)
I will say that, assuming use of cell phones is widespread enough in Dominica, this isn't the worst way to do it.  Assuming that the total amount is &lt; ~$50 US / person, it's probably not worth it to acquire a Dominica phone number for the sake of scamming, so encryption of SMS is really the largest attack vector I can imagine.  The largest issue, really, is that it will be *incredibly* difficult to detect an attack, unless it's a large enough attack that more than a reasonable "oops" amount of people chime up and say they didn't get their btc.

Yea, that's what I thought.  I don't see the downside to businesses using them (for now) to accept bitcoin...I got the impression was advocating for bitpay over coinbase for businesses, but as far as I can tell other than the fees there's no difference on that end.  That said, I can understand an argument against a service like coinbase becoming a centralized all-in-one bitcoin shop...but for now, I don't personally have a problem with it.  It's been easy to use for me so far, and that's something we need for bitcoin to go mainstream.

You're perfectly welcome to your opinion, so don't think I care about what you've posted here, but...I am a bit confused about your username in light of your posts.

...isn't the fee for using a debit card even worse for the consumer?  I personally do not have one, as an atm card and credit card serve the same purpose for me, but I was under the impression that while merchants pay the CC fee, card holders pay the debit fee, no?
And there doesn't *have* to be a middleman in bitcoin transactions, that's just how a lot of merchants have set it up.  Unless you count the blockchain verifying the transaction as a middleman, but I'd call that more of a notary.
Anyway, the point you made about bitpay/coinbase/whatever middlemen there are is a valid one.  In that case, I'm not actually sure how the fees there would compare with merchant CC fees, so I can't comment on that.  I will say though that companies accepting bitcoin (whether through a third party or otherwise) should have an easier time doing business internationally.  Maybe not right now, when regulations are still being set up, but once things stabilize, btc will be an easy way to convert currencies.  A company using the Euro could sell me something without having to go through several middlemen (me-&gt;US bank-&gt;Currency exchange-&gt;EU bank, though that may be simpler if using an international bank, I don't do business internationally so I don't know how that's set up).  I'm not saying that's the case, and you're free to correct me if I'm woefully misinformed on how international currency exchange works!  At this point in time, I only have ~10mBTC to my name, but when the time comes that I have more (or make plans to have more) I will put the time into properly researching these topics.  For now, you have my general impression, and I will humbly accept any knowledge you would like to confer onto me.

Just to offer my two cents from a male perspective: while obviously lewd or suggestive behavior is uncalled for, the incredulity does not surprise me.  I can't say that I'd blame someone for seeing a woman at such a convention who is there out of interest as a potential romantic interest, because unfortunately the ratio of women to men who share such interests is rather low.  That said, professional demeanor is appropriate.
On a side note, I need to get some bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:55:08
Now, now...it's not necessarily *that* they charge, it's more about the amount.  Credit card companies charge as much as they can get away with, which is fine and their prerogative, but if a similar (and some would argue better, I'm probably one of them) alternative such as bitcoin exists that's cheaper, I'm all for it.

Like I said, I totally see your side of the argument, but I also see the other side.  I'm not even fully disagreeing with you, I'm just trying to play devil's advocate as best as I can.  Apparently that's not very well &gt;_&gt;
I guess my stance is that if you want to change the need for regulation and you can't convince someone like me who understands your argument then you'll have trouble convincing those who are die-hard for regulation, ya know?
Personally I think a little bit of mandatory 3rd-party auditing at least could be a good thing.  Obviously that would be corruptible, but what isn't?  Maybe all the licensing requirements aren't necessary, but I still like the idea of auditing.  If an exchange isn't open to a 3rd party auditing it, I probably won't trust it, if that makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:10:48
Yes, and as it turns out the US government as sovereignty over its soil and has the right to regulate such exchanges that operate within it.
We can speak about "rights" until we're blue in the face, and I'm not here to say what rights one does and does not have, but if the US wants to regulate an exchange that operates on US soil and exchanges something for US dollars, then I'd say that's its prerogative.  I don't always agree with what the US government does, and in fact in a lot of cases I think what they do feels extra-legal, or even is, but in this case I'd say it's well within its rights.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:40:04
I actually understand your arguments in this post, and can agree with most of them to a point, but...there is another side to the debate.  I completely agree with you when it comes to a transaction between you and someone else in BTC alone.  The problem with taking that attitude with an exchange is that the assumption is that you're exchanging BTC for fiat, namely USD.  Just like you wouldn't want the government to go and print $50t and give it out to whomever, I wouldn't want an exchange to cause the BTC-USD exchange rate to tank because everyone there willingly entered into that arrangement.
I certainly agree with you that personal responsibility comes into play, but in this case more parties can be affected than just those who entered into the original contract, and thus I can see a justification for some regulation.  You gave an example below of "why not ban alcohol then?" and I gave that some thought.  Well, we *do* regulate alcohol.  If you are found using alcohol irresponsibly (driving drunk, drunk in public, etc) then there are consequences associated with that.  Sure, you don't need a "license" to purchase alcohol, but it's still regulated.  The only reason an exchange would need a license is because without auditing it would be difficult (like in the case with MtGox) to detect insolvency before it's too late to wind things down in a less harmful manner.  The license is essentially your exchange paying the cost of that auditing.
I won't sit here and say that auditing/regulation/licensing *works*.  Hell no.  But to say that there is no argument to be made in favor of it is something I disagree with.
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:06:23

Well now you're contradicting yourself.  You said elsewhere that driving licenses are okay because you're using public roads and putting others at risk, but you're okay with not regulating the use of alcohol in some contexts (e.g. driving)?
Also, you're absolutely correct, the US government *does* maintain a monopoly over USD.  Thus they maintain a monopoly over regulation on how it can be used, like it or not.  If you want to argue against taxation or any other thing on the basis that it's USD-only, fine.  That makes sense.  But you can't say that the US government has a monopoly on USD and then turn around and say how it can and can't enforce that monopoly.  If you don't like it, don't use it.  And again, if you want to say that you can't because taxes, fine!  That's a valid (though still debatable) argument.

I'm far from an expert on computer security, I just happen to have some experience in that sector.
I would say that *in general* SMS is okay for this use (though I would personally prefer to limit its use to 2-factor auth).  That said, there's a large difference between "what are the odds an arbitrary person's private key will be intercepted, understood, and stolen if sent via SMS?" and "how likely is that if we announce that a bunch of them will be distributed via SMS in a relatively-small geographic area?"
Really it depends on how much is distributed and how strict laws in Dominica are on cellular interception.  Here in the US it's a felony, so more than likely not worth a small handful of BTC to a potential attacker, but if identification of the attacker is unlikely in a place like Dominica and there's a large enough amount of BTC being distributed, I can see it as an issue.
Just my two bits!  Like I said, I appreciate the idea!  :D

I don't (and don't want to, really) follow the discussion at hand, but once in a while I'll read a post about it so I'm at least somewhat informed.  Reading through your comment, one thing stuck out at me: does it really take that much RAM to run a node?!  I can't see why a block size increase causes that large of a RAM usage increase, but I don't know much about the internals.  I know it wouldn't do the same in Monero, unless I'm missing something totally obvious...
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:56:07
Well...in my experience minimum specs as listed there are rarely mandatory, but rather "if you have less than this and have issues or things are slow, that's probably why".  That having been said, I'm still not sure why increasing the block size means increasing the RAM footprint by so much.

But the utxo set shouldn't have to live in RAM...that's what databases are for.  That said, I'm not really sure how block size affects that either...I mean, long term, sure, as I can see it accelerating growth, but if that's the case then utxo set growth should already be growing, meaning this problem will happen anyway.
I'm not convinced that the client/daemon needs to use as much memory as it does, and I don't see how increasing the block size should have such a great effect on this memory footprint.  Perhaps I'm making too many assumptions about the code's efficiency/optimization?

I mean...most passwords (sure you can randomly generate better, but we're assuming *chosen* passwords) are mostly alphanumeric.  Giving a bit of room for random punctuation, we're talking a set of...45 if I'm generous, for most people?  Now, assuming you choose somewhat randomly four words from a set of 10,000, repetition allowed, then the question is how many characters from the previous set are as strong?  In this case, that would be [roughly equivalent]( to a 9-10 char password from the other set.
Obviously these numbers aren't perfect.  Most chosen passwords are a majority of lower-case English letters, but also most passwords chosen as phrases use far more common words, reducing the size of that set.
I don't know if I had a point to begin with or was just curious how the math works out on this with arbitrary parameters...but there it is, I suppose.

1MB limit * 144 blocks/day * 7 days/week ~= almost 1GB.  52GB/year is *tiny* in the grand scheme of things.  Absolutely tiny.  You can find a good 1TB hard drive for under $100 and that'll last almost 20 years.
I think scaling the block size limit over time is a perfectly reasonable proposition as long as cost of storage drops at a faster rate (which it almost certainly will with an reasonable block size change proposal).
Side note: to your comment below saying if you don't run a full node you're not part of the network...well, you're not *wrong*, but if we can agree that keeping a 1MB limit will mean that an increasingly small subset of my transactions can be on-chain as adoption increases, well, I'd rather have my private keys than the whole chain any day.

I haven't checked out unfilter yet, what's it about/how is it?

I checked out the blogger example...is it just me, or is this just javascript?  NoScript is your enemy in that case, I'm afraid.

You'll want to make sure you make links one-time use, or perhaps expire after an hour if they've been accessed.  A user who misses the window can use a form to get another window, say, twice, just in case, and then any cases where someone legitimately had internet failure 3 times (my parents *just* got DSL...some people have complete shit internet) can be resolved with a support ticket.
This way, although people will pirate your videos perhaps, they won't be able to just link to your site and eat up your bandwidth all the while getting your content without purchase.  You could also consider a unique download link that is one-time use, and someone can get up to 5 total for a purchase (again, with a support ticket system, shit happens) like Louis C. K. did with his stand-up specials.

I said this in another thread, only to be corrected that all the verify part does is have the bot post a comment to publicly verify the tip.  And so I pay it forward.

Lol, I'm just wishing I had bought a few coins like 5 months ago.  Not even for the price increase, but because I had money then...

You're going to ~~nickel and~~ dime bitcointip bot to death!

I got a tip on here for $1 about 4 months ago that's now worth a little over $6 if the bot is to be trusted, I can't complain...

As you said at the end of your comment, there is an inherent chicken-egg problem.  Using bitcoin for transactions is not without risk, true, but if nobody uses it for transactions then it will fail.  Those who accept the risk are betting on its future success, and likely know very well how risky it really can be.
That said, businesses take on risks all the time.  It's part of doing business.  For example, spending tens of millions developing and advertising a triple-A video game that may only earn back half of that.  Almost no facet of business is without some sort of risk, even if you just consider "what if that person would have paid more for my product and I lost money that way?" and other smaller risks.
Basically what I'm getting at is that yes, using bitcoin is risky, but those businesses that accept it (most, anyway) probably don't do a large % of their business in it, and if that becomes the case for them it will be a sign that accepting bitcoin was in fact a good idea.  If not, it's (hopefully) not a fatal blow to the business.

Note to self to add myself to this when I get home from the holidays.  I too recently switched to ting.  Quite good.

A part of me wants to interpret that as "24 bitcoins in sales" but I feel that can't be true.  That would be amazing for you, but 24 transactions is still pretty cool!
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:50:12
The nights 7-11 surprises me, as I would expect this to be a result of trying to get people to use more power during non-peak hours to lower peak demand.  I could be way off-base though...
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:21:05
That's still pretty amazing.

Right now it is.  3 years ago it wasn't for those ranges and 3 years from now it won't be.  You can make a linear approximation at any point, as with any function.

Seriously, when that shit happened I wasn't aware it was a thing and just thought some Majora's Mask shit was going down.  It was awesome.

I volunteer!  Lol, I was tipped ~$1 about 4 months ago.  To see it worth $6 or $7 now is mind boggling (and depressing, as I had money I could have invested then).

You may be right.  All I know is I hate paywalls... &gt;_&gt;

It's almost like bitcoin is a [fiat currency](
The author seems to dislike bitcoin because of its origins and lack of institutional support, but speaks as though he dislikes is because it is a fiat currency, which would be outright hypocrisy if he uses USD, Euro, etc.

That shit was just stupid on amazon's part.  Why invite the ire of someone with an audience?  I guess I don't know just how large said audience is, but apparently decent since you know that.

List the current USD value of the bitcoins on the bill of sale as the sale price?

I knew that last bit.  I worked for a gov't contractor doing software vulnerability research for a year so that would be rather relevant to me...

haha, thanks.  I got randomly tipped ~$1 about 4 months ago...now that $1 is worth ~$7 or more.  bitcoin is weird.  I like it, and wish I had more, but...idk, a part of me feels like the growth isn't sustainable, but people have been saying that since it hit $.50 etc.
