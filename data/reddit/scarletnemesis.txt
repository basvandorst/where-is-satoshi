Yeah but it looks like it's terribly bad for the knees.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:19:31
interesting, thanks for the in depth response!

I have read the wiki and explored mining in general. I still was wondering about this hypothetical though.

i didn't intend to troll in the slightest. apologies if my post came off that way

does running a full node provide any other benefits/incentives to the individual hosting it?
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:13:27
Interesting. Thank you for the examples. It helps me understand more clearly than before. I appreciate your effort in providing greater clarity!

Ok, so altruism is the real motivator. Thanks for the clarity, guess i'm going to join up finally.

yeah, i've been using nicehashminer for a while now but always backed off from running a full bitcoin core node cuz i wasn't always sure about it even after reading alot about it. I guess all I really needed to do was just talk to someone about it to figure out if i wanted to do it or not.
Edit: Proof I'm doing it. [Print Screen]( Thanks again @_date: 2018-07-23 18:32:27
Yeah I'm currently waiting for the client to fully synchronize before I start focusing on opening up port 8333 for good.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:25:01
I understand that its largely a selfish act. I'm choosing to focus on the altruistic factor however, as justification for running a full node. I guess I should've worded that more clearly.
