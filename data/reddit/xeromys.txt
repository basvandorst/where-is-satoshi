you obviously have not lived long enough....no matter how bad it is, it can always get worse. Not saying it will, just saying be grateful.

You're good. Grow a thicker skin and move on. Remember a politician thinks the world loves them when only 50% of voters hate their guts. Small consolation: I almost got lynched at the local pub one night trying to talk to some gloom and doom end-of-worlders about bitcoin in an attempt to cheer them up.

i dont think so. He's cracked the biggest problem: implementing scarcity. Hard act to follow... and as stated below: there is a community now working on it, his baby has a life of it's own now. If I were him, I would be kicking back and enjoying the show.

Irony: Satoshi's need for anonymity, would  have made it impossible to publish in a peer reviewed journal anyway, if I am not mistaken

Excellent post. I appreciate the time, effort and eloquence of your article.  
The problem Bitcoin solves, in a nutshell, is the implementation of 'scarcity' , 
a true break through in computer science in my opinion.

Someone please correct me if i am wrong:
1) % wise: Sweet fuck all.
2) Who cares what they use it for? I don't. But more and more things all the time. Porno and drugs are just early adopters and will help sort out the glitches for the rest of us
3) Not gonna happen -- wonder all you like.

I dont intend to sound mean but it is totally your responsibility and your call. Assuming everyone is trustworthy, including yourself: No one can give you the advice you seek because no one has a crystal ball and you are the only person walking in your shoes. It is your call and yours alone. I wish you the best.
