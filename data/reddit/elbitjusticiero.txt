Well, it *is* a simple PowerPoint. The information it contains is the most basic and readily available about the subject. Why would you expect people to be impressed?

Do you know for a fact that his lawyers *didn't* bring it up? Have you seen the legal proceedings? Not being charged is a thing, not saying anything about it in court even when you're not being tried for it is a different thing.

Five what? 


So he *was* charged?

This is not accurate either. Entrapment is when the action of the officer makes you commit a crime *that you wouldn't have committed otherwise*. A variety of models are possible.

On the contrary, it can be *used* to *show* that what you present as *not* entrapment sometimes can actually be: 


Well... it *can* be entrapment, clearly! It all depends on the hows and whys of the situation. Ulbricht's case (according to what people have said in this thread, which is admittedly not any measure of truth of accuracy) may fall squarely into the definition if the investigators purposefully made him think his life was in danger whereas *he would never have tried to hire a hitman if that hadn't been the case.*

I claimed the exact opposite. 


The definition you quoted is just the formalized version of what I wrote.

I'm not defending Ulbricht, and I've let it show that I don't know anything about this case except what people are saying in this thread, so I couldn't even if I wanted to. ;) I'm just saying that a blanket statement like 


is definitely wrong. 


This is very dangerous in a society with checks and balances. The police can't "just happen to be" the cause for a crime. **If this scenario was true**, Ulbricht wouldn't have ordered the hit without the police intervening, so the police's intervention actually *caused* the crime! This is what's "so wrong" with entrapment. Judges sentence people for committing crimes, not for "being the kind of people who would committ a crime if the police forced them to". 


This is dangerous too, because you're essentially saying that if you want to catch a guy who committed a crime, it's OK to make him commit *a different, worse crime* to put him in jail. That's... kind of insane, really. 
EDIT: I'll leave aside the fact that sneaking an edit into your comment without acknowledging it is poor form and go straight to the silliness of it: 


Oh yeah? We must be using different dictionaries.
