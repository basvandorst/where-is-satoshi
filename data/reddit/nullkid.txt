They won't take mine. It's bunk. Plus i get an automated call from my banks fraud department half the time.

Also... I am positive I formatted a hd that I used to mine with. Sad days.
Congrats btw!

Is it easier to buy bitcoin these days? I was going to buy a handful right before the first big boom but it was foreign to me and a little more complicated for me to get them.
What's the going rate? It's been awhile since I've read up on it. Not one of those people looking to make money off it.

I bet the crazy part is.... Is that the answer is probably a simple one that the people are over analyzing but im still too dumb for it.

Man, do I ever feel you. 2 years ago, when I found out about it, I believe it was under 40 a coin. Tried to talk my SO into it, she could not fathom the idea, no matter how complicated or dumbed down I made it. I started my attempt at mining and wasn't getting anything out of it with my rig.
Fast foward a year, wow hunnie, look- btc is worth over 100 bucks, think of the money I would have made. We should invest now.. "It's too expensive now," even though I have some expendable cash at the time.
2 years later, 80k in hospital bills(hers), a non working car, and nothing in savings due to her being off work..
My balls hurt when I think about it.
Don't get me wrong here, not blaming anything on her but man i should've listened to myself, even if i didn't ride the wave long.

This is what caught my eye in the beginning, some of the forums I fancy had a few guys talking about their mining ops(botnets) and I started reading about it- now the stories are turning out to be as juicy as Eve. Theft, market control, mining ops, scams, and 10,000 dollar pizzas. I love it.
Hopefully it doesn't end in one big scam :D the tears would be glorious, hahaha.

Nobody gets busted they said. It's cool they said, both times I was going to dive into silk road this happens. Last time it was the asian kid who kept logs for everything. I'll continue to pass on this and be jealous of everyone who gets away with it.

I tried, it was so much hassle. It's easy now.. But not 15 a coin anymore.

I wish my damn bank would speed up my online account so I can start buying.
I wanted to buy back when they were 30 or so a coin but it was such a pain in the ass(new and scary.) I wanna punch myself in the face. I knew it was going ti get big.

Sadly, I'm from US and it seems like you have to jump through so many hoops just to get started. 
I'm currently waiting on my bank to fix my online account, which I've only used once or twice. I have been waiting about 2 weeks for them to do their freaking job, meanwhile btc hits 1k. I'm not loosing money but I sure do feel like it. I'm not in it for the investment, either- I just want to grab a nice chunk and wait for it to become useful, it's like eating glass watching the price go up though.
