And can't we start a small game here then? We just need ten people. 
And I also wanted to set this up to provide an opportunity for players, where one player is guaranteed to win, and another is guaranteed to get back his money. On rulette or Hi Lo games you will lose everything eventually even if you have won before.
Also the house price is quite fair I think, on other sites you pay a %, here it is a fixed amount, and it stays the same even if there are more players and more bets.

BITCOIN IS AWESOME!

So the plan is that everyone works for them until they receive the first payment, then quits. But since lots of people do this they provide enough for them to continue their "business".

I checked some jobs, and received e-mail from eployers.
Most monthly salaries range from 30 mBTC to 9 mBTC, but those are reserved for only the best. Average is 1 mBTC to 0.3 mBTC.
So the maximum salary I can get is 10 dollars per month. Yay!

Ah I didn't meant specifically you. I meant the reddit community.
Lot's of people use reddit. Probably some out there would play with me.

I tried that, it said jobs available: 0.
Potential jobs: 56.
There is no information how can I get jobs, or get to the level what the potential jobs require.
Also lots of people said that bitvisitor is good. Yet they always halve the income, and they only send when I reached 60 bits.
60 bits! 0.12 dollars.

Maybe I am raged a bit, sorry. But it's a bit annoyoing scam sites get a way greater visibility for bitcoin. Nearly every google search shows sites like this.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:52:58
yes that's the point
it's pathetic.
All the jobs for bitcoin are closed for me, I beginning to think that the others on the site are just for show.
Any other site only needs bitcoin developers, researchers, or PHP scripts. And they also pay 1 or 2 dollars/works
Basically you don't work for free, but the maximum you can earn with bitcoin related jobs is 10 to 0.01 dollars.

thanks but this is a bit complicated to me, this looks way too complex to implement in a year. I don't know how o even start.
What If I write the code wrong and the payment is lost, and the customer gets nothing?
I thought that the guarantee for a fair game would depend on trust.
You see if on the first few play I would steal the money nobody would play my game. And it would lose its purpose.
Also I am criminally liable if I do such a thing.
I thought I just start this thing as a hobby without much investment (beside the randomizer and my wallet API).
