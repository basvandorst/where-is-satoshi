It means people are trying to use the network but cant.

To me I sort of agree. I mean they are making the advantage why shouldnt they take advantage of it. I am a blue collar worker getting paid fuck all so its not like I have a bias. But I can see why he thinks that way. Its a law I never really agreed with even though it doesn't suit me.

Oh the humanity. A company trying to make money. Everyone has an investment strategy. Everyone wants to make money including you. It makes the west go around you know. 
Since you know know Coinbase will shit on BTC in January what is your next step? Whine about it or work out how to take advantage of it. If ypu have smarts it will be the second option. But hey ypur free to buy morw BTC and whine when January hits.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:38:21
Your better off with Bitcoin cash. It will be implmented into Bitcoin atms with the new update, you can buy it for cash in January 2018 (this is very important), it is next coin onto coinbase, it is quick to transfer and the fees are next to nothing. The other upcoming coin is Ripple. Supported by companys like Google, super quick to transfer and cheap as chips. 
So you know I do have investments in both coins so I maybe considered to be shilling. But I bought those coins because I think they are the next coin that will puch crypto currencies forward. So I am not just giving you this advice I am putting my money where my mouth is. I am not just trying to push the price of these coins up I want tgem to succeed for the sake of crypto currancies in general. I would he happy with 10%a year.

Thats true, hes not. But at least hes not pretending to be something he is not. He can come across as a bit different but I think if you knew him he would be less defensive and more neutral.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:11
Yeah. Stupid shills. Btc is amazing just check out the 215k unconfirmed transactions. No one else even comes close to our unconfirmed transactions. Maybe when thry hit 215k unconfirmed transactions they can say how amazing they are.

Hey man I am trying to send the doge but it wont go through. It keeps saying invalid address through shapeshift but I think it might be the low amount. I will do it asap just need to work out how to do it. I was going to.donit through my coinspot acc but they have holted putting in funds.
I will do it just need to work it out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:40:47
Bro calm down. Get over it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:11:16
Thats cool. Send me the wallet and ill send the 296 doge coin. Do I need to buy a little more for the transfer??
Coinspot has blocked deposits do i will shapeshift 296 to your wallet. Just send me tge address when your ready. 
A pixilated picture might even be better suited. It might look more authentic. Then in 50 years your grandkids will see it and think that was the picture quality we had today.

In that case no one does anything for anyone ever. People just do charity work to cease boredom. People only feed the hungry to cease their boredom. People give money to make themselves feel good.
Do you think about what your saying?

Everyone sells your data. If you delete everyone that sells your data you wont have anywhere to go. Get over it.

Just watch the podcasts, their only a few minutes each.
@_date: 2019-03-04 01:12:32
I though it said Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2019-03-05 03:05:22
Yeah, why does everything in crypto have to be exaggerated.

Its not a scam coin but it is competition to Bitcoin. I am assuming your Bitcoin will return to the wallet you sent it from.

Decent article, worth reading!
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:36:34
Bullshit. I have watched both but am only a dew hours into the second one.
They didnt dodge the questions, they answered everyone.
@_date: 2019-03-10 00:27:26
How would you expect one person to know everything that happens on Twitter. Maybe the big stuff but they cant know the background of every tweet. I think they answered to the best of their ability on most questions. They sort of admitted they are Liberal leaning and that is effecting their rule making process which I think they now realise and will look into. I think they didn't realise how much left lean they had and maybe will go back and try to fix it.
The amount of text they would have read and follow to make correct decisions on their own is staggering and automation makes mistakes. Everyone wanted them to just admit they were wrong with everything. They explained their process for making decisions and realise it needs work. They admitted to mistakes. They admit they cant track everything and need new processes in the future. I would like to see most people run a global company in so many countries better. You would probably be banned from half the world by now.
Down votes begin!
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:54:28
No you wont. 
But I will give you the 100 doge back if you do.

Worth the watch

Dont worry that guy has been trolling every Samsung s10 thread about crypto. Probably an Apple supporter but hurt.
@_date: 2019-02-26 01:12:04
Everyone is going to downvote me but a backup is needed. It cant be if you lose your 1 key all your money is gone. People are lazy and wont back it up or store a spare copy. You cant compete with banks. Banks are easy, put your money in a bank if you lose your card go get a new one. Crypto if you lose your key good bye money. You think the average Joe is going to accept that.
@_date: 2019-04-29 08:58:07
How do we do that with bitcoin?

If its money you can lose who cares
@_date: 2019-01-25 03:03:27
It depends what your looking for. If you just want to buy and hold I think coinspot is very good. Good selection of coins and supports airdrops.
If your looking to trade though I would suggest buying something cheap to transfer on coinspot and sending it to Binance.
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:17:31
Actually its not. Your truth might hurt someone is not an argument and it took over 6 minutes just to get to that  zzzzZzzZzzZZ.

@_date: 2019-05-08 06:21:05
Cant they actually track the bitcoin these days and lockdown the wallets. I know they cant get it back but at least it will not be worth while stealing from exchanges anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:49:10
In other words, Yes!
