Go all in now

to check the address you sent the money too, you can find that in the wallet you sent from.
 If your GF doesn't see it in her wallet ...she or you entered the wrong address whilst sending the 0.1 -then your funds are as good as gone.  
This is a lesson in actually being conscious of your actions.

Judging by your sentance making skills you probably played a bitcoin Mining game on miniclip or newgrounds,  if not good luck.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:54:24
Localbitcoins is usually best in the UK

Depends on how you feel about your seed words on a device that's connected to the internet - if it doesn't bother you then carry on, however the smart thing to do is to get a hardware wallet.

"Analysts"��... $7k? LMAO they wish they could buy for that.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:26:03
Keeping 2k in fiat is dangerous it will loose it's purchase power so you better go all into Bitcoin sooner than later... Imagine putting in 2k when you first heard of Bitcoin, yeah? Now go all in now!
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:11:44
I'm very sure those who have bitcoin anyway are still buying when they can, so you should too.
@_date: 2019-07-18 08:50:14
Smart money dumb asf, it was obvious Bitcoin was king from the beginning.

Bitcoin trades over 10bln daily. You wouldnt see 10bln from your business. Dont use it if youre scared - youre clearly not worthy.
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:06:50
So your initial response to the opening question was "Duh" while looking for nice people makes you an idiot. Welcome to the internet. Good luck looking for nice - you wet tissue.

Whatever you wish to "cash out" on will accept bitcoin as payment just like if youd used cash - but in the next 1-3 years just "cash out" your bitcoins on the many aldready existing exchanges for fiat.

The post office used to say email is useless. The brick and mortar stores said internet shopping will never work. The taxi firms said people would never trust an app. Blockbuster turned down buying Netflix because it wont catch on... Now what was that about Bitcoin?��
@_date: 2019-09-07 23:08:42
Great HW wallet! ... but This the same dude 2 years ago telling people to get into cloudmining and bitconnect so i dont support this clout chaser
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:24:51
There was no real emphasis on blame, rather a story of betrayal that included Bitcoin.
