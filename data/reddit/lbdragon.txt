Better go find all those shirts of men with no shirts on or Calvin Klein advertisements and tear them down because they make men into sexualized objects for women to....oooh Double Standard, the argument's falling apart...

And I love how you're down voting everyone who doesn't agree with you...go back to Tumblr, fatty.

I just signed up and they won't even let me use the account unless I activate two-factor with a cellphone text message...
...it's starting to get annoying that the default is a cellphone text message instead of phone call to either a LAN line or a cell, which are both more abundant and reliable than text messages.

What? He's smart enough to know there are mentally unstable women-warriors who dig for the slightest inkling of something to complain about to forcefully mold society to their own visions, at the costs of non-harmful tee-shirts and video games?
He can be as ignorant of their stupidity as much as he pleases since it's something no one should actually have to worry over on a daily basis, if at all...his bondage shirt was NOT degrading to woman any more than a tee-shirt with a male gimp would be degrading to men would be: which is zero. They just like picking fights like PETA does to garner attention to their 'cause'.

Because I cry when 90000 women are calling me names over a fucking SHIRT after I spent and entire decade planning on how to further humanity...
No, he was told he could lose his job after losing years of his life for the greater good because bitches are bitches and won't shut up.

People who don't...it's not required to be a person, and if I can contact everyone through email or IM why do I need a phone...? (Haven't had my own phone for the past 3 years now)
And having to get text messages to unlock or buy coin is flat out ANNOYING which is why I took all my coin out of CB.

*He-Man is a DIRECT assault on the male figure and these women should be ASHAMED of showing a sexually attractive and empowered man on her shirt in public!*
This is literally the argument they make...and it really doesn't hold up when you flip the gender because most men simply don't give a two fucks about their body types.
