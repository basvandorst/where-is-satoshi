I tip if it was good service or I order a substantial amount, I don’t think I, the customer, should have to pay the employee the extra dollar for the 10  seconds they spent walking a basket of fries or a beer half way across a room.  
I would gladly pay + 15% across the board for food if they would get rid of this horrid tip system.

I’ve been berated by friends for not leaving tips. Seriously if you say you don’t believe in tipping around here you’ll get called and asshole cheapskate who shouldn’t eat out if you can’t afford to tip. 10%~ is pretty low. Most people say 15-20%. (Oregon here)

You seem to be a troll, as if you know I am “worrying about nonsense”. And you comment about my situation is arrogant and shallow AF. I have an education, I like my jobs, and I have nothing to worry about in my situation. I’m a young hard worker that lives with my girlfriend In a house, and make more the. Enough to pay my bills.

I'm seriously considering investing in one of these. They are 3500$, there are a few around but 50+ miles away, and I live in a college town(Oregon) with lots of foreign students. every year same time the banks are over run with students having to open accounts so they can actually have fiat to spend.

Cash advances often have very high interest rates where as you can get 0% interest for Xmonths with credit.
