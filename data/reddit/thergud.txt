Even if he ignores the points you made, no one is demanding services without paying people. These folks don't have their heads on correctly.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:12:49
Then stop fucking talking about it.

I'm American. They were specifically talking about Canada since they are Canadian. You don't know shit about their healthcare system so shut the fuck up.

And you couldn't use your critical thinking skills to determine they might not be German? Goddamn.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:02:56
Because the people you are arguing with live in Canada and use the fucking system there. They may have taxes out the ass but they DO NOT get billed for receiving care. You live half a world away and think you know better than them about their fucking system.

Because you're not a centrist. You're whole comment history is filled with identity politics.

I live in Tennessee and I pay for just as many Trump voter's wellfare checks as "alt-left terries" if not more. The problem is people like you who let those in charge divide and dis-empower the people.

You don't have a right to pay for roads. You pay for roads because you have to if you live in any type of contemporary society. 
He wasn't talking fire insurance he was talking fire department as a service. Which you also pay for without choice if you live in any society worth living in today.

If you held BTC, during the fork, on Bittrex you have BCC there.

It should be noted that it will eventually happen and the difficulty will be adjusted then. After that, it will probably (maybe) go much faster.

What logic are you following here? Wants people to shut up about thing! Post about thing to create noise about said thing!

"Pff. I don't think you have a fucking clue. Do you think the bills magically disappear because of universal healthcare." 
You said that as a reply to someone who said they are Canadian and don't get bills in the mail. You're a moron.

How do you have half a mil in BTC but aren't smart enough to talk to an accountant? 
*A month ago you were asking how to buy BTC and now you're saying you have half a mil. OK JB.
