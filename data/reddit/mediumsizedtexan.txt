Economists see money creation as a tax on the entire population, charged via inflation as a result of money value going down.

Replace ???? with &lt; 21000000. The market will fluctuate WILDLY because massive bitcoins are brought into and taken out if market at different lifespans. For example, if you own several bitcoins right now, you’ll be a market mover in the future. Bitcoin owners from the past are market movers now. In summary though, patience will pay off.

Who defines what a missing coin is? What if it comes back into circulation? Take gold for example, there’s tons of missing gold. This missing gold is priced into the price of gold as best as it can. If a whole bunch of gold is found and enters the market the price will react accordingly and the market cap will be calculated once more. My point is that total market cap is still the best indicator for overall size of the market and is not misleading anyone.
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:25:47
Market cap is an economics and investing term. Wether people understand it or not is not really a problem. It’s a measure some people use, and others don’t. Take a company... not all stock is floating. Some is ‘trapped’ in vesting or haven’t even been issued. Some people buy the stock purely because they like the product and never even took a look at the market cap. This is all factored in! Just the fact that we’re talking about it means the market is reacting and learning to this information.

Agreed. But this is passed on to consumers in the form of inflation. It’s steady and unnoticeable day to day. It’s a slow and steady crawl to worthlessness. This will help gold and bitcoin long term, but no global implosion.
@_date: 2019-04-13 05:08:53
What’s fake? The price prediction is literally an assumption. Fake implies prior facts. Geez man provide something here

Mining was barely profitable back in the day. But it paid off in the long run. Smart miners are accumulating for expectations of long term price growth.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:23:51
Nah that was 14 years ago.
If market players don't understand the market, that's the nature of that specific market. I'm not defending bitcoin, nor promoting it, just explaining to you how a market works. Your opinion forms a part of it, just like mine does. The collective opinion of all of us values one of these ghost coins at $5k. If it goes up, the collective whole values it more. If it goes down, then the market is clearly placing a lower value on it. It just is, and market cap is just another indicator that points towards this understanding.
Read up on this guy. Great research there: [
The strong form of his research "claims that prices instantly reflect even hidden "insider" information." Whales, you and millions of others are playing at this game. Some know more, some know less, and the market cap is a nice indicator of the overall size of this market :)
Happy reading! And thank you for the discussion kind stranger.

FUTURES. Nothing wrong with letting people speculate. Calm your tits. Regardless, more awareness is good :)
@_date: 2019-04-27 00:31:49
Market cap is a calculation, not a driver. Missing coins is already factored into the price. Market cap is still a true calculation.
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:31:18
What will never work?
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:21:59
Not the case. The price already reflects this. It’s priced in.
Edit: further explanation. The unit price of bitcoin already takes this into consideration. Volume is also an important metric you should all take a look at.
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:08:07
It can't be calculated based on circulating supply. That's the entire point. No one knows the circulating supply, or supply that's in circulable condition (not lost). Market cap is still an accurate measurement of all known information available. I think what you're looking for is volume.
Why are we arguing this? There is no 'should be' here. This is how it's done. It's up to you to decide how to digest these measurements.

Unless you’re heavily invested with mining equipment. Might as well use it and run some depreciation losses against it.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:07:01
And you’re making assumptions that they don’t. We are both the market, and so are millions of others all around the world. Grasp your head around the insignificance of one single opinion, but instead the collective and average opinion all reacting under the same information that’s available (some more easily accessible, and some less so). Have a good day sir and good luck :)
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:10:16
Might not make sense to you, but it does to the collective millions as a whole. The fact that some players can manipulate it is all baked in. Some people are afraid of this, and therefore drop out, deflating the price.

There's terms for that too! Alpha and Beta. Bitcoin is volative to small amounts of new money. This is still a true market.

Market cap has plenty of meaning and it shows overall value quite well actually. People that hold bitcoin, as well as people that don't, value one of these scarce digital items at $5500 a pop. If more were available, they're probably we worth less. If less were available, they're probably be worth more. The number of people participating in valuing this currency also plays a huge role. The more popular it is, the more people are willing to buy it, increasing its value. Those that hold bitcoin and don't want to sell theirs when value increases are playing a long term game. Those that sell them value theirs differently, or see other potential plays in other markets. If there aren't enough people willing to sell them, the bid increases and then people that are holding might be more tempted to sell. It's a beautiful game, and market cap is directly affected by these bidding wars. If the market cap increases, it means bitcoin has become more desirable, on average.

This is amazing PR for Bitcoin amongst business readers and although the effect won’t be immediate, I believe it’s the start of a slow progression towards establishing Bitcoin as s legitimate asset class, store of value, and worthwhile investment for not only institutional money, but retail investors as well.

It's not naive when we have a possible meltdown in the monetary system. Usually the government comes in and saves the day by just printing more money and taxing with inflation, but this isn't sustainable. Remember, modern day economics, the USD, the federal reserve and a whole bunch of made-up financial tools are relatively new.

Demand for BTC would increase. Demand for FIAT would decrease. Existing debt will remain valid in its existing currency unless the contract says otherwise. Smart money will trade into BTC early and pay debt with an improved conversion rate.

Market sentiment is extremely negative, and it pushes prices down for sustained periods. These are accumulation opportunities.

It’s actually a perfect metric to value an asset class. It takes absolutely everything into consideration: sentiment, availability, momentum, value, size, worthiness, and much much more. Because it’s directly tied to price, if benefits from the efficient market hypothesis.
