FYI most tax money does not go to military.
You're confusing discretionary with total. Majority discretionary is military but discretionary is minority overall.
Social security and Medicare are several times larger than military for example.

Oh, so you're maliciously using your demented grandfather as a prop for an e-argument? 
My grandfather passed from Alzheimer's about five years ago. It was a hard and difficult time for my family to live with his decline and reconcile his end. It's not something I personally casually bring up on the internet in a petty attempt to be mean to someone else, though.

Bitcoin is the new Rick and Morty.
Someone write a Rick and Morty High IQ shitpost stat!


I'm dying! �� This is pure gold. Maybe you should take investment advice from your granddad. You might find he knows a thing or two learned over watching the market go up and down many many times.
Or, maybe your generation invented finance and no one in history could ever have a valid opinion rooted in experience and history.

Lol you definitely strike me as someone on the spectrum of anti-social personality, but I guess I should not be surprised based on the community. 
I will have a good one, thanks!

Holy shit did you attempt to argue that you don't use money, you exchange it as currency in trade?
You know you've lost when youre redefining 3 letter words (use) in order to protect your fragile ego.

In gambling addiction, the actual first step would be learning self-perception in order to gain an understanding of your behavior free from ego. 
It is unsurprising you would disagree with me.

Graphene was a new material 20 years ago too, buddy. We're not in magic-energy land today either.
20 years is much too soon. China, India and the majority of humanity will be chugging through coal and oil at rates dramatically higher than today in 20 years. That's fucking reality. Get ready for the point of no return on climate change as arctic methane and other dormant positive feedback loops finally rejoin the climate system. 
Batteries look about the same they do now as they did 20 years ago. The first iPhone came out a decade ago -- with a very similar lithium ion battery as the new ones being released today. Where's the next gen batteries? Same place they were 20 years ago: "20 years away". Lol. The LiOn battery reached commercialization in 1991 -- almost 30 years ago. And we don't even have a viable runway for an alternative, just "futuretech" hopes and "nextgen materials" and dreams.
We're nowhere near "next gen batteries powering electric cars" in 20 years. It's just not going to happen that fast.


While some tiny little European soc democracy with the population of a middling US state might use it, the cold hard reality is that China and India and Brazil and Russia and Indonesia and Pakistan and Nigeria and the rest of the billions who are industrializing and modernizing and growing, they're not going to go green, they're going to go the route of the cheapest and most strategic energy, and that is going to continue to be coal and gas, as opposed to foreign sourced high-tech green energy. 
Hell I can't see any major nation using high tech green energy solutions in any large scale capacity unless they produce those things domestically or a historic ally does. You think Europe is going to fill themselves up with Chinese solar tech? You think China wants American batteries? No way jose, not at scale.

The goods and services you "use bitcoin for" are all pegged instead to USD/fiat, causing the bitcoin value of them to vary dramatically. 
You're gambling on bitcoin because it's not a stable or low-risk investment, it's an extremely high risk and unstable cryptocurrency notorious for its young, naive and strongly addicted fans. 
The gambling occurs potentially in several places. Like when you move USD to crypto and then buy things pegged to USD with it -- the gamble is on attempting arbitrage that the value of the goods and services will be less through bitcoin than through USD. Even if you attempt to just bitcoin as a currency, you're gambling on the arbitrage opportunity whether or not you want to. This is why people who have euros turn them into dollars before spending them in America. Why gamble on every single small purchase? 
The gambling also occurs on any bitcoin you don't spend, as it's quite worthless without being turned into USD or being spent on a USD-pegged good or service, so at some point you have to resolve your gamble and take your USD/USD-pegged result.
And finally, even if, even if you were truly attempting to use bitcoin as a currency only, then you're engaging in the rank stupidity of using an inferior, expensive, laggy, pseudo-currency. That may not be a gamble per se (although I would make an argument that anyone who supports bitcoin at all is gambling by nature), but it's worth pointing out.

So you're the young version of gold hoarders. My dad might be a bit of a prepper and gold hoarder. Your type of gambler is one that I'm intimately aware of. 


Come on man, a BTC transaction can cost multiple euros and take hours to process. Even today you're waiting at least 10 minutes on the network and paying each miner a fee. You're just being dishonest. 
Could you imagine if you were at a local store and swiped your credit card and _had to wait 10 minutes_ ? The current fee is 13,500 satoshi's or about $1USD and is about a ten minute wait. Could you imagine a $1 fee just to swipe a credit card! MADNESS! Your system is not just inferior to fiat, it's about an order of magnitude worse. Or several orders. The dominant system can process millions of transactions per second at a fee of $0.01-$0.02/ea, while bitcoin can do 100-1000X less and costs 100-1000X more per transaction while doing it! Get real! 
BTC is not easier than euro, you're just lying.


I shouldn't assume that literally the only way of doing it in the wild is the only way?
You're off in fantasy land. You're a gold hoarder who is hoarding something that is, hilariously, even more shitty of an investment than hoarding gold, and you're doing it because of some utopian-esque idealism about the future.
At least the gold hoarders saw peak oil, climate instability and nuclear holocaust in our future so they bought something that will work when the power grid shuts off. But you, you've built a lot of gambling into your retirement investments! Gambling that your utopian bitcoin society will be reality! I mean, the gambling you're doing is so much more delusional, risky and shocking than simple arbitrage, you're betting your whole future, your entire retirement -- **_on fantasy_**. 
You are possibly the most addicted gambler I have ever met.

Gambling your entire paycheck the second you get it after spending days fantasizing about gambling your entire paycheck the second you get it 
That's healthy.

Sweet summer children. It works great, and you've never experienced deflation or stagflation like used to be common in previous generations
You live in the security of success while blindly criticising the very success that you cannot even perceive.
