Use wireshark, so easy a 5 year old could do it, else why would you need the source.

Not true, at least where I live, If I send money to a wrong account, the bank will do shit. It's your responsibility, your transaction, the bank only processed it. Been there, done that

Why would you worry about this? Do you know if the dollar you use hasn't been used to buy drugs or fund terrorism etc. before it ended in your hands?

I don't know what you are smoking, but Bitcoin most definitely is, it is software no matter how want to turn it. Not sure how you think this is anything different then any open or even closed source project. It's code that's all it is, no magic included.

Hal Finney, the first person to run Bitcoin other then Satoshi and most likely he was Satoshi himself. Of course this is never confirmed or proofed because he passed away because of ALS.

E-mail is not secure, so I would call it quite dangerous to send a private key over mail. I atleast would never do it, even in 2009. So not really sure what you received. Could be ofcourse don't want to deny that.

Damn, then this Bitcoin must be also a scam? ;) But agree, scam

Bitcoin can't be seized as far as I know, how can they proof you own the private keys

The state of this exchange is shockingly bad, it wasn't like this at all when I joined some years ago..
This morning (and like many occasions) it was just plain impossible to even place a simple limit order. Error after error, after +15min of bashing the form some order comes true (even though the interface never told it got placed...)
To notice the price is wrong and spend another +15min to cancel this order. To spend another +15min to get again a new order in... 
This is even the short version, but finally after +45min and seeing the price shoot up +150, compared to when I wanted to place my first order...
Kraken... please update us on your roadmap!!!  even the new beta cryptowatch thing is only showing spinners/errors. This starts to be unacceptable, well think we are well passed this point!
Looking for alternatives!

Thanks for the reply, really just curious of where the dislike of core comes from. 
Reading some Pr's on Github once in a while, so can't say I follow their every move.

Purely out of interest, but why do you hold such grudge against the core team? Do you even know?

Take the drive out and into another PC copy the contents to an image file. Best tool for this is DD (
After this you can mount the image and search for your BTC!

Internet replaced the role of publishers. It took the middleman away for reaching the masses. 
Sure they still exist, the same will be for banks but their influence will be changed. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:04:13
First of to clarify:
bch (or bcc)  = bitcoin cash
Btc (or btx) = bitcoin 
Btg = bitcoin gold
(they made a mess of these abbreviations) 
So you needed to own bitcoin, before the fork (btc) only then you would get bitcoin gold. If you owned bitcoin cash, you won't get anything.  
Found a topic about claiming your bitcoin cash, this should work the same for bitcoin gold (if you owned bitcoin)

Jup fork happend 24th, and if you just like me didn't get informed about it through official channels and didn't move your BTC to a wallet... Kraken has your BTG and so far ain't giving it too you....
If you have them already in a wallet, you are fine, you got a copy of it now in the BCG blockchain (and own them!)
