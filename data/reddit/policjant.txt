I still think it's really dumb to remove a check to gain a 600microsecond speedup.

An immutable distributed linked list, with each element being a block of records (they don't necessarily have to be transactions).

just send them to me, I'll do the work

And sadly processes much less transactions per day.

I read your comment wrong ;_;, I thought you wrote "what is the big b Blockchain"
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:41:30
and he's right? and he's talking sense?
I really fail to see an issue here. Bitcoin might be an investment asset but Ethereum is just a decentralized mainframe which doesn't care if 1 ETH costs $1000 or $1. Ethereum is for computation, not for investment, and we see it working with projects like Golem and Dai.
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:29:04
I certainly would spend at least half a minute looking for it.
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:04:36
Not really. Most Bitcoin nodes will be wiped. Losing most of our machines will wreak havoc that will make the issue of the blockchain being gone one of the smaller ones. Cars won't work, factories won't work, hospitals won't work.

Are they refusing to move fiat or BTC to the exchange? The latter is old news, but the former, wtf.
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:08:41
Can you actually read the data your node stores yourself or do you need to use a third party service?

Read about UUCP. Email could take hours to arrive if you didn't have a direct Internet link. People still used it

I meant can as if you're able to do it yourself, rather than if it's possible.

They are talking about switching station and base station manufactures, not phone manufacturers. Nokia's and iirc Motorola's phone network equipment divisions are still doing alright

TBH examples on this one are quite out of date. A/C chargers standardized on USB, though it's flakey now because of the move to USB-C, for character encodings everyone is using UTF-8 or at least any other variant of Unicode.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:01:53
I'm really happy that it's moving at all. It was a stablecoin for the last couple weeks.

BTC uses exceptionally much power per transaction
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:25:19
Considering the inflation, why would anyone even sell Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:56:04
I understand paying using it for utilities, but you yourself said that once talking to the owner you can pay for anything with XBT.
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:20:18
well, I went into bitcoin purely for investment, not for using it as a store or medium of exchange of value. There are better options for storage (Dai) or exchange of value (Monero)

Ethereum itself is a good project and a success.
ETH the currency will probably lose meaning and drop once Ethereum allows paying for gas with other tokens.

Well, looking at the block explorer the [BCH's  block]( and the [BTC's  block]( share the same txhash.
Citing Wikipedia (lol) [it also lists the genesis block of BCH as the BTC's one in 2009]( with block  
being the one where the BCH and BTC split happened. They share the same ledger prior to the  block.
I really don't see how this is still not technically a fork and rather an airdrop. Airdrop means a completely separate, never interconnected chain, just copying the balances of a different chain, not the whole chain with all the work accumulated instead.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:28:38
Not really. 
Anyone owning BTC prior to the BCH fork got same amount of BCH as they had owned of BTC on it's inception. Basically, they share the ledger prior to the fork. Both a software and chain fork.
Nobody owning BTC got LTC when it forked. They are two completely separate ledgers. Only a software fork.
@_date: 2018-07-16 00:18:43
It was a software fork but not a blockchain fork.
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:43:12
yep, these signatures are worthless.
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:05:35
Okay, let me improve my definition.
In a blockchain fork both resulting cryptocurrencies share the same genesis block. BTC and BCH have the same genesis block. BTC and LTC don't share the same genesis block.

To be honest, physical security is even weaker than computer security, the difference is that your neighborhood burglar can't run a lockpick through all doors in the city at once.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:11:14
It's just that the BTC team didn't want to increase block size because they were working on Lightning, BCH people just wanted them to take the obvious solution for now and keep working on Lightning rather than artificially keep the payments expensive
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:18:05
zcash does, monero also although it's not listed there.
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:59:47
