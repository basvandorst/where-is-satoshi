Yes except that a lot of the draw for new people is "omg bitcoin is 11000 dollars!"
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:30:39
Because maybe I had an emergency and needed the money quickly?
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:08:59
Lol well good luck, if you can find it it's safe to say you made a decent amount 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:49:51
I like how they're calling everyone who owns bitcoin lazy fucks who don't have jobs lol.... billionaire investors put chunks of money into bitcoin..... do they not have jobs? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:15:42
I bought in at 1800 thinking it might be too late but it was worth it if I was wrong - it's gone up to 4k+ since then. I definitely made my money back and then some 
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:29:00
Buy it and forget it. It will always go up. I started out when the price was at 1800..... thinking "well fuck is it too late? Probably can't get much higher!" And now it's double that

Btc is still early adoption. Think about it like this. If you went out on the street right now and asked 100 people, how many people do you think would actually know or care what bitcoin is? It's not going to stop going up for a while. As more people get interested it's going to keep rising.... I'd wager you still have a good 80% of the world's population to go.... I read somewhere that there is enough btc in the world for everyone in the world to have 0.003 btc, so if you have more than that you've already got a leg up

 I've got 24 dollars in ✌�� watched it turn into 58 but I'm still holding lol
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:17:04
I'm fairly new to btc but the way I see it is this. 
You have 500 dollars in BTC so you spend 100 of it. The price of btc jumps up by a pretty marginal amount before you go back in and replace what you spent, now that 100 dollars isn't worth as much btc as it was before 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:12:43
Keep in mind though that there ARE other altcoins you can mine like Ether, zcash etc that are profitable on a gpu/CPU and you can take the profits from
Those and invest them in btc 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:27:31
 I started with 10, have only put a total of 20 in, and I'm up to 80 total portfolio value now 
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:01:32
Yes you can buy like 10 dollars worth if you want. If the price a whole coin goes up then the value of your purchased amount will go up and if  h  value of a whole coin goes down your value will go down as  well 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:58:24
If it drops to 2200 it'll go right back up because people will be rushing to buy big amounts at 2200, I know I will 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:06:38
That's funny I make 30 dollars a week using nicehash to mine altcoins but get paid in btc on 2x 1080's
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:23:59
 I started out doing 20 a week for many months but now I'm doing 50 a week + mining with nicehash on 2x1080's netting me on average another 27-30 a week 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:45:18
I buy every week on the same day no matter what the price is 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:38:40
It's from 2 days ago 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:47:45
How does putting it under your mattress store the value? Lol it still continues to drop in value weather you have it in a bank or under your mattress 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:36:21
Electric cost hasn't gone up a dime from before I started mining, and I had the cards previously, my rig is just a gaming rig I didn't buy the cards for mining I bought them for gaming but I don't really have a lot of time to do it anymore so they mine instead 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:15:02
They don't convert it lol.... the whole point of being a bitcoin millionaire is to keep it in bitcoin. If you're gonna pay bills and whatnot with it.... transfer out what you need and leave the rest in btc to keep growing. The biggest point of btc is to get AWAY from fiat 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:23:19
Exactly my thoughts when I saw this post 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:49:23
I use nicehash with 2 1080's and I'm making about 6.50-7.00 a day at current price. Nothing huge but it adds up 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:36:11
If you buy in December the price of btc will probably be higher meaning you'll get less for your money, if you put 15 dollars in now... it could be worth 20+ by December. 
I started with 15, and put in a little more every week. Was a slow start but now I've got over 1000 in it. I started when the price was at 1800. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:42:14
Don't know what the people saying it should show up immediately are talking about. If you bought via bank transfer it takes 7-10 days 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:41:30
Where are you getting these numbers? I make 140 a month mining on nicehash with GPU's..... their calculated profit for an antminer s9 is 690 dollars a MONTH. Granted that's mining alt coins but you get paid in btc 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:43:43
Because say I bought 20 dollars worth of btc a month ago. And spend it now. It will take me way more money to buy back that same amount of btc as it did a month ago....
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:40:31
Have you seen all the price threads lately? A lot of people are just here to get rich unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:53:17
Just don't ever sell on the dips because it always goes back up. If it drops 2000 dollars..... buy more 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:56:07
Coinbase when you have the USD wallet set up. It takes a while for your initial money to be put into the usd wallet but then you can buy and sell back to the usd wallet instantly. That's about the best way to do it 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:30:05

I started with 20
Bucks. I've made a tidy little 110% return. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:14:40
If you wanted to convert to fiat, which I wouldn't reccomend at that high of an amount, just take out the maximum you can in a month and leave the rest in there to grow. You're not gonna go through 500k in a month unless you're just being stupid. Take out 500k and leave the rest in there to grow more exponentially. If you had 1m in bitcoin now, think about where that would be when the price hits 10k. You've just made another million just letting it sit there 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:37:31
Why the hell would you keep that much on an exchange? Lmao
