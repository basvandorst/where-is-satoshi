We're talking about a car with a bitcoin license plate and the potential for unwanted attention, not the general risks of driving an exotic.

You're making the assumption that they'd need to cash them out into immediately. Also, washing them into a different chain like Monero effectively kills the trail.

No you're absolutely right, in fact I neglected to mention in my original comment that I think something like coin custodial services (or just physical storage like you mentioned) will eventually become commonplace.

I mean everyone is going to operate within their comfort zone. Some people are more comfortable with advertising personal details ("my family" stickers on their car, Smith and wesson stickers on their car, specific college or pro team stickers/plate frames, etc). Personally I don't feel the need to share or draw attention to things like that on my car knowing how there are some screwy people out there.

On the one hand it's fun that he chose this plate, maybe he's a bitcoin hobbyist with a mild interest in cars. On the other hand I'm thinking "why are you showing off with your bitcoin plate when you didn't spring for the M4?"

Decentralized exchange.

If you insta-link a bank account from one of their supported banks, they'll accept a statement from that account as proof of address.

The difference is the overwhelming majority of those people driving exotics have their money tied up in things that take _time_ to extract value from. Say you snag a Ferrari driver and he's got $5M among his bank accounts, 401k, brokerage accts, etc. How the fuck are you going to extract that money out quickly without raising a bunch of red flags? Also, let's say you _do_ figure out a way to get that value extracted, how do you actually collect it? You can't go into a bank IRL, you could hypothetically have money wired to an account of yours but again at the end of the line you're still going to have to tie it to "you" somehow to use it.
Now replay the same scenario with bitcoin (or crypto in general). The time delay and IRL aspects are gone. Keep hitting him in the head with a pipe, pull his toenails off, or whatever sick shit you've seen seedy Eastern European movie thugs do until he gives you access to his wallet, and you can irreversibly move his $5M in a matter of seconds (well, let's be real, more like 45 minutes, but still).
