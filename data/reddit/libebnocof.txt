Your Prof...is looking for measurable data as evidence to support your arguments. As opposed to qualitative information which is effectively just heresay.
You might want to start with things like Market Cap, adoption rates, Value of options trading market. Etc etc

If anyone here has had this issue with a UK bank account I would be interested to hear. A bank account in the Uk is a legal right.

First open an account with a non exchange BTC seller like Bitpanda. 
The easiest and quickest way to cash out is to then buy BTC with your euros at Coinbase/GDax then send the BTC to a non exchange you have an account with like Bitpanda then sell the BTC. Bitpanda will send you the cash in about 3 working days via SEPA.  You won’t get a great rate but at least you’ll get your Fiat back reasonably quickly. 
I don’t represent Bitpanda in any way ! And you do this at your own risk.

A) Learn to HODL
B) Control my FOMO
C) Realise I’m not Gordon Gecko
Fortunately I always obey 1 golden rule never invest what you can’t afford to loose.

I hear Coinbase are very good, they’re timely with payments and don’t charge excessively for transfers. Validation is quick they’re insured against loss and have a beneficial affect on the market by selling lots of BTC themselves.

I’m not prone to hyperbole but I’m afraid your totally and utterly wrong re Coinbase. Market manipulation is rife and it’s aimed at devaluing BTC they are abusing their position. It’s the Wild West right now... but people will not forget.

If you’ve ever invested on NASDAQ you’ll see similar behaviour day in day out. Glaring market manipulation particularly in pre and post market trading.
