Bitcoin is volatile. Surely you know that this dip is just part of a normal day? You can't always expect gains all the time.
If it's just a small amount to you, HODL. If you can't afford to lose it, get your initial investment out now at least. Watch the news and the market for a little while, then decide whether you want to take your profits or leave it in Bitcoin.

I would say hold off for now. It's just too risky with all that's happening lately. NiceHash hack, ROK's ambivalence on Bitcoin, and Bulgaria's stance towards Bitcoin.
I'm a HODLER for 6 months. I just sold a moment ago. 
EDIT: In the end, it's really up to you. But if you can't stomach the wait, buy now.

75 million now, was 62 million less than 24 hours ago. Lmao

Is that 50 euros that significant to you? If not, just HODL.

Stop regretting about stuff like this. If everybody knew how Bitcoin's price will look like a few years ago, everyone would be a millionaire. You needed the money for your baby, so there's that. Family first.

If you don't have savings, you shouldn't even think about buying crypto. Bitcoin is volatile, I'm sure you know that. What if the price plunges to rock bottom the next day? You have nothing to fall back on. Don't buy more than what you can afford to lose. This piece of advice has been repeated countless times already.

Don't. At least not yet. There's 200k transactions stuck now. So many Redditors are complaining of transaction problems. Hold off from spending, and watch the market.

This isn't even a crash yet. It's just a dip. Just another normal day for Bitcoin. It will rise soon.

This is one of the addresses used by the hacker who did NiceHash in. Whopping 62 million USD sitting right there

If it accounts for 100% of your savings, you are a fool. Sell off some now.
Otherwise, you can use some of that XBT to buy alt coins.
