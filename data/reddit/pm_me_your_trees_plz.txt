Wait a few years and fees will be that low and everyone already knows the name
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:59:07
Do you accept other, lower fee cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:18:19
DC is 1 city, not a fair comparison to a state like Texas with tons of suburbs. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:06:46


Because I liked the area and house enough to buy a place there...you can still travel and/or purchase other properties, but you at least have that once property in a place of your choosing, forever.

Definitely not. You’re right it’s not useful right now, but it may become useful again in the future, and there are useful crypto alternatives in the interim. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:21
use a fake ID then
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:35:18
For me personally it’s been remittances and buying goods that I can’t with USD (fake ID’s when I was underage, DNM, etc). 
Other use cases that make a lot of sense are when one is dealing with an oppressive government, doesn’t trust the other party, or just doesn’t want to be a part of the centralized banking system for whatever reason.

Oatmeal, canned beans, and canned tuna are all pretty healthy, and macaroni and cheese can 100% also be part of a healthy diet. This + seasonal fruits and veggies + rice is actually an incredibly cheap and healthy diet. Not always exciting, but an excellent diet for someone with a low food budget.

has 80,000 comment karma, you can trust him
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:22
I’ve certainly used it, and not just for novelty. That was a few years ago before the fees went up and speeds went down, but it does have plenty of use cases. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:28
not if you use a PO box
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:14:38
1) are those not uses?
2) remittances and transactions where you don’t trust the other party are illegal?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:17:15
lol exactly. While it sucks to be in the red, the real benefit to owning a house and the reason it's worth purchasing is because you can live there forever (assuming you can pay property tax + utilities of course). You can call it negative equity or you can call it eternal piece of mind, I'd go with the latter. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:02:01
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:06
I mean it has the name recognition and market cap so that may carry it till Lightning but you’re absolutely right there are better alternatives right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:58:51
Easy! Just start a thread an hour or so before the thread maybe with a few important links in the description, and beyond that it basically functions like a mega-thread.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:33:36
Why do insiders have an incentive to vote? What's in it for them?
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:27:22
Yeah, if cryptocurrency becomes a thing, .03 btc will be worth $2000-$3000 or more. I think there's basically no going back at this point but obviously I'n on this board so I'm not the average person and I am likely blinded by my own biases.

Inb4 chaos
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:36:20
This. What people won't watch because they read the script?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:54:07
Nice shitpost
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:59:03
Yeah very similar to that.
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:59:29
I'll try posting one around 2 hours before the fork and we'll see if people think it's worthwhile to use.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:21:57
Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:39:45
Multiple DC's =\= independent DC's. If Amazon goes down all those DC's go down. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:55:46
That's just way way way harder than it sounds to do from scratch. You have to have some serious engineering talent to build secure apps that are capable of doing all those transactions with no problems and can't be hacked. 
If it was that simple there would be 10 good alternatives to coinbase but that's not the case
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:14:27
Right haha like are we going to ban every important figure in finance from speaking publicly now?
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:50:36
Certainly diversify
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:15:53
That's not true at all in the US or Canada or western europe or japan or the koreas or parts of china etc. etc. which is a huge chuck of the world, especially in bitcoin's market. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:02:38
Thank you. People on this sub act like just because their investments worked out so far it was a good strategy...that's not how this works. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:03:43
I mean the US is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but yeah capitalism isn't perfect either. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:00:14
One is coercive, the other is voluntary. If you can't see the massively important distinction there you're either a) a dumbass or b) intentionally misunderstanding. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:01:09
compensated in a currency that they have the power to devalue and did in fact massively devalue 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:58:18
Yeah, we'll take your inflation-free store of value in return for these pieces of paper we *promise* we won't inflate away to worthlessness. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:21:57
Electrum is a good one
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:56:24
Where do their loans come from then? Genuinely asking
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:52:19
Why is being a jackass here? That seemed completely reasonable. Bernanke came off like an idiot he didn't know anything.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:30:05
Lol at the thought of more than a few thousand in an exchange 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:03:27
Lol that was literally me. Not a big deal though, I really think the etherium idea is really cool and I intend to hold long term.
