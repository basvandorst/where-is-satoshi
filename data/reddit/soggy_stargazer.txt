gemini has less bank support.  
My credit union (4 largest in the us, largest not associated with a government agency) isn't one of their approved banks.  As a result, connecting gemini with my bank is kind of a pain in the ass.
But seriously if this is the attitude, fuck this guy.
So whats the problem exactly?  All of the volume in his exchange doesn't happen on the blockchain, but he's butthurt because scaling means off chain tx?  News flash, 10 min best case minimum first confirmation is never going to be sufficient for Point Of Sale transactions regardless of how large your blocks are.
I guess I need to redouble my efforts to convert over to gemini since polo and hitbtc are off the menu because of where I live.

My favorite bit of cognitive dissonance is the desire for them to tell you how bad bitcoin is compared to bitcoin cash but then in the next breath try to convince you that bitcoin cash is bitcoin.
You'd think if it was that bad they would want to distance themselves from it as much as possible so as to avoid confusion.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:08:21
I see the point you are trying to make, but bitcoin.org never mentioned bcash or btrash.
This isn't the same as some guy on the street calling bitcoin cash bcash.  
This is a calculated nuance designed to confuse bitcoin with bitcoin cash in an attempt to usurp bitcoin market cap and push a personal agenda through a series of thinly veiled attacks, character assassination, and a particularly slimy marketing campaign.
If Ver truely believes that BCH is the technically superior product, why is he spending so much time, money, and effort to convince the world that BCH is BTC?  Why not just prove that BCH is better?  BCH doesn't need to be called Bitcoin to do so.

Thank you for posting this.  I believe this answers my question.  
big blockers are morons.
:-)  I jest, somewhat.
I am confident that the developers know what they are doing and that nobody with any real influence doesn't believe that layers are the solution and the "debates" that I see over on chain vs off chain are from an ignorant position.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:02:12


First of all, zero confirmation transactions are absolutely fine for small transactions.
I don't think you are considering this in the context of a transaction between complete strangers in a POS scenario.  Where do you draw the line for what constitutes a "small" purchase?  I hold by my statement that best practice is to not accept unconfirmed tx's
Most businesses or vendors would not be willing to take that risk.
I think your example of reversed charges is valid and I agree that BTC reduces that risk from the perspective of the vendor.  It does reduce consumer protection and shifts the process to make a slighted customer whole to a legal arena which is an entirely different discussion.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:51:07
I am considering a transaction as a completed transaction which would include confirmation time.  
Frankly I think discussing how long it takes to submit a transaction to the network in this context is not only disingenuous but also a bit irrelevant.
I do think that lightning is the next phase, will it be the final form?  Not sure yet.  Things like this move slow until they don't.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:42:32
Agreed, however the TPS figures are almost always trotted out in the same breath comparing to card processors which are most certainly processing transactions every second.  
My takeaway from these comments are that the community at large understands that scaling is nuanced and that really there has been a very vocal minority criticizing the direction of development while missing the forest for the trees.
I have been in the game since 2010 and have always seen the final solution as layers upon layers each serving a purpose working in concert to provide a smooth, fluid transaction solution.
Personally I see a lot of complementary tech between ETH and BTC and that ultimately we will see a future where they work in concert.
@_date: 2018-05-01 22:10:40
Because Bitcoin is established as referring to a specific coin handled by a specific block chain.  Bitcoin Cash is a fork, a deviation from the blockchain which has established itself as Bitcoin.
The bitcoin chain/network is larger, stronger, more resilient, and more decentralized than bitcoin cash (this was proven when they tried to pull hashrate to bitcoin cash in november and failed).
I understand the argument that you are trying to make here but its kind of a strawman.  People are angry because the technical takeover failed and now they are resorting to brand theft in order to capture market.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:31:33
If Bitcoin Cash is truly better it doesn't need to be called Bitcoin.  This obsession with being named after what they consider to be an inferior product is strange.
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:50:15
Throughput is a function of block capacity and confirmation time.
I understand the difference, but it seems most of the people making the arguments don't which is the point I was making.
I feel like in order for BTC to really gain mainstream use, it needs to be as easy or easier to use than a credit card.  I just see the whole TPS argument in the on chain transaction context to be somewhat pointless.
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:56:51


10 minute blocks will never be fast enough for point of sale (POS) transactions.  This is going on the assumption that until a transaction is confirmed, its not completed.
BCH supporters will say the primary difference between BCH and BTC is that BCH removed replace-by-fee (RBF) which allows users to accept unconfirmed transactions.
This is at best a strawman argument.
RBF is optional, transactions that support it are flagged as such.  There is a small chance that a nefarious actor could use RBF to modify an unconfirmed transaction, HOWEVER, common sense since the dawn of bitcoin is that accepting unconfirmed transactions is not advised.
The reality is that BCH is NOT "faster" than BTC as a matter of fact.  It *was* faster but only because the blocks were full prior to segwit.
It *was* cheaper because full blocks mean people were paying more to get shorter confirmation times.  [There is some speculation that a third party was spamming small transactions to keep the blocks full to artificially inflate the tx fees.](
The bottom line is that 10 minute blocks will never be fast enough for POS commercial adoption.....EVER.
So this makes "onchain scaling" a particularly complicated issue.  It doesn't matter how large the blocks are, slow transactions are slow transactions whether you can handle 20 or 20k.  Larger blocks take up more compute resources to store in perpetuity thus leading to more centralization.
The primary contention is not based on technical merit but on ideology.  I personally think that BCH is driven primarily from a miner perspective with little consideration towards improving adoption for non-technical users.  I also believe that Roger Ver is an unstable individual with ulterior motives that do not have the best interests of bitcoin (or bitcoin cash) in mind. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:47:11


Fantastic!  What are some of the other scaling solutions that are not on chain or off chain?
Are you talking about a fundamental change to the chain itself like tangle?
Not trying to be an asshole as I am genuinely interested.  I was not trying to present a false dichotomy by stating there were only two areas to innovate (on vs off chain) and if there are others I would like to go down that rabbit hole.
@_date: 2014-06-13 11:17:19
Likely a combination of both.  I think hit the nail on the head as far as the legal aspect, ie they would rather not give the government a reason to pester them, and has it from the internal customer service aspect in that they would rather not deal with things they can't help a customer resolve.
in my experience with google, they tend to err on the side of better customer service rather than better bottom line.  I have been a longtime user of the extra storage they were providing for picasa, because of a problem with the transition to google wallet and drive, I basically got grandfathered in on a 50 gig google drive for free inperpetuity.  Not saying google doesn't fuck up or engage in some questionable data gathering/acquisition, but I believe most of the time they are honestly trying to "do no evil".

I switched to key auth two years ago when I started working in the cloud.
My setup is very simple, but I have a few friends that have unprivileged accounts that use password auth.  I need to have discussion with them about switching to key exchange anyways.
I'm not freaking out over it or anything, but just thought it was an interesting coincidence.  I have turned down bitcoin-qt, I want to see if things "go back to normal" and how long it takes for that to happen.
If it happens right away, then that implies that they are simply monitoring the bitcoin network for ips and not storing them for repeated attacks.
I get that correlation != causation but there is a very strong correlation here and given the fact that bitcoin is very popular lately, its a reasonable conclusion to come to.
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:43:19
Yeah, well aware of all the ASICBOOST controversy.

These are the emails telling me my system is blacklisting IPs that are trying to log in with common logins which are disabled on my public facing webserver.
I believe this is a direct result of recently starting up a bitcoin client on another host on my network.
the basic premise is this, you port scan my ip, I blacklist your ip.
you try to log in with an account that is disabled (ie root), I black list your ip
if you manage to get a valid user but fail the password 3 times, I blacklist your ip.
you do any of this more than once in a month, I blacklist the ip for a year.

I don't think its the combo, I think what happens is "they" see bitcoin, then scan for open ports and execute attacks against known services.  "They" may skip the portscan and go right to the attacking also.
I would say that hackers are looking for signs that people are running bitcoin related services and then attempting to exploit whatever they can in the hopes that the machine can be compromised and coins stolen.

I probably should have done some more googling before posting.
I found this [page]( which lists the maximum difficulty at 2^224.
According to [Wolfram Alpha]( thats a RIDICULOUS number: 
26 unvigintillion 959 vigintillion 946 novemdecillion 667 octodecillion 150 septendecillion 639 sexdecillion 794 quindecillion 667 quattuordecillion 15 tredecillion 87 duodecillion 19 undecillion 630 decillion 673 nonillion 637 octillion 144 septillion 422 sextillion 540 quintillion 572 quadrillion 481 trillion 103 billion 610 million 249 thousand 216
In the light of this realization, and the fact that my example of yottahashes (a number I felt was pretty ridiculous)  is essentially 1 septillion hashes is not even half of the total potential ( recognize that hashrate != difficulty number, but it just illustrates how the current difficulty is barely even scratching the surface).
Even right now with the network running at ~322 peta hashes, the difficulty is only at  ~40 billion, there is a considerable amount of room even at yottahash levels of operation....
So it seems that there is very little chance of the difficulty being exhausted before the bitcoins to be mined are.
Would still love to see what people think...
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:34:15
True, and like I said, AWS isn't a magic bullet for all workloads.
Any of the T1/T2 instances can't compete with actual hardware, and they aren't designed to.  The C3's and R3's are pretty beefy, and again the primary concept with AWS is developing solutions that scale horizontally not vertically so apples to apples comparisons between the performance of a given instance size and a 1u rack is not exactly a worthwhile exercise.
I have seen some horrible architectures in my line of work, I have also seen some really elegant and incredibly responsive architectures.
That said I don't necessarily agree that the skills in option a are mutually exclusive with the skills to do option b.
There is some overlap between the two, but AWS infrastructure is more about the software design and less about the facilities design where option A is more forgiving* on the software design and more about facilities HA.
*Not exactly the right word, traditional infrastructure has been around for a long time and in a wholly owned scenario you have much greater control over the interconnects and many of the dragons have been slain by those who came before so its easier to implement a well performing solution.
With AWS so often I find myself having to develop a new solution to a problem because it hasn't been done yet (or more likely because of the software side of things starts to get into the hazy world of IP) and people are less inclined to share their "secret sauce" receipe.

Ahhhhhh. This is way different then mounting a new volume and finding the previous data on it.

[Not likely.](
**Physical and Environmental Security**
AWS’s data centers are state of the art, utilizing innovative architectural and engineering approaches. Amazon has many
years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied
to the AWS platform and infrastructure. AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly
controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance,
intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a
minimum of two times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and
are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.
AWS only provides data center access and information to employees and contractors who have a legitimate business
need for such privileges. When an employee no longer has a business need for these privileges, his or her access is
immediately revoked, even if they continue to be an employee of Amazon or Amazon Web Services. All physical access
to data centers by AWS employees is logged and audited routinely.
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:40:33
Its easy to do stuff like this in aws.  Its not aws's responsibility to protect you from not knowing what you are doing anymore than dell should be expected to protect its customers from bad admins. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:32:05
Nobody else knows the physical location of "your" servers in aws either.  Customer to physical hardware relationship is completely decoupled in aws.  The guys that have access to the hardware don't know who is on what, and the guys that have access to customer data don't have access to the hardware.  
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:29:30
So you aren't happy to be on rackspace or you are? :-)
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:29:23
As someone whose job revolves around aws let me say this.
The people who work in the aws data centers don't have access to know what customer resides on what hardware.  
Furthermore aws physical security is some of the tightest security I have ever seen in my 15 years in IT. Just going to the office buildings involves going through man traps and security checkpoints.  
AWS data centers are most certainly more secure than most private data centers. 
Now all of that security means nothing if you build your vpc with bad security groups and basically fail to follow best practices.  
I have seen accounts get compromised because of bad security choices.  This is not unique to the cloud and is not automatically mitigated because you aren't using cloud resources.  
Oh and amazon does everything via public key encryption.  They generate a keypair ONCE and thats the only time you can download it.  If you lose your pem, its gone.  If you're lucky you can reattach the root volume to another ec2 instance and add a new pubkey.  But that is something you as the user has to do.  AWS has ZERO access to your systems from a login perspective.  Even if you wanted them to get into your host, they can't.  Believe me I have had cases where the customer screwed up and couldn't get into the hosts anymore.  SOL.  The closest they will ever come is a screen share with aws where they are basically looking over your shoulder.  
TL;DR - aws is probably some of the most secure systems in the world.  Still doesn't mitigate bad infrastructure and security decisions by the user.  
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:39:18


You don't have to.  It's done already:
**Background Checks**
AWS has established formal policies and procedures to delineate the minimum standards for logical access to AWS
platform and infrastructure hosts. AWS conducts criminal background checks, as permitted by law, as part of preemployment
screening practices for employees and commensurate with the employee’s position and level of access.
The policies also identify functional responsibilities for the administration of logical access and security.
From[ this document]( which also details how tightly controlled physical access is.
Additionally my statement is not "No."  You didn't say anything about asking for the results of employee background checks from Sungard in your initial statement, just that the banks require it.  I also seriously doubt sunguard is going to provide all of the individual background check results.  Most likely it will be handled like aws does, you will get the NDA audit results, [which you can request from AWS](  I was not able to locate a similar page or information from sungard so I can't validate your statement at all....
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:38:48
I would say no more than any other data center operator.  Its hard to say if that risk is higher or lower in aws. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:25:38
Yes but let's consider for a moment, providing that uptime and better on your own is expensive.
Option a) build and maintain two pairs of  georedundant data centers on opposite sides of the country.
Option b) design your aws infrastructure to be multi-az, multi-region.
Option b is going to be cheaper to implement, faster to implement, cheaper to maintain, and it will take a global calamity to impact your service availability. AWS has had outages, but so far they have not affected more than one region.  Plus option a gives you zero options for cost recovery in the event of a service outage.  
This doesn't even begin to cover the benefits of autoscaling and other features you get with aws. 
Not saying AWS is right for everyone and every use case, but there are reasons companies like coke, Yamaha, NASDAQ and others are moving significant portions of their infrastructure to the public cloud.

True, but that does bring up an interesting point.  
Its widely accepted that no cryptographic standard will withstand Moore's law forever.  
If we are capable of exhausting the difficulty, then the wallet encryption becomes a viable attack vector. This is of course assuming that wallets aren't upgraded as cryptographic ciphers are.   
Of course this also opens up an interesting possibility to recover "lost" coins that are in old wallets with old encryption where the owners lost the passphrase or threw out the hard drive they were on...

So aside from the really low fee of 50sat/byte, where is the extra .3 BTC coming from?
The transaction on the sending side is only for 5.00019044 BTC.
This transaction may never clear, or it may just take a week.  Don't care about that, more interested in where the extra BTC is coming from.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:44:45
5 BTC was sent with a fee of .00019044.
Where is the .3687253 BTC coming from that is showing in the transaction?  
The source wallet isn't short this BTC.

Add in some geoip and you could have different continents represented by the different highways.

I feel like bitcoin's value will prevent it from becoming the daily coin of use.
Eth will be the network of transaction processing for POS because of the speed at which it operates.
You may see litecoin operate in between as a daily currency, held in digital banks running on eth, with BTC backing it all and providing the mechanism for long lived high value transactions.
I think this idea of "beating" bitcoin is silly.  We have some serious usability hurdles to get over before the everypersons of the world can replace cash with crypto.  
I see BTC and ETH as two pieces of that puzzle.  Whether LTC is part of that puzzle remains to be seen.

A better way to put this is that if you receive BTC in exchange for goods and services rendered, then the USD value of the bitcoin when you receive it is considered regular income and must be reported.  Also contrary to popular belief there is no minimum reporting threshold.
All income is to be claimed.  In practice however I don't think it makes financial sense to chase someone down for not paying taxes on $300 bucks 6 years ago so unless they have another reason to audit you, its not likely that the IRS is going to come after you for it.
And yes, Miners owe income tax on BTC mined less costs.

It is.
It also happened 4 years after he "disappeared" 
Assuming he was still active and lurking, I would think that if he cared, he would have regained control of said account.
Regardless, what does this have to do with validating anything that this new satoshi has to say?
I believe it was always the intention of Satoshi to release bitcoin into the wild and then disappear knowing full well what the capacity for disruption would be and not wanting any of the inevitable attention that would come of it.
I still believe that Satoshi is a group of individuals as that is the most reasonable explanation given the known facts.  Perhaps we will never know the truth and the more time that passes, the less relevant it becomes.
At the end of it all, my primary point is that this has all the earmarks of a scam and someone like Satoshi would know better than to even attempt it.  This conflicted creator trope is tired and far too obvious.
It was created by a PR firm and has all of the hallmarks of a pseudo-viral marketing campaign.  Detailed story from a mythical individual, references to mystical insight, tales of woe and tragedy, and the commitment to "do better next time.....which by the way is just around the corner...just wait and see what I have to show you next"
Yeah, because Satoshi has historically shown himself to be a showman and entertainer.  My money is on this being the latest incarnation of Ver(min)Coin at best, and at worst another attempt to fleece rubes of their BTC.

**"I lost all ability to validate my claims due to my own ineptitude but please believe me when I tell you I created bitcoin."**
I for one have a hard time believing that the creator of bitcoin would be so careless and clueless about these aspects.  Enough awareness to encrypt the shit out of his hard drive, but not capable of securing an email account?
I am not a cypherpunk and I have managed to maintain multiple email accounts and even recover my hotmail account over 20 years.  Also managed to keep my wallet safe through not one, but two hard drive crashes....and it was before I could use a seed to create an offline backup.
Honestly I don't know why I am even wasting my time debunking this further because everything about this smells.

Here's the issue I take with all this; The real Satoshi (assuming it is a singular person which I think consensus has established as being unlikely) would know that 
 a) only signing a message or moving coins would establish provenance 
b) doing so would likely destabilize bitcoin and make him a target.
So why even bother?  You can't turn back time and you can't recover data which is truly lost.
This is just an elaborate [sob story]( designed to evoke an emotional response in order to gain the readers confidence.

Well yeah, this is just the common refrain that RBF makes unconfirmed transactions less trust worthy.  The argument usually goes like this:
"Fees too high/mempool stuck bitcoin sucks" 
My response, use lower fees wait longer...doesn't take that long"
"but I should be able to buy coffee with it, if I can't its a failure"
My Response "10 minutes to confirmation is too long for any sort of POS usage. LN will solve that"
"We don't need LN, unconfirmed tx is fine for POS, its like a check.  The confirmation is when the check clears a couple days later (this was an actual argument)"
Me "Okay then whats the problem?"
"RBF can take my money if unconfirmed, we got rid of it ergo, we're better"
Personally I think unconfirmed tx's are no better than a temporary hold on a credit card and would not rely on one in a case where I don't trust the person.  Much in the same way I would not accept a check from some rando.

This is a waste of money.
The ad is horrible and has the wrong tone.  Top comment in that thread says it all.
Also, BCH is a pain in the ass to get right now, even for the technically savvy.  Anyone technical enough to be able to get it from Bittrex or Kraken already know how, and any new comers are going to be quickly turned off when they realize that not only is it harder to acquire, but also harder to spend, especially in the US.
Coinbase provides the lowest barrier to entry for most people that want to "invest" directly.  Everyone else is going to use the futures markets and traditional investment methods when they become available.  You can't buy BCH on coinbase yet so really I don't know what the market is here.

Bitcoin is an asset which has never existed before.
It is similar to gold.
Supply is finite.
Takes effort and resources to produce.
Functions as a store of value.
Can be used to facilitate commerce.
On this last point, gold isn't widely used anymore, but it once was.
Gold has serious drawbacks. 
Its heavy.
If you want to pay someone in gold you have to do it in person which could be dangerous if they are some rando.  Doing it remotely requires secure transport and some way to guarantee payment.
So here comes bitcoin, a deflationary asset like gold, with the liquidity of credit cards, no dependence on a third party, the ability to transact globally and some privacy (not enough which is one issue with bitcoin).  
The financial sector is having a problem grokking the potential and since its growing so fast, the only other scenario that seems close to what we are seeing are the many many bubbles we have seen over the course of human history.  So people who aren't visionaries are dismissive calling bitcoin tulips and bubbles and claiming every correction is a sign that bitcoin is doomed.
You are absolutely right about mining being an energy suck and the arms race going on can't continue.  I am not sure how that is going to ultimately get resolved.
On the subject of consumer surplus.  There are only 16 million bitcoin in existence.  Of those, probably 4 million are lost, in wallets that have no private keys,  or are otherwise not in circulation.  that leaves 12 million coins in supply.  Coinbase at last report has some 10 million users.  There's barely enough supply for all of coinbase's users to have 1 each.  Demand is through the roof and every dip is seen as a sale.
This isn't a bubble, its the beginning of a [technology adoption curve]( and things are going to start moving very quickly over the next 24 to 36 months.
edit to change "in the next 24 to 36 months" to "over the next" because momentum is already building.

I think the takeaway here is that many countries use foreign banks to secure assets.  In this case it was gold in a london bank to which access was, rightly, refused.
I have said it before and I will say it again, the moment a country builds a bitcoin reserve fiat is the day the tide will have truly turned.
Once a country decides to basically reject the world banking system in favor of crypto the shit is really going to hit the fan.
Now I don't know how realistic this really is, but it seems far more likely that crypto will be used to secure it than a physical asset like gold.
The point being that once you buy into the global banking cartels, you no longer control your money.  Period.
Same goes for crypto on an exchange, not your keys, not your coins, of course this is nothing new, people just put a lot of trust in banks to play nice.

no different than if you were to receive stock from a company as a grant (ie for free).  
You realize income on the value of the stock on the day you received it and pay taxes. 
If you sell it a month later for double what it was worth, you pay regular income taxes to the tune of sale price - value on the day you received it.  
If you manage to hold onto the stock for 12 months or longer, you can take advantage of long term capital gains and pay a lower tax rate.

No shit sherlock.  
I realize they would be converting BTC to USD.  My POINT, in the context of comments from the FBI that N.Korea using BTC is an argument AGAINST BTC, is that USD is used directly far more often and is easier and more anonymous than crypto.  
The reality is that moving fiat into and out of crypto is difficult to do on a large scale.  Exchanges which allow fiat withdrawals typically have stringent requirements since they act as an interface to the financial system.
It's an asinine argument that has been trotted out before [and has been found to be largely false](

How can the mechanism that the retailer uses have ANY bearing on whether I owe additional federal tax on a transaction?  The presence of SALES tax is a STATE construct and has nothing to do with my federal tax liability.
The reason this has federal tax liability has NOTHING to do with whether the crypto goes through a fiat conversion process prior to the sale being completed.










What this means, in crayon for the folks playing at home.
* If Bob buys $100 worth of bitcoin and then spends all of it to buy $100 worth of ANYTHING else, no federal taxes.
* If Bob buys $100 worth of bitcoin and then spends half of it to buy $100 worth of ANYTHING, he just earned $50 in gains on federal taxes.
* If Bob buys $100 worth of bitcoin and then spends all of it to buy $50 worth of ANYTHING, he just lost $50 and can claim a loss on his federal.
Whether the gains are taxed at the regular income rate or long term gains rate is only dependent upon how long Bob held the coins between buying and selling.
These are the only criteria that matter.  The method of purchase whether by bitpay or direct party to party crypto are irrelevant in the eyes of the IRS.






Which IRS form is that exactly that you claim your assets on?  I must have missed that one....every year for the last 15 years.
Q-6 specifically states exchanging virtual currency for other property.  In this case that other property is literally property.
I don't know if you are trolling, or suffering from a debilitating cognitive dissonance on this but the guidance from the IRS is pretty damn clear and I am sure if you asked a CPA in a professional capacity they would disagree with your stance.
I wish you luck in your pending audit.

Okay, I'll play along.
Sure but I am not converting it.   A third party is and I am never in possession of the fiat.  How am I supposed to know what happens after I spend bitcoin to buy something?
Does this mean that if I buy ethereum on coinbase with BTC that it *might* count if coinbase converts my BTC to fiat before they buy my ETH?
How would I know in either case?
How about if I buy a house from someone with bitcoin in a private sale with no payment processor?  Does that count?

except he isn't exchanging 10 $10 dollar bills for 1 $100 dollar bill.  You're changing .5 bitcoins for 4000 xrp

I believe you are incorrect in your assumptions.
The coins do not exist on the same blockchain therefore "converting" between blockchains is not simply changing colors of your pen.  You are changing pens.  
You cannot change from blue ink to red in without either exchanging the ink in your pen, or exchanging your pens.  
[Per the only official publication of the IRS](
In section 2, they establish the following:
















They specifically point out that virtual currencies can be **exchanged** for other virtual currencies.  While they specifically mention Bitcoin, they also use the term "other real or virtual currencies" which would indicate that they are not speaking specifically to all coins but instead referring to the different currencies as a class of assets.  Because they failed to specifically call out Ethereum or some other coin that was created after this, doesn't automatically make that new coin some new asset that isn't covered.
The IRS goes on to state:








This establishes virtual currencies as property.
The section which I think specifically speaks to your perspective is as follows:
























This statement again uses the terminology of an **"exchange"** which based on the language in section 2 would indicate that the IRS considers exchanges to other virtual currencies to be a taxable event.
NOW, that said, in section 3 the IRS states:














Now if you recall, in section 2 they state: "Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as “convertible” virtual currency."
SO one COULD take this to mean, that exchanges between crypto's which do not have a USD or other "real" currency trading pair would not be considered to be a convertable virtual currency.  So if you are trading between cryptos that do not have a USD/EUR trading pair, you could conceivably argue that your interpretation applies.  
 [I think you are stretching the description of colored-coins](  In my opinion it was more like an ERC-20 token.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:22:10




The sale or exchange of convertible virtual currencies OR to pay for goods and services.  The key is the inclusion of OR.
They are saying selling or exchanging currency **OR** paying for goods and services with it (spending it) constitutes a taxable event.
The IRS is not distinguishing different protocols because any reasonable person would take the statement "convertible virtual currency" to apply to any and all coins which fall into that category.
If you aren't selling the crypto, aren't buying goods and services with it, what else could exchange possibly be referring to if not the specific act of exchanging one crypto for another?  Just because they didn't spell it out in crayon doesn't mean its open for interpretation.
Furthermore, [in the official filing for the coinbase lawsuit]( the IRS again uses the distinguishing language of sale or exchange of virtual currency
 




































Now, if they either intentionally or unintentionally did not include language pursuant specifically for coin by coin exchange, why would they continue to distinguish between sale and exchange.  Coinbase doesn't sell anything that could fall under the paying for goods and services clause.  They sell and exchange crypto.  Thats all coinbase does.
As to the congressional oversight letter, I am unable to locate a source for that, HOWEVER, if you consider the recent SEC letter and the changes to the tax code which specifically state that in-kind exchanges can ONLY apply to real estate, then that's a pretty clear signal that the law states in-kind doesn't work.
NOW, your point about who decides what is and isn't convertible....THERE is the ONLY loophole.  If no USD/EUR/or other official FIAT trading pair exists for a coin, then you could reasonably argue that it is not a convertible virtual currency.  If you exclusively traded those pairs then you could reasonably say that they do not constitute taxable events.
To answer your question, you, the taxpayer, would be responsible for proving that said currency was not a convertible asset at the time of the trade by virtue of there being no direct path to fiat from said currency.  You could even possibly go so far as to say that coins that only have a USDT pair also fall into this category, but honestly I think that one might be a stretch.  When the IRS comes knocking, they knock with a bill and its up to you to (and your lawyer) to prove otherwise.  As to the point about crypto that becomes convertible, transactions prior to that date would potentially not taxable, but transactions after that point would be.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:13:19
all of the official guidance from the IRS treats it as an asset, however with unique circumstances.   
For example, if you receive BTC from mining, you are required to count that as regular income based on the value of the BTC when you acquired it.  When you sell that BTC, then you will also be required to pay taxes on the change in value.  If you held for more than 12 months, congrats, cap gains, if not, so sorry, regular income.
If you are buying BTC then its pretty straight forward and similar to stocks.
I am going to go with the assumption that if I treat it as an asset, and take the change in value to be based on the USD value of the btc when I "spent" it, I suspect that will be best effort, however without a 1099, its going to be hard to claim that as capital gains.
I do want to speak to a CPA but I have my doubts that there are really any around me that will have what I need.

They are not "admitting" anything here.
The wording of the headline (and the sentiment of many comments in the thread) seems to imply that this is some sort of capitulation or acknowledgement of a superior rival.
It is the exact opposite.  It is a statement of fact, to a regulatory body, that underscores the "threat" that crypto poses to the entrenched banking system.
Most of the effort exerted by the financial regulatory offices of the world is around controlling, monitoring, and securing global monetary supply.  Crypto makes that difficult and in some cases impossible.
This is not "hey we better watch out", its "hey, are you going to do something about this because this could fuck up our day."
The fight is not over.
Not by a long shot.
If anything, its just getting started.  
The annoying gnat that everyone hoped would go away didn't, and now the people which outnumber every bank, corporation, and government by several orders of magnitude are adopting something beyond their control and manipulation.
It will not be easy.

EDIT: Relevant sections from the actual filing [here](
SECTION - GEOPOLITICAL


We are subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats of terrorism, and actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response thereto and/or military conflicts, which could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad as well as in the U.S.
For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&amp;A on page 70.
SECTION - OTHER


We operate in a highly competitive environment and will continue to experience intense competition from local and global financial institutions as well as new entrants, in both domestic and foreign markets. Additionally, the changing regulatory environment may create competitive disadvantages for certain financial institutions given geography-driven capital and liquidity requirements. For example, U.S. regulators have in certain instances adopted stricter capital and liquidity requirements than those applicable to non-U.S. institutions. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions to compete with technology companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions including electronic securities trading, marketplace lending and payment processing. Further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies. Increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology and/or reducing our market share, or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us.
Also from the OTHER section


Our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services, delivered through multiple distribution channels. Our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services at lower prices and this may impact our ability to grow revenue and/or effectively compete, in part, due to legislative and regulatory developments that affect the competitive landscape. Additionally, the competitive landscape may be impacted by the growth of non-depository institutions that offer products that were traditionally banking products as well as new innovative products. This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions.

Much in the same way they lump all foreign currencies together.
I can understand how you can logically come to this conclusion, however its based on a flawed assumption.  Just because the IRS doesn't differentiate between bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, iota, etc etc doesn't mean the coins they represent are the same "thing".
Look at it another way.
[Precious metals.  Silver bullion for silver bars is in kind.  Silver bullion for silver coins *might* be in-kind provided that the value of the coins is based solely on its content and not on any other characteristic.  Same goes for Gold.  I can trade bullion for Krugerrand's as like kind but I can't trade bullion for US gold coins because us gold coins are numismatic.  Their value is tied to the artistic nature, age, AND metal content.](
Crypto pretty easily fits into this scenario, far more easily than the idea that because crypto coins don't "exist" then they can't be property and thus all crypto is considered to be 1 unit of generic cryptographic value.

Too much wallstreet money in the system to close that pandoras box.  The political backlash from the up and coming millennials who are already completely disenfranchised  would be deafening not to mention the wall street lobby.
I spoke to a family friend recently that is actually on the Federal Reserve Advisory board (discovered after I read his wikipedia page) at a family function and he said three things after he stopped by and said "I heard you are mining bitcoin".  I confirmed and he said sell half as a hedge because there is too much uncertainty.  His closing comment was that blockchain was definitely going to change finance, its just a matter of how regulation will impact bitcoin.
Crypto is here to stay.  Period.  The crap from figureheads like Dimon is just the wailing and gnashing of teeth, primarily over the fact they can't patent blockchain and that as a technology its going to change the way the world handles asset transfer.
You're right.  They can't directly impact bitcoin but they can regulate the hell out of the edges to make handling it, hodling it, and transacting with it legally precarious.
I just don't think that's a realistic outcome anymore.  Especially since several governments have already come out as pro-crypto.

short answer, mining is still "viable" in that you can build rigs/buy hardware that will allow you to mine cryptos.
You will have to participate in a pool and  depending on the coin, amount you spent, and operating costs, your break even ROI may be as short as 10 months.  Most scenarios put ROI out farther, in some cases to infinity.  Of course as the value changes, this can change but the math and the uncertainty makes my head hurt.
You will NOT be successful with a single mining rig mining by yourself.  Lots of other good responses here that cover the technicals.

Coinbase makes it easy for someone to sign up, buy x dollars worth of bitcoin and participate.
They also make it easy to divest the bitcoin.
You pay for the convenience by not being able to set the price you want to buy/sell at and through higher fees on deposits/withdrawls (up to 4% but have a structure that changes fees depending on a couple factors)
GDAX is a real trading platform.  If you want to buy $500 worth of bitcoin, you have to figure out how much bitcoin that is on your own and make the trade.  Upside is GDAX is WAY cheaper if you aren't afraid to do some of the legwork or wait for the trade to execute.  I think the fees on GDAX top out somewhere in the .25%, but that's only if you aren't using the order book and are being lazy.
There are a lot of people out there that would be intimidated by something like GDAX.  Most investors don't hop on scott trade or where ever and place limit orders for stocks and funds, instead they call up their "guy" at Wells Fargo, Schwab, JP Morgan and say buy me some of X stock.
Coinbase provides that level of simplicity and they turn a healthy income from it, enough to cover the small percentage of users that use GDAX.  Plus low fees is attractive to customers and the more customers, the better it is for the exchange.

Finally got around to claiming my BCH, but now I am on the fence about converting to fiat or converting to ETH.
With the coming POW change, converting to ETH seems rather enticing.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:26:35
I think the biggest thing is a lack of understanding about the fundamental differences between ETH and BTC.
The primary one being that ETH is not technically a store of value. Couple that with the fact that ETH is in the EXTREMELY nascent stages of development, The perception that the barrier to entry on mining is lower than BTC and "easier", and you have a lot of FOMO out there because of BTC, the current ETH market is being largely driven by speculation and an attempt to convert ETH into BTC for hodling.
I strongly believe that ETH has a place at the table, but its not as a store of value.  The value in ETH will be the DAPPS and the capabilities for smart contracts which we haven't even begun to realize yet.  I think we are at LEAST 6 months from even seeing the beginnings of the future of ETH.
I have stated this before and I think this is where the landscape will end up.
BTC will be the granddaddy store of value, the "old crytpo".  Stable, Reliable, valuable.  The crypto bedrock if you will.  Large National banks will hold BTC as security for fiat.  Litecoin will become the digital cash for POS and day to day transactions simply because its cheaper, a little less volatile, faster transactions, and still like granddaddy, a good store of value.  Then there is ETH.  ETH will be the engine that drives it all with near instant transactions and complex capabilities.  It will be the sidechain to rule all sidechains and be intimately intertwined with both LTC and BTC.
I believe Crypto will never replace fiat, it will just provide a new anchor for value.

I am very interested in POS as a potential for passive income streams on ETH.
From what I have read, minimum stake is somewhere in the 30's, and they estimate about a 9% return.  There is a lot that is still yet to be decided so this could all change.  Even if I don't have enough to get in on POS, I should still be able to sell the ETH for more than the BCH was ever worth.

Claiming the fork is a taxable event much like taking possession of mined coins.
If the forked coins weren't claimed, then waiting a year to claim them does nothing.  In order for the 12 month timer to start, you have to have bought or taken control of coins.  The former is merely a reference point for calculating gains while the latter is a taxable event due to realized income.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:45:46
I used bittrex to convert into ETH.
Keeping my BTC as BTC but want a piece of that ETH pie as well since I think there are some interesting things happening there.  Plus I think ETH will be reasonably fluid and easily swapped for some time, which is not something I can say of BCH.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:54:59
I believe the implication here is that development has continued on BTC while BCH has tapered off and does not show a lot of active ongoing improvement.
~~I have not done the analysis but it would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between development activity and price/value of a given coin.  I suspect that "dead" coins most likely have "dead" development and that the github activity or lack thereof may be an indicator of overall project health.~~
[Someone did some analysis.](  It suggests a positive correlation coefficient between number of commits and market cap.  Its not SUPER strong, but it is positive which means there is some correlation.  Now I am not suggesting that number of commits is WHY a coin has more market cap, just that it may be one aspect of analysis which suggests how healthy a given coin is and thus its potential for adoption.
This of course does not take away the fact that OP is likely trolling.
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:45:34
I understand the difference between short term and long term gains.  For tax purposes short term gains aren't a special class and are taxed as regular income.
You are correct in that your cost basis is $0.  But how do you calculate the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the forked coins?  In order to determine gains or losses (when you liquidate) you must determine FMV and a date of possession.
Now, there are two schools of thought here.  The first one says FMV is calculated on the day of the fork, and the other says FMV is calculated on the day you claim the coins.
Forked coins are unique in that you cannot "spend" them without first "claiming" them by moving them from the BTC wallet to a BCH wallet.  This is a deliberate action which the holder has  some control over.  For example, the day that coinbase released BCH to users holding BTC on their platform would be considered the day the coins were "claimed" for the purposes of establishing FMV.
Whichever camp you are in, you realize regular income equal to the FMV of the BCH on the day you pick (day of the fork or day you take control of the coins) that has to be reported to the IRS.  There are two very strong reasons why it works this way.  
The first is the IRS guidance for miners which states that coins earned from mining is regular income equivalent to the FMV of the coins on the day you receive them.  While this isn't EXACTLY what is happening with a fork, it's close.
The other example from case law is around "Found Money".  The IRS has established that found money, regardless of how long it was missing or outstanding, is considered regular income in the tax year for which it is realized.  If your rich uncle dies and leaves you a million dollars but the lawyers can't get it to you, it doesn't matter if it took 1 year or 10 years, you're paying the same tax rate on it when you finally get the check.
So if you are referring to people that haven't claimed the coins and think that waiting a year to claim them is going to change their tax liability, it won't.  If you're talking about people that claimed BCH in August and are waiting to dump them to get long term capital gains, then that is a little different, but I would argue that the smart ones sold when it hit $2k+.  Personally I would rather pay 35% on $2k than 15% on $700 and make almost 2.5x more.

Irony? yes.  Absolutely.
Sure Fire bad thing for Crypto?  Not really.
The banks need crypto, not the other way around.  
They will be made obsolete in time, but there will always be someone that needs banking services.  Short term, they will profit because that's what they do and in the process they will make crypto more accessible, more accepted, and more prevalent in society.  Eventually we will transcend the need for banks in the traditional sense, but I see them as a stepping stone.
Also MOST people don't want to deal with the security headache that is being your own bank right now.  A house fire can wipe out your entire crypto holding if you aren't doing it right and the problem is, doing it wrong is VERY easy right now.
So until there are some more user friendly solutions for DR and data security regarding hot wallets for the everyman, banks acting as holding companies for crypto are kind of a necessary evil right now.  
In the end the most important thing is that we get away from unsecured fiat.  That will put an end to much of the dickery banks have been doing.

Extreme corruption aside, which basically makes what I am about to say nigh impossible.  What would happen if as part of the revaluation, the central bank of venezuela moved to a crypto standard and backed the new bolivar against bitcoin.  
What happens when countries use bitcoin to secure their currency like they would use gold?
Of course countries would have to disclose their BTC holdings to really be able to prove the valuation (like that's going to happen).
Realistically speaking this could be a future state of the world where fiat currencies are tied to bitcoin or some other crypto.
I think what is happening in Venezuela is incredibly important on the global stage for crypto.  It is the exact situation that crypto was designed to mitigate.  How things transpire may be a bellwether for other countries in similar scenarios.

You're talking about the guy that tried to take over bitcoin with bitcoin cash.
edit: Looks like I hit a nerve there.  Look at the facts.  Bitmain makes mining hardware and has repeatedly done everything it could to push onchain scaling and BCH as "the real bitcoin".  On chain scaling directly favors miners and increases the costs of running a full node by increasing the storage requirements thus leading to more centralization. The refrain of segwit won't do anything meaningful and lightning is still years away have all turned out to be bullshit.  I am sorry the coup failed, but downvoting me won't change the fact that BCH has a small dev team of questionable pedigree and has exhibited no innovation other than twiddling a value here and there to change the configuration.

I get conflicting info on that.
it would appear if the total is less than 400 then no, you don't need to report it but also apparently any income regardless of the amount needs to be reported.  
Do I think the IRS is going to come after me for &lt;$10 in "income" from mining 3 years before the guidance came out, no.  Not really.  And if they do, then I have a bigger issue with the fact that it will cost me as a tax payer far more to pursue that avenue then the taxes on it are worth.
At the end of the day it wasn't a conscious effort to skirt the rules and even if they "threw the book" at me for fines, we're talking less than $10 in owed taxes.  Mined enough to be a maybe future millionaire but not enough to retire now.
I am more interested on the back end since really the acquisition side for me is practically NIL from a tax liability perspective.
I need to figure out how to claim that income in a scenario where I am "spending" BTC directly for goods.
I mean the math is easy, my cost basis is so small that its practically irrelevant, the documentation is where things get dicey.  I don't think using BTC to buy stuff direct from Steam and NewEgg are going to generate a 1099 because neither steam nor newegg has my SSN.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:11:06
Just found this brief :
It basically says that the IRS still doesn't know exactly how to treat every type of transaction.
I mean if I buy something through a retailer that uses bitpay, technically I am converting to fiat and then using the proceeds of that conversion for the sale.
In that scenario, I believe my BTC is a capital asset and I get capital gains.
What is less clear is how to treat the direct exchange of BTC for goods without the intermediate fiat step from the perspective of the buyer.  The sellers side is pretty easy.

ETH to become the defactor standard for trustless organizations and smart contracts.

@_date: 2013-11-15 22:13:54
So therein lies the conundrum.
Are bitcoins to be treated like stock? (in which case you pay only when you sell them and only on the difference between what you paid and what you sold it for)
HOWEVER since bitcoins are not stocks and are currency, in reality, it should have been counted as earned income, which would have been around 1.00 (the earliest values I can find are from july 18th 2010 USD)  I got my block on july 11.
There are some peculiar rules when dealing with income in currency other than USD.  It seems to suggest that any gains I make on the conversion of the "foreign" currency into US would be considered regular income in the year during which the conversion occurs.
Merely having them in my possession does not constitute a tax liability until such a time that I attempt to convert them.
This brings up another consideration.  Lets say I get paid in Euros....I still have to pay taxes on the converted value of those euros (usually less what I may have paid in local income taxes)  It doesn't seem right that if I were to then convert those post tax euros into USD that i would taxed again on any appreciation that might have taken place.
I suspect that if I were to get audited over a claimed bitcoin disbursement, the rules that apply might be up for interpretation since there is no existing caselaw..... 
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:41:41
Bitcoin is the foundation of the holy trinity.
LTC for small day to day transactions, ETH for contracts and similar arrangements. And BTC is the gold standard backing it all used for large value transactions and securing value in all other cryptos.
There are only two things that can stop crypto.  A fundamental flaw in the design which irreparably destroys trust in the network(possible, but unlikely at this point) or a complete collapse of the global communications networks used.
I see BTC as the "mother" currency with all others seeming to be designed to have more total coins than BTC thus lower potential value simply because larger supply dilutes the value.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:42:21
 Nope. Just as suspect. 
I got my coins CPU mining before GPU mining was a thing.  I intend to collect more to spend but hold onto my mined coins until the last coin has been mined.  Only then will we really see what BTC is capable of.  
I see a lot is sensational news around BTC, positive and negative.  When the sensational crap comes from fresh accounts with uninspired names, I can't help but think that its an attempt to use the wide reach of reddit to move the BTC market in a specific direction.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:08:19
I guess you have me all figured out. 
you can't deny the fact that there has been some interesting movement.  Do I think its a conspiracy?  No. Am I some anti establishment banks are bad mmmmkay bitcoinista?  Hardly. 
Just a skeptic who got curious and lucky when bitcoin was only a few months old and I am really curious to see how this all plays out.  Do I hope for a huge payday? Sure, what I would rather see is the day when I can buy a house in BTC through traditional processes without having to involve centrally controlled fiat.  I qualify it with centrally controlled because let's be honest, bitcoin is fiat, payment processing and proof of work aside. 
On a larger scale bitcoin( and other crypto currencies) are the logical next step in the democratization of the world that is facilitated by durable world wide information networks.  Online activism is more effective at mobilizing significant societal segments. The killer app of the internet is anything that allows people to accomplish what was traditionally reserved for governments and large corporations.   Yeah okay so this paints me as a little anti establishment but it doesn't mean I am not hedging my bets with traditional investment vehicles. I consider myself to be more of a pragmatic optimist. 
At any rate back to the point...machine translation is poor at best.  When that is combined with a language with significant ideomatic differences, its very easy to miss a subtle difference which can change the meaning significantly.   My only real point is that people need to consider the source and the mouthpiece parroting that source before freaking out.   Personally I have zero fiat invested in btc.  If it goes nowhere I am out nothing so I really have nothing to lose.
