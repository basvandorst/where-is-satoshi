he never said they would steal it for the bitcoins,
People steal copper piping and sell it for scrap value.
Just thinking about a that being handed into a junk yard a for a dollar or two.

 [enter stage right, Middle age woman]
"that ATM has a longline, I'll use this one there isn't any wait!"
     Inserts card and without paying attention to prompts hits 100$
"WTF this ATM is broken and it stole my money! It just gave me a receipt and no cash!"
     Cue phone call to 911/Bank
 [End scene]
I would cover the damn thing with so many disclaimers you would be able to see it from the ISS. Every screen on the display would have it as well. Similar to the "THIS MACHINE DOES NOT GIVE CHANGE" on claw machine games.

My most favorite is I can see bitcoin becoming the world currency. The Science fiction currency of the 'Credit'  A simply easy to use mathematical currency. The idea of this make me giddy with excitement.

Since just starting out with Bitcoin...two days ago and trying to grasp everything about this currency, How i see this becoming massively widespread a couple things need to happen.
**Ease of use** - With pretty much everything these days includes camera the QR code system will become a mainstay, The plastic/metal Public cards for payment/credit will play a pivotal role in ease of use and wide acceptance. People need to be able to relate the new system to the their current system in order to transition easily.
**Market stability** - We can all see what happens when a normal paper currency changes drastically and what once use to buy a loaf of bread now requires 100x the same amount. With the USD we have had great market stability and the swing i have seen in the past couple days would terrify most normal consumers/people not use to market swings.
**Tangible wealth** - Before you will get John Q Public who has zero knowledge/interest in cryptology or hash values involved in any large sense the concept of physical currency will need to still be around. The physical coins that i have seen look very well made but would require an associated reader synonymous to a current coin reader, but with the require built in camera system to recognize the coins value then refund the balance of your transaction to your account. (deposit plastic card comes in handy here)
**Smart phone-apps** - So far my experience with them is the blockchain app, and as far as ease of use it is amazing as far as i can tell. Built-in QR scanner for outgoing transactions, BTC to currency conversion on the fly. The next step is a real up to the second tracker for the current market value and the ability to purchase BTC on the fly. 
I see BTC as the currency of the future, growing up with science fiction as entertainment, all the books/TV shows/movies they all had one thing in common. One worldwide currency, the credit. It makes me excited when i see news posted here about BTC gaining traction in another country.
We are the verge of the future, and it excites me to no end. Now if you will excuse me, i have to visit another website to earn .00001 BTC
