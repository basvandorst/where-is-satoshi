Does anybody look at the new blocks mined and try and determine if they are being held or put into circulation?

If instead of creating 184 billion bitcoin, they created 5 or 6, how likely is it that it would have been caught?
Does anybody audit the blockchain to make sure the number of bitcoin in existence is correct?

For an individual, sure. But for a company, no. Once a company receives bitcoins, how do they store them safely? How do they stop employees from being able to steal the coins? How do they not depend on one employee having the keys, in case they get run over by a bus? None of these questions are impossible to answer, but it's more involved that a bit of CSS/HTML. That's why most companies are still using a payment process who has figured it out.

Just wait until the next wave of bitcoin newbies.

Would it be possible to DDOS (or some other attack) the mining pools to knock them offline to make mining easier?

I think the problem is, in the short term, there is no good reason to use bitcoin as a consumer. The only people using bitcoin now believe in it and are willing to put up with the difficulties to help it succeed. 
Your example doesn't make sense, the store gets an extra $800, not me. Why do I care which business gets the extra money? Or maybe they give a 3% discount for using bitcoin, but I'd probably lose at least that much on transfer fees buying bitcoin.
The long term benefits will never convince people either, the average person always optimizes for short term benefit over long term. 
In the medium term, services will make bitcoin much easier to use and add useful features on top, but they will charge fees, so now I'm paying fees again.
If you expect people to:
- Purchase bitcoin
- Secure their bitcoin
- Give up purchase rewards
- Give up buying on credit
- Give up consumer protections
For a 3% discount, you are crazy. The average person doesn't care about inflation, they have no savings anyway. Buying with bitcoin only makes sense for people who got in early since the value of their bitcoin has increased so much.
I think people familiar with bitcoin still underestimate how hard it is. Every week in the sub there are people posting about how they lost all their coins.
I don't think bitcoin can win taking a front on assault on credit cards/banking, I think it has to focus on niches where the fees are exorbitant, like remittance. Slowly expand niche to niche until it's everywhere.

I've never understood why anybody would use those kiosks. I just got back from the UK. I got 100 GPB from a back machine for 186.48 CAD plus a $5 fee. That cost me about $8 or 4%. If I'd known about the $5 fee I would have taken larger amounts of cash less often, but it still doesn't seem that expensive.
My credit card was giving 1.876086 compared to 1.881000 of my bank card. (But no fee on the credit card) Probably should have used the card more.

Why are popular addresses excluded?

Less than 50% as you've defined success. Greater than 50% succeeding in a few niche roles.
The greatest hurdles to adoption aren't technical, they are social. The benefits of Bitcoin are fairly abstract and long term. Most people think short term, pay cheque to pay cheque. I don't believe people will put the effort into learning about Bitcoin just to save 1% - 2%.

How will this have any different effect than just auto buying bitcoin with each pay cheque?

The perception that it's too easy to lose your money. Every time there is a new wave of bitcoin users a bunch of them lose their money, either it's stolen, an exchange disappears or they just lose access to their wallets.
If the perception becomes that your more likely to lose money than make money, the next wave of new users won't come.
Bitcoin needs $2.2 million coming in per day to maintain the price, and if the new users aren't putting money into the system, the price will slowly fall. As the price falls, more and more people will try and cash out before the price gets too low. 
Bitcoin won't completely fail, but it could relegated to only niche uses,

Is this just fantasy?
