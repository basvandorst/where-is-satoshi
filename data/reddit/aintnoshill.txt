Yeah, no one should be cheering at an accidental bitcoin owner asking to cash out.

What about isolated seed storage that some wallet apps (e.g. Natrium) use? The seed will have to be loaded into memory for signing, but I don't see how other apps are going to access that, especially if it's a non rooted device. If you ever intend to spend cryptocurrency on a regular basis, you need at least *some* convenient way to access smaller amounts of funds.

Correct. It is not a zero sum game (and benefits all the bearers) once people start to actually use crypto wealth gains for barter instead of trying to rid it for as much fiat as possible.

Yes, Go Mic is good value for money

That's nothing new. It's the reason why operators prefer to put them in indoor crowded places

I think they mean hodling as in 'not dumping for fiat'. Of course you can buy nice things with crypto nonetheless.

I see your point. Yet, dumping is what causes so much havoc in the first place. If everyone dumps simultanously, no one gains.

I'll put this on my list of reasons to switch to crypto

We will probably see a similar transformation that already happened to the WWW itself. More surveillance, less freedom.

Yes, no one knows how many of these transactions were used for real purchases. Also, in permissionless networks, anyone can generate as much accounts as they want. Most wallets generate a new change address by default, therefore artificially inflating the number.

Same thing happened at viabtc when china banned them. Thankfully they sent a text to my phone on the day of deactivation

They dont like arbitrage from localbitcoins and similar hotwallets either

He literally released 'Max coin' as a silver bullion limited edition 
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:51:10
He originally promoted precious metals who obviously don't sign checks. His show also covered Riccardo Spagni from Monero. Max is a bit shady though, I have to agree - he predicted 500$/oz silver. There also is another gold guru called Mike Maloney who randomly started to shill Hashgraph - that one triggered so many red flags with me

Technically it was his co-host Stacy who introduced us to BTC I think. I remember the exact moment she mentioned it but I can't find the episode. She was trapped in an airport and used her webcam for filming. I didn't look BTC up until the second time they covered it on their show

Especially with asset forfeiture, insane lawsuits and stuff like that, i feel more comfortable with cryptocurrencies than i do with tangible assets.
