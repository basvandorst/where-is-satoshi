Not the point. The total volume of coins traded in a day is meaningless when the average trade is as small as it is. 
A daily volume of 1 million coins is made up of 1,000,000's of trades each hour, half on the green side/half on the red side, with the average trade &lt; 0.01 BTC. You better believe that selling chunks of volume into that market will move it pretty hard.
I know someone who is scalping 1.80% per trade using "just" 30 Bitcoins. He's making multiple trades on each side per day. This on a small exchange with a daily volume of 400 or so BTC. He's taken his initial investment off the table and is making a tidy income for himself with a simple scalping bot. He would screw that market for himself and lose all profit in commission if he put in a market price sell of 30 BTC though. Instead he's able to bounce off the walls he sets up on each side.

Absolutely. 
Institutions, exchanges, and some no doubt owned by holders who can't access them for whatever reason (lost wallets, deceased, incarcerated), some of which will never be touched. 
However, there are quite a few large balances in wallets held by long time hodlers. I think it would be naive to think someone with a balance of 50,000 coins won't realise their profit at some stage. How many of these people are there? Sure, if these people are well intentioned and are aware of the damage they could cause then it doesn't need to be a problem. Coins can be dripped into the market, or sold OTC. 
But there is still a massive imbalance in the distribution and I can see it being a problem sooner or later. I actually think this issue could be the eventual downfall of Bitcoin and a more fairly distributed coin could replace it as the standard.

I'm looking for any opinions on what effect the BTC wealth distribution might have on the markets should BTC reach anything like what is predicted (say US$50k +). I think this wealth distribution is the elephant in the room myself, but would like to hear any opinion on the matter. Any links to known articles discussing this would be appreciated.

Dude, I'm sorry, but if you don't think a 16,000 coin dump will "make much of a difference" you don't understand the workings of this market. 
Those MTGox coins DO have the potential to move the market in a big way. Hopefully they get traded OTC or are drip-fed into the market, but regardless, small investors are still at the mercy of other large holders who are capable of crashing the market pretty hard. 
Those large balances are the elephant in the room. They are there for all to see but nobody really wants to acknowledge them. 
Posts that do acknowledge that we investors are at the mercy of some random BTC millionaire get downvoted because, well, let's just try and push that idea out of sight and out of mind (a human trait that seems magnified in this crypto world, along with a couple other characteristics we have).
In my opinion there are still a few shakeouts to come before this market settles to the point where we can use crypto as actual currency (no shit Sherlock) and I think a lot of investors will unfortunately get hurt in the process. The reason I think this is because I believe in the general idea that there is no free lunch. 
This space seems overpopulated with people that haven't learnt that basic premise, but that's ok. I think that's mainly because crypto is populated by a relatively youthful majority and the youth can bounce back if they lose a chunk of dough. 
Anyway, I believe Bitcoin is here for the long term. I think it has a solid foundation and a resilience that other coins do not have. Be careful not to invest more than you can afford to lose and you can ride the market without worry as it plays out. There will be swings larger than today's 5% to come and it's not worth the stress to have too much invested on them. 
I think there's still time to gradually get into the market. 
Disclaimer: I suck at predicting which way this thing goes.

Well I hope you pick the right stocks and you make lots of lovely money and buy a nice home. 
If you ever want to buy BTC again, maybe just buy a little bit each week. Honestly, I don't think BTC should be used as a "get rich quick" scheme, although I realise that's not a popular opinion. I would actually suggest just putting a regular (modest and affordable) % of disposable income in for contingency's sake in the event the current economic climate goes to shit and the stocks disappoint. You never know.

Today I heard the Dotcom market was $6 trillion in 1999. In that context a Bitcoin MC of $3T doesn't seem implausible.

You're a patronising cunt. You're using a 25% crash in price this week to come up with some lazy hindsight biased prediction. Nice one. Go and collect the Craig Wright award for obnoxious moron of the week. 
Most people interested in bitcoin aren't into technical analysis or trend analysis or whatever the fuck you call it and nobody really has any idea of what bitcoin is actually worth in dollar terms. The fact that price fluctuates wildly understandably gets people excited about making some free money, but those people need to be shaken out of the space before bitcoin or its successor can gain a proper foothold. 
Bitcoin or something very similar WILL become the main means of exchange and store of value in a world that continues this path of technological advancement. That's pretty much a given. Visit today's lecture halls of economic and computer studies and you might come to understand that the generation coming out of tertiary education now and henceforth will be using blockchain and cryptocurrency much like yesterday's generation uses email and ATM machines. The only way this doesn't happen in my very humble opinion is if cunts like you continue to fuck this planet up so much that we will be so focussed on pure survival for a millennium or two that we won't be thinking about trivial amusements such as an Internet of flowing micro payments.

Why Bitcoin over stablecoins? 
I don't know much about stablecoins, but are there any that have the same trustless, decentralised, immutable, secure, deflationary, censorship resistant qualities of bitcoin?

When is the best time to buy 10,000 btc?
The day after you sell 1,000 btc.

And all those benefits are being paid for by other people. Often by people less fortunate. 
I get emails and letters from my bank constantly asking if I'd like more credit. They act like desperate beggars with their weekly offers and freebies FFS. A lot of people can't afford to resist those offers and they end up as slaves for life supporting the "benefits" people like you are getting. No thanks. 
I mean, it's a personal choice and you're welcome to the banking system you use, but Bitcoin offers an alternative now for people who look beyond the free plastic cards and smiling faces offering mortgages and car loans and 48 month interest free never pay it off washing machines.

ABC News Radio in Australia also gives the BTC price in their hourly finance updates. 
Now you hear: ASX, Dow, Nikkei, $US, BTC. 
Whereas a year ago it was: ASX, Dow, Nikkei, $US, Gold. 
Not sure when they added BTC. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:01:08
The last time I listened there was no Gold, but I'm not a regular listener so couldn't say if that was the norm now. I'll tune in on the way home from work this afternoon and pay more attention :)

She should've replied and asked for a reasonable time to pay in light of her condition.
