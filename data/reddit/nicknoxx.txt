To some extent it depends where you are but generally you need an exchange. Coinbase, circle and Kraken are examples but there are many to chose from. Pick one that exchanges with your local currency.  You will need to prove your identity (unless you use a service like localbitcoins) then you can send them some money.  You can then buy bitcoin at the market rate.  I'd advise creating a wallet on your computer. I use Electrum. Then withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange to your wallet. Et voilà you have bitcoin.

You realise this link mentions the E coin and that is banned here?
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:20:45
That's probably the most expensive way to buy them.

You can buy lots of new coins on Kraken. Do you have a reason to want to go elsewhere?

After the death of Alphabay the dnm is increasingly becoming interested in Monero
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:18:42
Yeah, good luck with that.   (FX: Hides ledger)

Or no.  Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:07:43
Yeah, we know, that's why the dark markets are moving to Monero.

Technically you may be liable for capital gains tax but as far as I'm aware banks don't report to the Inland revenue, they just have to do the KYC bullshit.

I bought at £2 but sold at 300

Not only that, I'd suggest that the main reason has become so successful is because it's used on the darknet.

What will be their reaction when I reply £2?

It's cheaper to buy in the clear and tumble than buy anonymously.

Modified Blockchain? Smart contract? Sounds like (whisper) Ethereum.

For me, large amount is relative. I bought btc at about £2. Then I forgot about them until they were about $600. I'd bought through mtgox so I tried to sell through them. But having transferred my coin to them I couldn't get my money out.  My original investment was small but my losses were huge. I try to think of the former and move on. I'm more careful about where I keep and exchange my coins now and I'm hoping ethereum will give me the chance to regain some profit.

Until they require ID, then you might have a problem.
