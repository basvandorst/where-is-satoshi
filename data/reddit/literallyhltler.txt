Could you go further as to explain what "levers" could potentially exists with BTC or other cryptocurrencies Is it possible? Does it defeat the point of why others here praise BTC?

I don't think you have any idea how currency works.

You sound smart enough but just here to warn you about wolves in sheep's clothing. I got burned really bad recently by someone pretending to help.

This reminded me of the HowToBasic videos.

That's beside the point...

Doesn't necessarily invalidate what he is saying though. This is coming from someone who does not believe what he is saying purely speaking of BTC. I stand to lose some money on this coin myself, but I've used it to buy stuff and to me that's what we should be worried about - not what investors are saying, otherwise I question your motives. Sorry if this sounds snobby.

I'm sorry but isn't that statement completely inaccurate? Cryptos aren't backed by any government or centralised institution. That's the whole point.
I feel like you chose the most inflammatory and obviously misleading statement you could. Why are you here? If you truly are an advocate of so-called labor-backed moneys then you are also an advocate for a monetary revolution and cryptocurrency is the first medium to come anywhere close to a revolution, probably in the history of paper money.
Also want to point out that your idea is very questionable. The value of labor is completely arbitrary. You can classify things as much as you like, that doesn't make it any less arbitrary. Not saying that it can't work, but I just don't see the advantages over decentralised non-fiat digital currency.

Do you guys actually believe this shit? I mean really.

But how will we do it? Maybe the water supply?

I knew they were separate but I had no idea it was private - I just assumed. Not privately funded by Elon though, I am assuming lots of private investors are concerned.

If investing was that easy... Investors are holding onto the hope that SpaceX will be the first company to commercialise space-travel et al  effectively on a mass scale. If SpaceX accomplishes this, which they are on pace to, then the investors will be very happy with their decisions I'm sure.
It's not totally unreasonable to say 500-1000 humans could travel with the BFR (in development) to cislunar space and enjoy the dark side of the moon.
At a price of $250,000 USD per seat with 1000 seats you're looking at $250,000,000 operating budget per mission.
This shit is real folks, it's just a matter of time.
