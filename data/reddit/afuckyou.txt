This sub is amazing.

They should, BTC is a joke.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:52:15
You guys are proud corporate shills are saying you are a good currency? The group here has changed a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:12:46
I mean, they have a point though. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:38:04
Lol. Arnt the transaction fees hundreds of dollars?
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:41:32
Why not use your own? Bitcoin is becoming a lot like apple.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:21:54
God damnit. I knew I should have invested when it was 300 per coin.
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:34:48
Where is the bank again? I forget how they work. And if the whole Internet goes boom and they have to restart it, what happens to the coin? Also, can't the coin be erased? It's quite high in value right now.

Bitcoin should never be advertised as anonymous. You don't "need to get into it." You just don't say bitcoin is anonymous.
Even if you are a seller, when you go to turn in all that money you made selling product on the Silk Road you subject your self to being tracked. 
The only reason bitcoin is anonomyous is because the US and world organizations haven't put into place reporting mechanisms. 
Bitcoin tumblers are often scams. In order for them to work, you have to trust the tumbler to take your money and hen give your money back. If you deal in large amounts of money, that's about the stupidest thing you could ever do. Exit strategy is an intergrated part of the bitcoin community. 
The anonymous aspect of bitcoin is a joke. It's like turning on private mode and expecting your browsing habits not to be tracked.

I'm not sure you know how percents work.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:21:53
Ah hopefully it drops to like 1 dollar a coin. So I can buy 60,000 and then go back up lol.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:07:08
I don't think it's going to stop any time soon. I'll bet it will break 9k this time next year.

Bitcoin is not anonymous. Bitcoin is publicly tracked. You can see person id exchanging bitcoin for EVERY transaction.
So your online identity is immediately betrayed when you use bitcoin. Bam, right there. Literally having your id and amount transferred for EVERY transaction, 100% publicly available for anyone to look up. That is the opposite of anonymous. 
And the transaction doesn't go away. Once you have a user id to focus in on, you can see ALL transactions for that user id since bitcoin started. Not anonymous. 
Then you say well your physical identity is not known. Okay, unless you try to use your money for real things. And let's be honest, that's the point of money. To buy things like food housing and shelter. That's the point of money right? To have things in real life? 
Once you buy something real or convert something to cash, your online identity and your physical identity are betrayed because you must either physically go convert the coin to cash or you have to give someone an address to send it to.
Either way, if you are using bitcoin for nefarious activities, you can be EASILY tracked. I'm a moron and I could track someone using bitcoin. Let alone some one with resources like a letter agency.

I think it's going to keep skyrocketing. Assuming there remains a finite amount, bit coin is still catching on. So the more it gains traction the more it will grow. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:52:40
Bit coin went from decentralized to owned by one company. This is an embarrsment to the name. If i were the creator i would sell my coin just to spit what it has become.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:57:13
How does it protect you from the federal reserve? Will jobs start paying in bit coin? Since when did but coin buy groceries?

In real life, there are legal ways to launder money. Bitcoin is 100% traceable, all the way back to the person using it. And it's not even real. It's not tangible property. 
You can sit there and say it's an amazing way to launder money. It's not. It is not better than the existing methods the black market allready has. 
Get over it.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:16:39
How are you suppose to launder 100k in cash, or bitcoin. Just walk me through the process.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:08:34
You really don't have a clue what you are talking about. It hurts so bad. I'm just going to stop responding. 
It's like, if you want to buy a candy bar. But you can't. And you are with you friends trying to figure out how to buy a candy bar.
And your over there in the corner saying, "I know I know I know. Let's jump off a bridge. That will get us our candy bar." And all your friends are trying to explain to you that jumping off a bridge has nothing to do with buying a candy bar. But you just won't fucking stop saying that you all should jump off a bridge for a candy bar.
And you don't understand that what your saying has nothing to do with and adds nothing to the topic. Like when your a kid, and your playing chemist, and you mix shit togther that won't have a reaction but you expect it to. You can't just make up words and think that you now can launder money on bitcoin.
You just want to hear that bitcoin is good for laundering money. The fact is that it's not. It is not good for laundering money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:23:35
I like how people refer to this as a dip. It was clear market manulipulation. Will they do it again, yes. And will they tank it again, yes. As long as there's people who loose big, they will have a lot to gain. Bitcoin is no longer open source, etc etc etc. You all have heard it all before but still shill.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:09:08
So, the only point that I am making is that bitcoin is traceable. 
I am not money laundering genius. I also don't care to suggest the logistics. 
My point is that, if you are the target of an investigstion. The NSA, CIA, and FBI can easily do a middle man attack and locate your user name and thus ledger activity. 
Bit coin is not a way to hide. Unless you strictly keep everything online, which means you wouldent get any thing physical. As soon as you move from net to real work it's traceable to you.

Just to start with, a small money laundering buisness will be 1 mill per year. 100k is not enough to even show up a blip on the IRS radar. 1 mil and you might just go unnoticed, depending on how you spend it. 
But let's just play a small game. 100k, how's that sound? How the fuck do you even turn 100k into laundered money on bitcoin? How do you think that works?  
Do you think it's magic? You throw a stack of 100k dollars at a computer screen that has bitcoin written on it and it's magically legal? YOU HAVE TO REPORT THE REVENUE TO THE IRS AND BE TAXED TO MAKE IT LEGAL. 
You would have to set up a legal buisness with a bitcoin wallet. Then take several hundreds of transactions on YOUR ledger, from several hundred different accounts to make it look like you were running a legit buisness. 
And that's just the THEROY. What about in practice. How the fuck do you get 100k cash into several hundred different bitcoin accounts? Well, dummy, you would literally have to fucking make the account , and PHYSICALLY, THROUGH THE MAIL, mail people cash, which they pay bitcoin for. 
God I'm not even going into ANYMORE. your whole you haven't explained shit. I HAVEN'T EXPLAINED SHUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BUY BITCOIN. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT EXIT SCAMS. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE DARK WEB. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT SILK ROAD. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT VPN. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT GOVERMENT SPYING.
You don't know shit. And you stupid smug remarks about how I am some how explaining shit wrong compounds fruatration.
How about you go fucking look something up and read you moron. Your opening your God damn trap when you have NO FUCKING CLUE what you are talking about. 
You don't even know how to LEGALLY launder money. You think you are so gad damn smart, cause some dumb fuck said bit coin is anonomyous.
BITCOIN IS NOT ANONOMYOUS. EVER. YOU HAVE TO SEND SHIT THROUGH THE MAIL. YOU HAVE TO LOG ONTO A COMPUTER. YOU PHYSICALLY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT.
WHEN I SAY TRUST ME. IT MEANS EITHER READ UP AND LEARN THE LOGISTICS OR SHUT THE FUCK UP 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:36:58
You are wrong. I'm sorry dude. Bitcoin is not a good tool to launder money. If you are untouchable by the cops it is. There are several reasons, other than the ones I liste, and I'm not getting into. The nut hold the goverment the has on the Internet is insane. It's not good for laundering money. Trust me dude.
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:14:59
Your account is not anonomyous. You have to log into it. Meaning you physically have to go to a computer and log in. Aka, not anonymous. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:14:56
Bitcoin is not good for laundering money. The transactions are public. As soon as you turn it into physical money, or you turn cash into bitcoin, who you are is made available. You still need to launder the money before and after. 
So, an orginization like the goverment need only tap your Internet traffic, aka a middle man attack on your router, to trace you laundering money. A router middle man attack is one of the simplest things the goverment can do. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:15:39
You don't have a clue what you are talking about. It dosent matter. I don't turn dirty money to clean money. You obviously don't either. Money cleaning is for rich people dude. And yes, you 100% have to claim it. That is the purpose, to legally claim the money. And no, there's no legal way to do it. But there's a way that is commonly accepted. For example buying and selling art. And charitable foundations.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:20:15
The goverment wouldent start to figure out who's laundering money by checking an anonymous ledger. They would start with a suspect, then tap his connections.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:17:53
You are a funny guy. Like I said, it's not anonomyous. But you keep on with your bad self. I guess it dosent hurt being painfully ignorant if you arnt aware.
And a big paragraph of stupid, is still just a big paragraph of stupid. 
1. It's not anonomyous. I cannot stress this enough. The only anonomyous part is the transaction online. Everywhere part of the "laundering money" process takes place in the real world and is not anonomyous.
2. You have to mail cash. I'm sure you don't understand how this could be a problem. But anyone else reading this should immediately understand why this is a problem.
3. Just making and using the accounts to try to make it look legal is a logistic nightmare.
4. You can't just have money appear from a crypto currency and that makes it legal. The IRS and FBI will still want to know where you got it from.
For thoes reasons you would have to be an absolute moron to think laundering money on a crypto currency is a good option.
Also, you sound like an insurrefable little shit. Exams and your paultry attempt to use big words. You need not do either. And when you do you sound like a moron.
