All governments fall to corruption. When there is a source of power that can be bribed or coerced into meeting your needs, sociopaths will find any means necessary to obtain that power and wield it for their own ends. Whether the Constitution was powerless to stop our current corrupt government or enabled it, one thing is for certain, it is not fit to exist!

Police &amp; courts will always be around. They will just be private companies with competition whom you can select amongst. Monopolies never provide the best service for their captive customers. And yes, crime will be reduced. Who would voluntarily pay to have marijuana laws enforced?

Make it illegal, shut down all US exchanges, stage sting operations for localbitcoins, trace BTC protocols to ISPs and end users. It would not totally eliminate Bitcoins, but without an easy way to convert to $, it will be 90% dead.

Yes, so they can store their money into bitcoin instead of US Treasuries, which loses value or gold, both of which are non-secret. Since they make stuff for the whole world, they can also demand payment in bitcoin.

The Blockchain app is very dangerous! It allows you to create an account and receive payments in bit coins on your phone but then it also lets you forget the details of your account and if you don't add an email to it first those coins are forever lost! It doesn't ask for userid and it doesn't indicate in any way that you should record any identifiers.  I can totally understand how Apple could Ban it for poor design. I could imagine someone losing a lot of money and Suing Apple over that and Apple being liable, or at the very least a customer service headache and claims of scammers.

You are forgetting that the user needs to provide their bit coin address when they register, otherwise the web site has nothing to compare the signature with. 
This may be more inconvenient for the user since they will need another program running, and the BTC client no less. They wouldn't be able to log in through mobile or work.  
Another possibility which is even more seem less is client certificates. The server creates one, let's the user download and install, then it is automatically sent next time they visit. Apache has that feature. Downside is it could be stolen, but not if it is tied to an IP. Another is mobile may not support it.
