Prophecy or prediction at this point is not helpful, Bitcoin is not in the good rate to assess and people will definitely ignore those prophecies and prediction unless they can see improvement, you can't pursue them at the lowest point, if you will you have to exert so many efforts. I have encountered so much false prediction, and sometimes it only acts as bait for the people.
