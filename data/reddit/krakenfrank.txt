Have you tried opening a ticket on the support desk with the Account Access team? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:29
Hi, your ticket number is being worked by several agents, and the lead agent is aware of your urgency as the ticket has been escalated in importance.

We are currently trying to get the major upgrade ready, it all depends on our internal testing its currently undergoing.

Yes they are undergoing testing now and have been for a few days, release is dependent on how the lead engineers feel the upgrades have progressed over the testing phase.

Understandable, to answer the original question: I am new to the team hence the newness of the account.  And I am just trying to give the original poster an update on his issue, I just wanted him to know someone was working on his case.

Hi zenolijo!  The dev team is always looking to add new features and while I am not sure if this is one they were already considering, I can easily recommend it to them and let them know how you feel about it.

Hi BigJim05, Kraken has worked hard to improve our verification times over the last year and make the process easier for clients. We've also put alot more polish into our UI and site if you haven't checked us out recently. If you are still having some verification issues and you have a support ticket open with our team, I can see about escalating your ticket and getting the problem solved faster.

Hello, Vladimirovic. Do you have specific fees you are curious about or do you need some assistance understanding the fee structure in general?

Hi racebum, have you tried the new interface at  ?

Hello SilverSurferBez, 
the reason that the deposit takes a bit longer is that when the deposit is missing its Reference ID the system can no longer automatically deposit the funds and everything must be done manually by agents which takes a considerable amount of time longer. I understand that you included the Reference ID number and this is not a mistake on your fault, often times what occurs is that an error from a bank teller or during the wire transfer process causes the Reference ID to be removed by the bank thus when it arrives its missing all the important information which forces a security check and other time consuming processes. 
I apologize for those delays but they are unavoidable at this point. I did notify the agent in charge of your ticket and asked them to please hurry with the manual deposit processing.

Hello Fff007, 
 Kraken has a support article on opening long and short positions if you would like to read it: 
Also there is an old tutorial video on opening positions on youtube that is still somewhat useful:

Hi Keefryan, I'm not sure what horror stories you've heard but we did do a major upgrade back in January that has drastically improved our trade engine. We have even managed to bring back several trade pairs and the advance order features. If people are still wondering about our service they should give us another shot, and check out the new trading interface at trade.kraken.com.

Hi Young\_Grif,
If your Kraken account is a personal Kraken account, you would be wiring to an individual bank account, and if it is a corporate account you would be wiring to a business bank account. From there you would supply the information provided on the Kraken deposit instructions. For more assistance we do have a support article to provide additional guidance: [
