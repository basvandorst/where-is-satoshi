The company is less than 2 years old, yet we managed to build and maintain two Chrome apps and five different hardware wallets (Nano/HW1, Unplugged, Trustlet, Nano S, Blue).
Anyway, not comparable.

In a nutshell it's a Bitcoin / altcoins / Ethereum hardware wallet, also supporting PGP, Fido, custom apps (...), all of this running inside a secure element with USB, BLE and NFC connectivity and a nice touchscreen.

I really meant 2017 : almost a million units manufactured *and shipped* during the second half of the year

Check out "Ledger cryptographic attestation" on Google :) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:26:05
In January we decided to manufacture 30k units to sell throughout the year. Then we had to raise that number to 60k. Then 120k.
Finally, we decided to ramp up to 1 million units to be manufactured (and almost entirely sold) this year.

@_date: 2017-12-15 06:32:48
We can outsource anywhere in the world without having to trust our subcos because we use secure elements, which is unique to this technology.
Our assembly plants cannot do anything to effectively transform the product because each firmware (for each actual unit) is remotely signed and sent in real time from HSMs we control and that are hosted in France in our own buildings.
They cannot install anything other than Ledger-signed firmwares on the ST31H320, and if they were able to, those firmwares wouldn't pass attestation (check out "Ledger cryptographic attestation" on Google).
Using Secure Elements isn't a marketing thing like some people want to believe: it's essential (but it's not the only advantage) if you want to be able to massively scale by outsourcing manufacturing. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:16:29


Not at all (we have a 0.something % failure rate). Our issue is that we've become "Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies" unofficial support.
Newcomers are turning to Ledger to get general information about Bitcoin, Ethereum, cryptos overall,... Because most of the people who are now entering the crypto space have very little understanding of cryptos (and IT in general), they associate "cryptos" to "Ledger", hence the incredible increase in tickets volume.

I started with US shipping since I was testing the interface and discovering how contracts were created. 
Now we have a "european shipping" contract ;)

Hi, 
I'm the guy you were talking to, I had my share of issues while setting our store up so I fully understand. 
OpenBazaar is still work in progress and reporting those issues can only help the developers :) 
We'll be happy to process your order when the bugs are a problem of the past! Thank you for being one of our first OB customers! 
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:42:27
We actually sell all around the world but shipping rates differ from country to country. Setting up a node on OB was kind of a challenge and we had to start over multiple times, so I tried to stick to a couple of contracts for now.
Since the contracts system is still very simple, we'd need to create one for each product/country combination in order to reflect the shipping costs for each destination, and we'll do it eventually. 
Can you tell me which country you are from, so I can start with it? 
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:25:28

If you know what you're doing, you can use this tool: 
Type your 24 words seed in the first field ("BIP39 Mnemonic") then click "BIP44" under "Derivation Path". The tool will give you the corresponding public and private keys.
Edit: you will also need your change addresses. To do so, change the "External / Internal" parameter to "1".

The official Ledger apps handle all the officially supported coins (one for Bitcoin and its alts, et one for Ethereum and Ethereum classic) :) 
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:32:29
These tabs allow you to use the software as an alternative client for the Nano S (you're not forced to use Ledger's official client software). 
Your coins are still secure, no matter which client app you are using with the Nano S, as long as you take time to check your transaction (destination address, amount and fees) on the device's screen before confirming. The idea is simple: never trust the software client (not even our official client), always check on the device's screen. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:24:26
I don't know what to answer to that. It's javascript, you can literally inspect the source.
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:29:41
I'll do my best to make the Starter available in other languages (but as you can guess we're pretty busy with the upcoming products/firms/coins support!). 
Also I need to check with the team how we could properly add multilanguage BIP39 to our apps ecosystem (not just the Starter).
My goal was to completely revamp the Starter to add a desktop and a very lightweight version of the Chrome app, making the process smoother and much more user-friendly, and in that case non-english characters would be supported out of the box.
Now I need to find the time to do this ;)
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:40:39
From now on, the HW1 comes with the LedgerOS 1.0.1 Firmware.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:43:05
The Nano S has always been "58 euros excluding taxes" which is exactly "69.60 euros including taxes".
"Available from 58€" means that it's the lowest price you'll get, and that depends on where you live. If you live in the EU, our website automatically adds VAT to the displayed price, making it "69.60€".
Outside the EU, the shop will display "58.00€" since we don't have to apply VAT to exported goods.
It's been this way since forever on our website.
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:32:56
Thanks for the review!

You can store several currencies on the "same device" since everything is actually mathematically derived from the same original seed. You simply need to switch between the apps without ever switching to a new hardware device. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:27:07
You don't need a PC to initialize the Nano S, just a USB power supply. 
The device will draw a random 256 bits seed which is turned into 24 words, displayed on the embedded screen, that you have to write down on a piece of paper (see: BIP39). 
Once written down, those 24 words will allow you to recover your coins even if you lose or destroy the device: all Ledger products support BIP39, and most other hardware and popular software wallets do too. 
A word of advice about this 24 words backup: unless you know what you are doing, don't take pictures of it, don't store it on a digital medium and don't keep it in a small safe that will be the first thing that gets stolen. Thieves are not going to look for a Bitcoin mnemonic backup when searching your house, but they will definitely take the safe with them if they can. This happened to many people before.  
The device is not linked to your computer. You can use it on any compatible terminal running Windows, Mac, Linux or Android (with OTG support). 
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:51:10
No worries, I understand how that can be confusing :)
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:35:58
After setup you need a client: our official app from  or any other compatible client like Electrum, Mycelium... 
From the client, you can generate a receiving address and export your extended public key to use with tools like Sentinel (which allow you to consult your wallet safely and receive funds without carrying your hardware wallet with you).

It has a battery and a touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity (can be used with upcoming iOS wallets, where USB and NFC wallets *cannot* be used) and a bigger storage space (480K vs 320K for the Nano S -yes, storage space in secure elements is scarce :D)
The large screen can be used to display smart contracts data.


No, it still dependent on a client terminal (smartphone or PC). 
If you don't need those specific features, the Nano S will be best suited (and less expensive).

- SDK

That's not normal and could be due to a slightly smaller buttons set or buttons soldered a tenth of a millimeter too far away from the edge of the PCB, for instance.
This won't affect the device's reliability or security in any way.

Why does it look like it has been opened before? 
Marks on the USB connector are to be expected: they are left when testing the device before closing the boxes. 
Anyway: even buying them used is OK, when the device gets wiped by entering 3 wrong PIN codes in a row, it is completely erased and goes back to its original factory state.
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:00:27
Yep, unfortunately there's not much more we can do apart from notifying Github (well, fake firmwares will display very obvious warning messages on the Nano S in case they manage to install them).
Users should never install an .exe file from Ledger unless it has been downloaded from "LedgerHQ" on Github (and for now... we don't even publish executable applications)
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:31:38

I understand. You may have received an older batch that didn't come with the sticker, but rest assured: the sticker was meant to be very visible and explain that "we don't need a sticker", but was a failure (people though it was **actually** an anti-tampering sticker).
There is now a new leaflet in all our new batches explaining that holograms and other anti-tampering are worthless, and that we used cryptographic attestation from the beginning. Here's the article this leaftlet suggests reading: 
Basically you can verify that your Nano is genuine thanks to this attestation. The Chrome app runs the attestation each time, and there are also Python tools that can help check it :)
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:21:18


Yep, that's what we ended up doing! The new batches (starting a few days ago actually) now contain a little card saying *"Did you notice? There is no anti-tampering sticker on this box"*, followed by explanations.

Remember that hardware wallets don't (yet) protect you against malwares that change the addresses directly in Web pages for instance (before it's even displayed on your computer screen). Using an unsecure computer to shop / trade by displaying a payment address is still dangerous (this is the problem BIP70 is supposed to solve).

Yep, the price is going to stay the same.
@_date: 2015-07-12 08:52:12
The client doesn't know what the fee should be, the value is returned by querying our API which also runs Bitcoin Core. 
There's an "estimatefee n" command that returns the fees you should pay for your transaction to be included in the next n blocks 
@_date: 2015-07-12 09:07:46
It depends on how the wallet communicates with the Blockchain. We use an HTTP API so we query bitcoind server-side, but I guess an SPV client could do it by itself. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:49:16


You clearly understand the topic /s
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:13:30
It replaces the USB dongle and you could say that it acts as a second factor: transactions can be confirmed through the Trusted UI. Using the Trustlet, you don't need a Ledger Wallet since the Trustlet is your Ledger Wallet (but you need hardware that supports it, ie. a recent smartphone) 
You can read more about the trusted UI here  and TEE is detailed there 
@_date: 2016-02-23 11:52:11
Yes, it will require a firmware update. 
The Trustlet is another product: it allows you to use your TEE-enabled phone as a hardware wallet. In that case, Mycelium acts as a client but signing happens inside the TEE. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:07:28


BTChip was telling you that if the address is changed by a malware BEFORE appearing in your browser, the Trezor doesn't protect you (edit: this also applies to other hardware wallets right now, until BIP70 gets widely used)
* Loading webpage with payment address (**1abcd...**) 
* Malware changes the address (**1xyzz**)
* You ask your Trezor to pay to **1xyzz**
* Your Trezor shows **1xyzz**.
* Everything looks fine.
Think  with more advanced regexes. Get it yet?
@_date: 2016-02-03 08:59:49
I have 8k€ in BTC on my Ledger Wallet. Online wallets are not very secure for this amount of time (you never know what could happen).
Trezor and Ledger are meant to store your bitcoins without relying on a third-party. Even if you lose your device, you'll have a paper backup that you can copy and keep in multiple safe places.
In the end, those hardware wallets are a bit like "cold wallets from which you can sign". Your private keys never leave the hardware wallet to be used by another (potentially compromised) device.
I don't know how long I plan on holding my BTC, maybe 4 or 5 years :)
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:57:36


Your USB thumb drive can be physically stolen, or read by malwares when plugged into your computer. Encrypting the private keys solve the physical theft problem, but malwares can still wait for you to decrypt the private keys. Plus, it's not very convenient.
The Ledger Wallet is not a thumb drive, it's a secure element with a USB interface (you cannot store files on it).
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:29:23
Sure! 
Speaking for Ledger at least: everything security related happens on the device. Signature is handled by the secure element (ST31H320) and confirmations on screen with user interaction through the two buttons. 
Outside the device, you *have* to assume everything is compromised, the device has been designed with this in mind. This includes your PC and even, why not, the cable. 
If something tried to ask the device to sign a different transaction than the one you are currently signing, it would appear differently on screen (different amount and/or different address). 
Also, everything that goes in or out of the device is public information (public addresses and xpub keys come out when loading your wallet, inputs to sign come in when requesting a signature, and signed transaction comes out after confirmation). There is therfore nothing to really worry about, if someone were to use some kind of "spy cable" for instance, he would basically get data that is already available in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:15:23
Not at all
@_date: 2016-02-03 08:27:59
Yeah, you mean like OpenSSL? /s
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:50:52
You don't need the device to receive coins once you have copied your receiving address. 
The device is only used to send funds: it signs transactions. You can receive an unlimited amount of transactions while the device is not connected, since transactions are stored in the blockchain and not on the Nano S. 
Regarding confirmation times: that depends on how much you paid in fees and on how many transactions are in the mempool, it's not related to the Nano S. 
Generally speaking, a high priority transaction gets included in a block in about 10 minutes. Lower priority transactions can require more time, and very low priority transactions can stay in the mempool for days when the network is heavily used.
@_date: 2016-09-20 12:55:06
And if you can tamper with the device, you can also invest a few hundred dollars to order the same "tamper-proof" stickers to reseal the boxes. Your victims will never know.
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:40:37


Also in case someone simply steals your safe. It happens all the time. 
Storing the backup sheet anywhere but in a safe is the best way to protect it against theft, and considering it's only one or two millimeters thick you have plenty of options.

You seem to has misunderstood my point: you're saying "should always ship with a tamper-proof seal on the package". Why? This is assuming the contents of the box have been tampered why, right?
I'm saying: tamper-proof seals are bullshit if you're assuming the attacker already has enough funds to create a fake HW wallet. He will obviously have some money left to print out a board of fake stickers and some fake boxes.
PS: I'm one of the co-founders of Ledger, I also work in part on our logistics too: I know how much a box and a tamper-proof hologram cost (hint: nothing)
[Edit] What I mean is: 
*  If the contents of the box can be tampered with, the sticker won't be of any use -it can be replaced-
*  If the contents of the box can't be tampered with (see how we manage cryptographic attestation at Ledger), the sticker isn't needed
@_date: 2016-10-14 05:38:32
Tamper-proof seals are bullshit.
If you're the bad guy planning on intercepting hardware wallets before delivery and replacing them with fake copies, printing a few hundred fake holograms and making fake boxes will only cost you a few hundred dollars.
@_date: 2016-10-14 07:19:04
Well you don't want to check if the **package** has been tampered with. You want to check if the device has, with cryptographic attestation.
Here's how it works with our products: 
tl;dr 
* The Ledger Nano/HW1 can be checked with our official application or with Python tools
* The Nano S (not pictured in this article) auto-checks its firmware at boot on its embedded screen, and can be checked with Python tools or with an upcoming management app (Soon ™)

100% fake. Reported to Github too.
@_date: 2015-09-10 08:18:58
The first three buttons should output some JSON values at the top of the page. Do they write anything?
For instance "Is Ledger app available" should write "{"command":"ping","result":true}"
In the xpub export text field, enter "44'/0'/0'" (which is the first account) and click "Get xpubkey". The Chrome app should react.
@_date: 2016-10-19 09:50:38
Not yet, but soon™
The "Enable Browser" switch allows you to choose between two modes: regular mode works with our official app or third-party apps, and browser mode which allows the Nano S to be accessible from within compatible browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Opera).
The first application usable with "browser mode" will be MyEtherWallet.com. The main advantage is that no additional plugin or application is needed.
The Shuffle PIN mode changes the way the first digit of each PIN slot on start. When disabled, the device always starts by suggesting a "5" for each slot. When enabled, this digit will be randomly selected (prevents people from visually counting the button presses to guess your PIN code).
Don't worry, neither of these options will lock you out of the device

The device won't work with our bootable OS because it doesn't need to: the bootable OS is there to initialize our screenless and buttonless devices. 
Since the Nano S embed two buttons and a screen driven by secure hardware, using an airgapped computer or live OS to initialize it would be redundant (you can even initialize the Nano S on a portable USB battery if you don't want to connect it to a computer during the process).
You should be able to restore hexadecimal seeds on the device using our Python tools, but I will let confirm or deny my claims.

SEPA is not the problem here, your bank is.

Both can be turned off. That leaves you with the USB interface which is a bit more tinfoil-compliant.

Students are building one at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris. We'll post about it when it's ready :)

We were at CeBIT 2015, here are some pictures:

Unfortunately as I said, we don't want to make false promises and because there are so many things that can go wrong, we prefer to keep announcing the original deadlines. 
We're sorry for the inconvenience.

Mine went three times through the washing machine, still working!

What about keeping your BIP39 backup somewhere safe?

You will indeed be able to put labels on addresses or transactions in an upcoming release. The settings will be encrypted and stored depending on information derived from your master seed, so using a previous wordlist will get you the previous settings associated to it.
If Ledger came to disappear, you'll still be able to use the hardware wallet with compatible applications or derive your addresses from third party scripts like this one 
(Warning: if you ever need to use this kind of tool, you have to do it on a trusted computer!)

It's not a flash drive if that's what you're asking. The device uses an ST31H320 secure element to protect private keys and sign transactions.

See my previous reply: 
A total of 1M units will be manufactured this year to keep up with demand and we should be able to fulfill the current orders backlog with the coming batches (60k units). We simply prefer to announce a shipping date based on our current production capability, just in case. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:50:08
When you ordered, the system should have given you an estimated shipping date in June or (most certainly) July. 
*Transparency mode enabled*: we're currently processing orders made between the 24th and 26th of may (tons of orders). Our production capacity is still lower than demand and the situation will begin to come back to normal once the first units come out of our new (much bigger) production line. 30k units will come out almost at once starting week 26.
Thank you for your patience!
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:47:31
Shipping should happen before: we have 30 000 units coming out of our new production line in the next few weeks, but we prefer announcing shipping dates based on our *current* production capability, just in case something goes wrong (we don't want to make false promises). 
Another 30k units will then come a few days after.

The company pictured here is not Ledger but a Ledger reseller, they are not going to refill our own warehouses :)
