"So realize this.. the threat to crypto is not just from governments or Wall Street or some hacker stealing your shit, it's from greed. Greed from within... "
totally agree.  But honestly I think there are less colluding forces than that.  I think at this point things are VERY random and hard to pin down.  There is a lot of un accounted for money in other counties that will be wanting in on this game.  Many have not much to lose and everything to gain.  I see it teetering here for a bit then up up and away..

BTC is scarce ans so is gold.  But technically BTC is more limited because gold might be found on other planets/moons someday.

:(  I thought Carlos was really gonna be there.
I think it's ironic that the host usually makes fun of people not being intellectually competent enough to understand his basic ideas, but here he just bashes the intellectual.

He trashed bitcoin a few months before he bought it and publicized that he bought it.
Also if you watch shark tank he does this a lot.

Cuban always trashes stuff before he gets it.
