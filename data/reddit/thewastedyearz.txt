I dont mind any of that, i would encourage people to use it themselves, as technology increases in the island im sure they will. I would just operate as a simple exchange, kind of a localbitcoin guy.

Cuban here.
I have been debating this with a few friends over the past months, i want to set up an exchange in cuba where people around the world can send remittances to their family as they currently do at a 20% cost, so you want to send money to grandma? $120 dollars for your 100.
I want to minimize the tax obviously, maybe just charge 5% and utilize bitcoin as a method of payment, you simply set up a business in Havana, we recieve a payment for an individual as western union or any other company would, we exchange it at the current rate and profit a much smaller percentage that is currently being charged across the world.

You can make money, but you can also lose money. You can convert your differences back to USD, exchanges will charge you a fee. Also for tax it is treated as capital gains.
There is no fraud or negatives about it, it is a gamble, the legality of bitcoin around the world seems to change almost daily, countries around the world are just beginning to embrace its uses while others ban it as they see its potential to uproot their financial institutions. 
Around the world we all dictate what has value, a dollar is a dollar because a bank is telling you it is and has a system in place to support it, it is no longer backed by gold since 1971 or anything to be exact, it is backed by trust, trust in a system that as the internet age matures it realizes that it is printing money and its systematically flawed. We all have the authority to say what has value.

your wallet is going to synchronize for awhile, like days...
you shoulda used another service like multibit where the wallet doesnt need to sync the entire chain. The money should be there, your wallet just has to basically "catch up" with the transaction. hope this helps.

You can bet there are a few miners just waiting until the last second to create controversy. All things point to early adoption, we have less than 2 weeks and are almost at 80%, i dont think this is going to be close at all.

You kno how many people have made this math in the past 5 years and then made a post about it? About 1% of this sub.

Because maybe a transparent and nearly hack-proof way of voting is not what the powers that be want.
