doesn't help if your compter gets owned though.. it's better than nothing, sure - but if you have a secure password and it gets compromised by a keylogger I'd think that usually means you can't trust google authenticator either.

Some people are just determined to read a lot of negativity into the ECB report - it wasn't, in fact it was surprisingly positive I'd say. They did touch on some pitfalls but that isn't representative of the overall feel of the report - these are just out of context quotes being used to misrepresent the report and create controversy to drive traffic for all these 'second hand news' blog sites.

well bailouts are feasible as long as they can get the money from somewhere I guess.. it would be politicially a lot harder than just printing it where the effect is diluted throughout the entire economy. If they want to bailout a failed bank using tax revenue they either have to increase taxes or cut spending on services.. that won't go unnoticed by the citizens.

1. With bitcoin there is no possibility that any such bank or payment processor can be bailed out by a central bank.. if they lend out your money and run into a liquidity crisis they're probably going to be fucked and will go out of business.. the owners of such organizations will probably be lynched since all their customer's money will be lost - so that should act as a disincentive to anyone doing that.
2. There's no way to prevent custodians from abusing their position of trust.. it's up to the users of those custodians to make sure that they actually have reserves.. if they fail to do so there's a good chance they'll lose out. The point with bitcoin is that there's no way for a central bank to bail them out if this goes tits up like it always does so the damage is limited to the customers of the failed institution and not the larger economy.
3. maybe.. i think there will still be a limited need for banks.. especially in managing non-cash investments (ie: investment banking - which is where banks make most of their money anyway).. but maybe not so much in the payment transaction business anymore.

with so many free porn sites I can't see there being a huge market..  even girls gone bitcoin and chateau de crypto seem pretty dead these days.. I guess there's not enough people tipping to attract any more girls than those that were already giving it away free on other subredits.
