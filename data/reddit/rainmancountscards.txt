I agree with this.   I've been watching BTC for 1.5 years, and it was about 6-7 $ when I was first speculating on it.   During that time I have seen it go up and down, just like a roller coaster.   World policy / news events / positive negative media / all of this is a factor on BTC's price (along with the supply vs demand).   To say it won't go back to $500 is silly because we've all seen it.   For me to legitimately tell you not to wait for $500 to buy would be because I am waiting for that and don't want you to be able to buy as low as me.   It's going to have it's ups and downs, its still a new technology.  Just hard to predict when.  If you're ok with putting in a buy/sell order and waiting months for it to happen, theres high chance you will profit just don't get trigger-happy.  Don't invest more than you are willing to lose, and diversify!

I totally agree that Bitcoin needs to have a related RFC # associated with at least the "base protocol" specification. It relies on network to function, and just about every network component has one or many RFC's associated with it.
There is an RFC for avian pigeons being used as an IP packet delivery service but not for Bitcoin?
Maybe we can use the pigeons to deliver Bitcoin transactions on paper!

When I think back to when Bitcoin avg'ed at $113-125 and then it spiked up to $266 and people were still buying in, this makes me remember that.   Many speculate it will drop after black friday which is a possibility but the future remains to be written.  I wish you the best of luck and hope you haven't spent more than you are willing to lose.

I have used BitInstant 2x now (and helped a friend use it once) and on each occasion the funds were at Mt. Gox by time I got home to check it.  I found you just need to make 100% sure that you are using the proper account # (starts with M ends with X).  I hear alot of people with problems using BitInstant but I just have not run into any (YET).

Thanks so much keep the comments coming!   The news station supposedly has a "financial expert" that will be talking about it but none of them have any clue regarding the technology side which is where I may have some input for them.
I support Bitcoin and want to see this news story go positively.

The seller has 0 feedback which means it's an auction hosted by either someone who has never sold before, or a newly created account.   Keep that in mind as you bid on anything on eBay you need to make sure its a reputable source.

This seems like pretty positive news.  They took a known successful ASIC and plan on using their specialization in mass producing them in the USA.  I hope they succeed I would love to get one.  I did consider the BFL ASICS back in January however there was so much speculation whether they were legit or not I did not pre-order one (and after seeing what BFL is now doing regarding order confirmation/cancellation and also insane high cost for "express shipment" my trust for BFL is still non-existant.  Hope this company succeeds and can get the ASICs into hands of users without any bullshit.

Whats interesting is during this time of it dropping a tad I've been refreshing Mt Gox and so far I've seen at least 4 unique "503 Service Unavailables".   Someone DOS'ing again trying to do price manipulation?  At same times you see the panic sells then the re buys at $119.xx.

After reading this article I think it's quite possible that it will go past 600-700 this week:
If that happens we are about to see some even higher all-time high's!   The author of that article speculated potential of $1700.  I am pulling up a comfortable chair along with a week-long supply of popcorn and caffeinated drinks.

Thanks everyone for all your suggestions.   The news segment was mostly recorded today.  Some of the questions I was asked were:
- How did you find out about Bitcoins (internet tech news sites)
- How many Bitcoins have you personally bought
- How did you buy your Bitcoins (plugged BitInstant.com and the process of going into a local chain store to execute the transaction via MoneyGram services)
- How can you spend your Bitcoins (this is where I plugged BitPay.com as an "intermediary" in between the merchant and customer)
- What do you plan on spending your Bitcoins on (plugged precious metals sites)
- What suggestions do you have for potential Bitcoin purchasers.  Stressed to read up on it, its a volatile currency, and "Do not invest more than you are willing to lose."
- They did mention sites such as Silk Road and I said something along the lines of "sites like this supposedly exist and US regulation will help shut them down going forward and that they basically give the currency a bad name which is undeserving."
- They asked about the "anonymousness" of the transaction and how I feel about that.  Pegged that its nice to know the transaction is anonymous but that is not a major factor for me.

I purchased my coin through    If you look at the main site for Casascius coins ( you will see that he now only sells through authorized resellers.  I saw that hardbtc was on the list and went that route.  So far its been a pleasant transaction and my coin is enroute.

Regarding a publicity stunt, I personally was thinking about that too just to get people interested in Bitcoin.   If you look at coinmap.org right now theres only a few places in the USA that accept Bitcoin.   What if there was a contest that people could enter (by using BTC to enter) and the end prize would be a trip for the winner to visit a city that has much BTC interest (i.e., San Francisco, NYC, etc).   Would be a neat contest plus end result would promote Bitcoin awareness by getting the winner to location where they can use Bitcoins.  I think once this BTC ATM machine hits that will be huge in form of publicity.

I also am curious about this question.  When funds are sent to Mt. Gox (using the BitInstant / ZipZap) they do show up as USD (fiat currency).  What happens if someone sends funds to Mt. Gox using BitInstant and they have a non-verified account?  Are those funds gone (since it's probably difficult to get your fiat currency back out of BitInstant, and Mt. Gox may be at point they won't allow those funds to pass through without verified account?)

Would love to see what Steve Jobs opinion of Bitcoin was.  It's unfortunate that is not going to happen.  He was a visionary and I think he would be pretty impressed with what is happening around in him the finance/tech world.

I purchased a 1 BTC Casascius coin and received it in the mail the other day.   It came in an "unloaded" state worth 0 BTC.  Once I notified the merchant I bought the coin from they initiated the transfer of 1 BTC to my coin's unique wallet address (which is part of their security procedure to make sure proper end user has the coin in hand).
The hologram sticker on my coin has the wallet ID's firstbits "13Aq1dcL" which is basically a short name for the wallet address.   The sticker is tamper resistant so if I peel it off (to get at the private code underneath) this lets the owner of the coin know that it has been tampered with.
I personally wonder if the sticker is water resistant ?   People do have tendency to get coins wet how as for how well this sticker holds up that I do not know.
The coin may be literally a token with a sticker however its a piece of history and it also has 1 BTC of value.

Not sure how many people use this bank, but if it lost it's license due to poor/illegal practices it could be a sign that it's customer base is about to pull a "Cyprus-like move" (i.e., have more trust in Bitcoin than their own bank!)
This could be good for Bitcoin.

Very good example thanks!   Mt. Gox seems to get much press these days and if I had many users coming to my website the least I would do is make sure the landing page looked as good as it could.   Bad statistics and poor website design lead people to think "what type of people run this site".  Why would an average person want to walk through the front door at Mt. Gox looking for Bitcoins, only to see the front door has paint chipping off the door, dirt on the porch, a stray cat lying around, maybe a broken window....   not the front door of a house I'd want to enter.  Same holds true for websites people need to think about that.  First perceptions count especially when trying to help a new currency like Bitcoin succeed.

You were correct!
1) Created buy order 0.303 BTC by price 75 USD (total 22.725 USD)
Displayer_  :   I agree 75 USD is a very low rate for Bitcoin and its very improbably it will go in that direction anytime soon / ever again but its the risk I am taking for now at least.

Oh I know - that's why I am not selling.   The sky is the limit - the question is when does the sky end hah.  People asked the same thing back in the days of 266 then shit fell apart for months.  Looks to be on a steady incline back to those days.

My question is what triggers it to return to its "wild" ways?  Why did it fluctuate so much over past 30-60 days and then in past week stabilizes at $112-115?  Been watching volume and its was 60k and today is 30k.  With all the positive press happening I would expect it to be increasing and instead seeing the opposite.

Yesterday I sent funds from Blockchain to Mt. Gox and it took about 2 hours to complete.  If memory serves me correct I believe Mt. Gox requires 4 confirmations on the transaction before they show the transaction as complete and release the funds.

I still can't believe people are willing to pay 20+ BTC (currently valued at $2650.00) for a device that BFL is charging now $274 for (weren't these at $149 to begin with?)
I can only imagine what is going to happen to the price hikes on these items once a big company (such as AMD, or any reputable motherboard manufacturer such as Asus) start making them in mass production and/or develop their own ASIC and hardware.
I think you may be able to currently make some profit off these devices but as time passes others will pop up, and once a larger company starts making them (and actually has them avail for order) the price hikes will disappear and many people will be rather upset regarding how much they paid for these devices, considering how much they actually mined prior to the larger companies selling them in mass quantity.
China and Taiwan is notorious for duplicating electronics.  I give it 6 months and we will see much more ASIC-based miners out there which one can actually order and have (in-hand) within a few days.
These price hikes are robbery.

I originally mined 1 LTC and sold it on btc-e at about $30-35 USD.   I just had a trade that executed to buy BTC @ 666 USD for that amount.   Its not much but I have a fraction of Bitcoin again all due to the single LTC I mined.
