Forgive me, I'm very far out of the loop... Does this mean that if I have a bunch of ethers that I also have the same number of ether classic in the same wallet? What if I transferred it all to a Coinbase a wallet as soon as I heard they started supporting it (on the 27th)? I still have keys for the old wallet and I think it was post fork... What's the deal with that? I'm just hearing about all this now.

In order for me to lend you a bitcoin and charge you interest, I need to own a bitcoin and assume a risk by lending it to you.
A bank doesn't need to have 10,000$ in order to lend you 10,000$ and charge interest.
So why do you say that people who lend bitcoin would charge interest as if that's somehow bad, or shocking, or unexpected, or an argument against such a system? You were just in the process of defending a system where people charge interest on loans in dollars. You should be the one explaining the difference to me.
Your statement also implies that people who don't charge interest on loans do so 'out of the goodness of their hearts.' I guess that makes credit card companies benevolent and loving, and completely lacking self-interest?

No he didn't, you just made that up...
He was saying that it's corrupt to let banking institutions charge interest on legal tender that they create out of thin air, and that this wouldn't be possible in a bitcoin economy. That's very different than being opposed to charging interest at all, which is a communist / religious zealot position that I'd smack down too.

Capitalism is perfect though. This doesn't mean that having capitalism automatically solves all of society's problems and makes that society perfect.
Being capitalist is like being cancer free. You can still get diabetes or alzheimer's or leprosy, or whatever. Being cancer free doesn't make you perfect or immortal. But there's absolutely 0 benefit to having little bits of cancer here and there. There are no good ideas to be taken from socialism and worked into a capitalist system.

The ledger itself was probably safe though. The pertinent advice is to learn how private keys work and to know that if anybody could have accessed that key at any point, then it's compromised.

That perspective is the popular position. That's what we hear everywhere but here (and we also have to hear it here when the price is going down).
You act like you're making a bold stand against popular opinion... you're not, you're saying what 90% of people already believe. The claim that people haven't heard your side of the argument is a blatant lie. Everyone has heard these "concerns" 1000 times.
The fact that every top comment on every thread is people saying "anyone who has bitcoin is a retard" in a subreddit that is supposed to be pro-bitcoin is proof of this.
It's like if I went over to r/soccer and all the top comment's were people being like "soccer is such a fag sport, you should all play a manly sport, like football." 
Or a bunch of peta idiots going into r/awww and being like "owning pets is oppression!" and being at the top of every thread.
It would make sense that the mods would delete such comments and ban the people making them, as they're obviously not trying to be part of that community.
Unfortunately the mods of this subreddit are afraid of being accused of "censorship" so we have to listen to all this garbage.
One of the worst parts of the price crashing is the forums being overrun with anti-bitcoin trolls that don't belong here.

I used to be a huge druggie, like multiple drugs every night. Then I heard of the Silk Road and other dark net markets, and was like ‘oh shit I need to get some bitcoin so I can buy drugs on the internet.’ As soon as I got some and realized that it wasn’t just Silk Road drug credits, and that it’s actually its own system completely separate from all that... I was like holy shit I’m not spending any of this. Never spent a satoshi on the dark net and started spending all my play money on bitcoin instead of drugs. It very well may have saved my life. I still dabble but it’s no longer the focus of my life. I mean, cannabis is still pretty important to me but compared to what I used to do it’s basically nothing.
It’s funny that they say bitcoin makes it easier for people to access drugs and that’s bad. You’re completely right. That abundance of cheap money creates a bad economic situation and inspires despair in those who takes the time to look at it, but don’t have the means to profit off of it. Those people often turn to drugs and other self-destructive lifestyles because why the fuck not. 
Most people who buy drugs with bitcoin end up massively regretting it because of the missed economic opportunity. Far fewer people who buy drugs with cash end up regretting it. I want people, especially those who think all drug use is bad, to think about the implications of that.

That would be a lot easier, a lot safer, you might be able to grab and run without committing assault (I don’t actually know the laws...) and opening yourself to other criminal charges... no I’ll wait until it’s cryptographically secured, and then I’ll commit literal torture for an unknown sum of money.

I don't want to talk about how much I make, but it's paid off in bitcoin accounting for electricity and I don't have cheap electricity.

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:58:43
Litecoin is a good choice for these transactions as well. Btc *should* be fine for 50$ transactions but it currently isn't unfortunately. If it makes you feel any better, I was doing 1 sat per byte transactions just back in October, and they'd confirm overnight. I'm not saying we'll get back to that soon, but we got back down to about 5 sat per byte back in November. Bitcoin companies need to start using segwit and need to start batching transactions.
But I like litecoin a lot for these playing-around kinds of transactions.

What I don't get is that they seem to just say "fuck it, we'll pass on the transaction costs to the customers." Which I kind of understand, even though I don't like it. 
But why not use segwit and batching to save massive overhead on the fees, then just charge the customers the same insane fees while pocketing significantly more money? 
Then the mempool will shrink, Coinbase can pocket even more money, regular bitcoin users will pay lower transaction fees on chain, and coinbase users will still be getting hosed for insane fees. Everyone's happy, right?

A) Who are you, the irs? Get the fuck outta here. It doesn't matter if you you buy 1 or 10 or 100 miners, you'll just make 10x or 100x more (if you're profitable) or lose 10x or 100x more (if you're not). You don't make a bigger percentage of your investment by having more of them. The bigger miners also need to pay employees, a single person doesn't.

In order to maintain social adherence to the stated goals of the project you'll need to rule over your fiefdom with an iron fist. Otherwise, opportunists will take advantage of the project and use it for their own personal financial gain and communists will attempt to take it over to implement their "true vision" of "real communism."
Anyway I love hearing about bitcoin making anarcho-capitalist social experiments possible and I hope that your privately owned covenant community is successful.

We can’t continue to allow China to rape our cryptos and that’s what they’re doing. It’s the greatest theft in the history of the world. 
The single biggest weapon used against us and to destroy our companies is devaluation of crypto currencies by pumping shitcoins, and the greatest ever at that is China. Very smart, they are like grand chess masters. And we are like checkers players. But bad ones.
There are people who wish I wouldn’t refer to China as our enemy. But that’s exactly what they are. They have destroyed our entire mining industry by utilizing low-wage workers and taking advantage of very unfair environmental regulations - regulations that only Americans have to follow. They cost us tens of thousands of jobs, spied on our businesses, forked our technology, and have manipulated and devalued our cryptocurrency, which makes importing our Lambos more expensive – and sometimes, impossible.

Thats funny, because I speculate on stocks and invest in crypto. 
I don't know why this comes up so much and is always a top comment when someone uses the word "invest," but... speculation is a form of investment, and investments are often speculative. They're not opposing ideas, they just imply different things. In the **stock market**, investing implies a lower risk, but also implies that you're going to hold the asset for a much longer time. Speculation implies a higher risk and a plan to sell it shortly after an increase in value. But in **real life** people use the word invest much more broadly. Take the definition if the word invest:


(my emphasis)


My purchases of bitcoin satisfy both of these definitions.


So if I take the bus every day, but then I decide I should just pay up front for a bicycle and save money in the long run, I could say I'm investing in a bicycle. The bicycle doesn't generate any revenue or pay dividends... but I'm not using the wrong the word. If you say I'm using the wrong word because the bicycle doesn't produce cash flow, then you're the one who is using the word in the wrong context.
Now let's look at speculate:


So buying stocks that generate cash flow can be considered speculation if it's risky, which is pretty arbitrary and subjective. 
So if you don't really give a shit about crypto, but you think it's gonna go up in value in the short term so you buy a bunch to sell to some sucker at the peak, then it makes more sense to say you're speculating. If the only reason you 're buying bitcoin is to turn some amount of dollars into a larger amount of dollars, then it makes more sense to say your speculating (which is still a form of investment). There are a lot of people here who are just speculating. They don't use bitcoin, they don't buy it often, they might not even like it. They might even *dislike* it. But they think they can flip it quick for a bunch of fiat. They're speculating.
But if you're someone who actually thinks bitcoin has value and plans on holding it for as long as you possiblity can, if you use it for your **savings**, or if you've been buying it for years and never sold any and replace what you spend, or if you wouldn't sell it no matter how far it dropped to "cut your losses," or if you have no interest in ever trading it for dollars and you just hope to be rich in bitcoin some day, then it makes more sense to say that you are invested in it, in the literal definition of the word. Sure, there is still *some* level of speculation going on because it's high risk and high reward, but investment is the more accurate word in this case.
Whether you're speculating or investing depends on your strategy.

People say they're investing in gold coins when they're using it as a hedge against uncertainty and inflation. Gold coins provide no revenue, yet investment is the more accurate word because the people who buy them generally don't plan on selling them, especially not in the short term. It's something you keep for an emergency and hope you never have to sell. That's why you would call it investing and not speculation. It's only speculation if your like "I think gold is gonna go up a lot over the next 3 months... I'm gonna buy some gold in May and sell it in July." Nobody really does that with gold... Some do it with crypto, but some of us are investing long term.

I stronlgy disagree. Liquidity is a feature of currency. The higher the market cap is, the more useful Bitcoin is. At the current price, bitcoin can only support less than 128 billion dollars worth of commerce. Bitcoin cannot be used for a single 150 billion dollar transaction because there isn't that much in existence. As it gains value it becomes a better and more useful currency. As it becomes better and more useful there is a much bigger incentive for technological development. If it drops to 1$ a coin there will be very little incentive for development. If you "care about the tech" you should want the price to be higher, not lower.

We anti-government extremists don't want the government to do anything, including law. That doesn't mean we don't beleive in law at all. It reminds of the popular quote of Frederic Bastiat in The Law.

Imo the important part here isn't that they take bitcoin, it's that they give a very generous 20% discount. That's awesome. If there's no discount offered for giving up the superior form of money, then I'd rather dump my fiat and hoard the coins. Plus it's basically an advertisement to the world saying "I think bitcoin is more valuable than fiat currency." At this generous of a discount it makes it worth it for customers to buy bitcoin for the sole purpose of using it at this office. Then they can see for themselves why it's the superior form of money.

The problem isn't lending in general... the problem is that the money being lent doesn't exist before the loan is created. The issue is that **some people** are able to charge interest on money being lent out without risking any of their own money. Not only is it an obvious case of moral hazard, but it's the main cause of an ever increasing and unsustainable supply of money. If someone wants to lend out their own money at their own risk for a fee, this is perfectly acceptable.

We get it. The government owns us, so not giving it our stuff is stealing.
The government sets itself up as a monopoly on the most important functions of society, heavily regulates and taxes what's left of the market, oppresses everyone with horrible economic decisions while advancing their own careers, and mass murders foreigners while mass incarcerating citizens. Then they provide the absolute minimum needed for society to actually function, and you act like they're the only reason it does. There's no reason I should have to pay for mass murdering foreigners, keeping "illegal" immigrants from moving here, horrible economic policies, and locking people in jail for having drugs in order to also pay for roads. If your ideas are so great then why do they need to be violently imposed on everyone?
I pay my taxes, not out of any moral obligation, but out my rational self interest of self-preservation. Please, stop advocating violence against me. Government is violent, immoral, oppressive, inefficient and I don't want to support things that I find morally abhorrent. OP seems a bit odd, but nothing nearly as destructive and evil as what you support.

I think it's just that all of us aren't fancypants "investors" with "portfolios" trying to shortshell bitcoin. Some of us like the technology and actually use it to buy things and trade. When the price goes up, we're inclined to spend them. When the price goes down, we're inclined to buy them. Many of us use it because we don't like fiat money and we want an alternative. We're all rational actors in a market, we just have different goals and different values. 
Some of us see bitcoin getting bigger and more popular, and we'd rather wait to be able to buy the things we want with it, instead of trading it for the thing we're trying to avoid using. I don't have anything against speculators, I think they're good for the market, but we're not all trying to do the same thing here. 
Personally, I've been buying small amounts at a time and putting it in savings. I'm quite happy with the increase in value, but I mean, whatever. I'm sure there are people way richer than me that look at it the same way.

I love the attitude that people like you have. 
"Oh, someone else is looking after my safety? I have nothing to worry about then."
It seems like a lot more rapes happen in cabs than Uber. I googled and found about 4 right off the bat in the same time period that Uber had 1. It would probably be about the same if it was decentralized. You already have their license plate number; that's a pretty big piece of evidence and enough of a deterrent for people who aren't completely psycho to not do it; and the people who are completely psycho are going to try whether they have a cab, an Uber, or are just picking up a hitchhiker.

You use bitcoin to buy drugs, prostitutes, avoid paying taxes, illegal gambling? Fine. No victim, no crime. Use it to traffic in the violation of other people's private information? Fuck you, you're a criminal and I hope you get caught. 
This is the stuff that "makes bitcoin look bad" to (semi) rational people. Not people voluntary trading arbitrarily prohibited goods and services, but shit like stolen credit card info, child porn, and this shit - actual crimes with actual victims. That shit isn't cool.

You're either ignoring my point or you don't get it. The most rational choice is completely dependent on the persons goals and values. Look up what "rational" means in terms of economics. Your actions are rational given your goals and values, mine are rational given mine.
You assume that my goals and values are similar to yours, and that's why my choices seem "irrational" to you. You can say that they're economically imprudent, fine. I might just value economic prudence and material gain far less than you do. There are probably many things I value more, like sweet, sweet liberty.
I also don't value your sympathy, so that would obviously not have an effect on my actions.

I pay taxes, not out of any moral obligation, but out if my rational desire for self preservation.
That being said, this argument is bullshit. Most of my tax money goes toward mass murdering innocent people on the other side of the planet, locking up innocent people for victimless crimes, and corporate welfare for criminal organizations. I'm personally and morally responsible for all these horrible things because I take the easy way out and pay taxes. Just because the government throws people a bone to pick with a tiny portion of that stolen money doesn't mean they're good people or that your a good person for standing up for them.
You can't list what you perceive as govenment failures as reasons to support government. Do you think that if the government doubled taxes then they would double the amounts of benefits they give out? Or would they just line their own pockets and acquire more power for themselves?
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:08:51
I see what you mean. I just think that even though bitcoin isn't regulated, the exchanges are highly regulated (due to laws that were in place before bitcoin), and this causes many if the problems. 
Also, corporations going under and stealing everyone's money isn't because of unregulated markets. It's because government regulations *allow* them to take profits from the public, while being personally shielded from any damages they might owe.
It's not that bitcoin isn't regulated,  it's just that the state doesn't have absolute, complete, 100% control over it as they would like.

What I would do (and what I have done when giving away free btc paper wallets to friends, family, and coworkers to spark interest) is retain the private keys. I let them know that I still have access to them and that if they don't transfer them after a certain amount if time I'll take them back. I've saved the keys for larger gifts, not to take them back, but just as a backup since they don't know what they're doing. Of course I encourage them to transfer them so I don't have access to them; if they can do this then they can probably be trusted not lose them (for the most part).

It's not "cold blooded murder" when those people are threatening your life and liberty. 
If someone is selling kilos upon kilos of cocaine and someone says "pay me or I'm going to rat you out" what they are essentially saying is "pay me or I will end your life". This is a deadly threat to the safety to the cocaine dealer. Killing this person is essentially the same as killing somebody who is trying to kill you. It's self defense. I don't see why this is so complicated for you people to understand. If someone's committing a victimless crime that's punishable by life in prison, it's obviously justified for them to kill those who threaten to snitch on them.

Yeah, and if you’re really lucky the credit card company will just cut them off completely and then nobody can pay with credit cards there at all, even with a “service fee,” and then they’ll probably just go out of business, lol! It’s good that there are people willing to stand up against these business owners and defend the contracts of these poor, downtrodden credit card companies. Seriously, the kind of people that snitch to credit card companies are just generally all around great people. They’re always wildly successful and likeable and have tons of friends. Anyone who calls them pathetic subhuman losers is absolutely incorrect. It’s just the absolute highest level of justice attainable by man, is snitching on a business owner to fucking MasterCard. I just hope there are always third parties involved in the transferring of funds, so that brave people like you are able to intervene when a contract that doesn’t involve you isn’t kosher.

I don't see how anyone could hold through the crazy swings without having some kind non-financial investment in it. If you're just in it for the money you're gonna panic sell on the big swings, up or down. I sold my ethereum for 10$ because I was up over 10x, I didn't understand the purpose of it, and had no use for it. I just bought it cuz my buddy said it was gonna be worth a lot in the future. I actually understand how bitcoin is useful to me so it was a lot easier to hold.
I think most of the people that have held bitcoin for the longest didn't initially buy bitcoin just to resell them.

No they can’t. The reason they’re not responsible for illegal content on their platform is because they advertise themselves as being a public square that’s open to the public.

I used to think this too but it's a little more complicated.
The amount of trade that can can be done with bitcoin is limited by it's market cap. If the total market cap of bitcoin was only half a million dollars, you couldn't make a transaction for a million dollars because there's not even that much btc in existence.
At a market cap of 200 billion dollars it's not that great for stuff like international oil trade. 
If you want bitcoin to used more for more kinds of trade it will need to be a lot more valuable. 
It can't be a means of exchange without being a store of value.

The hard part is not getting robbed by exchanges and the government. Not your keys, not your coins... only a fool would put 100k on an exchange at once (unless 100k is a trivial amount for you) or in a fiat shitcoin and hope the people running it don't just steal it all. The top of the bubble is when the bigges exit scams happen. And then they use your coin to crash it.
What would probably happen is he would time the market perfectly and the exchange would "lose" his money in a "hack," or just keep demanding more personal information on order to "verify his identity" and then eventually start ignoring him completely, and he wouldn't be able to afford a lawyer because they have all his money. Or tether would implode and become worthless overnight while he's holding it. 
Your funds aren't secure if it's not in bitcoin or if you don't have the keys. When you tell noobs they would be bad at trading it sounds like a challenge. You gotta let em know there are bigger risks than bad trades.

I don't think there's an accurate way to quantify it, but it's at least theoretically possible for example, that the automobile specifically, has had a larger effect on humanity than the internal combustion engine in general.
It seems possible that the internet has had a larger effect on humanity than the computer, despite the fact that the internet needs computers to operate.
It seems possible that bitcoin is more valuable than "blockchain technology" despite the fact that bitcoin runs on a blockchain.

If you can buy one with less than 5% of your bitcoin then you should think about getting one. If you can buy one with 1% of your bitcoin then you should definitely have one.
Why you would want one:
One thing they don't mention here is that hardware wallets tend to be quick to implement new software and upgrades a way that's easier for newer users. They make it really easy to get your forked coins and they all had segwit way earlier than the free mobile wallets. Because you're actually paying for it, you can generally expect better software than a lot of free wallets (although this might not be as true anymore, apparently Samurai is really good and has funky features). 
I prefer Trezor personally. I find it easier to use, and it seems to work better with really old, shitty computers. Ledgers are a little cheaper and I believe they support more shitcoins, if you're into that.

@_date: 2018-06-10 22:47:09
I know this is a popular sentiment here, but I think it's wrong. Speculation is a type of investment, and in order for bitcoin to be usable as a means of exchange it must **first** be a store of value. The more people that hoard bitcoin, the higher liquidity and more value it has as a medium of exchange. We need hoarders in order to have spenders.










As the value of bitcoin increases, it will increase interest of merchants and other traders and financial people to use it. As the value increases, people won't be able to resist spending some and its use will increase. 
The value of bitcoin has gone up over the years **in spite** of people using it to purchase products (most merchants convert it to their local currency, driving down the market value), not because people use it to purchase products. The cause and effect is happening in the opposite order that you think it is.

@_date: 2018-06-11 03:07:19
I'm not "choosing" store of value over means of exchange, I'm saying that in order for it to be traded for goods and services it needs to actually be worth something. The less bitcoins are worth, the fewer goods and services can be purchased with them. The amount being transferred using bitcoin cannot possibly be worth more than all bitcoin in existence. Practically, it must be a lot less. This isn't my personal preference of what I want bitcoin to be, it's the economic reality. 
There is an immense amount of value transferred every day globally, and if you want bitcoin to compete with national currencies in any meaningful way (in terms of value being exchanged for goods and services), then bitcoins will have to be worth a lot more. And the only thing that makes them worth more long term is people holding them long term. Someone who buys a bunch of bitcoin, and then buys a bunch of stuff with them later and doesn't keep any for savings has the exact same effect on the "future success of bitcoin" as someone who buys a bunch and then sells it all for fiat later. They're both just playing hot potato with something they don't actually want, trying to pawn it off on the greater fool in a zero sum game of winners and losers. It's the people who recognize the value in it, and want to use it to store value, as savings, that give bitcoin most of its value. This is not done by "crushing the backs of others." The people of Venezuela will be better off if bitcoin is actually a viable alternative to their currency. If nobody wants to hold bitcoin, then it must not be.

Yeah, Sam Hyde talks about this in one of his video making fun of boomers. It's way different though. One difference is that we're actually part of a free market - we actually had to take a risk. And we don't have government programs artificially lowering price of bitcoin to allow us to buy it cheaply and then artificially propping it up after it skyrockets.
People live in houses. So they'd be trying to buy homes anyway. It wasn't a low time preference based investment with cost benefit analysis... it was "I want to live in a house." It wasn't a "smart" investment. It was given to them as a package deal with something they wanted anyway. They took this from us.
That's way different than holding a couple hundred thousand dollars in something we can't live in or rent out - something that the government isn't artificially propping up the price of to keep us as indentured servants.
I kind of agree with you, but it's way different. If this happens for us, we will have actually earned it.

Damn that sucks. I've always had good luck with Shapeshift but I decided to use Changelly this time because they had no limit, and the same thing thay happened to op happened to me (only I actually got my refund about 3 days later). But I remember thinking to myself "I'm gonna use Shapeshift next time so this doesn't happen." But I guess it can happen there too. It's funny, I used these services because I don't trust exchanges since I got goxed. I always time the market perfectly and always get fucked somehow.
They need a way to automate refunds in the case of a failed transaction. Since Changelly makes you have an account, maybe they could credit your account with it, so you can attempt the trade again without needing to go through the "waiting for payment" stage.
Either way, they need to find a way to not have to hold everyone's funds if something goes wrong. There has to be solution to this. Since shapeshift asks for the return address up front I just assumed the refund would be automatic.

I'll talk about how I lost. I was trying to profit from the b cash pump and dump. I got over 13 b cash for 2 btc at the beginning of the pump. I timed it perfectly and went to exchange them when 1 bitcoin was less than 3 b cash. I sent them to Changelly expecting to walk away with over 4 bitcoins (that's over 2 free bitcoins in the course of about a day) and then they went poof aaand they're gone.
I don't use exchanges because the last time I tried trading was on Gox when I successfully earned a bunch of free coins and tried to withdraw them aaaand they're gone.
This is why idiots like me shouldn't trade. Not because timing the market is hard, that shit's easy. The hard part is finding a trading platform that isn't going to fuck you over with "technical difficulties" when it's time to take your winnings.

I have a question. Did anyone actually get 2800$ for any of their bitcoin cash? Did anybody successfully dump bch at that ratio? I don't hold bch, but I knew a pump was imminent and got some for like a day to ride the wave. I literally saw that happening and tried to dump them for btc though Changelly when that was the ratio, and as you may have seen many of our funds were stuck. I also heard that Shapeshift was having issues. I also heard that some exchanges were failing. 
People who actually were able to exchange at that ratio, what exchange or service did you use? Many of us timed this perfectly but couldn't actually find a platform to exchange on that was functioning, and had our funds frozen until it was too late. 
People who were trading btc for bch at that ratio, are you real? I don't think anyone actually did that.
*I'm looking at bch charts and I'm not seeing any above 1600$, but your right, I remember seeing it supposedly worth that much that night. But was that even real? Someone who actually made that deal successfully, please report back.

Dude, what the fuck is your problem. Why are you such a butthurt fuckhead?
Anyway, here's a post from 6 years ago where I voiced my concern that the price had just doubled in a short period of time but was still considering buying. As you'd know if you weren't a total fucking noob no-coiner it went all the way to 250$ and then back to 70$ shortly after.
Here's another post after the crash where I said I was going to keep buying...
So is any of this supporting evidence of my claim or is this all an elaborate hoax?

The drug he gives away for free to people who don't have insurance?
How do people still not get this? The government forces you to buy insurance, and your insurance covers the drug. This removes every incentive to keep prices low. An increase in profits will allow the company to reinvest more money in the production of life saving drugs at no expense to the people taking it. He sounds like a fucking hero to me. There are plenty of other drugs that companies charge more for drugs that you don't care about because nobody told you to. Stop believing the left.

Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep at night.
I originally bought bitcoin to buy internet drugs. Once I found out what it actually was, that it was it's own decentralized currency and not just Silkroad drug credits, I was like fuck, I'm not spending this. Stopped buying drugs and got addicted to hoarding.
This article is from 2014. This idea definitely existed before this article was written. Especially among Ron Paul end the Fed types.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:05:23
Yeah, I guess it's more like that. But that was and is still the only option. You're comparing this to some ideal system in the future that doesn't actually exist yet. And you're basically saying that anyone who exchanges fiat for crypto in the current environment that actually exists deserves to get robbed. By your standards the only people who don't deserve to get robbed are people who mined their own coins or people who were given them for free. The other 99% of us deserve to get robbed because we used a bank at some point.
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:58:08

@_date: 2018-03-21 02:49:13
Corporations do that in real life, in the current world that we actually live in where the government exists. You should scrutinize your reality before criticizing my abstractions. Evidently, having a government doesn't prevent this from happening as you might have noticed from all of the times that this has actually happened. And no, government isn't the only thing working to prevent it. Not only are governments themselves the worst polluters of all, worse than any corporations, but the state and it's regulatory agencies shield corporations from liabilities and criminal prosecution through what is known as regulatory capture. They basically allow corporations to socialize the costs of doing business, while privatising the profits in exchange for more tax money. This is why corporations can dump toxic waste and destroy property and make people sick and get off paying a fine, while you or I would go to prison. Corporations are granted superhuman rights by the state. In the absence of the state these corporations would have the same rights as everyone else and would face criminal charges just like everyone else. As opposed to how it is now where they basically just pay them some hush money and are on their way to go do it again, but more discreetly this time.
So no, it's not cheaper when everything is privately owned and there are no "regulations" protecting them from getting thrown in jail or sued and paying out damages to the people they've hurt and for the property they've destroyed.

Holding and hoarding is good, but I think the best thing you can do (while holding) is demand to be paid in bitcoin. I tell everyone that owes me money, or potentially owes me money that I'd rather be paid in bitcoin and I'll even cut them a deal.

I agree with you that these are all things that need to happen, but all of these things ultimately involve more people holding bitcoin. 
And its usefulness is *correlated* (not equal to) to its value, as MrRGnome pointed out. At 10$ per coin it's not very useful for online gambling. At 100$ per coin it's not very useful for international oil trade. The market cap is the absolute maximum amount of value that can be transferred using bitcoin, and as the market cap increases so do it's potential use cases. I understand that if all the demand is simply speculators planning to trade it for more dollars in the future, that this creates an extremely fragile valuation that can be wiped out at any time. And you're right about what needs to be done to prevent that.
But it's still true that the more bitcoins are worth, the better Bitcoin is at doing the things that Bitcoin is supposed to do. It's not being overvalued that's the problem. It's losing value that's the problem. The only bad thing about being over valued is that it can lead to it losing value. But we still want it to be as valuable as possible for reasons other than greed and wanting to see our savings increase. It does make it more useful as a currency.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:36:13

It can't be used as a currency if it doesn't store value. Why would someone give you valuable goods in exchange for something with no value? It makes no sense. It has to be a store of value first before it can be  used as a medium of exchange. And the amount of commerce that the bitcoin network can absorb is directly correlated to the value of bitcoin. If bitcoin only had a 100,000$ market cap it couldn't possibly absorb more than 100,000$ worth of commerce.

Alex did a really good job staying neutral and distancing himself from both sides of the argument, but I think that deep down he knew that callers might be right. There were some subtle hints that regular listeners might have picked up on. He pointed out that he doesn't personally know and can't vouch for his guest much more often than he usually does. At one point he used the word "kingpin" to describe him, which anybody who is a fan of Alex Jones knows that he basically only uses that term for "bad guys." It's hard to explain, but as a regular listener, I think he picked up on it.
I'm willing to bet that because of all the negative callers and comments on social media, that the next guest he has on for bitcoin will be someone on the other side, because he actually cares about truth and exploring both sides of an argument. So fuck all y'all haters, Alex Jones is the man.

It depends what you mean by "rational." In economics (at least the Austrian school that I follow) "rational" doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea or smart. It just means people are pursuing their interests.
So if you're a heroin addict and you're not high, then it's "rational" to go out in search of heroin. If you don't have any money then it's "rational" to steal to support your addiction. It doesn't mean it's rational like it's a good idea, or it's moral, or anything like that. By this definition markets tend to be rational. But by the colloquial definition I guess it would be a value judgement.

Gox was a different because they allowed deposits at a time they weren't allowing withdrawals. This is different than going belly up with funds you already have. I didn't "store" any bitcoins on Gox. I transferred some in one day, then read about what was happening, and said "oh fuck" and immediately tried to withdraw it (in bitcoin) but it wouldn't let me. That probably *should* be illegal.
If everybody just accepted the fact that any exchange that trades bitcoin for fiat can legally take your bitcoins and then just say "fuck you we're keeping everything," their value would be next to nothing.
As long as fiat money is the norm, people are going to need to be able to trade fiat for crypto. If you give the exchanges carte blanche to straight up rob people, and then just blame the people who got their money stolen... how do you expect people to actually acquire bitcoins? Nobody would. They'd be like fuck that, I'm not giving money to someone who is legally allowed to steal it...
Regardless of whether or not I'm a moron for falling for such a scam, it's still a scam. Like if you go into a really shitty neighborhood with mad flashy shit on and you get robbed... yeah people can say you're stupid for doing that and kind of deserve it... but the person who rob's you is still a criminal and should still go to jail.

The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden aren't socialst, they're capitalist.
And capitalism and socialism are mutually exclusive, opposing concepts. You can't find a "balance" between them. Capitalism is privately controlled means of production. Socialism is worker or state controlled means of production. There's no middle ground. You have to pick a side or stay out of the argument. To say that we should take the best parts of both is to demonstrate that you don't understand either.
There are capitalist countries with huge welfare states and all kinds of economic fuckery, but ultimately they're capitalist because people are allowed to have private property. You're basically saying we should take the best parts of allowing people to own private property and the best parts of not allowing people to own private property.

I don't mean to sound like these over critical asshats, but out of curiosity, if your main reason for buying it is as an alternative to the current world order, then why do you plan to sell them in 5 years and return to that old world order? It's fine to use bitcoin as a speculative investment if that's what you want to do, and it's not using bitcoin "wrong" as some might argue, but if you bought them with the intention of "cashing out" into fiat then you are just gambling on a game of greater fools and your not really doing anything to challenge the current world order.

Any time I've felt the need to use high a fee it happened to be on transactions that either couldn't have ever happened without cryptocurrency, or cases where the choices for payment were either bitcoin payment or wire transfer. In both cases I was happy to pay the fee as it was the better option. I'm sure there are other reasons, and I'm curious to find out what they are.
But you still haven't answered the question. Just give me one or two examples of when and why you've needed to use the higher fee.

It is immediate, it's just not confirmed immediately. When you use a credit card it says "pending" for a day or so. Even a 5 satoshi per byte transaction will be confirmed faster than that.

To the first point, I already mentioned that many people who lost money weren't storing their coins there. They simply went to make a trade and had their funds stolen.
To the second point, I already mentioned that you're describing an ideal situation that might exist in the future, not the actual situation we find ourselves in in real life.
I think we both agree about storing coins on exchanges. My point is that this advice doesn't really go far enough. 
We should also be advising people to "never exchange more bitcoin for fiat than you're willing to lose because exchanges can literally just steal your money legally and you'll have no legal recourse and everyone is going to call you an idiot and say it's your fault." But we don't usually say that because it doesn't sound good and will turn off a lot of people.

Yes, bitcoin is a barometer of freedom, but in the opposite way you describe. Bitcoin is most valuable in the places with the least freedom. A less free world will make bitcoin more desirable, not less. A more optimistic view is that bitcoin and precious metals are struggling because the economy *isn't* collapsing. If you want either of these to increase in value you should vote for democrats and socialists that will crash the economy and force people to adopt them (I do not advocate this strategy).

It's just used as a proxy to represent purchasing power.
The market cap gives us an idea of the amount of commerce that the currency can absorb. If the market cap was only half a million dollars, then you couldn't buy something that costs a million dollars. If the market cap was 10 million, then a couple people buying lambos with bitcoin would cause a massive crash. The more valuable bitcoins are, the more commerce the system can support. If nobody valued bitcoins enough to keep them, then there's no way people could use them in trade as they'd be considered completely valueless. In order for someone to be able to spend bitcoins, someone else needs to want bitcoins. People who say that hoarders aren't helping are wrong. It becomes a better medium of exchange as more people use it as a store of value. The greater the market cap, the more useful it is.

Mass incarceration is a result of prisons being treated as a public good, not a result of private prisons. 
Governments seeks to expand and acquire resources as well, and without the limitations imposed on private corporations. The people who build prisons, the people who sell them supplies and food, the guards, law enforcement, all have a vested interest in keeping people in prison and lobby the government for harsher sentences for victimless crimes. Government workers don't want to be out of jobs. Suppliers want to sell them more stuff, and governments provide an endless stream of money. This is the cause of corruption and mass incarceration. It doesn't matter if the prison is "privately" owned. The state ultimately decides who to imprison, and the corruption is totally legal and socially accepted. The solution isn't to treat prisons a public good, but to privatize every aspect of law enforcement.

From the Trezor website:
How is TREZOR different from...
an ordinary Web Wallet?

your mobile phone?
a USB flash drive?
an encrypted wallet?
a paper backup of my keys?
 
Also, something that isn't mentioned here is that they're really quick to implement upgrades that allow for a much easier user experience. 
For example, the only way I've been able to use segwit is on my trezor. None of the other wallets I use have it yet.
Also, it made it really easy to access my bitcoin cash so that I could trade them for real bitcoins. I honestly wasn't about to go through a the trouble until I saw how easy they made it. You just click the "claim bitcoin cash" button.
Whenever there's some kind of update like segwit or a fork like bcash, I feel like the hardware wallets are the first ones to make that stuff accessable to dumbfucks like me.

This is wrong. Bigger operations don't necessarily have a higher profit ratio. All else being equal, someone who buys 100 miners is just going to make or lose 100x as much money as someone who buys 1. But bigger operations need to pay employees, and pay for a lot more electrical upgrades etc. You're not going to need to put in special wiring for 1 miner*, and you're not going to be paying employees. So assuming the same electrical costs, the small time/side job is going to have less overhead and wider profit margin than the full scale operation. It has a lot more to do with the cost of power and hardware... scale is irrelevant other than that you might get cheaper power if you're buying a lot of it. But there's always going to be someone with cheaper power. 
*but you will need to use a dedicated circuit
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:52:47
When people ask "what are the benefits of a hardware wallet?" this stuff tends to get overlooked. There's the obvious security benefits, but they also seem to always be early to make important updates like this. Trezor also made it very easy to securely access my bitcoin cash without exposing the private key. Trezor is the only way I've been able to use segwit.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:32:16
He's wrong, it doesn't cost nearly that much... It costs about 1500$ for an S9 and a psu, so that's the minimum you'd spend. I recommend you try it, but I also recommend that you look at it as a hobby that costs money, rather than as a side job that makes money. Because you'll probably lose money. But hey, you might not. Think of it as a scratch ticket that costs 1500$ up front and 100$ a month or more, but that also has the possibility of suffering hardware failures, etc.
It's not nearly as hard to get into as people make it out to be, but you hafta be ok with maybe losing 1500$. If you got money to play with I say do it.
Be careful, it's addictive...

@_date: 2017-09-15 23:32:14
Yeah, when you pay money for something there's a much bigger expectation that it works properly, and there's a much bigger incentive for them to want to satisfy the users and stay up to date. Free wallets are fine for smaller amounts, but the fact that they're free probably means less people are (or nobody is) getting paid to fix problems with them and keep them updated. They don't really owe you anything the same way that someone who actually sells you a product and makes claims about it does.

What's to say that the total money supply stays at 80 trillion though? There's no cap on the amount of value that the human race can produce legitimately, and there's no cap on the amount of money that banks can print. If the human race becomes richer and more prosperous as time goes on, then won't that be reflected by an increase in the total circulation of the money that represents that wealth? I assume that the total money supply was a lot less than (the equivalent of, adjusting for inflation and other factors) 80 trillion a century ago, right? I know a lot of that is just money printing and inflation that adds no real value, but surely more actual wealth / value exists today than back then.
Isn't it possible that cryptocurrency could actually add value to the total overall wealth of humanity rather than just taking away the value of existing currencies? And if it doesn't, then isn't it essentially valueless?
I really am asking and not trying to make an argument. Can someone smarter than me tell me if this makes any sense?

Keep in mind, it doesn't actually take 20 trillion $ to bring the cap to 20 trillion $. All that would need to happen is everyone with bitcoin would need to decide they're not selling below a million dollars a coin or so. It's not like people would need to spend 20 trillion on bitcoins.

Having more rigs doesn't necessarily increase your profit margins unless you're already paying massive overhead on a large scale operation. Someone with 1 miner who pays 5¢ per kWh is going to have a higher profit margin than someone with 1000 miners who pays 6¢ per kWh. While having a larger scale operation might result in lower energy costs by buying in bulk, in the end it's these lower energy costs themselves and not the scale that makes the difference. So if you have cheap power, then go for it.
In fact, I'd argue that energy costs being the same, the smaller miner has an advantage. Building a large scale mining operation requires massive overhead in construction and electrical upgrades, employees, security, etc. One person running a single miner in their home doesn't (generally) require any electrical upgrades, just put it on it's own circuit (conduct an electrician if you don't know what you're doing) and plug it in. So all else (electricity costs) being equal, you'd make a higher percentage profit.
Of course you probably don't have cheaper power... but you could imagine what it would be like if you did...
My point is that this "you have to have a ton of miners to make your money back" train of thought is wrong. Having 100 miners just means that you'll make or lose 100x as much money as if you had one. So if you have expensive electricity and aren't profitable then having more miners is just going to make you lose more money. It's more about electricity costs than scale.

You don't need 10k to invest in hardware and you don't need to to use 10k in power a month. The amount you pay on hardware up front has no effect on your profit percentage. Buying 10 antminer s9's will be 10x more profitable or less profitable than buying one. So you can buy just one and you're not at a disadvantage to someone who buys 100. In fact, since there's no real overhead to operate just one, if the cost of power was equal then you'd actually be at an advantage because you probably wouldn't be installing special circuits, renting space, and paying employees.
And you don't need 1¢ power either. Yeah, that'd be ideal, but you really don't. I remember people in 2013 saying mining isn't profitable and isn't worth it. I'm pretty sure that was bullshit then - I recently tested it and I'm pretty sure it's bullshit now. People were saying the same shit about buying the L3+ litecoin miner for 1250$ a while back and mine paid themselves off in like a month (I don't have cheap electricity).

You can't just make an assertion and hold everyone else to a higher standard saying they have to formulate an argument... that's just weird. Why do so many people do this?

I generally agree that, *in a free market* companies should be able to discriminate against whomever they like.
The banking system, however, isn't a free market. There are very strong relationships between the banks and government. We are legally obligated, in many cases, to use this banking system. 
Letting banks discriminate against gun owners is very similar to letting energy companies shut off the power of anybody who voted for Trump. This would be illegal for energy companies, for good reason, and there are laws in place preventing this. If there aren't laws in place to prevent banks from doing this then there should be.

Not nearly as big of a deal.. but I got 50 ethereum when they were under a dollar cuz my friend who is into crypto told me I should get some. Then when it got up to like 11 dollars in February I started actually reading about it. When I saw that the ether wasn't meant to be a store of value but more of a digital token for smart contracts I was like... so what's to point of keeping this, then? And traded it for btc. Like a month later it shoots straight up. At least btc is up too, which mitigates some of the loss, but it would've been another nice 10k in the old crypto-folio.  I kind of secretly hope it fails just cuz I missed out ��.  So yeah, fuck Ethereum.

It doesn't matter how perfect of a position you are in, nobody is going to give you advice, they're just going to tell you not do it. You'll be competing with people who know how to mine, so they have no reason to give you advice, and people who don't do it will try to justify their inaction by trying to convince you that it's not profitable (while out of the other side of their mouths they complain about how greedy miners are and how they make too much money and provide no value). Any question you ask will be answered with "if you don't already know this, you haven't done enough research". Most of these responses will be from people who have never mined anything. Good luck, and don't waste too much more time asking reddit what to do, they'll just obfuscate and spread fud.

It's not even necessarily a utilitarian argument. If someone threatens to give up your location to someone who you both know is trying to kill you or lock you in a cage for life, then you have a right to kill them, and therefore you have a right to pay someone else to kill them. I'm much more of a moralist than a utilitarian, and as I said in my reply to Spats_McGee, I'd rather 1000 snitches get killed than 1 meth dealer spend a month in prison for providing people with something they want.

I think it's cuz there are so many shitcoins out there, so instead of telling people to be smart about which one they choose and explaining what's good and bad, it's easier to just assume they're a moron and tell them to stick with bitcoin. Just like how you can make shit tons of money trading, but everyone will say "don't do that" because they don't want stupid people to come back complaining about how they lost all their money listening to your advice. It's kind of a smug and annoying attitude that scares people out of doing things that could improve their lives... but I totally get why it's the default answer. There are a lot of dumbasses and even the highly intelligent can be ignorant. But it's like saying "oh, well most businesses fail, therefore you shouldn't start a business." Yeah, you shouldn't if you have no idea what your doing... but it's possible that some of these people could get an idea if they weren't afraid to try.

I wouldn't agree with his decision to do this either, but don't you support voluntary free association and the right of business owners to manager their finances how they see fit? Isn't this the point of bitcoin? Don't get me wrong, it would be a dick move for sure, but do you really think that force is warranted here?
You say he's "fucking with people's livelihoods", but he's doing that anyway just by being a business owner and employing people. If he runs the business into the ground through bad management and everyone loses their jobs, then he's fucked with their livelihood more than if he pays them in bitcoin. Should he be able to get sued for that too?
Now if they worked for a week and he said "oh yeah, by the way, the hours you've already worked are going to be paid in bitcoin" then that would surely be fraud and legal action (force) would be totally warranted. If he tells them this before they work the hours then I wouldn't consider it a crime unless it violates the employment contract. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:48:39
Even if he was laundering money that he had gotten illegally, if it was earned through victimless "crimes" would you consider it immoral for him to launder the money? Do you think that every "crime" (made up by government) is immoral and there are no victimless crimes? I can think of plenty of scenarios where someone would want to launder money for totally non-immoral reasons, like earnings from selling weed, or transporting illegal immigrants, or illegal gambling, or any kind of smuggling. That's without even getting into whether or not your two scenarios would count as immoral. If someone is doing something that I don't consider to be an actual crime, then I wouldn't consider it a crime to hide their activities from people who want to lock them up for it. What purpose does the law serve for you? Is it on the side of morality or control?

I didn't like it either at first, for the same reason. The thing is, you just have to listen to it when you're not in a "high energy" state of mind, or when you don't want to be in a high energy state of mind. When I'm cleaning or doing dishes for example, I usually go high energy. If I'm doing something that requires more focus, like playing Starcraft, I don't want to hear crazy distracting drops and stuff. That shits even annoying when you're trying to read and write stuff online. Once you listen to good stuff in the right mood, you'll want to listen to it to get yourself into that mood the same way you listen to high energy stuff to get excited.

Yeah, but what sparked the initial investigation? It's not like darknet market users are going to go to the police to report their drug money stolen. Probably undeclared income being converted into dollars, I assume, but that sounds like the easiest part of the scam to get away with.
It's just funny that the government is essentially protecting darknet market users here. I'd almost think they'd be like, 'oh, you're defrauding druggies, cool, slap on the wrist.' It's funny that they can barely catch the drug kingpins but they can nab this guy that's pulling of a non-drug related scam within that market. Next they should take on the vendors building up trust and then pulling exit scams.

It's not that I care about losing the money. Before the spike and the crash when it was at 90$ I started telling all my friends and parents about how I'm thinking of buying bitcoins and how awesome it is (I had wanted to buy them for a while but was intimidated). They all tell me I'm retarded and it's obviously a scam and I'm gonna lose all my money, so I didn't buy any. Once it got to 240$ I was finally like "fuck this I'm getting in, better late than never" and hours later it crashes. The 300$ dollars I lost on my first day of Bitcoin is nothing compared to the embarrassment of being wrong (not that Bitcoin is a "scam" but that I'm going to lose all my money). Whatever, I'm still going to keep buying more. And probably keep losing money. I'm gonna dig my way out of this hole.

Yeah, it’s a shitty meme (not shooting the messenger). Basically anyone they view as dirty peasants that are beneath them. The funny thing is those lowlifes were buying in 2013 and I remember those jokes back then. There are junkies and webcam whores with more coin than these punks, but they think they’re so cutting edge. I mean if you’re one of those people that wants dollars more than bitcoin, you should consider selling when pencil necked namby-pamby skinny fingered tech nerd soyboy redditors start saying you have to get in.

So if the employees can't decide what currency they get paid in because it's not their company... and the owner can't decide what currency to pay employees in because of "fairness" or something... then who has any say in the employer / employee relationship other than the government? This is the whole point of bitcoin. Financial freedom between the two parties involved; nobody else has any say in it. No government saying you can't buy drugs on the internet. No government saying you can't pay illegal aliens below minimum wage. It's the same principle. Voluntary association.
If I work from home for a foreign company that pays in Zimbabwe dollars, am I entitled to get my paycheck in whatever currency I happen to use?
Whether it's bitcoin, dollars, quark coins or Zimbabwe dollars doesn't matter. If I don't like the pay, or whatever currency it's paid in then I don't have to take or keep that job. Nobody owes me anything. My boss doesn't ask for my permission when he makes business decisions. A good boss will take the employees wishes into consideration... but they make the final choice.

I didn't sign a contract with my boss saying that he'd guarantee to pay me in dollars for any period of time, nor did I sign a contract that prohibits him from firing me. If he wants to pay me in bananas then I'm gonna have to find a new job. If a monkey can do my job better than me and only ask for bananas, then that monkey deserves that job more than I do. Why do people think their bosses owe them shit?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:21:07
It would only be "without consent" if he paid them in bitcoin for hours they've already worked, or if they had a contract that guaranteed payment in dollars and still only gave them bitcoin.
If they continue to work for him, then they consent to being paid in bitcoin. If they don't consent to being paid in bitcoin then they stop working for him. 
Bosses don't need consent to make all kinds of decisions in the workplace. The general rule is that if you don't consent then you compromise or you don't work there anymore.
It's like saying "my boss fired me without my consent!" 
He shouldn't need your consent to do what he wants with his business.

Being libertarian isn't putting your entire faith into one type of ideology. It isn't putting "faith" in anything. It's simply taking a moral stand against the initiation of force or using coercion or threats of violence to forcibly control people or steal their property. There's still plenty of room for people to have totally different beliefs (libertarian socialists vs capitalists), because libertarianism in general does nothing to propose how things **should** be. It only says what we shouldn't do (violate the non-aggression principle)
Libertarianism is more of a philosophy or a moral stance whereas democrat or republican for example is more of a political ideology (this is why outsiders see it as being "cult like"). It's more comparable to being a pacifist or a vegetarian than a member of a political party (some libertarians go so far and say that the fact that there is a "libertarian" political party is a contradiction in terms). 
This is why you **can not** be *kind of* a libertarian; you either are, or you're not. If you say "I'm a libertarian when it comes to economic issues, but when it comes to social issues I'm more conservative". That's like saying "I don't eat pork so I'm a vegetarian when it comes to eating pork, but I still eat steaks and chicken".
I don't get how you can take something Max Keiser says, and use that to discredit libertarianism in general, or say we should be more skeptical of it. I agree that we should be skeptical of everyone who tries to manipulate our opinions including people that call themselves libertarians... but libertarianism is pretty solid. He's not our representative. We didn't get 100% (notice I didn't say 51%... this is another important part of libertarianism) of libertarians together and agree that he's going to be our spokesperson. 
Him being wrong does nothing to prove that I shouldn't be unapologetically opposed to the initiation of violence against my fellow man. If Max Keiser burned down an orphanage tomorrow, it would say nothing of libertarianism other than that he's not one.

My friend was recently selling some concert tickets on stubub.com. I asked him how it works and he said that you just send someone the PDF of the tickets, that person pays Stubhub, and Stubhub sends you a check after taking 15% of the sale.
When he said that, I immediately thought about bitcoin and how it eliminates the need for a trusted third party. But I don't know how the person buying the tickets could be sure they're not getting ripped off and buying counterfeit tickets. 
I hear people talking about how you can write contracts into the system and stuff like that... so I was wondering...
Could someone make something similar to Stubhub, where transactions are done in BTC without a middleman, and without someone being at risk of getting ripped off? Or would you still need that trusted third party anyway?
I was just wondering if that could work. Either way it would be way better to use BTC even if you still need the third party.

Compromise - yes, in most situations, but not always. Democracy - no, not in the sense that it exists today as a form of government (although it is useful for plenty of other applications).
I should have clarified what I meant by the slavery comparison. I was trying to be quick and get off of reddit, but obviously that's not gonna be so easy. I wasn't trying to say that government is the same as slavery or that it's equally bad. The point I was trying to demonstrate is that...
If you are morally or philosophically opposed to something, then you can't be "too extreme" (unless of course you're using violence against innocent people that aren't actually part of the conflict, like what terrorists/governments do). If you believe that slavery violates people's rights, then you have the right to violate somebody's "right" to own slaves. These people aren't going to become less "extreme" and agree to phase out of slavery slowly to make it less traumatic for the plantation owners. The only ways for plantation owners to win is by winning a fight, or convincing them that slavery isn't wrong. I used to not be morally opposed to government, then somebody convinced me. Now you're not going to convince me by saying "what about welfare? don't you care about poor people? just don't be so extreme on this one aspect of government". The only way you'll get me to condone the welfare state is by re-convincing me that government isn't inherently immoral. 
I'll try to do a more nuetral example... Al-Qaeda is philosophically opposed to Western civilization. I don't really have a huge problem with this. I am however, morally opposed to killing civilians. So the solutions are 
1) Al-Qaeda convinces me that killing civilians isn't bad.
2) I convince Al-Qaeda that western civilization isn't bad.
3) One of us is killed.
None of us are going to become less extreme. I'm just as extreme as they are... but I'm right. I'm not suddenly going to say "yeah killing civilians is ok sometimes". And I don't think Al-Qaeda is gonna be say "well, we really like watching the superbowl so... not all of western civilization is bad."
I'm getting prettaay fucking off topic at this point... I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if you're beliefs on a given topic are not "extreme", then you must not care very much about that topic.
