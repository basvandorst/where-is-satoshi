The legality of the currency can still be tested in court, as FinCen has no authority over the judicial branch.

New to bitcoin does not mean new to economics. He could have a degree in the subject for all we know. Just sayin'.
Also, great idea about thr new karma thing! If people posted their btc addresses when they commented or posted to we could have a new form of anon karma, where good posters are rewarded in money, thus reinforcing quality! (No begging, just the address!)

I was just thinking about this sort of thing to myself a few nights ago. Without food being purchasable, BTC is just a fancy way of transferring USD. Glad to see someone stepping up to bat!

A sneaky man could do it. A sneaky man *would* do it. What *keeps* a sneaky man from doing it?

Richard Stallman is a ninja, the awesome Chuck Norris of the freedomers! He does not need to be sent, he knows instinctively where proprietary mindsets rest, and will come and replace the thoughts in the holder's sleep. He does not kill anyone in the traditional sense, he kills by changing the person until they are no longer who they ever were. Be afraid, my friend. Be very, very afraid. (And *RUN*!)

I think they bumped it down to 25, which makes your argument stronger.

Sounds like fun. Thanks for the link! Enjoy your coinage (I assume you got some from when I signed up)!

They are targeting it, alright, just indirectly. Their main focus is the silk road (and rightly so, as it's an illegal thing and they are makers of law), but BTC stands directly in the cross hairs as it is the only mechanism by which trading is done on the site. Basically, the danger here is that they will attempt to stop the car by removing the gas from the tank.

VEB -&gt; Gold/Silver -&gt; Bitcoin?

Please, explain your reasoning.

My guess is that it doesn't. There is no way that BitCoin can be tracked, and even if they somehow do catch someone using it they won't be able to find anyone else. At worst, this will bring the legality of BitCoin to court (where it is almost certain to fail), and at best no-will notice.

While I know it' Mount Gox, I mentally say it as 'McGocks'
