Sounds an awful lot like you are being brainwashed to be an unpaid employee. Requiting advertisers, helping Users, having a company email address calling yourself part of the team. You are an employee. If you are fine working for free good on you, doesn't change that you work for them. You should be getting a real salary not settling for whatever Junocredits you get. You are being exploited for free labor and don't even realize it.

3.9m given out, 3.4m users. Have been around for years and average barely over $1 per user. Assuming you have a lot that do make good profit, that means a HUGE percentage of the 3.4m users you claim to have are inactive. Maybe you should look at why so many users join then don't continue.

I think he is saying thanks for pointing it out, like most people don't understand how costly even small minor things can be if you add then all up.

I've seen that same reply a dozen times over posts from the past week, yet no one is claiming they were ever helped. There is a CLEAR issue here. Many people with the same complaints in the same time frame. You guys really need to man up, admit there is an issue, and update us. When you are dealing with peoples money you can't jerk us around like this. There is clearly a widespread issue. Admit and keep us in the loop with how you are resolving it.

I don't see it as a withdraw option. Maybe I don't have enough... Whatever I went ahead and put a few bucks worth of BTC in just to try it. Deposit went fine.
