If you're talking about an actual network node it uses very little hardware and network usage. You also don't get paid for running a node.
If you're talking about mining (where you get paid) you're on the wrong track.

They know and don't care.
If you want to actually do something useful support other forms of awareness that help people know what Bitcoin is.

Basically what it started out for? Security, anonymity, reliability, decentralized and no authority. I trust Bitcoins technology and the developers more than I do other coins.
Sure you can find some or all of these things in other coins, but you can never be sure if they're as reliable as Bitcoin until it's proven through time.
Until then altcoins can be used for short term transactions. Bitcoin is still way worth it.

I'm pretty sure many Banks are already highly involved with Bitcoin. Who do you think is jacking up the price? Your regular Joe choosing to buy some Bitcoin from his bungalow? Maybe your average IT tech kid living in his shared apartment?
Obviously not. These are big investors and banks buying large amounts of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin becomes a common form of currency, it's the ones who control the largest amount that will control the economy.
Bitcoin won't help us escape from this, it will just reduce a bit of power that the reserves and banks hold.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:44:18
You can already do that. Wallets like green address for example give you the value of Bitcoin in USD or EUR or whatever. Any store can have their own wallet and accept transactions directly.
I think the issue lies more on the legal aspect. You need an application that will give out a receipt (proof of sale) that can be used to settle disputes and for taxation.
These applications are technically third party. They need to be maintained with the current Bitcoin technology that is always evolving. There won't be any way to eliminate it entirely, but at the same time it shouldn't be hard to replace (unlike with what we have with MasterCard and Visa etc.)
This will probably change though once the block chain becomes the main source for proving transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:21:13
It was partly because of the fees but mostly because of the volatility. I would also say it's more of a temporary suspension rather than totally removing it. They'll bring it back once Bitcoin becomes a viable option for making transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:23:01


But it kind of does. You can raise it by buying $.01, but if there's a wall of 50 BTC at $9000, it ain't going to go higher than that before those 50 BTC get sold. For now I believe the exchanges have a good picture of the current supply/demand for BTC.


I was talking about the federal reserves, like the ECB and FED. With Bitcoin they would become obsolete, but banks would probably still hold most power in the economy either way.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:48:11
That's a good point, but I think considering that mining the main block would still be most profitable, large miners wouldn't bother with attempting to mine the backlog.
This all depends on how it is implemented. I imagined having a separate "winning hash" for each block, this way it's not practical to mine both the main block and the backlog ones.
The difficulty level would also be a key factor. Making it too easy would simply make it more profitable, taking hashpower from the main chain. Making it too difficult would discourage it being mined outright.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:33:22

It's good to start investing at your age. Even if you don't make money, you'll probably learn a lot from the experience.
Give it a try and be patient. Don't get scared of the ups and downs of the market. I would suggest just leaving it in your wallet and not touching it until you need the money.

~~What you stated is not a problem. That's what people perceive as a problem or downside to something that wasn't created to be used as a currency. If you wish to use it that way, then you're better off staying with fiat.~~
The person you're replying to already gave you the answer as to why not increase the block size. I also assume the core devs are not interested in a short term solution to this "problem", but a solution to improve it and have scalability.
Also, I would imagine that doubling the block size would only halve the transaction fees and wait time. But it would quickly return to how it is now during peak periods or when the user base increases..
Edit: I stand corrected. BTC was designed for online transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:31:07
This has nothing to do with price. Miners don't decide the price of Bitcoin ...
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:28:11
That's a really stupid plan imo. Not only is the ticker symbol not going to be based on the coins value (at least for Coinbase it won't), most exchanges won't enable b2x trading until it's safe.
Aside from that you're assuming miners and other randoms have loads of money to risk to cause this spike, which I'm sure they don't. We're talking about billions being put into Bitcoin for a plan that's already doomed to fail.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:58:15
I don't get it. From the translation it looks like it's defining Bitcoin as a currency.

Do you know that the difficulty reduces?
Bitcoin is already safe proof against the majority of miners leaving the chain. If they do that, the difficulty will be adjusted and other smaller miners will take their place. It's that simple... It won't just die out.

Why are other cryptos worth virtually nothing? Why do over 90% of them fail? Because they think of the short term, unlike Bitcoin. There isn't much reason to compare Bitcoin with other cryptos just yet.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:01:20


I guess you're right. Reviewing the white paper it seems that this was the initial intention of bitcoin (not exactly to be a 'currency', but to be used for transactions).


I'm not a pro on this stuff but here's what I understand:
The issue is basically the same short and long term, but it will increase exponentially as time goes by. By increasing the block size we're further segregating the node network to those who are able to keep up with the network's growth (in short, those who have a decent internet connection and processing system). Long-term issue is that the network will now grow at a much faster rate, so the amount of segregation (and especially initial entrance barrier into the network) will increase.
It's vital that any average user can set up a node/miner and support the system. Increasing the block size will reduce the amount of 'average users' that can do so.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:07:28
Yup it will dip but nobody knows until what point. I think it's too inflated right now and will have a steep drop (probably back to €5700-5900 range)
No bad news about Bitcoin so far though. As long as there's no bad news it has a pretty steady trend upwards. Curious to see what will happen on the November 16 fork.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:00:57
It doesn't affect prices. Uninformed people are spouting this nonsense. If miners had so much control over the price then Bitcoin would not be a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:51:56
Obviously they're going to settle in cash. At the moment you can't pay bills with Bitcoin so why would you even consider settling with it? Just illogical.. 
And yes futures don't directly affect the value of Bitcoin but this creates more acceptance of it in the financial world which is extremely important.
Attacks on clients? So your broker doesn't want you to make money? Well ok....

It's true that ASIC miners have made CPU/GPUs obsolete and created a barrier of entry, but this just gives less reason to segregate the community further. You also don't need to join mining pools, you're free to be a sole-contributor (even though you'll earn less). 


It doesn't? From what I understand it seems that it is essential for nodes to also be decentralized to avoid false transactions/attacks. You're basically saying it's ok if less people hold the btc ledger. I don't see why.


It doesn't scale well for initial loads, but if it's kept at a pace where technology can keep up, it might not need to. Right now the block chain is passed 100GB.. Even living in a developed nation with average internet speed, this can take hours or days to download. The difference between a 1MB block size and 2MB block in the long run could determine whether or not the btc ledger will be available to the average user. If it's not, then it's back to trusting the guys in suits.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:49:39
I don't know if it will go that low. Only if bad news pops up, otherwise it's upwards.

You're right about the housing crash though you do leave out some details. 
Either way it's extremely risky as anybody would tell you to put a credit loan on Bitcoin. Loans are not for investment. If you do that you're basically betting your financial well being on the success of Bitcoin which has seen multiple crashes in the past.
I've so far only invested money I already have in Bitcoin, but if I were to take such an action it would be a rather small loan, something that I can easily afford to pay off in case it all goes down.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:07:10

@_date: 2017-09-30 20:29:58
In a business perspective this is expected. I see no issue with companies accepting bitcoin and instantly converting it to a less volatile currency, but just the fact that they accept it could create more demand and acceptance.
In the end it's a win-win.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:35:44
They would have to pay you for the current amount that Bitcoin is worth, so what difference does it make? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:49:17
I'm not sure why you're talking about its creation. I never mentioned that, but you even get that part wrong.
It was created to be a trustless system that requires no third party. Literally just need to read the introduction. THIS was the real reason as to why people bought into Bitcoin. Trustlessness, anonymity, security, decentralized.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:40:52
That's my point... BTC will probably continue to plummet, so I don't see why Chinese would try to buy now.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:37:47
Simple: if price is going down it makes mining less profitable. If a group of investors wants Bitcoin to fail, this would be the perfect time. Raise the hashpower to increase the difficulty to the point that Bitcoin would be no longer profitable to mine. Transactions will decrease for at least 2 weeks (probably more), enough time to cause a panic and a major crash.
All that will be left are the hardcore members that will mine at a loss to try and keep it alive. 
Of course this isn't so easy to achieve because the difficulty would need to increase significantly to remove all for-profit miners, but it's definitely possible especially when you have billions on the line.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:20:06

That wasn't the only reason. Actually, it was probably barely of any significance when people started adopting Bitcoin. There are many other options that will transfer money for you quicky and at low cost. 
Please stop promoting this as if it's the only good thing that Bitcoin had.

I'm not sure what you're worrying about here. When will you ever try to make a purchase using more than €3000 in cash? And that being legally (with a receipt). The most I've ever paid out in cash was probably around 700-800 dollars and there was no receipt so it wasn't actually a legal transaction.

Copay uses a wallet address service that can be changed but by default directs to their servers. I used to use their wallet too and was really disappointed after I found out about them supporting b2x.
Anyways you can try changing the address to a valid BTC node but I've had no luck and instead got a different wallet instead (check Bitcoin.org for valid wallets). If you don't change the address I think you'll end up having b2x on your next transaction after the fork but I'm not entirely sure.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:13:18
Those are companies that provide Bitcoin services, but whether they are actually involved largely in being part of the Bitcoin economy (in terms of holding Bitcoin) then that's probably not the case. They only support it so much as they would support another alt-coin, which is to provide services for that coin as well - except S2X is more complicated.
Most holders are individuals, investors, and possibly some large corporations/banks (including miners). These make up most of the Bitcoin economy.

Sure we can argue that way, but in that case you should stop using currency that was made by your government, stop going to stores that accept cash only, and stop using money in general, cause it's nobodies business how you use your money...
I agree that it shouldn't be the government's business in how we use our money, but at the same time we want to use the currency they produce (or not) and reduce corruption. 
This law is to stop money launderers from making huge purchases with cash, it won't really affect regular citizens. I assume OP is not a money launderer which is why I questioned his worrying.

Either Bitcoin will die out before it becomes mainstream (or very low in value) or it will cause a global financial crisis (not because it would replace Fiat).
If you read back on history, back when gold was used as the main form of currency, you'll learn why fiat was made in the first place: A solution to the world's stagnant economy due to the demand for gold.
Basically, people of the time didn't spend or consume as they do now cause it was preferable to hodl your gold. Why buy that new BMW when you know you can buy two if you wait a year? (Intentionally exaggerated)
The limited quantity of Bitcoin will probably be its down fall some time in the future, though I hope I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:25:14
Yes but that's not where most of it's value comes from. Gold is mostly expensive cause it's a fairly rare metal and for it's demand in jewelry (low supply, high demand); if we removed jewelry entirely from the picture gold would be really cheap.
And the demand for jewelry doesn't make gold useful because it's not a necessity. Also since other metals can be used as conductors it makes gold even less useful.
It's about the same for crypto and fiat. It only represents value but has no real value (or very little) in itself.

@_date: 2017-10-19 07:12:14
With an ever increasing demand and a fixed supply curve, nobody will want to send Bitcoin across the world. It also doesn't matter how much you can split it, as you can do the same to gold up to a certain extent. You could define 0.01 BTC as the new standard unit but in the end it's 1% of a btc. This won't give it more value or increase the quantity only make it easier to understand.

I heard about the wallet around here but I've never used it, so not sure, sorry. I've used Electrum and GreenAddress, both are good but Electrum feels like using a 90's business program while GreenAddress is similar to CoPay, probably just a little less sleek.
Here's the link I was referencing to before:
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:44:13
No because PayPal is used only for regular online transactions, takes long to register and also process.
Kakao's services would be more similar to a mix of companies like Google, Facebook and PayPal. They provide basically everything you'd need online.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:19:17
Probably not since Bitcoin is primarily used as a currency and this would be a logical business strategy (accepting Bitcoin part).
It's something rather predictable. Not like you'll release a completely new, unexpected revolutionary product so you buy stocks right before the announcement. That would be more similar to insider trading.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:54:13
The only real reason to remove your coins from the exchange is because of how disruptive S2X will be, otherwise it wouldn't be an issue.
You can check the following link for reliable Bitcoin core wallets:
I recommend using Electrum or GreenAddress with a 2FA Wallet (**use Google Authenticator**, other methods are very insecure). You can also set up a Bitcoin Core node or a Multi-sig wallet instead if you have the time (and tech savyness) to do it.

Sorry to burst your bubble but what he's saying is mostly true. Transferring value instantly is not worth that much with the technology we have today, and if this is what made Bitcoin valuable then it would focus on cheap and fast transaction speeds but it doesn't.
The main driver for fiat currency, cryptos, and some commodities like gold is speculation/demand. When it comes to utility there isn't much to talk about.

Ok, that's understandable. Maybe for you it would make a difference, though I do believe you are an exception. From a utilitarian perspective, it's just too impractical right now to acquire and use bitcoin regularly when compared to fiat.
Edit: Quote from a previous comment of mine:


@_date: 2017-10-26 14:02:27
Go to Bitcoin.org for all the info you need on getting started.
They have a list of wallets that is constantly updated to only have the ones that support BTC core and are trustworthy. There are other good wallets that are not on the list however.
You can find the wallets at:
 
Make sure you try to set up a 2of3 verification wallet with two factor authentication that uses Google authenticator (2of2 is not bad either) and physically store your word seeds. That's the most secure form of holding your coins aside from a physical wallet. Don't forget to do a small test (receive/send) before putting all your coins in the wallet.
Best of luck! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:04:49
Global trust? What trust exactly are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:08:33
Don't know. I think I will only ever care about using Bitcoin when it's easier or more beneficial to use over fiat/cards.
If I live in Europe, I use the Euro, because all my bills need to be paid in Euro and I get paid in Euro. Why would I care about paying in USD even if I had this option? There's no real benefit. Similar for Bitcoin at the moment.
The only situation right now where I'd use Bitcoin is if I needed to make an international transfer to another person, but that person would already need to have their own wallet set up (so chances of this happening are close to 0%), or purchasing something online.
What's worse is that I have an investment in Bitcoin, so if I were to use Bitcoin I'd look to add back to my initial investment, which at the moment requires me to make a bank transfer to an exchange (I don't have any local Bitcoin ATMs around me), and this takes time. Need to transfer to a personal wallet? Takes more time. I think you get the point.

Even if it was cheaper today, would it really make a difference to you? For me it wouldn't, I'd still use my credit card, because it's accepted pretty much everywhere, it's fast and reliable enough.
Until that changes or there is actually a true benefit to using Bitcoin (like promotions, mass adoption or having no other option) I'm just going to continue using fiat.
Edit: this doesn't mean it doesn't matter if it's cheaper. It does, but to me reliability, trustlessness and decentralization are more important matters.

@_date: 2017-07-26 08:55:02
But it's not used like other currencies are, so it can't really be compared to those either.
Bitcoin is traded mostly for its speculative value, in which case it is closer to commodities.
