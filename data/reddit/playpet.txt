What exchange is taking BCH deposits?

what is happening i am scared

If I had my coins on my breadwallet app at the time of the split, then emptied that wallet (yesterday), is the BCH still in breadwallet? I sold those coins off so I'm wondering if the BCH was sold along with them.

I sold at $3000, kill me slowly

later in that thread: "oh haha here's my address: xxx"

I went through a paradigm shift after a few months of investing into crypto. Stop caring what the dollar value is and start maximizing the amount of BTC held. The highs feel great, the dips are a chance to buy more, life's good.

Sold at 5k. Later bitcoin! See you again at the bottom :)

Yes it is, we still need to trade with underdeveloped nations and they are not going to take a currency that their nationals do not use.

OP probably values the car at $500, sets the cash price at 1k to make it seem like you're paying "half price" when using bitcoin, potentially making it more attractive. Or some tardo just pays 1k and then he buys bitcoin with it, win win.

Im trying to find a bit more background but I'm not coming up with much. These might be dumb questions. Why is bitcoin potentially going to fork? Who decided the Aug.1 deadline? How come there are possible outcomes (I.e. a third fork) that no one can really predict?

Why are these in the most random places? The one near me is at the back of a cupcake cafe, what the fuck 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:40:40
Very informative. Who set the Aug.1 deadline?

Holey shiet the amount of transactions 100-1000BTC are kind of staggering

r/bitcoin says bcc is garbage
r/btc says it's the second coming of Christ
too many narratives

Those that know it must die. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:22:09
Why is it so controversial? Sounds like a smart upgrade

It wasn't a bad decision to pull out at 2x. No one could have predicted the explosion these past few months.

Bitcoin concept and execution - super cool
The value of your assets getting erased - not that cool
