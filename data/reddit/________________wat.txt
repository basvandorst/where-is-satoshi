I hear you on that! Judging from my own experiences I can easily tell he is limiting himself dearly. It's also possible that his attorneys simply want him to hush up. At the end of the day no one really knows whats going on, so hopefully they question without judgement yet. I told this to a friend last year: if people want the truth - let the guy handle what he has to handle, otherwise they're going to troll and harass him until he kills himself and then no one will really know the truth. Sometimes its just a matter of laying back and having some patience. Cheers

I think he makes valid points in this post. I was in a similar position as he. The government will put you in a gag order, or your attorneys will beat you to death if you say anything that ruins your chances of coming out of this positively. Judging from his language and the way he presents things I'm keen to say he is in fact gagged, and is able to speak publicly albeit limited. I think there is a much bigger story here, and people need to stop with the trolling/fud/nonsense/rumours/lies/melodrama. You simply don't understand this situation unless you went through something similar. And I did. Sadly the media made up the most of sensationalist tales about me, even after prison and being gagged for many years. After being able to speak about the truth and what happened - no one seems to care/listen. Why? because they need a bad guy to point their fingers to. It's easier to brush off reason, when a story that was fed to you-and inhaled-seems to fit the narrative. Point being ladies and gents: ask questions before you judge the situation because its clear none of us are on the inside, and no one knows what really happened. Just a matter of waiting for the truth.  
  
  
My two cents.

So true. Bitcoins should not be sitting in someone elses wallet. That's like having people hold your wallet, and complain when money is missing. People need to take some personal responsibility. MtGox was not a bank, nor was it ensured by any insurance or legislation.

You may be giving him too much credit there. Perhaps he doesn't even know what happened. Judging by his schedule he was so busy with meetings and his personal life that MtGox could have been robbed blind by his interns or systems administrators and he would have no idea how that happened. Or perhaps he accidentally lost the private keys and has no wish to admit to his mistake. Human nature is a funny one. Once you experience a lot of mistakes in your life, you tend to understand how people react to these situations. With the employ of bots to fluff up the market, and subsequent Bitcoin price, he may have also missed the Bitcoins simply vanishing. So many possibilities.

You clearly don't understand the far reaching powers of U.S. government. If you were to rob enough Americans, you could be a Gypsy Sumo Wrestler from Indonesia, currently living in Iran with a Ethiopian wife and two Russian dogs: you will still face charges and possible extradition to the U.S.
