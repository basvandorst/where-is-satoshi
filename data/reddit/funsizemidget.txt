You got me.  I'm making it up.

LOL.  You'll find out.  NO job is safe.  Period.
Have you heard of the technological singularity?  
Head over to sometime and you'll start to get a feel for the pace in the coming months.

I'm an old man.  I'm almost done with work.  Perhaps you're right but I don't believe you are.  
It is my understanding that quantum computers should be very effective at non-linear calculations.  Correct me if I'm wrong on this.  The link I posted about getting quantum computers to work at room temperature in regular silicon is really cool and I would think would be a big deal.
Also, I don't think it's a bad thing that we won't have to work for a living.  Providing we learn to care for one another.  The age of plenty sounds good for me. 
Take care.
Edit:  I have only seen one credible rebuke to Kurzweil's timeline.  The man basically proved Kurzweil was pretty far off in his estimation of the power of the human brain.  I wish I could find the link.  I think you would like it.
Edit2:  Have to go.   There's an Andy Griffith show on that CBS is airing in color.  Take care.  Also, stop taking hope away from old men.  :)

I totally agree.  This is why we'll all be moving off core soon.

I'll take "things a man packing up his office in under 15 years says" for 1000 Alex.

Get back to us in 15-20 years when these are viewed as the technology of yesterday.  
That's not even considering getting quantum computers to operate at room temperature on everyday silicon.
