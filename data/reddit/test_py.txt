Yes, that really helps, thanks again.

I'll try that. What do you think about sending personal documents to other places that are "reliable"? That's another thing that puts me off a lot. For example the bitstamp or safello signup process.

Ok, but this "separate saving address", is it a paper wallet? desktop app? hardrive? or do you still keep your coins at online wallets?

But, just to understand your system, do you keep a bigger amount of BC in your wallet at all times? or do you just buy BC &gt; use BC and go back to having 0 BC?

Wow, thanks SirSpock, Now I'll just need to find out somehow how to get that tip. ;)

If that's the case, then bitcoin has currently got a big problem because I am a somewhat intelligent and techy person. I can't even begin to think about just technologically illiterate people out there.
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:15:15
But how am I supposed to know if it's legit or not? *that* is my problem, in general.

I am sorry, I have a very newby/ignorant question: does having my bitcoins in my (for example) coinbase wallet constitute "keeping" in regards to your comment?
Also, is there any possibility for coinbase to crack like Gox?

Irony isn't going to help anybody out.

I was considering using kraken but (to be honest) I didn't trust a site who's motto is "Release the Kraken", pretty superficial decision- I know, but it money we're talking about here.
In anycase, I've given it a second thought after reading your comment and I will try them out tomorrow and I'l ltake into consideration everything you've said. It's a good idea to start out buying 15-20 euros. I thought about buying 1BC but you're right that I should start with less and in a few days I'll move forward to my goal.
Unfortunately, I'm in Toulouse, so I can't take up on your offer to get together and talk about bitcoin, but I would have loved to!

Wow, now I see what they mean when they say the r/bitcoin community isn't nice.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:51:45
I have just made an account and verified it in less than a couple of hours, for those wondering. 
And thanks for recommending them.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:12:31
wow. Would you say this is a good idea for someone starting out? or should I stick to online wallets for the time being. I have around 1BTC which is quite a lot for me at this moment, but I won't die of starvation is I lose it.
