Ah, so you're pro Bitcoin (and a climate change denier).
This pairing is a troll. We can have both. We can use Bitcoin and generate solar but the op is trolling and setting up the idea that in order to be pro Bitcoin, one must be "willing to accept that climate change is inevitable" and a waste to attempt to prevent.
Perfect troll.

I think of it this way:
Bitcoin brings the benefits of blockchain to the personal banking ledger. I.e. how much "money" some person has.
Ethereum brings the benefits of blockchain to businesses structures i.e. fundraising, processes, protocols, contracts, and events.
So in the similar way that a bank, teller, ACH transfer, branch office, etc all get replaced (without losing trust) by Bitcoin. So too will many business processes/contracts/lawyers/administrators/etc be superfluous with ethereum smart contracts.

Benefits. Phones bring obvious benefits.
Crypto "just acting like money" brings little benefit compared to the hoops and risk.
We need smart contracts that reduce the cost of starting a business by a huge factor. Or new game mechanics that make covering your game items into money easier. Something with a benefit.
