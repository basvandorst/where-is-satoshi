If I see gallowboob irl you can bet your ass i’m stealing his phone and deleting everything.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:55:32
I definitely asked first.
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:41:20
The replies to this are golden. 
The cold hard fact is that bitcoin is seen as a get-rich-quick scheme, and nothing more. If cryptocurrencies weren't profitable, everyone here running their mouth would dip out and sell faster than you can say "HODL".
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:06:30
But which one of us asked first though :thinking
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:05:42
Oh I don’t really care about what you do in your spare time. No clue why you wanted to share that information with me. Are you lonely by any chance?. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:48:53
Do you not understand the idea of a depreciating asset?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:38:52
You didn’t answer my question 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:40:15
You already replied to this comment.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:59:55
Who says i’m not jerking off or smoking a joint at this very moment?, why would it matter if I was? You seem to be very interested in my activities. Very strange of you.
You mean to tell me you’ve never watched porn before?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:41:25
I think “who doesn’t like video games and porn” is quite clear. Would you like me to simplify the question so you can understand it?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:09:40
There are definitely good reasons why no one wants to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:36:08
Why would you use bitcoin to buy something instead of hodling onto your capital?. A pizza bought for $20 would end up costing $40.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:45:56
Who cares. Crypto can never take itself seriously.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:04:23
Do you enjoy talking out of your ass?
Bitcoin is nothing more than a money machine for those who invest in it. It has the flaw of being a store of value, because no one will want to buy it when the price doesn’t go anywhere.
That’ll be the day bitcoin dies. When the price is locked and everyone withdraws. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:53:40
A lack of impossibility does not negate a high likelihood of something happening.
Basic statistics. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:38:32
Lol you’re implying anyone who invests gives a shit beyond getting rick quick
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:50:34
I asked first
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:52:21
Tough shit, Learn to read.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:12:45
If you had 1 million in bitcoin, and you took out 10% to buy a tesla, you’ve effectively just thrown that money away as your 10% is now worth $200k
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:39:51
So why bother spending it before the value maximises?. Play the long game.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:07:38
Fuck it lol. You go ahead and live in your fantasy land and waste your investment like an idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:22:05
No, it would still be $20
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:31:00
I wanted to throw in £100 last year. Now i have money available i wanna throw in more. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:09:02
Ew incel germs. Gotta dash.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:26:51

And no one would give a shit so long as they didn’t lose money
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:54:23
This is coming from the guy who tried to insult someone for liking video games and pornography. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:46:36
Bitcoin doesn’t get used in transactions. I have no idea why anyone thinks it’s a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:27:00
No money until today
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:32:01
Who doesn’t like video games and porn?
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:00:53
G8 response m8 i r8 8/8 I definitely didn’t just prove you wrong lol.
Get rekt.

OMG HOW DO I BUY


LOL FUCK THIS SHIT CURRENCY
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:33:01
He can’t counter my argument so he’s trying to find something to attack me with.
Funny really.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:00:20

Are you kidding?, I love a flash sale!
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:46:41
Yet that’s the only reason people buy them
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:46:43
Bitcoin isn’t a currency to most. They see it as a money tree.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:07
Hi can I work for you?, Would be nice to have a boss that isn’t a complete dumbass.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:07:07
“Used in transactions” 
People use bitcoin to buy stuff?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:30:00
Bitcoin is popular because everyone sees it as something to make money out of. No one is interested in actually using it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:28:56
No one is interested in using bitcoin as a currency. They sell for a reason.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:46:19
Sigh this is boring 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:29:09
Smart people
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:29:21
You’re saying this like people don’t treat bitcoin as an easy cash grab.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:26
There’s the problem, no one sees bitcoin as a currency, it’s seen as something you throw money at, then takes out a magic wand and doubles it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:02:01
You like high fees and buying items that rapidly depreciate in value?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:44:44
We don’t have the income to buy large amounts!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:25:26
Never used bitcoin in my life.
Why do they have fees?. Is that even legal?. Is bitcoin really just a cash cow for everyone?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:37
OH NO THIS IS SO BAD 
^^^For ^^^my ^^^wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:03:37
They can’t afford to be dumb and cautious, anyone making any serious money with this has risked a fucking lot.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:04:08
Lol you’re not worried because you know it’ll bounce back. Stfu.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:20:43
Not really much explaining in your comment, but hey, if you’re not willing to decede and admit that you were trying to sound smart I’m happy to watch you try to dig yourself out of this one.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:50:24
Not really interested in your neckbeard latin lessons
@_date: 2018-05-20 02:35:33
I need to ask more questions.
1) What’s the longest wallet address limit?
2) Can you create your own custom address?
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:45:19
I have no idea what any of this means
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:45:22
No u

Missing z=5

Are we trying to guess a password, and this guy is giving us hints?
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:09:48
Stop using the word “basically” like you can explain it better
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:00:23
People in this sub giving a fuck about using crypto as an actual currency?
Everyone here is in it to get their wallet heavier. The second bitcoin stops giving them profit, no one will give a fuck about it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:45:36
Hahahahaha 
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:42:14
Lol bye
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:20:58
Sshhhh, it’s ok my child, you can cry later, to someone who gives a shit about what comes out of your mouth.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:53:59
Dear god give it a rest dude
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:04:37
It’s a “lets get confidence into crypto so we can boost the price up higher”

DIDN’T YOU SEE THE NEWS?, 30% DROP THE BUBBLE HAS BURST, EVERYONE IS LOSING $10K EVERY MINUTE.

Let me know when it reaches £14k again
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:20:30
Don’t act so smug, Bitcoin has disadvantages too.
It’s a huge system. At some point something will glitch out.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:04:27
I can get behind that 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:47:26
LOL no it isn’t 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:04:03
Is that the method where you do it yourself ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:20:14
No no no. Not a few years ago, I’m talking about now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:12
Sounds like a bubble waiting to burst.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:19:20
You can drop the act, we all know OP is a pussy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:56:37
So how would I be able to start?, I can’t exactly say 1 DEC = $0.00 USD. You’d have some cunt buying an infinite amount.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:17:32
I don’t mean any disrespect on your part. I just don’t trust anything on the internet. This is the same place where adult males pretend to be teenage girls and certain communities live in a giant circle jerk bubble and ignore anything that doesn’t fit their narrative. Just a pit of lies and exaggerated truths you know?
I have no doubt you make a good salary, I too want to be in the informatics sector when I graduate, Perhaps one day I’ll be earning six figures too. 
When it comes to bitcoin, I see it as a gimmick, The currency has value the more users buy into it. Makes sense to entice users into buying coins by making it out like they’re gonna be millionaires by the end of the year. 
There are risks and negatives to using bitcoin, and until I understand them, I don’t think it’s smart to jump in just because I like more money. That’s exactly how people get ripped off in scams. (Not calling bitcoin a scam).
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:46:37
RIP OP’s 30 Grand
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:56:09
Reading this makes me sad for not having a disposable income.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:41:16
Bitcoin is built on exaggerating their brand to make people buy their currency.
Of course they are gonna pretend to be bitcoin millionaires.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:02:59
Even if I put in $200 , I’d have $2,000 by 100K
It sucks because as a student I don’t have the income to invest in this.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:49:58
You could at least eat the testicle of an animal. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:50:14
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:46:32
A week?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:33:57
Because I asked about investing in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:11:48
I know because he’s dumb enough to post it online. Which either makes him retarded because I could get his location from his post history, or a dirty liar.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:24:01
What’s 4K 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:03:38
I know right. OP should at least eat an animals testicle.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:09:17
What happens if bitcoin collapses tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:25:37
Redditors should be extremely aware that anyone can find their identity quite easily given the task.
It’s against the site wide rules for a reason. Anyone can find out where you live and what you look like.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:04:47
I bet you’re gonna be chuffed if bitcoin crashes tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:25:21
Yeah fuck that, Might as well track down the guy and offer to buy his bitcoin for $15,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:08:41
This is my research, I’m asking questions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:15
He’s not gonna eat a testicle, it’ll be a troll
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:56:15
I think that the people who have bitcoins don’t make a whole lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:34:57
No one is mad, they’re too busy with their elitist mindset denying that a drop is a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:26:36
I read the comment back and realised it meant 4K USD
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:18:42
If I bought 1 bitcoin today, I would not become a millionaire by any stretch within my lifetime.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:30:12
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:43:58
Elon is a genius, he knows better than to accept internet money for his cars.
If he did, the first thing he would be doing is exchanging it back to USD.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:03:32
I wouldn’t know how to fuck it up
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:54:43
Looking at the chart, Would it be correct if I said the price is probably gonna be higher in 2 years?. The only thing I see disproving that statement is an entire collapse of the market.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:49:21
Elaborate on point 1
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:46:04
You just said I can’t do that
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:15:24
150 Bitcoin?, And you left him in the store?, and then told Reddit about it?.
You idiot, you realise that if he’s dumb enough to leave $1,500,000 unattended , Someone with any knowledge of his fortune is gonna be sending him scam emails asking him to transfer that shit over. 
Get back to him tomorrow and show him how to sell. Idk, sell 1 or 2 so he can pay off his car. Then show him why he should leave the other 148 until the market peaks.
That’s if the story is true of course, which I doubt. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:12:29
Nice. I think you’re lying tho.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:18:44
How much is your pay check?. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:10:19
Probably when bitcoin gets inflated to $20,000
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:53:00
I see. I need to invest heavily in the currency to get a substantial profit. 
I don’t have a spare couple of grand lying around though :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:26:23
Not everyone has the money floating around to be investing in coins. Bitcoin went from 9k to 11k in 36 hours, Even if someone invested $900 from their savings, That’s a $200 reward. You really wanna tell someone to risk $900 to get a 25% profit?
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:30:20
Might as well throw a shot in the dark and ask if you’ll help me earn back my losses.
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:35:29
Hahahahaha. Yeah, if you wanna lose money.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:20:23
If I ever wanted to sell, i'd dump the high price bitcoin first.
I get what you mean tho.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:35:58
Just last week, guys on this sub laughed at my £200 loss. Had I kept holding, that value wouldn’t be the same. 
If anything i can re-invest later. But I won’t.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:46:19
Yeah it’s not happening. Sorry buddo
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:35:45
I wanted to hold longer. I couldn’t.
I wanted bitcoin to at least grow a small amount. I wasn’t expecting huge money.
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:14:41
I get you. The idea is the more work you put in, the more rewards you get. So long as you are willing to learn. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:18:31
I can’t afford to re-invest
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:34:09
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:34:34
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:18:30
There are only so many times a coin can crash before the people stop investing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:58:51
I expected the coin to grow. The rate doesn’t bother me, but if it’s gonna drop, i might as well withdraw at my investment and buy at a lower price.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:34:08
Hahaha too late I sold the second it went back under £6,000.
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:43:16
I was told to do that a bunch. Invest £100 a week instead of £400 a month.
I should have done that. Maybe when I can afford to again, I will.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:37:58
I don’t have disposable income :(
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:55:12
I saw signs of growth. The coin went up ~30%, then lingered too close to my investment to be worth holding.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:15:10
You think crypto is random?, like in 5 hours it can dip straight to 0?
No dude. When a trend starts, it sticks, until a downwards direction hits and there’s a crash. You will get a good pre warning before that.
The saying is simple. The early bird gets the work, the second mouse gets the cheese.
Be the second mouse.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:22:38
Ahahahahaha no one buys for that.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:16:10
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:44:31
By ignoring them
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:37:19
That was my plan. My financial situation changed and I can’t afford to have my money as bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:28:46
I would love advice on this topic. Truly. 
I can’t seem to do anything right at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:59:38
I edited my comment.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:50:46

Don’t be silly, everyone here is in it for the money.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:52:19
5x ? Meh, That’s being greedy. 
I’ll stick past the double, but if the price dips below triple enough i’m selling. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:25:42
Wouldn’t really be interested in scams, i’m smarter than that. Sorry to disappoint.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:43:20
I knew if
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:56:25
Not exactly. My plan was always to withdraw before the coin went below my investment.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:58:43
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:00:19
hmu when there is one
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:43:27
Can’t wait for absolutely nothing to happen!
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:30:58
Not dumb enough to gamble with someone elses money
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:07:01
Why would i invest if i’m going to lose money
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:16:14
You bought before a boom? Lol that’s luck
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:34:15
That’s fantastic. Do you mind if i ask questions?
1) What’s your net worth?.
2) What was your job before you retired?.
3) What mistakes have you made?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:46:52
Actually I lost money because of the fees. Fuck the fees man.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:28:28
Am I allowed to pay someone to invest for me?
I.e. when they invest, they shoot me a DM and I stick in an amount.
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:17:22
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:55:57
I’m serious 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:39:39
Feels like the kind of shit that’ll keep my money hostage.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:29:39
I wasn’t panic selling. I wanted to stay on. I couldn’t.
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:50:48
I’ll remind you that I didn’t have a choice, i wanted to hold.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:48:35
Modddddsssss play nice
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:20:47
My plan is to not get greedy. I wanna buy low, and sell when my investment is doubled.
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:08:33
You’ll be glad to hear I loudly cringed at the 7 figure loss from a divorce. 
I’m 21 and I really don’t want to mess up my life. It has only just started. To have $2 - $10 million at 41 is a dream. Even if the amount is considered small. I just wanna know how so many people are becoming successful. I want to learn and work hard. I don’t know where to look since websites LOVE selling get rich quick schemes to naive young kids.
Your information has taught me a few things. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:59:24
5 weeks
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:53:11
Bitcoin is at a lower price than it was 2 months ago.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:54:50
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:57:54
I was patient. I sat on the bitcoin for months hoping for change. Nothing happened. I’m sure there might be a sudden growth soon, but I can’t rely on luck.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:59:01
Which one do you use?
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:00:36
When I invested, the market had risen. It didn’t continue. I’m pissed at myself more than anything.

It’s not
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:16:29
Oh I expected dips, just after the value rose a good few figures.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:59:29
It’s been stagnant for the past couple of hours. I can’t be fucked to watch the price any more.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:41:28
*welcome to failing get rich quick scheme
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:04:54
Fucking hell bitcoin is racking up value fast. As a new buyer I stuck £100 on. seeing the price rise so drastically, it's now £300 invested, with more ready to come on top.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:11:15
what does it mean for me
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:02:30
Being responsible is investing money and not coming out with a total loss. 
Since I invested the price has stayed the exact same. I could put all the money back in right now and be at no disadvantage 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:43:11
I’m glad you’re doing well.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:54:57
Coinbase does, i just signed up
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:59:30
Hahahaha this comment is cute
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:49:51
No doubt the coin is gonna follow the trend of the last few days, at least until the week is done.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:36:47
Dropped by £700 today. Yeah fuck that.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:52:10
It’s almost like completely different people making those comments.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:19:11
I’ll reiterate.
I don’t want someone to buy for me, I want someone to tell me when to buy/sell.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:02:41
I can when the crash happens AFTER those 8 years.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:40:04
what are those
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:56
That doesn't help but I did stick £500 down 4 hours ago
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:17:23
Name an exchange that is reputable.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:25:51
Bitcoin has had only 1 major crash. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:16:32
20% fees tho. Fuck noooo
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:39:50
The money flows in because everyone sees the value go up and they get $ signs in their eyes.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:31:12
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:10:59
So you can watch as your money goes closer to 0?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:33:53
It can absolutely go to 0. If not go so small no one wants to buy
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:07:40
Not ones on the scale of last month.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:17:04
Still lost potential 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:22:58
Because you’re upselling something that got fucked lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:36:50
I didn’t expect it to be a loss, I just prepared for it to dip.
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:53:09
OK reddit, I wanna invest £1k into bitcoin. What advice can you give me right now?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:49:44
If bitcoin goes under £6,000 i’m selling. Surely if it can dip -£2,000 , there’s no hope.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:45:51
I’ve been lurking on this sub long enough.
Bitcoin does hold a pattern, though i’m not willing to risk money trying to prove it right while the current trend is showing depreciation.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:00:46
And does nothing else
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:50:55
Your mouth was sealed tight when it dipped yesterday huh
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:22:50
Right?, if no one talks about him , he dies. 
If everyone on the internet starts talking shit. SOMEONE is gonna check his website and buy something.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:28:59
Yes, the coins go up and down but long term there is growth.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:06:54
UK here. It's £6,000 on the dot. 
It's super infuriating. The price isn't moving anywhere. Pretty sure it's gonna peak and go straight back down to £4,000.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:34:04
It’s not false information. I’m looking at a trend and stretching it out for a week.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:44:46
I sold at £5,600 a week ago.
Fuck sake. ��
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:01:21
Now that the bitcoin price is back on the rise, how do I buy?
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:30:03
The real cringe here is that you bought 5 jags. 
I don’t care how much you’ve made. If you’re gonna make it out like you give a fuck about the currency outside of getting rich at least make it believable .
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:14:37
What’s funny to me is when everyone screams HODL for the long run.
Yeah buddy, this is the long run, bitcoin heading back to 0.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:15:07
Can i have some litecoin too i lost my savings in the crash
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:50:21
I read your website in full, now I understand. I need to stop buying luxuries I can’t afford. 
I want to know where I can dedicate my time and working hours to make a better life for myself. 
Programming is something I can look at, Though I also need an immediate resource for improvement. I don’t wanna spend 30 hours a week stacking shelves. That’s not something that will get me $10 million by 41.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:31:57
I’m more concerned about what happens when there’s a crash. OP would have to go to his boss and request cash.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:17:06
I love how the bitcoin experts from twitter abd reddit have shut up. Yeah these frequent major dips aren’t a good selling point huh?
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:39:25
So if the coin goes straight to 0, you’re fucked.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:00:51
I think it is
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:00:37
i'm buying with £5k
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:38:08
0.0806. Go ahead
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:53:32
No idea what you’re talking about sorry
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:03:21
Well, you can if ever sells
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:10:51
Ahahahahaha 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:44:38
I’m holding until my bitcoin goes past £750. Then i’m selling.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:29:17
Well, 5 weeks for the investment I had money on.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:35:37


Welp, i’m out. Enjoy your time in stupid town.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:39:32
I put more money on
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:37:59
How much money have you made?
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:02:09
But you lost so much money
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:21:14
When do i invest?
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:06:28
The finger in your case is what makes the money
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:59:46
(The currency is in pounds)
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:58:22
Oh, why?
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:35:47
I believe my local bitcoin ATM is 20% fees.
That’s absurd, especially given the shit coinbase gets for having 4% fees.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:35:52
I’m surprised that comment isn’t edited
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:36:19
I’m not up 400, i invested 500. I expected the growth to be the same as the day before. It wasn’t.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:59:40
There’s a reason why they bought mercs audis and bmws..... 
You’re 18 right?. Hmu in PMs
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:06:59
Donate £200 to me and you got a deal
I’ll donate 10% of my profits each month.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:18:28
Plot twist: the “friend” is you
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:17:40
They can donate some btc then
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:15:42
100 at first, then I invested another 400, making 500 total
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:47:27
Or (Crazy idea here) you can use DOLLARS. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:33:14
Hold on.
You realise if you bought coins at a higher price, and the coin loses value, you lose money?
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:32:07
Is a 200 loss is nothing, by all means help me out.
And I know shitcoins are shit , They have some benefits though.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:46:34
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:40:49
For being responsible with money? Ok.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:08:08
You guys certainly didn’t, That’s why you invested
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:14:25
All cryptos crashed lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:22:47
Ok i’m not that stupid
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:57:16
Long hodl?, bet you were shitting yourself a week ago
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:17:19
Uh, look at a graph?
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:43:37
I've got an alert for when BTC goes over £6k, when it does i'm buying.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:31:32
I invested &lt; 24 hours ago
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:52:05
Oh god, there’s one close by. Fees?
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:29:29
Day trading ?, guess that’s smart huh
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:11:06
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:46:15
You can drop the act. I ain’t buying it. Good luck trying to fool other people. Cya.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:19:29


@_date: 2018-02-14 14:20:41
Yes, because the crash didn’t happen a year ago
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:07:36
You didn’t respond to that comment at all
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:08:37
No thanks. The tech isn’t getting people rich
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:23:17
This place is full elitist mode when coins are booming.
Now they’re getting down, These guy’s lips are sealed shut.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:58:25
So say I buy at BTC: 8k, Would the btc I buy come up as 8k or the new value btc has in 5 days time?
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:59:48
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:00:07
That’s how I’m determining a purchase. If bitcoin rises a significant amount and reaches traction it’ll boom.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:51:54
It’s not on the app store
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:52:10
Buy the office a bubble machine
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:52:36
I was thinking naive bastards who believe his bullshit
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:22:15
Hahahahaha bitcoin is a terrible currency compared to the dollar or pound
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:55:05
Gdax doesn’t have a mobile app
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:56:15
The first day is the worst, I couldn’t stop checking my phone.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:37:05
The only thing they care about
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:46:56
If people hear that he is a scam artist, they’re still hearing about him. There will be a guy who wants to buy bitcoin and decide to “test” why he is hated.
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:06:07
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:19:46
Holy fuck that
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:22:47
It wouldn’t matter (so long as the coin doesn’t crash). My game is to hodl on for dear life until I double my investment, then i’m selling.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:37:03
That app looks tacky
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:04:01
what if i wanna sell on my phone
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:02:45
Yes, everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:42:09
On a real though why the flying fuck did you buy 5 jags.
Own up, which one of your friends told you they were collectible 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:57:10
No, these days people pull out if the coin is dangerously close to their investment 
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:19:16
The end of a dip is when the price rises a little, then rises more instead of falling.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:35:03
My investment amounted to 0.0806 BTC, i’ll keep check of what the value turns into. I doubt i’ll put money back in.
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:22:56
If you’re so rich how about you give me some money
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:53:40
That’s what everyone wants
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:57:03
How long
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:01:49
I know how markets work.
I have a new game plan.
1) Find an exchange without fees.
2) Invest
3) pull out when the value slumps close to my investment 
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:18:07
Coinbase are slowly fucking me over. I almost wanna make my own coin, buy 50,000 of them and let the market do the work for me.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:36:14
Doesn’t matter, it’s not hitting $1 million
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:31:40
What’s up with the low effort replies jesus
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:40:29
If he can afford to spend $6k on bitcoin, it’s no different to you and I blowing $50
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:26:51
No, i’m not noob. I don’t own bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:16:27
Someone bought a load
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:28:23
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:15:29
Lol after what?, 1-2 months of stagnation, only today is there a rise.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:19:04
You’re not the guy i replied to
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:21:03
What you don’t understand is that this is how bitcoin works. It grows as people give it praise and jerk off over it. They want the coin to be seen as profitable so more consumers will buy. 
If they start shitting on crypto, the whole system dies.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:31:39
I feel like I should ask them for money
Edit: He replied instantly 12 minutes ago, Now i got nothing. :(
