The r/bitcoin equivalent of being rickrolled
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:16:38
Do you mean payment processing companies, or ways of acquiring bitcoin?  Banking relationships seem to be a major roadblock for most btc companies in UK (hence why Coinbase themselves are not working with GBP afaik).  Most people use digital banking and peer to peer marketplace sites for getting hold of btc.  Cryptopay is the closest comparison I can think of

I think your videos are excellent man, I hope you manage to find a way of getting Cointalk up and running again.  I particularly like the idea you suggest to have different meetups from around the world check in regularly.  Good luck.

I'm a supporter of these guys' campaign generally speaking, but I just can't understand their hostility to Bitcoin's technological solution to many of the problems they're trying to solve.  Legitimate initial skepticism is fine, but with this they seem so out of touch and unwilling to engage with evidence.  It's a bit depressing.  If this is their official position, then it's annoying that it's not evidence-based.  They are a political lobbying organisation and I can't help wonder if they're scared because there is such vocal enthusiasm from the libertarian community etc... who knows.  Anyone want to buy a copy of their book off me for bitcoin?!

Is that you, Karpeles?
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:17:21
Yes, possibly.  But seriously, you're comparing apples with a new genetically engineered hybrid fruit containing DNA from many types.  Compare the distribution of bitcoin with the distribution of shares in a nascent startup company, or the distribution of holdings of any commodity. I don't understand how you could possibly argue that money and power resides with the people in the fiat system?!  Oligarchy is a logical consequence of how fiat currencies are issued, the opposite is true for bitcoin.

I approve of your r/cringe level idealism-- keep it up
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:03:12
1 satoshi will equal 1 cent if/when (delete as appropriate) 1 btc equals 1 million units fiat.  I like to imagine this was a deliberate design feature of the code.  There's nothing stopping anyone choosing whatever frame of reference they feel comfortable with for the units.  Across the world, there's a wide range in how people's fiat currencies are denominated, so what makes sense for one demographic might not be so intuitive elsewhere.

Superb work Canton.  I've been using your previous implementation to make paper wallets for a while but these are even better!  Thank you: these are all fantastic improvements to an already very useful package.

I kind of like the idea behind what you're suggesting, using the blockchain here like a searchable, massively redundant backup for the encrypted key.  But you've got to admit, this is a massively Byzantine procedure with many possibilities of fucking up!  
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:04:20
Could it be them completing the transition to Blockchain.com and Blockchain.info as different sites for wallet software vs analytics?

@_date: 2014-04-14 16:17:02
Seriously?  Surely you ought to be ostracizing the bad actor(s) in all this, not tangentially-associated experts who have shown willing to offer technical advice.  I bet Andreas himself would despise the idea that anyone made an investment based on 'trustworthiness' having been ascribed to his name alone...
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:30:51
Dunno about this one- is it not more to do with the argument that debt-based money is zero sum as the money issued as debt is destroyed when repaid? An issuance mechanism independent of the debt component then being "positive money" ...
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:38:33
Great job there Ethan. Given such a short space of time, almost as important as what you said, was your demeanour throughout-- you came across as very approachable.  All helps break the ice.

Epic.  This man started the Edinburgh bitcoin meetup and organised the Scottish Bitcoin Conference.  Sound bloke, cool to see this so far up reddit randomly! 
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:24:02
Yeah, I agree-- ant colonies are an often-cited example when describing emergent properties.  I'm pretty sure I've heard Andreas use it himself.  Can't wait for his book to be released.

It's actually only the initial step of starting the 2 year process of negotiations - "invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty"  - that has been announced as starting on 29th March. This doesn't in and of itself add massively to the existing uncertainty around Brexit within U.K. In any case GBP is a small fraction of BTC trading volume and all the other craziness within BTC will presumably override such concerns...
