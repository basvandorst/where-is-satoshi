To the people who believe Bitcoin has utility, it is absolutely an investment. Believe it or not, there's a large market of people out there who see value in a decentralized currency that is rooted in math and science rather than government and politics. Globalization is taking hold faster than people realize and there's value in a digital, borderless currency whether you see it or not. You don't have to invest and be a part in that, but then why are you here in the first place?

So you give an extreme and unlikely scenario (by your own admission) where the market cap is VERY TEMPORARILY pumped using $172 million and that somehow makes Bitcoin as easy to manipulate as penny stocks??? Are you kidding me??? Bitcoin still has a low market cap compared to high end stocks (see Apple at ~$900 billion), and that's why the market is as volatile as it is. But let's not pretend that it's anywhere in the realm of penny stocks.

I think it might be an expression
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:46:17
Everything is relative. I said it's "not that easy" in comparison to the OP's claim that it was similar to penny stocks. Penny stocks don't have a $250 billion market cap which is why that's worth mentioning. I already mentioned that it's still much easier to manipulate than high end stocks, which is why the market is volatile. If you can't handle a volatile market, don't invest in cryptos. It's that simple.

If that potential doesn't pan out, then maybe it crashes. And maybe it recovers and maybe it doesn't. This isn't a sure thing, it's an investment. But don't pretend like you alone gets to decide the value of Bitcoin. It's up to the market to decide. Clearly you're bearish right now, so sell everything you've got and ride into the sunset. If you've really been in this game since 2013, then you should have made enough profit to retire on an island somewhere. Unless... your valuation of Bitcoin was already wrong once before?

Nobody knows for sure. My guess is that most of the people who were going to jump ship already have. The market seems to have stabilized around 13-14k, which is probably a healthy correction from where we were at. If you look, volume is way down right now. Only about 25k Bitcoins have been transacted on GDAX in the last 24 hours. So I think there's a good chance that people are just waiting to see what happens and buying will continue after the holidays. I don't know if that means after Christmas or after New Year's, but I would be surprised if the price didn't start trending upwards again soon.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:39:50
I don't think that's the reason. Just a couple of days ago when the price was dropping rapidly the volume on GDAX was over 100k Bitcoins per day. The market has settled down for the holidays. People aren't trading cryptocurrencies on Christmas Eve.

It's okay, millions of people before you have said the same types of things for every paradigm shift throughout history.
Cars, what's wrong with my horse? Computers, who needs em'? The internet, that's a fad! Email, why would I use that?
Just because it's volatile and new doesn't at all detract from it's potential for widespread adoption and success. Personally, I think there's a lot more to gain than there is to lose by investing at such an early stage. But keep on spreading your salt.

Right now Bitcoin is an investment. It's not ready to be adopted as a useful currency - most people aren't arguing that. But, it's a revolutionary concept and technological advances (e.g. Segwit, Lightning Network) are being implemented that could make it a viable currency someday. Hence, currency of the future. If the price is this high based on speculation alone, imagine what it will be when the network is technologically advanced enough to back the price based on utility. Or, it could all crash and go to 0. Point is, that's the reason for investing and holding coins now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:00:32
Except by the time the market plateaus out, the low price opportunity is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:51:03
Yep. I've officially invested as much as I can afford to lose, and I've made up my mind. I'm either hodling until I reach my moon, or I'm hodling until it goes to 0. There is no in-between.

I think the worst is over. Nobody knows for sure, of course. But the price seems to have stabilized, and most of the weak hands have already sold. Once investors regain faith in the market, the price should start going up again. And I think it will go up fast. After a major correction like that, the "bubble" talk and FUD should be on hold for a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:08:21
That depends, do you think the price of Bitcoin right now is the highest it will ever be again? Because if not, there's your incentive to buy now.

All of the exchanges have different verification requirements, partially dependent on the country they're located in. I would suggest trying another one. Binance was pretty easy for me to get verified with.

You're solving cryptographical hashing problems. The specific algorithm is SHA-256. It's a simple problem that can be solved using a pencil and piece of paper, but it requires a powerful CPU running millions of computations per second to find the right solution. The value here is that it can't be falsified. The only way to find the solution is trial and error, and that means nobody can counterfeit Bitcoins like someone can counterfeit the US Dollar. The bonus is that it's easy for someone else to check that the solution is correct. Hard to solve, easy to verify. That's called Proof-of-Work (PoW). When the solution is found, the block of transactions is propagated to the network and the miner who discovered the solution is rewarded in Bitcoins.
Bitcoins are backed by their utility. Nobody would pay money for Bitcoins if they didn't add some purpose to society. So what's the purpose? It's a decentralized, borderless, digital currency backed by math and science rather than government and politics. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve doesn't control it. The POTUS doesn't control it. Nobody does. It belongs to the world. It's yours to own and store and do what you want with. Because people find value in that concept, people find value in the currency. Also, it's deflationary (only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be minted, and they can be lost forever), meaning it's reasonable to expect the value to rise over time. So it makes sense to hold onto them for now, and eventually spend and use them as real currency when that becomes a viable option. That won't happen until after Segwit and Lightning Network are adopted though. For now, Bitcoin is mainly a speculative investment.

Governments are afraid of cryptocurrency, and rightfully so. It doesn't surprise me that they're trying to dissuade people from investing. This has obviously spread to the media as well.

Well, first of all hardware is becoming more efficient by the day. As processing power per kilowatt hour increases, energy consumption is going to decrease. Secondly, Bitcoin itself is becoming more energy efficient. Segwit and Lightning Network will move micropayments off the blockchain, thereby decreasing energy consumption by the network.
And finally, you need to look at the other end of the problem. Energy is always going to be necessary as a means to power society. The question is, where is this energy coming from? If the energy source is renewable such as wind and solar power, then the amount of energy consumed is much less important.
Also, let's not forget that the central banking system and VISA are not exactly operating on surplus energy.
Hope that helps clear things up. I'm sure there are other things I forgot to mention, but those are all important and worth considering.

You're right. And I have a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies that covers many different types of coins. But if you believe in the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain, you would be silly not to have at least a small hand in Bitcoin, the one that started it all.

Bitcoin has a market cap of $250 billion. It's not that easy to manipulate, even for banks and rich investors. Absolutely nothing like penny stocks.

Sometimes people invest in potential. Bitcoin's value rests in its potential more so than its current viability as a currency. The value is based on the following it has, including brand recognition as well as the development and user communities. It's also based on the utility provided by a borderless, decentralized digital currency that isn't directly linked to any specific country or government. These things have VALUE. Do you know how much Snapchat was worth before it even began to monetize? Before it made a single cent of profit, it was rejecting buyout offers for BILLIONS of dollars. Don't underestimate value just because it's speculative.

First of all, Bitcoin isn't really anonymous. It's pseudoanonymous. You can trace any transaction back to the public address. And, if you know who owns the public address, it's obviously not anonymous at all. As you've just said, your public address is well-documented information by the exchanges you use and easily linked back to your personal identity.
The anonymity associated with Bitcoin comes from using private wallets with unknown public addresses to send funds. Even then, the source and destination addresses are all public information. Finding out where the funds originated and where they're going is just a matter of connecting a few dots and determining who owns them.
To add anonymity features to Bitcoin, there are services such as Coinjoin. Coinjoin uses a mixing algorithm to mask the sender and receiver of an individual transaction by combining it with other transactions. It's very difficult if not impossible to determine the identities of the sender/receiver if this is done correctly. So, Bitcoin can either be as public as sending funds through a wire transfer or potentially as private as handing cash to someone in a back alley. It all depends on how you use it.
