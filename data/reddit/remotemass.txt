When it reaches parity with gold (that has a market cap of 210,000,000 kg * $4000 USD = $ 840,000,000,000 USD)
1 BTC will be equivalent to 10 Kg of gold. By today price of gold 1BTC=$400,000 USD. I guess parity will be reached in less than 10 years from now (when bitcoin makes 18 years old).

I don't think so. I am indeed clarifying that they are different things. I also talk about 'private key', but when I wrote 'public key' and 'bitcoin address' what I am saying is correct: they are not exactly the same thing.

If two people send coins to the same bitcoin address of your wallet you get both coins in your wallet. The wallet keeps the private key of each bitcoin address and allows you to spend each coins sent to each address.

Dear willowandoak,
There is no such thing as bitcoins. Bitcoins are only balances associated with a bitcoin address. Every bitcoin address has a private key. It is the private key that is kept. Usually private keys are kept in a file called "wallet.dat". So the first thing you have to check is if there is a Bitcoin-Qt client installed on your computer. You do this by by clicking the start menu and typing "Bitcoin". If an orange bitcoin logo shows on the start menu saying Bitcoin you have it installed and you probably have a "wallet.dat" file. It is usually located at C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\BitCoin (Vista and 7).
Private keys are just numbers of 256 bits, that is, 256 zeros and ones. They are usually expressed with alphanumeric characters so they may seem strings, but if they were expressed in decimal or binary you would clearly see that they are numbers indeed.
Every private key has a corresponding public key that can be calculated mathematically and that you can find out - with the help of a computer - in fractions of second. But the reverse, that is, to find the corresponding private key of a bitcoin address is not known to be possible, unless you tried to do it by trial and error till you find it, which would probably take you millions, if not billions of years, even if you used all the computer resources of the Solar System. That is a very subtle, but very important, detail. 
So you can tell others your bitcoin address - that is usually called the public key - without anyone getting to know its corresponding private key. But if you tell the private key, everyone will be able to know its corresponding public key.
Please watch my youtube video production searching for the video: "United Colors of Bitcoin".
Please excuse us a bit. Sometimes we are a bit silly. This community is full of geeks that tend to be very much like what you would expect from a joy-stick kid. Also many are looking for fast money making. So, you see, we sometimes are a bit silly in this bitcoin community.
But I am here to help you. And I am sure there will be always people out there in this community that will be able and willing to help.
I am a computer system engineer, with a bachelor degree, and will be glad if I can help you sort it out.
My feeling is that you will not be able to recover any money your husband may have invested in bitcoin.
So take it easy, and forgive it all a bit.
Because after all the most precious thing you have is this life; and there is no reason not to be happy and grateful for everything :)
These are my two cents. Hope it can help. And God Bless you and your family.

Bitcoins are not held on the wallet file. That is not true. Bitcoins only exist as balances associated with a bitcoin address. To be more precise they exist in the blockchain (the public ledger) purely in terms of the chains of transactions that take place and become registered. What you hold in the wallet file is the private key of each address you own. That allows you to spend from the balance associated with the address. You see, bitcoins don't exist. They only exist as balances associated with public addresses.

Very nice.
There is a little difference between public address and bitcoin address as she may know. But that is just a detail, and maybe it helped people understand it better the way she put it, indeed.
The bitcoin address is more compact then the public address and has less information than it for that matter; and you cannot guess the public address if you know only the bitcoin address, although if you use the address then its related public address will be made public on the blockchain because if you use the address you must have the private key and the private key is everything you need to find out the corresponding public key.
A private key is a secret code which allows the user to prove his ownership of his Bitcoins. Every Bitcoin address has a matching private key, which is saved in the wallet file of the person who owns the balance. The private key is mathematically related to the Bitcoin address, and is designed so that the Bitcoin address can be calculated from the private key, but importantly, the same cannot be done in reverse.

It is scarce and useful. Market forces of demand and supply drive the price of BTC. The bitcoin network brings about to this material world something that it had not before: that is very useful to send and receive money without limits, borders, censorship and without middleman.
That's why miners are payed (with rewards and transaction fees) to secure this network and bring it into full fruition.

I suggest something else.
Youtube would advertise for all videos a bitcoin address and QR code with the vanity address prefix: CHECKOURTIPS.
Then would tip back always in the same way so that it would get to be kwown the formula used which would be based on the hash of the next block and on how many satoshis you sent.
Because there was no official thing saying it was a lottery it would seem just like a tipping address but everyone would know that it was a provably fair lottery paying no taxes and with no profits.
There would be no profits but it would be fun that Google was sponsering the greater global/international lottery with winners every 10 minutes.
The more satoshis you sent the more likely you would be tipped back what got on the tipping pot.
The formula used would be: Hash mod satoshis.
The bitcoin address of that satoshie entrie would get it.
Everybody would get to know how the winners were picked but there were no official disclosure and no prize claims and complains could be made.

My comments, as a message to the author, on the youtube video: [How Bitcoin mining actually works - What is the "cryptographic puzzle"?] [  ] [reddit] [facebook] [youtube]
"To be honest I did hardly learn anything new with the video but I did enjoy it and loved it very much and I am sure it may be helpful to many people learning about bitcoin/mining.
I did produce youtube videos in the past to explain bitcoin mining and have been learning and participating in the bitcoin community for quite a while, back to 2012 or so (I got quite interested and enthusiastic with bitcoin in late 2011, after reading about it in Ray Kurzweil mailing-list that I receive by email. But actually I read about p2p money years before and I remember that back in 2009 or so I happened to mention and link the blog post where these new revolutionary p2p form of money was being talked in an email I sent from my university account, when I was graduating in Computer Science. Unfortunately I didn't archive that sent email and lost it but is interesting to think I could have had the extreme luck of having been mining by then) so I really love to see what others come up with. When a new video is brought up to explain bitcoin I always get on salivating and curious to see how it goes. I think you did very well. I can have a good appreciation of the hurdles you have gone through and think you did a wonderful job explaining this stuff to a wider audience. I hope your video gets many views, as it deserves, although sometimes that is quite difficult to achieve and does not happen straight off but I wish you good luck and thank you very much for providing us this video, that is certainly very appreciated by the rest of us in the bitcoin community. Cheers mate, best wishes! I also loved your sense of humour and creativity. Awesome. It made my day  ;-)"

Every ten minutes a new block of transactions is created and miners are rewarded with new minted bitcoins. In the first four years the reward was 50 BTC every 10 minutes. In the next four years the reward halved to 25 BTC every ten minutes. And so on. Every four years the reward halves. Right now it is 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes. Soon it will be 6.25 BTC every ten minutes.

The 21 million figure results from the accumulation of 50 bitcoins every ten minutes for 4 years (50x6x24x365x4 = 10 512 000), plus half, 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes over the following 4 years (5256 000 + 10 512 000 = 15 768 000), plus, half, 12.5 bitcoins every ten minutes in the following four years (2 628 000 + 5 256 000 + 10 512 000 = 18 396 000)… and so on until 2140, where half of the last four years is so tiny that it adds nothing to the total of “almost” 21 million, more precisely: 20999999.97690000
Very soon, by the end of the year 2026, there will be 20 million bitcoin in circulation. That is 95% of the theoretical limit of 21 million... Besides many bitcoins end up lost forever...

The video is excellent but I am pretty sure that if you gave different groups of people that were not introduced to bitcoin before one of the three following videos:
- "United Colors of Bitcoin" 
- "How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood"
- and this video.
The groups of people that were given the two other videos would score much better in a test that tested their understanding of bitcoin than those in the group that was given this one to watch.
I think that without explaining the relationship between private key and bitcoin address, and what it means to create a bitcoin address, people will not really get it. 
And also I think that you need to explain people that in bitcoin mining nothing is really created - as such. Without their understanding of the scheduled mechanism that is on the base of bitcoins entering circulation, they will not get it.
Before that understanding they will just want to run away from it, I guess.

From: 
Finding Valid Blocks
To find a valid block, the miner builds a list of recent transactions and calculates some summary information about the proposed block. This summary is combined with a number called a nonce to create a block header. The hash of the block header is then calculated and to see if it is small enough to win at the current difficulty. If not, the nonce is changed and the new hash is calculated and tested. 
There is no way to create a valid block except by a brute force
search. Brute force means the miner tries one nonce, then another, and another, repeating the process until it gets lucky. During that search, the miner cannot predict if the next nonce will give a smaller hash than the last.
Since it is a brute force process, the only way to increase your
chances of winning are to increase your chances of winning are to increase the speed with which you can try nonces. The more processing power you have at your disposal, the faster you can search and the more likely you will be to find a winning block. 
Once a valid block has been generated, it is broadcast to the
network and quickly verified by the other nodes in the network. The difficulty of finding a winning number is adjusted every 2016 blocks so blocks are generated on average, every 10 minutes.

didier1814: I don't think he needs to be a world class cryptographer in any sense, because the code uses external libraries like those of openssl to perform all the cryptographic computations. He just needed a very good sense and mathematical/logical intuition to make the choice on which cryptographic functions and math transformations to use, not really deeply  understand them intrensically and programatically. As I said, the software uses external libraries to perform the cryptographic math. You wouldn't don't need to be an expert enough in terms of the mathematical proof and intrinsically complexity of it.
Regarding being a world class programmer, he defiantly doesn't profile a professional programmer with a commercial career that would be much more sophisticate in terms of the use of the IDE used rather than being super intensive in much more academic technicalities like the use of concurrency and the use of sophisticate C++ constructs like templates, map, multiset , multimap... It definetly looks like a senior academic, doing it all in a very solitaire way.
I cannot see him as a top .NET developer, expert in Microsoft tools and products used by software professionals these days.
I don't see him either as a more conventional professional in fields of engineering like like DSP, signal analysis, fuzzy systems, etc.
It really doesn't look like it should profile someone with the regular underpaid job as a systems expert or test engineer, and much more like someone with plenty of time and a profile pretty much like that of my uncle A. Franco Alexandre.
I am sure time will prove that I am right and make it all much more apparent.
I cannot ask him, because with don't have contact, following a series of tragedies in the family.
Both my uncles, the two brothers of my defunct father, also with a tragic death, are PhD and highly respected academics.
My father was also an intellectual but more hippy and world apart, as a student of psychoanalysis in Paris in the 60's and suffering from deep anxieties and troubled love affair.
I could be lying, you may think, but it still makes a great story worth a true love for truth-seeking, and revelation.
But believe me, it is real. And will hardly believe Satoshi can be anyone else but someone, that makes sense with this all.
I believe my uncle and the Fellowship of Friends, in Apollo, California, are the greatest hope we have for the planet.
We are the so called family: Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Michael Jackson, Shakira, Britney Spears, Ophrah Winfrey, Shirley MacLaine, Oprah, Prince Charles, José Sócrates, Angela_Merkel, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, and all people that do really care, including Jerry Maguire, KnowWand and Trueman.

Here is the code that imposes this limitation,
//on main.cpp

    int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210000 blocks, which will occur approximately every 4 years

London, the 5th of April 2013. (Friday) 
I guess my uncle, António Franco Alexandre, is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto.
The more I think of it the more convinced I am.
One important suggestion that is indeed him is that, I remember it well, on the last Xmas I spent with him and the family, he was reading 'Notes on Fermat's Last Theorem' as we were watching TV. And also he had Neal Koblitz’s autobiography, 'Random Curves: Journeys of a Mathematician' at his bedside table, which made me curious and made me ask about it.
He told me that he was particularly interested in it because a colleague of him, recently had showed him a photograph were they were at the same Hall, at Harvard, in the summer of 1969, when he was visiting the campus for the first time in an important celebration.
Althought, they did not meet he is an important cryptographer and mathematician, and all makes me think that was what may got him interested and knowledgeble about the Elliptic Curves used by bitcoin.
I know it sounds crazy, but I have very good reasons to think my uncle is indeed Satoshi.
And no one has made me think otherwise yet or ruled it out as a great possibility in any way.
I will keep seeking the truth, and dream with a great fortune. My goodness... I really couldn't have it be missed.
