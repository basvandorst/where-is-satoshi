He sounds like an idiot. I generally try not to argue with people like that. They just get me extremely frustrated. Even wielding an encyclopedic knowledge of cryptocurrency from a future where bitcoin has become the foundation of a global economy, you would never be able to convince someone who doesn't have any respect for verifiable facts of anything but what THEY choose to believe.

I wouldn't buy them, you're paying too much per hash. Electricity should also factor into your value proposition.

The day I can literally smoke some Bitcoin will be the day I truly find happiness.

Did anyone else look at their rig after seeing this and hear Indiana Jones yelling "It belongs in a museum!" in their head?

Some of the posts here have already expressed a similar sentiment but I figured, as a residential scale miner, I'd throw my two cents in as well.
To start, I think the promise of a chip dialed down to a 14mm manufacturing process is awesome. The technical achievement is something that I think is, in and of itself, worth celebrating. Even if we're talking about a company whose business practices are less than admirable, it's still pretty cool.
However, I find it difficult to understand why a company like Black Arrow would want to try and walk the line between a consumer-facing business and an enterprise-oriented business. They sell assembled mining units and focus on R&amp;D, chip manufacturing and selling wholesale. This just seems like a bad idea. The first comparison that comes to mine is the PC industry. Initially you had a handful of players who handled everything. Fast forward to present date and now we have hundreds of specialists that focus on excelling at singular aspects of a larger ecosystem.
I will leave you with this. Are we seeing an industry struggling through its growing pains? Or is this just another scam and Black Arrow has decided to double down on their con?

College students. Nerdy ones.
I'm one of the officers for my schools Makers Club. I'm assuming all of them have at least a cursory knowledge of Bitcoin, but have probably received a fair amount of misinformation about what it actually is. I'm not sure if making that assumption is wise.
My goal at the moment would be to dispel any myths and explain how the blockchain works. Maybe a brief tutorial on setting up a miner to have a hands-on component with shiny toys.

Not trying to be a jerk, but you could always just compile from the source.

It's quite strange. I think that Coinbase uses off-chain transactions to provide payment processor solutions to merchants, which might explain the delay.

Scrooge McDuck dive into a pile of retired mining hardware. Use bitcoins to pay hospital bills.
