The only SSL domain, pay.reddit.com, was intended for setting up ads or something. It probably bypassed the CDN and directly loaded their servers. You can still enable the pay.reddit.com rule in HTTPS Everywhere

JavaScript itself isn't insecure, but the delivery and execution can be sketchy, and it's hard for Joe User to notice.

The idea is probably that it's going to be impossible for even a neighborhood the use that much, so they can oversell massively as long as it can peak at 1T.
Edit: Article says they're totally guessing about terabit speeds for Google fiber. They're basing it on a job listing for a photonics engineer. Clickbait.

And HSTS and HPKP, since nobody pays attention to a (missing) 's' and the CA system is sketchy.

Ignoring how tolls are more or less a regressive tax, and how they're complete nonsense in a town with no serious highways... They did none of that, just refused to pay for road upkeep.

In the stupidest ways possible.
Yeah, instead of paying to fix a utilized and historic building let's wait til it's condemned then pay significantly more to tear it down then pay twice that amount every year ongoing to rent a replacement building across town. And roads? Who needs roads, we aren't gonna pay for repairs or paving anymore.

They're examples of what members of the free state project do when they get into government, like I said: try to reduce the size of government in the stupidest ways possible.
One of the things they did was stop funding road repair.
I have no idea how you're reading this so strangely, but thanks for the name-calling.

As someone who has to deal with their trail of destruction: PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THE FREE STATE PROJECT
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:20:33
Certainly. For starters, here's my post from last year about [what they did in my town]( - don't miss the thread under the negative-voted reply.

If my lived experience is obscure and irrelevant to you, your abstract state successes are obscure and irrelevant to me.
It's wonderful that things you feel are positive are being done, but please support those without supporting others that are directly destructive to me and my community.

Seems like a bad idea to me. Would that not make it unusable to you? And irrevocable if you lived longer than expected or had a falling out with the recipient (or were killed by them, or they died first, or your hypothetical of choice)?
@_date: 2016-10-08 14:46:54
Hmm. RBF is active and supported now, and works for CLTV transactions after confirmations? Or different mechanism? I think this plan still breaks quantum safety, but that's obviously a more hypothetical concern.

The mail like this that I got failed DMARC. Not sure why. 
I also have several coinbase accounts, and only one got this message. 
There's also nothing about this on  - until I see something there, I'm going to assume this was forged FUD sent to the email addresses coinbase leaked a while ago, or something.
ETA: Also, my mailserver's notification to theirs that DMARC failed, bounced... though that might just be coinbase being a clusterfuck like usual.
Update: It's on  so it's legit. This company is a dumpster fire.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:16:45
It looks like they sent it through datadrivenemail.com but didn't actually make sure their DMARC policy allowed that. AIUI it doesn't because they use the strict alignment for dkim and spf.  
That means people probably did not receive the email, either because they have policy=reject or because even things that don't actually reject it (eg. me) still heap on the spam score for failures.

Probably a coincidence, but an interesting one nonetheless. [Tor usage up by more than 100% in August](
