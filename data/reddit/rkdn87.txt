Putting any amount of money into USDT is insane.

I'm not trolling. Why wouldn't this work? The main chain could check the sending wallet to ensure local rules haven't been broken. That the wallet is valid based on the rules.

Yes but they would know your last valid wallet hash stored on the main chain and you could show your local wallet history, transactions with other known wallets, as well as its effects on your hash. Which could be checked.

Yes but you and the other party could verify the information of both wallets for each transaction and store the hash changes in each wallet. You would only commit to the main chain to update your last "known" valid hash showing proof of work between the last updated hash and your current one when the local computation between your last "known" hash and current one became to large.

Why couldn't you just use some sort of cryptography to ensure the transfer is valid between the two parties?

Can you explain? It works fine for other purposes between two parties. You could check the transaction rules on your end before accepting the funds to your wallet.

And to answer your last question. There would be no record of balances. Just a main chain containing a hash or something that ensures the wallet hasn't been tampered with.

Why do you have to check the balance. Isn't checking that the wallet hasn't had fraudulent transactions enough?
