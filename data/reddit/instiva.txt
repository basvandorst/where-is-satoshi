Not saying you're wrong, but diminishing marginal returns "could" negate a large part of this analogy. The proportionality between family size and amount of fish caught, for instance, isn't going to stay constant at 1:1 all the way up. Depending on the specific circumstances, the returns may drop off so low after X hours that anything else would be better, maybe even the palmtree nap specifically due to the need for rest. These dynamics are hard to map out due to the odd effects of specifics.

I understand your arguments, and I'm not really trying to engage this all (hence just quipping briefly originally) but for what it's worth, I haven't experienced anyone complaining about the prices at Walmart being too cheap. If anything, people complain that they're too high given what Walmart is: economic retail. Mostly I've heard people complain that they aren't providing enough for what they're taking and that people shopping there en masse within a community does not provide a healthy state of economisation, which Walmart purportedly does little to discourage.

IMO daytrading with $50 isn't really worth the time. How much effort is it going to take to pull 100% returns, just to net $50? With risk-less principal you are probably looking at a low $/hr and $/effort, especially relative to just working a paid job. Altogether "don't trade" is solid advice. If one is going to do it anyway, I would suggest they compare their activity to what they would be able to do outside of trading, and not just compare "internally" (that is, comparing trading in general vs not trading instead of trade X vs trade Y)

The global bitcoin volume vs the total global volume is negligible. If we faced a serious crash, crypto would be pulled tremendously down because of people cashing out into something that can be used tangibly, without upkeep costs (internet, phone, electricity, effort maintaining private keys) for tangible goods. There's security in knowing that the difference between where we are floating on global financial bloat and the tangible, intrinsic value of things is just about the maximum a crash can bring us down, but that's still a pretty far drop.

The point about the community investing in the devs is very true. I think that the actions of the active devs formed most of why the tiles landed as they did. There wasn't this protracted discussion and long history of resilience that there is in bitcoin. It would not be a stretch to say that the process was rushed by necessity, even with the attempts to pace properly. The atmosphere was filled with the highest degree of FUD, which helped fuel the ideological split between the coins. I'd say this circumstance ultimately led to Poloniex and others realizing there was market demand for this "abandoned" token, and thus the survival of the chain now called ETC. I don't know the consequences different actions would have had, but it seemed to me as though there was a collective cognitive dissonance with the entire ETH/ETC debacle and this may have arisen largely due to the short timescale and drama-rich circumstances.

To all the people blabbing about how ETH is a market-positive over ETC, doesn't TheDaoHacker have millions of ETC stored away for dumping -&gt; potentially affecting the price? Granted we do see that in bitcoin with Karpeles, BFH, et cetera, but it's still somewhat different. Only 6 months out after Mt. Gox and Bitcoin wasn't doing so hot vs its high and ETC is facing a similar threat (and currently lack of development).

Eh, I'll take it. You could say the true assholes are the people who refuse to engage in adult discussions, emotionally lash out at any criticism, subscribe to mob mentality, etc. 
The same people who love to bitch and moan and play hate-club games, the same people who have their own lives and livelihoods affected by policy changes they refuse to investigate or even discuss, etc. are the ones who did this to themselves. They deserve every bit of it, too. If you're going to act like a 9 year old voter, bitching about a president who acts 12 is not justified. Zero responsibility, zero accountability, etc. when it comes to their behavior, but as soon as something happens that they not only don't like, they're "up in arms" on Facebook, repeatedly bitching, acting like an irresponsible child, doing absolutely nothing productive before or after the fact... it's a veritable shitshow. 
I lost respect for a LOT of people in the last election cycle, and most of them because of their inability to meet basic levels of citizenry. At least a lot of Trump's supporters engaged and fucking voted. Sure, many of them are crazy, but many aren't. Sure, I certainly would have liked a different campaign cycle and election altogether, but I have yet to see a shred of justification for the disappointing and reprehensible behavior of his opponents. Instead we get wall to wall complaints with zero substance or thought behind them and a bunch of people who feel like it's their saving grace to hate on someone whose strategy bricked them, paved a road with the bricks, and walked all over them. The opposition is anally probing their politics and they're looking forward to the next Tonight Show so they can laugh at Colbert's endless brigading and get their "I'm good for the world because I like how he makes fun of the Orange Man I hate" dopamine boost.
If someone's so upset about the threat to the environment and national parks, why refuse to enter a discussion about renewable energy? Extremely upset about foreign policy but can't differentiate France and Germany on a map of Europe or even know where the Korean Peninsula is? Hate tariffs, tax breaks, trade agreements, etc. but live paycheck to paycheck because you buy street drugs every payday? At a certain point, enough is enough. There are plenty of reasons why the country rejected such crass... immaturity in favor for a candidate that hundreds of millions of people around the world openly mock. 
It's more that the country as a whole has a huge population that despises anything that makes them uncomfortable and gets dragged around mindlessly on emotional leashes held by the people they refuse to even acknowledge exist. There are no real selection mechanisms to eliminate or mitigate the negative impacts of such chaff. 
I'll certainly say that I am probably over-generalizing from a poor personal experience, and I certainly don't mean to seem aggrandized. However, I suspect this is just a small fragment of a very large issue.

Adoption itself is a myth unless/until you can fully dethrone all of fiat, which isn't going to happen. There's a litany of reasons it exists in the first place and none of them are "because no one could have imagined this or done it before the bitcoin whitepaper".
The notion of miners being the ones to benefit most is not wrong, but I'd say it's valid for different reasons. Because of the place mining holds in the ecosystem they are in positions to benefit disproportionately vs the rest of the ecosystem, albeit at larger levels of risk and different types of it. The trade off is still proportionately a better "deal" if you have the ability to break the "economy of scale" barriers required to be a competitive mining operation, but very few actors do. Imagine starting now and bringing up a competitor to something like Bitmain. Very few people would be in such a position, and none of the redditors getting shilled on "the next big thing" so they will spend their paychecks "investing" in cryptocurrency are remotely close to being there.

This statement is wholly false. There is absolutely no reason to correlate the two, and most stock investors are choosing to go into stock and not crypto. As non-rudely as possible, to say otherwise is some moon-boy bullshit.
Also, since I'm already risking sounding like a dick, just because you aren't a native speaker doesn't mean you can break the rules of a language and be a dick when you're corrected. If there is room for improvement, it is your responsibility to do so and anyone pointing out your mistakes is just giving you an opportunity to improve. If you aren't using the words you are trying to use correctly, and someone tries to help you get it right, don't reply with the rough equivalent of "suck my dick, I don't have to because I know another language". It's great that you can speak another language under your belt, but still... not a good stance to take. 
For what it's worth, a major reason why it is ever brought up in the first place is that native English speakers that tend to make the same mistake tend to also be viewed as less competent and less intelligent. It hurts your arguments and stance overall to put yourself in such a crowd. Again, not trying to be a dick, but you're seeming a bit closed-minded and inattentive to details otherwise and neither are good traits to see in someone who is giving you what amounts to financial advice.

I'm almost split on the exchange issue. I really would like to see action taken enough to discourage the type of activity the exchange did enough to reduce the likelihood of it happening again, but on the other hand I really can't feel bad for anyone market buying BCH literally minutes after it launched. They'll be lucky if they get anything back, because they're playing with higher stakes than they realize.

Well, I live in such a place for sure and that's probably why I have such a cynical view of the population lol... What to do is a really good question, though.
I honestly have no idea what to do about this large-scale problem and I'll admit it. Creating a future to be optimistic about by default is a true hard problem for this country and the world as a whole. I'll admit I'm not quite sure what to do for myself even except work hard and produce opportunities for myself. A STEM degree paid for by loans, long nights and stressful weekends, keeping my nose to the grindstone and not lines of oxycodone, not thinking with my genitals, studying technology enough to understand the value of finding BTC/ETH/et al., early and risking a huge amount of personal resources (time, money, energy, social connections, etc.) to capitalize on the past two years of speculative gains got me to where I'm at and I still feel at danger of sinking any day. 
I genuinely don't have an answer for this that would work for enough people, much less for everyone. It's a very hard problem to solve all at once, and any solutions that might work over time are going to have to withstand dissolution and destruction in the face of absolute chaos. In order to get anything done we need to create a foundation of standards, lines that can't be crossed, reference points that we can all agree to move forward from and some tangible and effective goals to be moving towards. It is going to take people from opposing camps working together to create new camps altogether and break out of toxic molds. This is why I am deeply disgusted by people who retreat into their political camps and bandwagon/meme their way through discussions. 
Things are absolutely going to get worse in many regards, and better in others as we move forward. We might see a lot of positive developments catalyzed by technology, but that catalysis works both ways and the same tech can exacerbate existing problems and create new ones that just stack and compound. Environmental change, economic upheavals, social hyper-connectivity, etc. all have the ability to push us down a slippery slope, one way or the other. 
To quote the great Carlos Matos, "The world is not anymore the way it used to be, no no no!"
Addition: I will say there are a lot of things to be hopeful about though, a good feel-good sub for this is r/futurology. Renewable energy costs are plummeting and are expected to keep dropping. We're looking at all kinds of emerging tech like lab-grown meat, global high-speed sat-net, etc. There are lot's of ideas that are just sitting shelved waiting for the right innovations to make them technologically or economically feasible, and there are tons of great ones not even thought of yet. There are also billions of people and lots of populations all around the world are stepping up to the global stage and getting education, skills training, economic opportunities, etc. that previously were not available. With a few billion more people on the internet and performing better in the global economy, who knows where we will end up.

If the price moves against them, they just pretend it's part of some masterful 3d-chess game and do their best to convince others to still buy in. It's mostly people making empty arguments steeped in ideology because they themselves are gambling more money than they should be permitted access to (hence CC lockdown, 10% of all ICO money being stolen, etc.) and are trying to recruit others into doing the same so they can get rich off of it.

Sounds like speculative trading logic - something people could do and did before Satoshi ever even conceived of Bitcoin. Hell, there were people speculatively trading centuries before he was even born, assuming hes not a long-standing Highlander. 
But yes, I too expect there to *eventually* be some crackdowns on *some* population that uses currency and for that crackdown to be resisted via tech. In fact, I would point to criminals as a whole for an example of a population "the government" in general is attempting to suppress. Criminal activity with cryptocurrency has grown year-over-year for several years now. There are huge volumes of illegal transactions done through these decentralized networks already, and there arguably have been from the start. You could make a very strong case that bitcoin only really exists as it is today due to usefulness to criminals and compatibility with criminal activity.

You might be either crazy or uninformed if you don't think criminal activity gave bitcoin its legs for most of its early years. Silk Road and the other darknet markets come to mind. Int'l traffickers using btc, cybercriminals taking payments, etc.  
Trying to deflect to anti-banker sentiment isn't valid or relevant at all. I know it's the theme of the subreddit and most "ayyy btc" posters' default to the point of being stereotypical, but we all need to collectively move on to substantial arguments and away from memes.
The argument you're taking is that to see if bitcoin is where it is due to illegal activity you need to see what fraction of all of global money laundering it constitutes? Seems nonsensical and/or impossible to draw valid conclusions from such information. You'd need more crypto-specific data for the info you're wanting to even show up against such a huge backdrop.
What you'd do better with is historical data about the distribution of use cases within cryptocurrency and bitcoin. You'd need this info from, say, 2009-present, particularly the early bits. Comparing this data to global money laundering and other crime would be interesting, but I imagine an argument based on fraction of global money laundering in crypto vs USD you'd just end up making an argument against the usefulness of bitcoin in general vs cash. 
I'm on mobile now but I can browse for what data is available soon.

I might, but I suspect most have dramatically overblown expectations for this resiliency both in terms of function and in value. A canonical example of resilience through decentralization is the illegal drug market. It, in all its forms, is pretty god-damn resilient even though it is illegal just about everywhere. This is sure and would support the point that decentralized networks (contraband supply + distro networks) can withstand censorship resistance and claim a portion of the global economy. Assuming we are limiting the discussion to purely illegal drug trade, compare this to the global pharmaceutical industries {just don't try to take this analogy too far, I'm sure it'll break down lol}. 
I've never been in a situation where such items as black market Tylenol, or the aspirin a college student makes in organic chemistry, were even remotely viable enough to be options on offer. The legal pharmaceutical market provides everything needed. Sure, you can go on to argue that there are corrupt industry leaders that provide society with harmful substances legally, maybe even under prescription, maybe in wildly excessive supply, etc. and then you can draw parallels between these people and corrupt bankers, but as a whole, the matter is whether the existing or future legal infrastructure provides what these censorship resistant networks purport to do. I would imagine arguments that drive the sensible stances in this community are similar to those that motivate drug law reform advocates that push for harm reduction strategies and socially healthy and responsible integration of the drug use and users into the world at large.

You can certainly pick examples and pitch old tech industries against new ones but that's hardly what the issue will be moving forward. People seem to think it's actually an argument of traditional banking tech vs new fintech and it absolutely isn't. It's a conflict of ideas and the general notion is people think this decentralized "community" is going to be able to produce some kind of social movement that will take us into utopia. If you want examples from history, look at how many times these little rebellions succeeded in creating utopias. Even the most successful rebellions tend to recreate similar or equivalent/greater issues for their countries. Even if things change, they will more or less remain the same. 
To see the utterly absurd attempts at arguments made around here demonstrates how very naive this entire "community" is really. The comment above about young college-age dropouts that have little to no participation in the formal economy is an accurate depiction. The reason why these people have such little involvement is because they understand so little and have not only no money, but no path to getting even medium sums without getting lucky on a moonshot in crypto. Thinking this is because they're some kind of revolutionary and this is going to change the world has all of history weighted against it.

1) Centralized solutions are cheaper. Consider Amazon vs. Filecoin. Amazon can buy hard drives in bulk and receive large discounts. They can pass those savings onto their customers. The Filecoin users providing storage to customers will have to 1) convince customers that their technology is safe 2) offer cheaper service. There isn't a trust issue with Amazon. So why would customers move to Filecoin?
--Why isn't there a trust issue with Amazon? Large tech companies have repeatedly abused the trust of their customers.
*++ Not sure what to say to this one, could go either way. You're right about a history of abuses, though, the most recent prominent example maybe being Equifax (Equihaxx).*
2) Centralized solutions are much faster. Yes, there is a bunch of work being done now to allow for smaller transactions (lightning networks, plasma). There's no proof this is going to work. High level scaling solutions remain academic.
--Blockchain is incredibly young. Things will improve over time. We are in the very early days.
*++ This isn't necessarily a valid rebuttal. Being early days doesn't mean this isn't going to have a set of intrinsic problems, challenges and disadvantages.*
3) Development takes longer because the software has to operate in a trustless environment. Every update, no matter how minor, requires an independent security audit. There are quite a few examples of why security audits are not optional.
--I would view this as a feature rather than a bug. Many open source projects took much longer, but ultimately resulted in much better projects than centralized projects. One major reason? Companies must respond to their customers' demands right away. As a result, they tend to have very short term thinking. A great example would be .NET vs. open source solutions.
*++ Taking longer isn't necessarily a feature. Getting more completely developed maybe is a feature, and might be the crux of a viable argument, but we also haven't seen this transpire in cryptocurrency. We aren't looking at systems that outcompete the incumbents in nearly any metric. The only one in favor of cryptocurrency that comes to mind is censorship resistance. This isn't inherently good, though. Censorship resistance can create a whole host of real-world problems. See: Bill Gates' (oddly contentious) AMA answer about cryptocurrency: "The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way."*
4) Because money is involved forks can be contentious. The default is to do nothing. A centralized solution with a board of directors and CEO can outpace a blockchain community in development speed and time to market.
--Which company has been outpacing the blockchain community in development? I understand your point in theory, but I don't think it matches reality.
*++ Essentially every single fintech company in existence can produce a higher transaction throughput than bitcoin. What is being compared, here? What is the metric being tracked? I default to transactions per second and transaction volume.* 
5) If the private keys are lost or stolen the consumer is screwed. That makes blockchain technology incredibly risky. It's still safer to pay friends with Chase QuickPay. Banks also have insurance. How can a blockchain be insured?
--This is a central feature not a bug. Again, using Bitcoins / crypto for everything is not necessarily the endgame for all Bitcoiners. There is a place for traditional banking and blockchains.
*++ This isn't a bug, but to suggest it is an inherently positive feature is a stretch.* 
6) Smart contracts are too rigid to replace the legal system. One option is to use an oracle as a source of information. However, using oracles to pull data from outside the blockchain means most of the logic is centralized.
--I don't think many people are suggesting that smart contracts should replace the legal system. Smart contracts will be most useful for things like clearing trades, etc. in the short term.
*++ Agree with you about the smart contracts use cases, but there are absolutely many that are arguing that smart contracts will replace large portions of the legal system. I'm not sure how much I agree with them, but they exist in large numbers.*

The very last line: "killing or incapacitating an influential dev" would be far, far more effective and threatening if it was applied to more than one developer and became a trend. Just one murder/assault and you'll have a few people throwing conspiracy theories and a lot of people suspecting he just got himself into some dark shit. Make it a clear and public trend of attacking the developers because of their involvement and you will have a much more vicious ecosystem very rapidly. 
And the likelihood and impact being "low" only seems to be the case at present. After the first few (and with the huge amount of money to be made by the perpetrating group, who would presumably short as much as possible before the news of their carnage broke), imagine the response. I'd expect a lot fewer people to stick around, and those that do will be a far, far greater target/magnet for attacks. The remaining ecosystem would be very, very easy to characterize as radical and destructive to society, henceforth, as the developers would probably be relegated to keeping themselves out of the public light, focused on maintaining their physical and digital security an order of magnitude more than the norm, etc. 
I'd be surprised if we don't see a few dozen bodies over this within the next few years.
