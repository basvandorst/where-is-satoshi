Bitcoin is a total scam and ponzi scheme from the beginning.  Who has  and where is all the money, millions and billions, that investors lost?  There seems to be a lot of profanity on this website. Many investors are appropriately  angry and totally infuriated at the loss of their money. Many investors have lost their life savings.  Many of these postings reveal that people do not know how to adequately express themselves using  standard  language without the vulgar profanity used by many posters. The use of so much profanity is equivalent to  infants and toddlers that have not developed  sufficient verbal skills to  express their feelings and frustrations so they  have tantrums, throw things, bite, and hit people as a means of conveying their feeling an anger or frustrations.    Adults, use vulgarity, profanity and many other obscene  language to express how deeply angry they are.  I find such foul language offensive.  It is getting very difficult to  be on the web in general without encountering  constant use of profanity.      Try increasing and building your vocabulary with words that convey your feelings so that use of profanity is minimized.  Children and Teens  now  frequently use obscene language in the school settings and then suffer the consequences of  such. They are a product of an obscene profane environment, society and culture that now exist in America.  Americans are the most profane country worldwide.

Apparently you are the one that doesn't know how bitcoin works or even what an investor or an investment is. so before you try to tell someone else what they don't know it's best you learn what bitcoin is an isn't. Your reply shows your lack of knowledge and understanding of investments and commodities.
