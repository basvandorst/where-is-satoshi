Just woke up and I'm wondering if last night's news about Mt Gox turned out to be true, or is still just a rumor?

I had this feeling at the start too, it's real. We're going somewhere uncharted and although I know governments will try to stop it, they won't be able to. The future is now, the future is btc.

I bought BTC because I believe in it completely. Nothing, and I mean nothing, will change that for me. If it tanks relative to fiat, I will buy more. In the end, Bitcoin will rise again, this I am sure.

A year or two? I'd say a week or two. Poor him ? I dont' have too much pity, maybe for his family, but certainly not for him.

Thanks so much for clearing this up. I realize I didn't correctly understand the process.

ya...seems like I time waster, I'm surprised you still can't more easily buy bitcoin (I've been out of the loop for about  6 months and figured it would have gotten easier)

I am lazy I guess, but also a bit of the later. I was hoping to be able to enter a bitcoin address and send funds via paypal and have my btc's delivered. Do you think that's unrealistic as a service?

what a hassle though, can't I just easily buy bitcoin? Do I have to register with some site like coinbase and make a big stinking deal about it? I'm just not into having to go through the whole reporting it to the government bullshit.
