yes I know, but no hacker can restore my wallet and no paper wallet thief can restore my wallet until they manage to get both: my 12 paper wallet words and my 12 words in the cloud? both are backed up separately: (the 12 online words) multiple times on different servers online and (the 12 offline words) on different locations offline.

usability. if I want to encrypt/decrypt the full 24 word list I need a freshly installed air-gapped laptop (I don't know if a dual boot on my laptop is enough to keep my seed safe with all the kind of hardware/bios/boot viruses these days...). Not a good option for me as a traveller with light lugage. Furthermore I have to print a long unreadable encrypted string, instead to simply write down 12 words.
But I may have to sacrify usabilty to get real security if you guys think 12 words of my -ledger nano s- seed is not secure enough? To split the passphrase in two parts is just an idea I had today for good usability AND security from both online and offline thiefs as a traveller.

My question was only about the half passphrase. if I keep 12 words on a paper and the put the other 12 words of the same 24 words passphrase to the cloud my assumption was that I still have good security both from offline and online thiefs with 2048^12 = 5 444 517 870 735 015 415 413 993 718 908 291 383 296 possibilities to bruteforce. I want to do it that way for better usability (see my answer above).
