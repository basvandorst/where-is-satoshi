I wonder what the repercussions would be if a stolen CC order went all the way through and was received by the btc spender.

And now they resolved it after I posted the link to this reddit post in the comments of the transaction.

I also sent a support message via their website's messaging system, however I was not able to find that again to screenshot it.  This lack of action to at least acknowledge my dispute is unprofessional.

I've had about half of my orders stall like this and half go through quickly and painlessly.  All depends on what buyer you get, but support should be much faster to act.  Being as bad as a non-reputable buyer to respond is just sad.

How do you "save a copy" of a website?

The rate is negotiable but I think $50/hr sounds very reasonable.
