There is nothing in his comment that indicates how much experience he has trading Bitcoin. You made seven mistakes in your writing, eight if I include the double dots.

Not yet future him isn't. (Is that a good sentence?)
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:02:07
I'd like to know too. As in, how much is a bit in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:12:05
So how does this work? What about the Hero Initiative.

You've got this right, but it depends on where you store your coins. If they're on a wallet, you should have equal amounts on both chains now. If your money's with Kraken, you do too. Other exchanges like Coinbase don't support BCH. If your coins are with them, you're out of luck as far as I know.

You will profit from buying more BTC with BCH if the price goes up again. It's not that difficult to imagine.

Being held at gunpoint though, anyone will give up their private key and make a transfer. Since nobody knows who has rights to the receiving address, the money will be lost in plain sight. Right? Are we trusting that being visible on the blockchain will scare off potential thieves like this?

Have I missed something?

You need to capitalise 'is'. Many people don't realise that.

I hear ya. I had a bitcoin three years ago. Sold it when the prices crashed. Didn't have the foresight to hodl. Now I'm buying back and doing alright.
It's no use thinking about what you missed out on. The only way is forward.
Also, at least you're not [this guy](

Would it matter if he did? Personally, I don't take people who claim a bitcoin will be worth $500,000 in three years too seriously. But what do I know.

Ah, I see now. The percentages I mentioned represent the amount of networks, not the amount of blocks. So I guess some networks (Antpool?) do the majority of the work?
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:54:27
Guess I misinterpreted the blue bar's tooltip. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:44:48
Coinbase is he biggest exchange. Personally, I've only used Kraken. Outside those two, I don't know. There might be scammers out there, sure, but if you do a bit of research you should be fine.

Don't you think Bitcoin's value will go down for a while after SegWit2x gets activated? What about the UASF and the risk of a chain split?
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:44:19
Sounds reasonable. I'm just getting into Bitcoin again, so pardon me for asking simple questions, but why then do more miners (43.9 % vs. 33.7 % according to Coin Dance) support SegWit2x? Personal gain? What would they, or anybody, gain from activating SegWit2x?
Also, what is the chance SegWit2x won't gain enough support and effectively split Bitcoin into two separate currencies?
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:55:50
Care to explain why?
