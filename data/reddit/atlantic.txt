The biggest risk in this scaling debate is economic. Resources will simply be diverted if Bitcoin can't deliver on its promise. It is funny because some people see so much value in the blockchain technology, but at the same time ignore its default and most valuable application in Bitcoin, while others seem to think Bitcoin in itself must be valuable without truly being useful on a larger scale.

no, no, no Bitcoin has inherent value. The ability to transact comes a distant second. Even if miners stopped mining and no one was using it, it would retain its value. All we need is enough nodes. /s

BU adoption is just a response from the market, that maybe, just maybe not everyone agrees that SegWit is a good idea - at least in its current form.
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:49:48
it's the assumption Bitcoin makes, period. It wouldn't even work without that assumption. Yet here we are discussing something without taking this into account. It is literally mind boggling.

Isn't Bitcoin based on this same premise? The risk is here, yet it works.
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:41:29
Let's for a moment discount everything else and just look at the amount of complexity of the two solutions. Would you still say SegWit is safer? Maybe I don't know what I am talking about, but I make good money developing mission critical software. You know, shit that makes me actually lose money if it breaks. Now I see an opinion of someone who has a lot riding on this, probably more than anyone else on this thread. Should I consider it as a reasonable opinion, or not?

It isn't particularly smart if everything else is scaling but bitcoin isn't.  This doesn't imply unlimited growth, just in case this isn't obvious.

@_date: 2017-02-21 16:12:22
That all depends on how far we get with Bitcoin... the network securing it already represents the most powerful supercomputer the world has ever seen. If Bitcoin is transacted and used widely enough it will be difficult to beat.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:11:42
Why no simply increase the block size limit without the associated risks? It's easier, less risky, more bandwidth efficient and requires less code to be changed.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:06:01
But why would you want to be on the minority chain as a miner? Just for fun? It will cost a lot of money to do so until difficulty is adjusted. There are coins to be mined and transaction fees to be had... but that's just a capitalists view, of course.
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:14:38
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. So far I haven't seen a single proponent of a blocksize **limit** increase against SegWit. Neither does argue against it. There is nothing to turn around. People aren't against what Core is doing, people are against what Core isn't doing. And again, no good answer as to why increasing the blocksize limit is an issue.

That is assuming that there will be a minority chain supported by any relevant number of users and miners. The market forces will be much stronger with this than with ETH/ETC though.

I'd say they have run into massive regulatory issues, or they have been hacked.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:59:23
Don't forget that almost 100% of people who are making the bigger block argument = centralization, are heavily for SegWit. Which ironically has the same purported centralization implications.

So why are you against the most efficient and safe form of scaling?
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:53:20
I don't think you will get a proper answer. There is a strong bias against miners here that completely ignores what miners do and why they do it.  It is so essential and obvious that it cannot be taken into account without completely invalidating their theories.

BU won't bring anything down. It is a purely market driven solution. It will either find economic support or not.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:27:24
It has been out for months now and those with the most at stake don't want it. Is there anything else? It really is that simple. The dynamics are difficult to understand and predict, but the outcome is simple. BU would have zero support if it wasn't for SegWit being a limited and overly complex pseudo solution to the scaling problem. The inherent complexity and incentive changes are simply not being accepted by the market. It is disheartening to see that some of the most influential core supporters and developers don't see this.
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:43:20
Of course, because I still have the same amount of RAM in my computer and the same bandwidth I had 10 years ago. The centralization argument is hypothetical, technological progress and the limit on the number of transactions are a fact.

It is laughable to claim that 1000's of lines of code are in any way a safe approach to a simple problem. Yes, it is a simple problem, 1MB isn't a magical number that can't be increased or the whole thing will break. It's stupid and disingenuous at best. And don't tell me I don't understand the complexities, because you can't explain them. I do develop mission critical code for a living and it's absolutely insane to claim that this is safer than the alternative.
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:09:14
yes, because a straight blocksize increase would definitely have killed bitcoin by now.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:54:08

I have yet to see a good argument that the way it's being deployed is more secure.

The key here is that miners don't mine in a bubble. Regardless of what the optimal size is, one must never forget that users will have an indirect influence on both price and fees.  Both values are ultimately derived from the overall utility of the network.

Was there need for consensus when there weren't enough transactions to hit the limit? It is new, because economically it has become a factor that will influence growth and fees.

Well, SegWit is by all definitions a convoluted and overly complex approach to scaling. It is both wasteful and risky. Its only redeeming quality being that it could potentially enable an offchain scaling solution. Unfortunately there is neither demand for such a solution nor is it able to compete with 3rd party trust solutions.

That is the best case scenario in the US, many merchants in Europe have to wait 14 days or more to get their settlement payment! A few minutes confirmation for a minimal fee on any size transaction is unbeatable.

Taking the thought of the bitcoin blockchain further upends everything a bank does and then some. Very difficult to think about when your livelihood depends on it.

Well, if he gets paid a decent chunk of money, why wouldn't he? Anybody can make up a theoretical legal case.  The same case can be made against Bitcoin core and probably by extension against Blockstream itself.
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:50:42
I'd join in... you'd still have to figure out the legality and any regulatory aspects. If you need coins, let me know.
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:30:17
But how exactly is this more power? The power you allude to is already what makes Bitcoin work. It doesn't work if you can't trust that miners will be greedy (aka do the right thing). This argument completely ignores the most fundamental economic incentives.

Can anybody here give us a rough idea when this will become usable (for end users), 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years? Just a best guess would be very useful.

Bitcoin does not fit the definition of a ponzi scheme. There are many valid criticisms of Bitcoin, but comparing it to a ponzi scheme is like saying that any speculative investment is a ponzi scheme.

You are making to much sense, please stop!

looks like someone is losing the argument... pathetic.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:31:40
Again... no reasonable counterargument.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:00:14
shh... the narrative is that we can't have bigger blocks under any circumstance!

I appreciate the ad-hominem! I guess when you can't make any reasonable arguments, that's all what's left, right?

Does SegWit use less resources, such as memory/storage and bandwidth?
EDIT: So from the answers below it seems pretty clear that SegWit isn't a scaling optimization, but rather something that might or might not address scaling in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:27:53
Absolutely. The wallet and the network will be all that is needed. Expect some great business opportunities on the way there though.

Sometimes things are unden ufe, sometimes they are what they look like.

Yes a less used, less capable network will be more censorship proof. This makes total sense! /s
Governments will only stop attacking Bitcoin if you can make it grow quickly enough to make it indispensable. If you don't have the guys with the guns on your side you will lose!


The way the blocksize capacity is increased via SegWit is the least prudent and unsafe way any experienced software developer could go about solving this problem.

That's if all of Bitcoins mined changed hand in one year! Gold's 'market cap' is more like $7T and titanium is probably substantially higher than $17B.

What we need is people who have at least a basic understanding of economic incentives and how markets work.

I believe there was an event where your current dollars became useless and had to be swapped for new dollars(TM). Same applied to many other currencies once they weren't backed by the magic shiny metal anymore. The ones that didn't partake lost all their money. Today one would have to call this a hard forked dollar!

Thanks for getting personal. Nowhere did I say that I didn't want the malleability issue fixed. Problem is, we are discussing the blocksize here and it was sold to us as a fix for this too. I just find it amusing that Core is selling this as the better way to scale, while it is measurably more risky and very ineffective considering the time and effort it will take. One really has to wonder what their end game is. You won't be delivered any scaling solution anytime soon. Meanwhile the markets will decide.
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:32:39
Your arguments might even hold some water, but you completely disqualify yourself with your attacks. Meanwhile, good luck with waiting for your non-existent scalability solutions.

Many don't care about SN. They are just regular hodlers who enjoy 100Mbps links at their grand parents house and who use LTE on remote Caribbean islands and the African bush.
@_date: 2016-07-21 17:48:35
and ad-hominem in 1, 2, 3.... sad that this is the only argument for not implementing a simple and safe method of scaling. Oh, let's instead implement hundreds of lines of new code, vs a proven and simple approach. I am sure that's a much better solution. What type of thought did you say was dangerous?
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:54:08
Same here... I just asked them to close my account and they were more than happy to do so. Whatever that might mean for the state of their business.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:13:35
No, let's improve our air traffic control system to handle more capacity by changing hundreds of lines of code instead of using a better CPU and more memory. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2016-07-25 13:20:02
This is a classic tactic to imply legitimacy.
@_date: 2016-07-27 12:17:10
Sometimes I feel like the bitcoin community has completely lost site of how markets and technological progress work. The current scaling roadmap (if there is any at all) completely ignores how quickly markets and technology develops. This isn't something one can fight with theoretical solutions that might be ideal in the long run. You can't fight the markets, you need to adapt. It is a core principle of an open and decentralized system. If you don't deliver what users want, they will find a better solution. Besides, there are no workable, alternatives. Lightning doesn't exist (and who knows if it even works) and SegWit will be too little, too late.
@_date: 2016-07-27 02:07:06
The better can? A can that infinitely more risky. No, the better can is the one that simply works and will also work in the future. A can we can safely predict will work now and in the future. If Bitcoin won't take advantage of the current infrastructure capacity, some other crypto will. This is how a free market works. Theoretical optimal solutions don't need to apply.
@_date: 2016-07-19 19:32:26
Well, e-mail had the decisive advantage of simply being able to use as much resources as there were available. Makes it a bit easier for mass adoption.
