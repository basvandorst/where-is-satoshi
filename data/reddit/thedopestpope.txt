Markets are going down. Bitcoin is just reacting.

You can try taking the stick out of your ass, that might help
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:25:20
Lol reddit is a joke

You are clueless about the real world

Please don't put your retirement in bitcoin "investing"
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:41:35
You're a fool and a bigot
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:46:01
Just like how the US Dollar is totally reliant on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:00:31
It probably would bring more stability, but you would still have to be crazy to put your life savings into it. I love aspects of bitcoin, but ultimately it is not a stable holder of value. No such thing as free money. The quick jump from $10k to $20k should have been a warning

What'chu mean is he fuckin dead!?

Once the Patriots lost to the Eagles it was clear the jews who run the NFL would sell off their massive Etherium stockpiles. That, in addition to Chinese fuckery, created the perfect storm which rocked the metaphorical boat. It's really all Tom Brady's fault
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:52:58
You're right, bitcoin remains a great currency. As an investment... well let's just say there's no such thing as free money

I'd like to thank the academy, uhhh my mom, Sparky my pet tarantula, and of course the little boy chained up in my basement. Couldn't have done it without them

So gay

I'm not that person who said that. Also it's not an Ad hominem if my only point is that he's a pretentious wanker.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:34:04
An ad hominem fallacy is a personal attack used in place of actual evidence to discredit someone's argument. I didnt say anthing about an argument. I just think the guys a wanker because he writes like a pretentious cunt. See the difference? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:59:35
I'll give you some investing advice, once your grandma starts talking about an investment, FUCKING SELL

lol everyone make way for this builder/doer. He bought bitcoin thus he's God's gift to man.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:14:11
Its true

So stupid
@_date: 2016-10-19 00:30:08
Clinton is more corrupt by far, actually taking money to make political decisions. Trump is arguably more incompetent and chaotic. Pick your poison I guess
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:36:04
MRW I trick millennials into losing money with memes
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:07:53
It's amazing how people like yourself blindly believe that with no proof. As long as something gets repeated enough times by the media, morons will assume it's true
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:03:39
Wikileaks didn't even publish Marvin's emails 
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:58:23

Satoshi is getting frisky. Watch the signs. Feel the market
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:35:24
Oh ok I guess in that case bitcoin will be worth $1 million. Seems logical to me
