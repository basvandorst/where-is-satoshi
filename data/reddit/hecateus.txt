Credit cards are still required to get airline tickets IIRC....  (haven't flown since 1995; and it was much better then given the horror stories I hear.)

In their defense, the among best tactics in dealing with terrorists, insurgencies, and other asymmetrical threats is to find and stop the money supply; which effectively stops the engineers and other technical specialists from doing their thing.
Am not so certain that that's whats really going on in this case; but it is close.

I don't want a Lambo...I want a working 'transorpation system' for everyone.  Ie I want a stateless corruption free currency for the world.

Fellow copier monkey here, 
also to clients, please stop leaving behind your:
Birth Certicates
Death Certificates
Marriage licensessses
credit cards
drivers lciensensnces
and so forthe.  There is only so much room in our back office safes for this crap.  We have access to industrial shredding support and aren't afraid to use it.

Does this include Sales Tax or such?  Here in California, ST is almost 10%.  That $140 is about %5.5 of $2,600.  And it begs the question: How much does PayPal deserve to compensated for it's service?

on the contrary...what the Fed wants consumers to do create Original Demand.  What BillyG and the Banks are doing is Demand Fulfillment.
Right now there is too much saved money being used for the later and not the former.  However Consumers just don't have the money or credit sitting around to do this function (nor save money).  BillyG and friends do have the money (they are savers), but aren't 'trained' by their lifestyle to Create Original Demand (in proportion to their commanded wealth).
And we lack the political capital to change this.
And so we are fucked.

I don't know if this answers your question, but [This Webcomic 'Escape From Terra']( might help to at least address things a bit.

It would be to his benefit to at least accept BitCoins for now for purposes of winning votes.
Sanders has left leanings certainly; however he has enemies among those who call themselves extreme-leftists.  He is on record as broadly being against gun control; and has made various statements against Authoritarian government behavior and legal-architecture.  Though it is not absolutely clear that he is truly anti-authoritarian in his brand of socialism.
Republicrat Corporatists however would love to continue to expand their Authoritarian club.  Bernie may not be the perfect anti-authoritarian, but he looks like the worthiest available outsider to me.

Even if they succeed, Germans will just barter with Brita Water Filters, or liters of beer.

I so do dislike the misuse of 'Liberal' and 'Conservative'.  The bill is 'Authoritarian', not the other two.

I ended up reading almost everything by Ayn Rand.  And then faced reality.  Also she tends to be overly wordy.  The works of hers I liked the best were Anthem and We the Living.

In 1984-85 I was 12-13, and in Middle School. aka 8th grade.  My parents got me a CompuAdd Intel 286 computer.  It had 256k of RAM! iirc a 120MB hard drive!
I would tear that thing apart and put it together again regularly to get the most out of it.
As an adult...I would say your BCMining machines and your report about it are ENTIRELY AGE APPROPRIATE.
edit: asking my mom about this...who is a retired teacher btw.  Unfortunately I no longer live in her basement, so response may take a while.

I read the Fountainhead around that age.  What a load of crap...read it anyway.
