I wanted to provide liquidity to the market, it keeps the price fair and helps others get coins.

People should learn never to trust other people is essentially what your saying. I think you have to put trust somewhere, I don't think bitcoin makes this decision any easier.

I'm very unlikely to put money into the ecosystem again but thanks for the advice. I also don't think it stands up to 'if everyone in the system behaved this way, would it be a better place'.

See. That 'served you right for trusting' is what has killed this community.

No but I don't start with the assumption that everyone I meet is a complete thief. The exchanges represented themselves as trustworthy entities.

Performing the role of a market maker, keeping the price reasonable for everyone. If nobody trusts and everyone hoards then the market doesn't exist.

For a little, and then it will collapse. Best of luck with it.

Watch what happens to the market if everyone hoards

Actually I saw them bail out another exchange and trying their hardest to do the right thing by their customers under the massive strain of new accounts.

Thanks for the tip though I think doge will go the same way as BC, as soon as it's worth something, it attracts the wrong people!

Yes. I'm more than happy to try something twice if I believe in it - I'm just saying I don't any more. I'd prefer to live in a world where I have a default belief in the honesty of others, it's just a better place.

That's the conclusion I came to as well, sadly I'm better off in the world of regulated finance, and that is why I'm so disappointed. The inefficiencies of having to individually verify everyone you transact with counteract a lot of the efficiency gains.

I'm not advocating a government or any other political / libertarian viewpoint though it seems like the human shortfalls plague both sides.

I totally agree. Anyone that thinks they should be in charge of other people, shouldn't be in charge of other people.
