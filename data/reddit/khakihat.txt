Ok. 
Just call me back when I can buy a $15 pizza for ~$15 worth of BTC.

Does it require you to be a part of an app, or will it take public addresses through QR codes?

My barber does this. It wouldn't be so sad if the shopping center wasn't already a makeshift homeless encampment.

Sell the shovels, not the gold.

There's a guy in town who straps his P.O. box to the back of his wheelchair. Sad, but a hell of a lot more secure.

We await your presentation with baited breath, Moses.

Don't let survivor bias get in the way of rational assessment. These people worked hard for their positions, but that does not translate to investment accumen.

And those who refsuse to trade in currency at all. ;3

PC Builders who want their hobby back want to kill Bitcoin.

Backed by dreams of block rewards and stock splits when Nvidia makes an ASIC aqusititon.
They're actually in a few other industries like autonomous driving and general AI. I think they'll be the big player in sicilicone processing until(if?) room temputute quantum becomes a thing

Tbh this would be the only Lambo I'd bother buying. 
My legs are too long and my waist is too fat anyways.

Aye, but beauty shows it's value over many years.

So your saying the price is acheving a stable rate of growth? 
Nice.

Anyone else read Whatever Happened to Penny Candy by Richard J. Maybury? Its a bit Alex Jones-ey, calling for return to gold standard and all, but it was my first introduction to the concept of the business cycle, the diffrent types of money, and why fiat is weak.

Plot twist: It was originally Ether, but was sprayed over by the vicious BTC gang.

If you understand Bitcoin, you don't need someone to tell you when to buy or sell.

Yeah, right after 3 pm. But reach for the back of the refrigerated case, the stuff on the front is yesterday's bean dip.
But for Bitcoin: now. And then next week. And a little more the week after. With all this volatility and lack of utility, It's all a crapshoot when the lowest dip will be achieved.

The true winners of gold rushes are always the shopkeeps and pamphlet peddlers.

Someone who wants to buy a pizza could just use a service like coin base. It's as easy as setting up a credit card, except they give you an app instead of a card. 
It's easy, but you lose a lot of control. Just as in fiat currency, control over your funds depends on education and continuing learning. Bitcoin is especially attractive because theroeticaly you can gain full control if you are diligent enough to manage your value yourself. 
You can't do that with fiat currency. You got to use cash or credit regulated by national and private banks who control cash value like monkeys playing pachinko. Even hard currency like gold struggles because you got to appraise and mint it before it becomes useful in trade. 
So it really depends. How much control do you want over your funds? Are you willing to run your own hardware wallet? Who will you exchange money with?
