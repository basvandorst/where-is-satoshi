Those aren't ETF's, they are mutual funds. If you go to Vanguard.com and punch in the symbol it will give you the whole detailed summary. They are the mutual funds which correspond to VTI. VTSAX is the "admiral" version of VTSMX, which has a lower expense ratio. The VTI Expense Ratio is approximately equal to VTSAX. If you buy and hold VTI it's functionally equivalent to the mutual fund except you buy and sell during the day when the market is open. Its price fluctuates all day like a stock (or coin). If you buy the mutual fund, the purchase happens at the close of business when the mutual fund's price is set. You pay what it is worth, not whatever people have gotten it to trade for. I personally prefer the mutual fund but there is nothing wrong with buying ETF's and holding them for the long-run. Just please, please, don't day-trade an index etf, or try to time the market. It's folly.

@_date: 2017-12-05 05:35:08
go to vanguard.com, open an account, you can buy a share of VTI for about $100. If you have 3k you can get VTSMX, 10k VTSAX

Because it has three more electrons. 
The color comes from the 5d to 6s orbital transition. there is 1 electron in the 6s orbital for gold. Pb's 6s has 2 and it also has 2 in the 6p orbital so there's nothing going on in the way of d-s transitions
Wikipedia has this cool stuff to say:
The human eye sees electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength near 600 nm as yellow. As is clear from the spectral reflectance curves for Au, the reason for seeing it yellow is that it is absorbing all the radiation not necessary for yellow and reflecting those wavelengths necessary to see yellow at an observer.
The electronic transition responsible for this absorption is a transition from the 5d to the 6s level. An analogous transition occurs in Ag but the relativistic effects are lower in Ag so while the 4d experiences some expansion and the 5s some contraction, the 4d-5s distance in Ag is still much greater than the 5d-6s distance in Au because the relativistic effects in Ag are smaller than those in Au. Thus, non-relativistic gold would be white. The relativistic effects are raising the 5d orbital and lowering the 6s orbital.[9]
A similar effect occurs in caesium metal, the heaviest of the alkali metals which can be collected in quantities sufficient to allow viewing. Whereas the other alkaline metals are silver-white, cesium metal has a distinctly golden hue.

Just for everyone's information:
I found BitPay to be very easy to use to complete our first BTC transaction.
The lag between issuing an invoice and being notified of payment was very short. The lag between payment and it being credited to our ledger was very short.
I will report back about the first settlement with our bank to say how seamless it is overall.
Thanks again for all of the interest.

My name is AuRelativity because gold is an amazing element!
Did you know that its nucleus is so heavy it exhibits relativistic effects?
What this means is - the heavy metals like silver, platinum, and gold are all actually 'supposed' to be the same silver color.
Gold is so heavy that exhibits relativistic effects - it slows down the light around the nucleus - making it the color of 'Gold'.
I learned this in Organometallic chemistry before I left grad school. One of the coolest natural phenomena I think. Gold is so neat.
