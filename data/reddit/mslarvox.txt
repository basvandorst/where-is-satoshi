I really hope you tell that teacher she is a complete moron tomorrow, and that she is just setting a bad example for all of her students by not accepting advancement of currency. Clearly if their is advancement in technology their will be advancement in currency, and how we receive and send currency also. Goodluck tomorrow!
Edit: Also you should let her know, that she isn't their to push her opinions on her students. She can give her students her opinion, but also should allow them to have their own. If she simply just pushes her own opinions on the students she is closing the door for them to learn on their own and to think outside of the box which is horrible as we only exist with the technology we do now because of people thinking outside of the box. Also let her know what a lot of things people use to think was Ponzi schemes, or think wasn't going to work is what has shaped us as a technological society now. I really think she has some learning of her own to do to be honest. V_V

In my honest opinion the worst place to go when I started using BTC was this subreddit. lol You guys are cool and all but other BTC subreddits were a lot nicer and more helpful. 
Even on this account I had asked a question about the future of bitcoin, and got a response saying "I'm not even going to respond why that idea is stupid" or something along those lines. It really is V_V lol

-hug- 
I hope to make up for you losing all your BTC, you win the lottery or something =[ my boyfriend told me to give you another -hug- on him.

I don't understand why they mock Bitcoin. Ignorant is what I'm guessing. A long time ago when someone in a teamspeak I was using brought up bitcoin I said that it sounded stupid and a waste of time, but now I'm loving it. Saving me money on fees also. Plus so much easier to work with.
and cause you're awesome from showing me the ways &lt;3  200 bits Edit: V_V I think I did that right but not showing up on my change tip. We will see.. if not I'll re-do it later. PFT really need to work on this. lol &lt;3

I have a question. I was reading up on bitcoin last night, and I read at that there will only be 21 million bitcoins made. Will the money for bits get higher or lower by then. Like right now a bitcoin is worth 300 dollars or something right? by then will a bitcoin only be like 20 dollars or will it be 500 you know what I'm saying? lol 
Also what are good ways to make bitcoins? All I've found so far is faucets which pay horrible, ad clicking sites which aren't that bad but you can only make some each day, and then farming bitcoins but I have no idea where to even start from that, plus I read it wasn't really worth it anymore. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:27:53
Why? I mean the more we use the internet, and the more stores start bringing the internet into their stores it's possible. It's a lot easier to use, transact, it would even be easier to get from jobs. Instead of having to go cash a check at the bank and them taking some, they could just send it to your bitcoin account. Idk was just thinking about it lol 
Edit: Idk much about bitcoin but I just found that it might be possible maybe 
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:54:15
Couldn't you call ebay for the shipping info, or paypal and let them know? You don't keep back ups of the shipping info. Sorry just wondering. But I agree paypal shouldn't be like this, and should have a lower date of when people can charge back.

I prefer to donate to education charities, charities that help build orphanages in war zones, water and food charities, stuff like that. I don't like to donate to business's except Wiki which I already donated to. Not that I don't think they deserve it, I just think there is other people who need more help if that makes sense. :p 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:32:06
Yeah I agree. And just starting bitcoin I've thought about it a lot, and it's honestly made me want to use it more just because I feel like later it might be even more used and it's important to understand it now. I kinda hope it is also, it's so much easier then regular cash, and paypal and stuff always take a fee but bitcoin wallets usually don't take any or that much. I kinda love it now lol 
@_date: 2014-12-06 14:16:20
Just use 10 dollars to play around with in my opinion. 10 dollars isn't that big of a deal. Also he is more likely to buy drugs with actual cash then bitcoin. I mean the guy that gives my boyfriend weed won't take bitcoin so... I mean I don't think he would anyways. Hmm I wonder..
Also don't you need to download TOR and go on onion sites to get drugs with bitcoin? V_V  lol 
OH and if she really has a problem with you guys learning with 10 dollars, then I really don't know what to tell you. Online currency regardless if it's bitcoin or another currency will eventually be used more as technology grows. It's cheaper and easier, don't have to bother waiting days for transactions, there's hardly any fees, it's more private, it's a great way to tip someone that you appreciate. I mean all around I've had a great time with it. I actually find it a bit more addicting then actual cash also. idk if that's a pro or con, but it's giving me a reason to work hard on making it.

He's saying that it's not possible. "No. And i'm not even gonna explain how unlikely it is. Use some common sense." Am I missing something? cause it seems logical to me if it starts to get more used in stores and multiple other places. Not saying the dollar will disappear but bitcoin could be used more. Am I completely wrong and off balance here cause in my head it seems logical but I'm not forsure because I just started using bitcoins like a week ago. But the way everyone talks about them and the more they are getting used I just thought.

I love Joe Rogan.. not because he supports weed, or any of that, but I straight up saw him put this fat feminist in her place. I just died laughing. I actually want to find that now.

I use Virwox. V_V 
@_date: 2014-12-06 14:27:03
They probably will hire someone that knows more about it to figure it out for them. I'm guessing it will then end up being sold or something along those lines. I'd guess. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:42:10
I'm not saying the dollar will disappear, as you would still need it clearly but what I mean is could it become more important than the dollar. If every place adapts to using the internet in stores, vending machines, markets and multiple other places where you can trade in bitcoin instead of cash, it would almost replace the dollar. Not saying the dollar would disappear but bitcoin could become more used is what I'm saying. Am I missing something cause it seems logical to me? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:01:44
Okay thank you! 
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:15:11
Bitcoin Wallet, virwox 
and I'm not confused I was just wondering what would happen if the let's say Virwox site got hacked what would happen to my bitcoin, do I get refunded stuff like that. It was answered below so I'm good now.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:38:43
Oh okay that makes more sense now tbh lol I wasn't thinking of it like that. How about the site I use to keep my bitcoin, if it gets hacked? Like do most sites refund, or if it's gone, it's gone forever? Is there any other way to safely keep my bitcoin? 
Sorry for the questions, I feel kinda of stupid now because of the comments but I really just want to know because I like bitcoin so far and plan on storing more of my money into it, because of how cheap and easy it is to transfer. I probably should read more about it, to find out what I don't already know to avoid these questions in the future lol

Does coinbase work in CA? I need a canada exchange wallet I guess you would say lol 
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:35:12
nuuu i like it, I just didn't know what to think of it, like should I be worried or what haha &lt;3 -.- meany!
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:54:36
Thanks for the detailed explanation. I'll look into keeping bitcoin offline and/or on my phone. I was mainly worried cause I keep some money on a wallet site or w/e and I was worried about it getting hacked and losing that money. Thank you though =D 
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:28:41
I mean what wallet should I sign him up on, coinbase or something like that? lol. 
Electrum is good? He just wants to when he gets the bitcoin to be able to transfer it to his bank in cash easily is all. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:42:45
I have bought some, I was just worried about the bitcoin that I did buy. I like bitcoin a lot and I'm glad I did, transaction fees are way less then anything (0 actually =D) and it's a lot faster. :p
