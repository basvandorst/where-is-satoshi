Just publish the longest chain so far minus 100 blocks and give it a few days for people to adopt?

Anyone could do it. It would be current block minus 100 blocks, which would be impossible to unroll, so anyone would have the same chain. And also, people don't have to trust it if they don't want to. They can still download older versions of UTXOs and get blocks from super nodes.

Publish the hash on several website. For example, today I could check point all blocks up to current block minus 100 blocks. That should be static and not subject to change. In case of super evil miner constructing an alt-chain 100 blocks backwards, we could still rely on the hash on websites. If ALL websites are compromised, then by the same token the attacker would've been able to intercept bitcoin traffics anyways.

Ha! I get it, it's funny because they said Bitcoin is anti-fragile yet people are trying to artificially protect it from hard forking. @_date: 2015-08-09 02:15:25
Nice, I will make sure to grab a copy next time I go spend $20 for special carrots that prevent cancer.

This is Hayek's Competing Currencies. It's finally happening. Nassim Taleb once said for Bitcoin to succeed it needs to be subject to stress, and this is what I have been waiting for. This is what will cause the next bubble, prepare to gain from the disorder, for all we know this might be the last chance to triple our wealth, get in now and enjoy the ride!

It's a joke referencing Fermat's last theorem.

Stop whining, this is why we have bitcoin so you can be your own bank. And using decentralized reputation system for credit checking such as keybase or open bazaar. Instead of trying to speculate on the market and make money without contributing to the society and crying when the bank refuse to deal with you which they certainly has the right to, perhaps you should focus on making a bitcoin service that solves the problem you are having!
