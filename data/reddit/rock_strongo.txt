Guys bitcoin is officially in the green again! (based on the last 24 hours).
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:25:09
I bought at 18.8k. I have been buying all the way down, and then I ran out of money at what I hope to god is the absolute bottom.
Oh well. As soon as I'm in the green it'll all feel inconsequential.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:27:15
Not as fun when you chose not to invest back then :(
Hope future ones will be more fun for me.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:22:37
This volume is pretty nuts. Has the potential for massive moves in either direction right now... I bought all the way down and as usual missed the real bottom cause I'm out of money. Just want it to spike a bit before I go to bed so I can sleep slightly easier.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:38:16
You can always lose that seed/get it stolen.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:19:59
Bah you can send from gdax to trezor for free? I just got done sending directly from Coinbase. I will never get that $1.87 back :(
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:40:41
Just wait until they release TwitCoin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:17:18
Not going to lie I could probably masturbate to completion to some big green candles right now.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:11:49
Depositing USD into Coinbase takes 4 days though, so you might miss out a dip if you do it this way (ask me how I know). Or you might end up better off.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:01:09
Average has been around 20-25k for the past week or so. This is the highest it has been in a while.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:21:24
Hmm, well I didn't say those things but I did those things...
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:41:19
The "catch" is that the price of BTC before the fork might end up being higher than the price of BTC+b2x after the fork, since it will take some time for everything to sort out and for you to be able to trade either again.
At least that is my understanding of it. I am no authority here.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:31:07
Just zoom out bro... if we're going to REALLY make money on this long term the difference between 5400 and 6k is nothing. This isn't a standard investment where you hope for 10% ROI. This is a whole different thing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:45:25
He got me interested in Bitcoin and made my first purchase at 4.2k because of him. I'm sure I'd have picked up on the craze at some point but who knows how much longer and how much money I'd have missed out on.
He might come across as a total slimeball but he's also pretty smart.
I totally get why everyone hates him though... meh.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:07:42
I'm sure some of the best players often bounce off of zero, but the most successful players are very careful with their stack. It's hard to go broke when you have a system in place to only risk a small % of your overall stack at any given time. Over time, a diligent player should be able to absorb a string of bad beats no problem.
The real issue is many poker players, though highly skilled at the game itself, are also gamblers and poor with their budgeting and money management skills.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:34:03
In the short term, markets are irrational. Over the long term, there are always corrections.
This is very similar to the .com bubble. Pets.com and other vaporware bullshit were mooning like crazy only to eventually crash hard and fast. 90% of these altcoins will do the same at some point. If you can time it and get out before then, more power to you.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:34:00
Name recognition, longevity, market cap, a dedicated community that's been involved for years, first mover advantage, pairings with every alt. Those are the biggest things.
Mostly I just don't see how bitcoin can be dethroned without it meaning really bad things for Crypto in general. At least not for the next few years.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:12:57
Wasn't expecting sage wisdom from this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:57:42
Can't wait til I've been in long enough to pull my initial investment and let the rest ride.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:20:46
If you got a good interest rate on your mortgage there's little reason to pay it off. There are lots of investments that can beat ~5% fairly easily.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:55:17
Well if the pattern repeats itself it'll rally for a while before they try again.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:52:34
Crypto to crypto being taxable is a pretty big annoyance. In my state I have very limited options for exchanges which allow fiat deposits (basically Coinbase or something super sketchy) which means every time I want to buy an alt I have to purchase some BTC then transfer to a different exchange and then buy with BTC. Basically extra taxable events for no reason. Grrrr.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:44:01
Squeezed in a quick buy at 151... wish I had bought a lot more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:42
Cause you can buy elsewhere for 3800 - why leave a buy in at 4300? It'll get even more insane if that delta increases in the next hour.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:25
My LTC limit order at 202 came through. Pretty stoked about that (at least at this moment, heh). It went back up to 262 almost instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:07:33
GDAX withdrawals are free no matter which wallet you withdraw to.
Either of those are good.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:52:40
Well that's good because I have been stocking up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:34:51
It's also "down" from an ATH it sustained for approximately 2 days after a massive run-up.
If you look even 2 weeks ago it is still up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:33:36


@_date: 2017-12-24 17:16:01
If by "gold rush" you mean throwing a small sum of money at Bitcoin and waiting to become a millionaire.. yeah that phase is probably over. If that's what you're looking for you're better off going all-in on an alt-coin. Bitcoin could go to 100k and unless you have a fairly significant investment in it you're not going to be rich (depending on your standards of the definition).
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:40:16
A lot can change in crypto prices in 4 (business) days. If you're interested in locking in at the current price it may be worth the fees. You might miss out on a 20% price surge just to avoid paying the ~1.5% in fees. Then again it could go down in that amount of time anyway. Basically - who knows ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:17
Can't you transfer to a different exchange and sell there? It's still at 3275 on Bittrex at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:05:50
Nah you are correct. If Coinbase didn't make it easy I might not have ever got involved. Or at least I would have been later to the party and missed a lot of gains. They may be a shittily run company but so far they've partially responsible for making me quite a bit of money so it's hard for me to hate on them too much.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:12
Well those orders got cleared anyway thankfully
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:38
Man I'm on the west coast and I casually checked gdax at 5am, then sprinted over to my computer to buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:12
"Update - All BCH markets will remain cleared and offline until 9am PST 12/20/17. At that time, BCH markets will enter post-only mode for a minimum of one hour to allow liquidity to be established. "
Welp I guess I can go to bed now at least...
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:09
"Update - Trading will be enabled on the BCH-USD order book at 11am PST. If significant volatility is observed, GDAX will pause trading."
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:51
No offense but I don't think very many people are placing their trades around its price in CAD.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:06
It's been longer than 4 hours now, but I'm not calling my doctor just yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:45
Way more buys than makes sense above 4k considering the price on other exchanges. I bet about half of them disappear when trading starts.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:33
First, get familiar with GDAX. It's the exchange owned by Coinbase (same company). You can transfer freely from Coinbase to GDAX, and GDAX is where you can trade.
The other benefit to GDAX which is not obvious at all if you are a newbie, is that you can withdraw your coins to a different address for free. Coinbase transfers will cost you a fee, and especially if you're transferring relatively small amounts, that fee can be quite high.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:08:54
If you have a low mortgage rate there's little reason to pay it off. Rates right now are just barely above inflation. You can beat 5% pretty easily with traditional investments.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:40:34
Because if it drops to 14.2 and then spikes back up he makes no money on the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:11:53
The fact that everyone is panicking and it's only down ~25% from an all time high, and still up significantly over the last month is actually nothing but encouraging.
I'm just buying more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:04
Sorry bro all my limit buys got triggered so we're going nowhere but up now!
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:13:34
Bears. Bulls. Battlestar Galactica.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:45
Or it shows that the market is volatile and it's just as likely to spike back up as it is to continue going down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:22
I like how he predicted 100k by new years but you're hung up on why he thinks 20k by tonight ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:55:27
Surprised how many people in the sell wall at ~4300 have kept their orders instead of just market selling. Only about 10% of that wall has either sold or been moved since trading was enabled.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:53:50
I would bet that 90% of the people who hold BTC don't even know who Roger Ver is.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:10
There's nothing wrong with trying to protect your wealth. Just make sure you're doing it legally.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:06
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:42:07
It’s pretty simple. If you are in it for the long haul you should either buy and hold or dollar cost average your way in over time. Which of these two approaches is better is impossible to say, but dollar cost averaging will be less likely that you got in at a “bad” time so if that’s a concern it’s worth considering.
If you’re trying to day trade buying at an ATH is probably unwise unless you really know what you’re doing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:51:40


Actually if you're dollar cost averaging and it's going down you're saving money VS going all-in and holding.
Of course it hardly matters if the downward trend continues indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:10
You wouldn't consider buying dips? When would you buy then? When it recovers?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:05
It'll go back up... the question is whether it'll dip again once they actually enable BCH trading.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:46:02
That sounds optimistic to me (cause it means I can buy a lot more)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:38
My 12.3 big buy never got triggered :( I hope the dip isn't over.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:19:47










If my dog divorces me I will be pretty upset.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:24:53
I know this is a joke but bitcoin and crypto in general is a terrible place to store money in the traditional sense. You put your paycheck in bitcoin and then go to buy groceries only to find out that bitcoin hit a 30% dip and now you can't afford them until it goes back up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:49
Well considering it's gone from $300 to $3000+ in a matter of months I wouldn't say he's COMPLETELY failing. Though I think this might be as high as the ratio will make it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:08:52
Bought at $18800 before all this BCH bullshit started. Bought more after it dipped to $15k. Will buy more if it dips further. These will all seem like cheap buys in a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:16:19
Right, I mean eventually you'll be paying the taxes either way, but by spending the BTC you're most likely paying short term capital gains (assuming USA) instead of long term - plus it's a lot more paperwork to track, assuming you actually plan on paying the taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:49
Many of the altcoin prices ebb and flow roughly in line with Bitcoin so if you're buying them with Bitcoin anyway the fact that it has dipped might not matter. Buy them based on the ratio between the two.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:06
It's not allowed to crash 80% until I'm up enough to absorb that hit and still have my principal.
At this rate that will only be a few more months :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:29:20
What if he's not american?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:04
It's been time to buy for a while now. I'm running out of money.
Keeping a stash ready in case it REALLY bottoms out.. wherever that may be.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:38
$8500 is not a real price. Nothing is selling at that price because trading is disabled for now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:56:34
engagement in business transactions involving considerable risk but offering the chance of large gains, especially trading in commodities, stocks, etc., in the hope of profit from changes in the market price.
Why use another word when a perfect one already exists.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:37
I can't believe people are actually placing buy orders at 2.5x what they could buy for on other exchanges... either these are false buys or just people who have no idea what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:16:27
What if you want to hold what you have but also buy dips?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:11:21
I've been buying all the way down. It hasn't triggered my biggest buys yet but I'm considering a few more panic buys before it spikes again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:00:45
If they market sold immediately they could have got about 4k for them... now down to 3.4 and falling still. Not to say it couldn't bounce around in that range for a while but yeah I can't imagine it's going to hit that sell wall again anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:01:10
You should put 2 spaces between your items because reddit formatting is weird.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:01:10


I didn't sell, therefore I lost nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:42
Alright I'm pretty much tapped out on buying power now. Bitcoin you can go back up now. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:14
Credit card purchases lock in your price when you buy though (at least on Coinbase).
Unless you're talking about people who are direct depositing from the bank which is a 4 day wait (again, using Coinbase).
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:09:43
Gotta buy that sweet 4300-&gt;3400 dip.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:55:36
As usual they will go after the whales first and the little guys maybe never... but the risk of a random audit is always looming. I got audited (nothing to do with Crypto) and technically even though I was correct and the IRS was wrong it took me 3 years and lots of lawyer fees to get the money I was owed.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:34:17
Well if you buy on Coinbase it'll lock in your price but also you won't have access to the coins right away. Basically they are "reserving" them for you but they still have to wait for your money to come through. Once the purchase is complete after a few days you can either sell them on Coinbase and pay fees (there is no real reason to do this) or transfer them to GDAX where you can trade instantly and for free with limit orders.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:08:10
Oh jeez, yeah that sucks. I just looked at my phone and I didn't get it either. Though I have been actively watching these charts all morning anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:58
"Update - All BCH markets are now in post-only mode and will remain in post-only for at least 60 minutes. New maker orders may be placed but no matches will occur. "
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:17:57
annnnnd it's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:58:24
I believe it can store more than that (not sure there's a limit to how many it can hold) but you can only have the wallet app for a certain # installed. I believe it's 4 or 5. So you can have a bunch of alt coins on there but it'll be somewhat of a pain to access more than 5 at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:43:58
10% off barely qualifies as a sale.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:54:44
Well to be fair he said "almost all" - there are like 900 altcoins right now? Even if 100 of them end up being successful (insanely unlikely) it's still true that almost all of them are trash.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:55:23
Currently - Fees and transaction times.
In the future? Nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:28:42
Wait so do you have a bunch or not?
If so I think you might be my long lost brother/sister.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:49:20
The whole point of a passphrase is that it's not stored with the seed. Otherwise it's basically a 25 word seed instead of a 24, and is not providing you any extra security.
I guess you could buy a second one and put the passphrase on that, assuming passphrase is all alphanumeric.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:27
Transfer to GDAX (it's free) and then withdraw from there (also free).
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:49:25
Tighter regulation = more institutional money = price goes up. Just a matter of when.

Eventually what people say the most becomes grammatically correct though.
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:39:55


I will move my coins to a federally insured bank as soon as I possibly can. I really hate being responsible for my own security - and the more my crypto is worth the more paranoid I will get about it.

Gather around young ones and let me tell you about the time I panic sold my Bitcoin for only a 30% loss....
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:31:56
So you're going to put some of your profit from BTC in BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:45:39
Yeah "support" is meaningless. People add and pull large orders constantly.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:33:17
GDAX takes 4+ days to transfer money in though, so you have to plan ahead. Plus who knows where the price will be at that point.
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:13:43
It was definitely my 0.03 BTC buy that kept us above 8k. You're all welcome.
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:01:11

Wow that's about the most nonsensical argument I've seen in a while.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:39:03

Amazing insight.
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:50:10
I tell myself that I'll sell some next time I'm in the green... but deep down I know there's little likelihood I will follow through. I'm in this til 100k or 0.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:33:24
GDAX (AKA Coinbase Pro) needs to up their minimum trade size. This spam is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:58:15
Well by default Coinbase lets you withdraw 10k a day, plus you can apply for a higher limit.
So 15 days to fully cash out, then again in 15 days who knows where BTC will be at, so maybe sooner/later than that.
Of that 150k, he'll have to pay capital gains tax of 15%.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:04:42
I expect to hold until BTC goes to zero or plateaus for a long period of time (~3 years of no more than +10% per year). What the price will be by that time I have no clue.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:25
If you have enough that you're worried how people react when you tell them how many you have... then congrats :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:25:24
and then it dips JUST close enough to your limit order that you're like "fuck it this might be the bottom" and you buy... and then it drops another couple hundred.
Or is that just me? :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:15:25
Is there tax on the purchase as well (assuming USA)?
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:19:19
I kinda hope your life savings isn't that much... but good luck. I'm resisting the urge to do the same cause I'm not sure I could sleep very well with my life savings in a single asset, even one I believe is going up for the foreseeable future.

Not an apt comparison as you cannot own a fraction of a lambo (well you CAN but...)
Owning "1" bitcoin is a completely arbitrary value.

Just wait a few years and then your .1 BTC will easily be able to buy you several statues.

I have a Trezor with about $9k total on it but I'm terrified that I'm going to lose the seed, have it stolen, or otherwise fuck myself. I'm seriously considering just moving it all to CB vault.
I know the whole point of bitcoin is that you control your own coins and all that... but I'm beginning to think other people may be more trustworthy than myself with them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:12:09


I think the market right now is too niche for that to be worth the dentists' time. I mean if you REALLY want to be known as that trailblazer then sure it could be decent marketing, but I wouldn't expect it to make an impact on their business right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:34:56
A few months? That's an eternity in the current Cyrpto space. I really doubt that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:24:07
Ah I thought you meant you bought into the FUD which made you buy BCH and that you bought in early enough to still be up.
I understand what you mean now. Yeah that sucks but hopefully a fairly inexpensive lesson for you. I know I've learned my share of those.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:36:11
Just move the decimal point over 2 places. Problem solved!
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:15:21
The difference between buying $200 worth at 6k and at 10k is $80.
You are essentially saying you would fuck your own face for $80.
I bet you could arrange this outside of bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:38:54
Asking seriously: what would be the point of that for me as the patient?
Also follow-up question with the fluctuation of the market, how would the price be set by the dentist? Would it be whatever the BTC/USD rate is at the time you went to pay the $800 bill?
My girlfriend also works at a dentist office and I doubt even 1% of their patients would have even the capacity to pay with BTC, much less the desire. It just seems too early for it to really matter.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:26:22
It is unwatchable. It makes me actually angry.
Sure there are worse shows out there, but when I think about how much money they are making off this complete garbage it is mind-blowing.

How did they cost you money if you're up overall?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:35:28

If the night finishes at $15 I am liquidating every asset I own to purchase more.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:07:39
When it went from 7800 to 5500 that wasn't enough for you?
I had the opposite problem and kept buying all the way down until I ran out of money by the time it REALLY hit bottom :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:34:19
Hey to be fair, future of money != present of money.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:41:45
I actually have no idea how to buy gold...
I'd google it but I don't want to help reverse the curves on that graph.
Then again I have no desire to buy gold.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:11:42
So let me get this straight... you want to help save people money short term by betting against them, therefore taking more of their money if you are correct.
That said I would take your bet in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:44:17
Without doing any research I assumed BTC was like a stock and you had to buy a whole one to own any. Granted all it takes is a google search to fix that, but when you're talking barrier to entry ANY reduction helps.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:02:20
Thanks I'll check this out come tax time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:20:10
Can confirm. Jumped on at $30 and it's now at $52. I think it can go even higher but it's tempting to just cash out those gains.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:26:19
Regardless, the transactions should still be there showing that he gambled away whatever he bought in. So the current price is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:50:16
The ultimate irony is that eventually you'll be able to buy a Fiat with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:37:09
So you pay a short term capital gains on everything you buy then?
That sounds kinda expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:31:27
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:51:31
You can already cash your Bitcoin in for "real" money whenever you want. Unless something catastrophic happens this will continue to be the case indefinitely.
In addition, more and more businesses are accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. Unless this trend reverses, there will be many options for what to do with your Bitcoin as it continues to increase in value (assuming it does).
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:36:19
It's currently 8180. I know people have different qualifications but -2.25% does not qualify as a dip to me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:46:25
Dude I literally said I can only be so erect, are you trying to hospitalize me?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:58:20
Wait how do you know me?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:44:23
Yeah it's all relative (still can't come close to affording a house though, so I am renting).
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:31:36
I think this needs to be the  bullet point of any article explaining bitcoin to newbies, especially as the price continues to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:02:35


That's a 2.5% increase from where it is now. Bold call :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:02:31
Same here man... the 2 weeks between my paychecks is too damn long!
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:48:58


What? The price has gone up 74% in the past month and it's showing no signs of slowing down. How is the investment phase over?
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:15:07


If I can buy it for $8k and sell it for $20k in the future it has a fuckton of value to me.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:50:45
Same here! but not on purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:31:20
It rallies as soon as I split 50% of my BTC into altcoins. FML. Could have hundreds/thousands more dollars right now :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:57:30


Well that's one fucking hell of an understatement. Especially in a 2 year period.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:28:04
So in anticipation of panic sellers you're worried about a major crash and suggesting everyone sells?
Sounds like a self fulfilling prophecy.
I will continue to hold and buy more if/when it crashes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:33:40
I keep buying, hoping it will be the bottom. So far I'm 0 for 8. It's OK though as long as it rebounds.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:19:54


Considering the ~10% difference in price - isn't it basically free money to do this? What's the catch?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:46:48
Problem is buying more either means fees or a 4 day wait period in which the price of BTC could fluctuate dramatically.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:29:01
I'm actually physically in pain thinking about the opportunity this guy squandered.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:15:55
Seriously... $4800 for a chance at $400k. I would take that bet without talking to a rep. Hell you can always talk to one afterward if it doesn't work and at least get a refund.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:15:54


It's only late compared to right now. In the long run you are still in early (at least that's what I tell myself).
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:41:00
Can confirm. Learned the hard way multiple times. Still hasn't sunk in yet.
The feeling of breaking even investing in something that is up 100% in the past month is a really, really shitty feeling.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:25:18
but investments are not the lottery... that's the whole point. Average Americans do not want to invest in something that is super volatile, they want to invest in something with steady growth. As BTC continues to get more and more stable it's only going to attract more "average" Americans IMO.
I get your point that people can't throw a few hundred bucks into BTC and become millionaires anymore - but it was never the average American who was doing that. It was gamblers/people interested in the tech/early adopters.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:47:35
damn... this is great perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:12:46
Coinbase stores all your transactions. Just download them all and save them in case of an audit. I'd imagine for that low of stakes ($250) you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:31:07


That would be a nice feeling. Hopefully that will be me someday.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:51:01
As someone who put 10k in recently... I'm prepared to lose it all but hoping for the best. In some ways it's like playing a lottery but with actual hope of winning.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:14:00


Wait this is considered a taxable event? Fuck me...
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:49:05
If you do sell, make sure you don't sell ALL your BTC. You would regret that if it hits 50k in the next year or two.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:08:35
Maybe I won't have to wait too long then :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:43:23
I'm ready for the signs of the next pump so I can ride it for a bit and then get off with some easy profits. I will not hold for any amount of time, but if other people are spending lots of money to pump it going along for the ride for a little while isn't a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:35:57
My strategy next time there's an obvious pump and dump and I'm paying attention enough to notice is to buy in with a small amount of my BTC and then ride it, selling all the way up. If it ever drops down below where the pump started, just convert it all back to BTC. That way at most I'd lose 5%, and could be good gains.
Wish I had done that this time.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:18:22
Congrats. I really wish I had taken the time to research this sooner... here's to hoping I'm still early enough to see those types of gains!
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:39:53
This has already been happening.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:05:36


This is 100% true for me as well. Without my bills I would be a total lazy POS. Being unemployed (aka semi-retired) is fun for a short amount of time but after a while I start to feel my sense of worth really plummet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:54:00
I'm trying to figure that out myself... for this latest PnD if I were following this subreddit closer I'm pretty sure it would have been timely enough to hop on for some profits.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:36:59
If you just commit to not ever selling your BTC, you will win over the long run so long as you believe that ultimately BTC will be worth much more than it is today. Assuming you believe that and it holds true, then you win either way (if it dips, you buy more, if it goes up, your BTC is worth more).
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:09:59
Not all work is slavery. Believe it or not some people actually enjoy what they do for a living.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:54:57
Personally I'd buy at $7249, then it will likely  go up so put a sell in at $7356, then you can buy back in when it dips down to $7314. Just keep repeating this process until you have no BTC left, then buy back in.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:06:03
This post is ironic given your username.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:47:55
Search for wallet.dat on your PC (assuming you still have access) and search your email for "mine" "bit" and "coin".

What does "when market opens" mean for a market that is 24/7?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:51:08


Oh well if SOMEONE said it, it must be true :)

Your analogy is bad and you should feel bad.

The same number of bitcoin but not the same % of the marketshare.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:18:31
You can always email your passphrase to yourself, disguised as something totally innocuous. Before everyone jumps down my throat here... it's no less secure than not having a passphrase at all and would require someone to have both your seed AND access to your email in order to steal your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:05:16
If you're really unsure and you want to invest... hedge yourself by investing in both BTC and BCC.
Ultimately though no one here cares what you do. Certainly not enough to make a case for you. Do the research yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:50:04


You just sell small amounts all the way up. Don't try to identify the peak. And then when it starts falling you sell whatever is left.
As long as you don't hold it when it drops below where you started seems fairly safe.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:23:30
The higher it goes the more media coverage it will get, which will lead to FOMO and therefore higher prices. This will continue for quite some time I believe. There's no reason that $10k is any sort of barrier.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:50:14
I don't think it's gonna crash too hard because there are LOTS of people like myself who have pretty big FOMO due to not being ready before the latest surge who are itching to throw more in during the next crash.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:47:05
Because it's entertainment, not financial advice. Also most of the people watching are even less informed than the reporters.
That said... that video was painful to watch, holy shit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:08:14
Tried to buy the floor of the dip several times, but it kept dropping. By the time it was actually the floor I was out of money.
Sigh... I'll try again after next paycheck.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:20:15


That's... not how it works.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:20:13
You just got the "bank error in your favor" card IRL. Congrats.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:20
You are 19. The amount of money you have saved is likely not life changing long-term unless it’s coming from an inheritance or something. Honestly I’d invest it in BTC and try to forget about it. Accept the fact that you could lose it all but DO NOT panic sell for any reason. If BTC goes to 0 (highly unlikely) then so be it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:28:18
I would kill for a 3 bedroom at $350k. That doesn't even get you a shack in the Seattle area.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:53:38
but if you gambled them away, legally or no, then as far as the IRS is concerned you still hold them and they are unrealized gains (and thus not taxable) - unless I'm missing something.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:07:07
but timezones are different all over the globe... so I fail to see how there's a single "market open" time.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:04:06
Would you be OK if you lost your whole savings? If so, go for it. If not... then you're being foolish. Doesn't mean it won't end up working out for you though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:17:42
There's a difference between selling any and selling all. I don't intend to ever do the latter unless there's a 100% chance it's going to zero.
For such a speculative investment I don't see why people don't keep at least some skin in the game even when they sell to avoid these types of situations.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:31:08
FOMO can grant you temporary gains but will ultimately cost you $$. Emotionless holding will win in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:21:42
Buying stuff with BTC is still taxable, so you'd still owe taxes on the BTC purchases based on your buy-in cost.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:28:15
The further it slips the more money you're making on what you have already. Would you rather have 1 bitcoin worth $5000 or 0.5 bitcoin worth $15000?
If you said the former instead of the latter you're being emotional and not logical.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:18:59
All of your examples go well beyond the core function of Bitcoin though which is simply to store wealth and complete simple transactions.
I agree that we have a long ways to go before the average Joe is ready to handle Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean it will remain this way forever. There is big money to be made in bringing Bitcoin to the masses. In some ways it's already begun, look at how easy it is to use Coinbase.
