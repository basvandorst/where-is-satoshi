[here's]( my recent interaction with this fool, 3 days later he has still not replied, probably hoping that it gets buried.
u/cryptolution usually deletes his posts when someone bothers to call out his bullshit so make sure you copy them in.
ps, one of the very important things that you can do with lrgr blcks is consolidate unspent transactions, reducing the bloat of UTXO set, one of the main issues that Segregated Witness was supposed to address.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:52:18


No that's not what you originally said, you are now trying to  wriggle out of it 
Cryptolution was using quotes from Adam and Szabo that Bitcoins **protocol** cannot scale onchain, I implied that he had missed out quotes from **self evidently** the most competent person in the field.
please learn the difference between architecture and actual implementation, though I suspect you know the difference, you just wanted to double down on your risible SN was "as incompetent as it gets" quote. heh heh

this guy is a fool, 


[sustained 2000 tps]( has been achieved on a 4 Core i7 with 16GB ram and solid state hard drive.
does this prove the network could handle this, No
But it does prove that ram and cpu are not the bottleneck as this guy would have you believe.
the rest is even more bullshit, but make up your own mind.

Says a nobody on reddit about the guy who single handedly came up with one of the most important inventions of the era. 
and your reasoning for this....


you are no different than the people who said Byzantine General Problem had no solution so decentralized money was not worth working on, until someone found a probabilistic solution, our incompetent protocol dev SN.
Every user running a fully validating node doesn't scale, 
* fortunately not everybody needs to run a fully validating node. SPV to the rescue.
guess who came up with that one!
but let's take your comment at face value


funny you should mention network flood filling, now how does current mesh LN route finding work again?

and your the guy calling SN incompetent. i give up
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:58:49
thanks, important points, can i add
it's **much easier** to ban something that is relatively small and not usable as a currency (a few 10's of millions of users *maybe* and we have $30+ median fees source: Dec runup to 20k ballpark estimate)
Just shut down the on and off ramps to fiat, if you can't cash out nor use the token then your store of value is gone.
now why would ordinary people run a node? when they cannot use the system
most people didn't run a full participating node when they could use the system with &lt; 5cent fees.
I have a 250 dollar laptop 16GB ram that uses ~10w , this could handle 10MB blocks today probably more.
participating node = one with open ports not a the 9/10 leeching nodes that add nothing to the system as a whole
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:53:15


You are accusing Bitcoin's Creator of being "as incompetent as it gets" and you can't even spell, heh heh
you lot are unbelievable. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:18:34
should you expect to be running a node on a raspberry pi? why not a TRS80? 
does it make sense to have a network where median fee for a transaction costs nearly as much as buying a full node?
now this guy u/Cryptolution has written extensively on the topic of RAM being the problem, heh heh
lets put it into perspective,
as a non mining node you have on average ~10mins to verify the block / incoming transactions. 
what sort of "memory store" do you need to accomplish this, 
with 1MB blocks that's ~**3** look ups in the UTXO set
a 2016 [64GB SD]( card could comfortably do this.
never mind a modern NVMe 3 Giga Bytes per second 15,000 IOPS (QD1) OR 300,000 (QD32) that can be had for $300 in sizes of 256GB 
That supports a UTXO set 60 times bigger than we currently have.
are these figures exact, NO
but they are back of the envelope accurate. don't take my word for it, think for yourself.
now if you are a mining node things may well be different you would want to verify as fast as possible, but then you have probably invested 10's of millions of dollars into hardware so a few thousand dollars for RAM might be justified don't you think.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:49:22


true, but it takes something special to put them together, see Einstein - special relativity, in fact the whole 1905 paper. next you will be calling him incompetent for adding in a cosmological constant into GR.


Bitcoin is predicated on "the majority of the miners" not making transactions up out of thin air, if you are not happy with this then you should probably, go buy some Gold and hide it under your bed.
there are always tradeoffs in the real world. SPV is fine.


not convinced every tx changes the state of the network, paths become blocked etc, very dependent on average number of hops per tx. 
* bandwidth wise every node involved in a tx having to update the **entire network** as to its state, scales far worse than, a subset of the network keeping track of every tx that occurs, not to mention what happens when a node joins or leaves the lightning network.
if you have a better solution I am all ears.
hub model doesn't have this problem though, so will probably ultimately work like this. ( I am not against LN even with hubs just against idiocy of not scaling onchain even a little).


now you are showing your bias, can i remind you of 


just replace Bitcoin with LN.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:18:59
Nobody said he was a hotshot perfect bean counting never missing an off by one coder, 
The fact that you quote this to bolster your argument that SN was 


He **succeeded** where all the other cypherpunks , Adam Back, Nick Szabo etc failed.
ooh look we are back where you came in.
The fact that you think missing "off by one errors" in a field that is clearly not his speciality (probably an amateur) when he puts together the edifice that is Bitcoin demonstrates to me how small you are.

this guy doubles down on his stupidity, 
* earlier he says Satoshi did not have forward vision because he advocated miners will be in big server farms (VPs's)
* then he says **we have found the solution** to the dissemination of blocks in the **Fibre network** (after I had reminded him of how the network actually works), but wait for it: **guess where Fibre nodes are hosted** frickin  **VPs's**
you can't make this up.
if his understanding and logic can be this contradictory about something so straightforward.
imagine how far off he is with more subtle issues, that he pretends he knows something about.
though in fairness he has made the odd good point (i remember being surprised a few times) 
generally be skeptical, as you should with every post, dig a little it's worth it.


unfortunately for Cryptolution it is all factual and easily verifiable, see [Fibre fibre how-to]( about half way down.
disclaimer being a big-ass blocker I am all for the fibre network (thanks Matt), in fact pro anything that helps scaling
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:34:02
have a think about the fact that the median fee to send 1 transaction currently costs [$25]( 
so to send 2 payments costs more than buying a full node [raspberry pi](
you could buy a full node but not be able to use the network. what a joke

Lightning Network
* unknown arrival date, maybe never (in true p2p incarnation, ie no superhubs), still massive unsolved problems in routing.
* people have to lock up significant funds in a HOT WALLET, they are going to charge you significantly for the risk they (as a hub) are taking.
* if your LN node crashes and loses data better hope the other party is honest and happy to not defraud you. LN is stateful.


in 2017 Jan to May [median tx VALUE]( was over $100 and from May onwards it was over $400. LN is not going to replace these tx's any time soon. 
this is what Rusty Russel Blockstreams LN guy has to [say](


I leave it to the reader to decide what constitutes a large payment


when that doesn't work someone will come up with a layer between the layer between LN and main chain.
all wishful thinking when we have a solution today for today's problem. 
hopefully in the future 2nd layers will make all the difference. but unfortunately not today.

@_date: 2017-08-09 18:32:31


the bit that you are missing is if the main chain is constrained at 1MB in order to push people onto LN then $10 fees are in fact caused by the the constraint and hence by the "need" to get people to use LN.

now think critically about what you are being told (including me)
keep in mind **if you don't own the private key - its not your Bitcoin**


the owner of this sub in early 2016 [stated]( 


now what happened when we hit $50 average fees December 2017? 
I hope Bitcoin can hardfork and increase the blocksize but in the light of this sentiment [why hard forks are altcoins]( from a highly respected member of the BTC technical community, i wouldn't hold my breath.


that's 100 tx/s on the Rootstock Sidechain, have a think whether that helps you opening your Lightning Network channel?
especially in the light of...
The Federation model in RSK consists of semi-trusted third parties (STTPs) who are the members responsible for securing the locked funds. [what is rootstock](


maybe this is realistic, so down to 6 years to onboard everyone with **NO OTHER ONCHAIN TX'S happening** hopefully you don't have to close your channel or you might get bitten by a LARGE onchain fee!
In all the scenarios that people present to you think whether **you and only you** control the private key to the **underlying asset**, this is the central issue with all scaling and why Blocksize is important and why **LN Scales Transactions NOT Users.**
how much are you going to keep in your LN channel? - remember it's a hot wallet - running on a computer that is always attached to the internet by necessity. 
LN will have it's place, does it solve scaling....
more realistic is probably Bitcoin Backed Banks, see [Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist](
Possible short term scaling solution:- Buy Bitcoin on something like Coinbase leave it there, use their Bitcoin backed Debit Card, they settle with other "Bitcoin Banks" over the LN.

Ledger has remote attestation. [link]( proof that it is genuine and the reason I bought 2 and one of them from someone I had just met. I also have a Trezor which I am happy with as well.
remote attestation  goes something like this 
* nano gets plugged in.
* remote server via chrome extension asks secure element to sign msg proving it has ledger private key, any update of secure element would delete ledger private key ( i believe )
* Remote Ledger server via chrome extension would warn if signing fails -&gt; tampered with.
* you then choose a user application on nano say "Bitcoin wallet" and secure element checks to see if this has been tampered with when loading, giving error on device  if it does not match previous signed code.
remote attestation blew me away, I had planned not to buy a Ledger product as they are very much aligned with Core and hence in my opinion against onchain scaling. but this and FIDO U2F, got me, best product wins. ( I say this to point out how good I think nano s is, not to make a point on blocksize )
Thanks u/btchip a great product, please point out any errors and I will fix them, does remote attestation work when using Mycelium / FIDO U2F, or do you have to use chrome extenision first to be sure?
edit, Ledger does not seem to connect to chrome extension until Bitcoin wallet is launched though it may be connecting in background.

Like PoW, Reddit Comments speak for themselves! Their value is inherent, available for all to see and to verify easily.
I really don't think he understands PoW as the basis for Bitcoin, hence why his main objection to UASF is lack of replay protection.
You can only bang your head against the wall so long.
edit. interestingly his last post equally applies to himself from my (perhaps your) point of view though I don't think he can see it. He may even be correct and I am incapable of seeing it, this is the asymmetry in our points of view though he is sure he is right and you and I are idiots for not agreeing.

We will find out in the next few months! Humble Pie time.

Reading through your comments, you seem to believe that anyone who disagrees with you is stupid.


Are you calling Jihan Stupid?


Please point out these actions. He is one of the prime movers in Segwit2x keeping his word with HK 1.0 even after luke took the piss with the 300kb fork.


Your quite vocal, and you typically belittle people when they don't agree with you. I have upvoted a number of your comments when you have called for the community to come together pre UASF. You have in the past argued against a hard fork as it would split the network, but now you run a UASF node which also will split the network, its ok to split the network if you are not getting what you want, very hypocritical. 
Have you ever upvoted any obvious big blocker? though most of the knowledgeable ones don't frequent here, I know you like the down vote button (that's usually how I know you have read my comment) 
If you make bold statements or make an error while talking down to someone less knowledgeable than yourself, expect to be called out.
Best luck to us all in coming months.

Your comprehension is limited as well!






The comment on you running a UASF node was in reply to you talking about MOB RULE.
Seriously kid in the light of all this have a long think as to whether you have the mental capacity to understand bitcoin, and in the future comment accordingly.

There is no point in replying to u/CryptFOOLution he's just a useful fool.
Just point out the bs that he spouts to others that interact with him.


Look through his posts (though its not really worth it), they are littered with them!

You do realize that implementing replay attack protection turns BIP148 chain into a true Alt Coin!
It undermines all the incentives built into Bitcoin. source see The Whitepaper.

You Jammy B...... You timed that perfectly, will done, I nearly went the other way due to FOMO'ing at the mouth.
