I don't think so. When David Micha says "we" in that quote, he's referring to Radio Corporation of America as a whole. In Nakamoto's statement to Reuters, he says "I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on cryptography," so unless he's lying, I assume his work at RCA didn't involve the portions dealing with cryptography.
Anyway, mind if I try the analogy approach? You're probably the most incredulous reader of the article, so it's helpful for my own persuasive writing if we debate this a bit more.
The real issue with this situation, and I believe the reason Newsweek has felt safe thus far not retracting their story, is because it is *very* difficult to prove a negative.
Imagine two (admittedly absurd) hypotheticals that must be proven:
1. Prove that I know the ancient language of Sanskrit.
2. Prove that I *don't* know the ancient language of Sanskrit.
The first is easily provable. Find something I wrote that contains Sanskrit, and it's proven. If you can't find a source, then it becomes more challenging, but with a source the act of proving it is clear-cut.
However, the second is much more difficult to prove. An investigation would probably go something like this:
* **Start with pure assumption.** No one knows Sanskrit except possibly history academics, which you know I'm not. So you're already 50% confident in the premise that I don't know Sanskrit. But that's baseless, and anything is possible. You need to dig more.
* **Read everything I've ever written, and find no Sanskrit.** Now you're 60% convinced I don't know Sanskrit. It was already unlikely due to the obscurity of the language, *and* there's no evidence of me having written in it. But it's still possible I've just never written it down in any permanent sources, so the investigation continues.
* **Interview all my friends, who confirm they've never seen me read, write or speak Sanskrit.** Great, so now if I know Sanskrit, I would have to have learned it in secret and never revealed it to any friends. You're gaining confidence – perhaps you're 90% sure.
* **Research my undergraduate background, and discover my university didn't even have a Sanskrit course.** This eliminates an academic route where I might have learned it, and now you're 95% sure. But, hell, there's still a 5% chance that I learned it from a library book, right?
* **NSA request on every library book I've ever checked out.** Nothing involving Sanskrit. Now you're 99% sure. But...I could've learned it *at* the library, without checking out a book.
...and so on. At some point, the possibility that I know Sanskrit becomes absurdly unlikely, but it's never 100%. It's at this point that you could offer two possibilities:
* I learned Sanskrit secretly, without any evidence of taking a class or reading a Sanskrit book, and never told any of my friends about it nor ever wrote it down.
* I don't know Sanskrit.
Everyone must then decide which is more reasonable, because the latter is impossible to outright prove.
That's where I'm at with Dorian. Newsweek tried to prove he was Satoshi and wasn't sufficiently able to, despite the fact that Newsweek was in the fortunate position of trying to prove a positive. If Dorian *was* Satoshi, they *could* have proven it by having him cryptographically sign something, or him responding to something via his known email addresses, etc.
But they were not able to prove it, so I and the rest of the community are only left with the option to catalog all the things that make it unlikely and, after doing so, compare that scenario ("despite these things, he's Satoshi") with the alternative ("he's really not").
Again, each individual point isn't damning. He still *might* know C++, despite there being no outright evidence. And I still *might* know Sanskrit, despite my friends not having ever witnessed it.
But if my friends didn't witness it, there are no first-hand sources of me writing in Sanskrit, and I never took a class or checked out a book, plus the fact that Sanskrit is an obscure language to begin with? Yeah, I almost certainly don't know Sanskrit. And Dorian is almost certainly not Satoshi Nakamoto.
Anyway – this discussion has gone on pretty long, so if we need to keep talking about it, I would prefer to talk exclusively in Sanskrit hypotheticals. :)

He wasn't a 3-D graphics engineer in the 80s. His son is a 3-D graphics designer who was born in the 80s. From the article: "Nakamoto has six children. The first, a son from his first marriage in the 1980's, is Eric Nakamoto, an animation and 3-D graphics designer in Philadelphia."

Sure, he could have. Newsweek doesn't offer evidence that he *did* learn assembly or C++, but like I wrote in the article, he certainly could have learned them without leaving a trail. One point I make in the article is that each inconsistency has, at some level, a plausible explanation. Some are more plausible than others. So could he have learned assembly and then C++ in his spare time, despite the fact that Newsweek doesn't present evidence? Of course.
But the larger point of the article is that, while each individual inconsistency has an somewhat plausible explanation, when you combine all the plausible explanations it builds to what I consider to be a very unlikely scenario.
I deliberately wrote the article in a way that presents not only both sides, but as many first-hand sources as I could find. If after reading it, you believe Newsweek's conclusion is more likely, that's entirely your prerogative and we can agree to disagree.

Neither of those quotes are in the article, so I just want to highlight what I actually said:




So, I basically restate my point twice in different words (which I didn't realize until now; that's pretty tricky).
In both instances I use the phrase "understanding", because the near-genius aspect wasn't necessarily in the creation of new forms of cryptography, but  the way in which they were applied. Given how bulletproof the Bitcoin protocol is, I think that's a completely fair assessment of Satoshi's presumed skill. Remember, people are still uncertain if Satoshi is multiple people or even a government (as Paul Graham once postulated).
With regard to his C++ skills, I have definitely heard people criticize them in the past, so I tried not to exaggerate how much of an expert he is. That being said, he wrote the initial protocol by himself, so even if he's primarily an academic, he clearly didn't just randomly pick up C++ in order to implement this mathematical idea he had. The guy is a programmer. And he was able to write working code for a new and incredibly complex system. Does that *not* constitute having a "deep knowledge" or "deep programming background"? I personally think it does – but perhaps that point is more debatable. I don't, however, think it's patently disingenuous for me to write that.
Ironically the one time I use the word expert is when I'm arguing Newsweek's position: "Dorian is an expert at C++ but honed his craft in secrecy." Maybe that was a bit disingenuous on my part – Dorian could've just been very capable at C++ and still written Bitcoin. But the point still stands, since evidence wasn't presented in the article that he was either an expert *or* very capable.
Also thank you for the feedback, I do genuinely appreciate it. I'm not a writer, so sometimes when I try and make a point things get lost between my brain and my words.

Don't give Newsweek any ideas.

I just woke up on the east coast and saw this. Apologies for not refuting this sooner!
I'm not Mike Hearn, the Bitcoin developer, just a regular dude with the same name as him. The irony's pretty thick on this one. :)
Thanks for the kind words.

This is absolutely correct, and like all the possible inconsistencies I list, there is an explanation for all of them. Some of the explanations are plausible, some push the boundaries of believability – but there are explanations.
But the larger point of the article is that each inconsistency has a different explanation, and they compound on each other. So Dorian not spending the money is plausible – I agree with that – but if you believe that Dorian is Satoshi, you can't take that explanation piecemeal. You must also accept that he anonymized everything except his name, secretly became an expert at cryptography and a capable C++ developer, deliberately masked his perfect English by writing using horrible grammar starting as early as 2004, and so on. Eventually the series of somewhat plausible explanations adds up to a vanishingly unlikely scenario. It's not unlike the way a coin landing on heads is totally reasonable – it has a 50/50 shot – but a coin landing on heads ten times in a row is a near statistical impossibility.

Actually $11.37. I think the top comment summoned the bot incorrectly, so the $30 never reached me.
In any event, let's give this a try: $11.37

**BIG PSA:** I am of course grateful that you're sending me money, but I believe you want to send it to who is the Bitcoin developer. I'm just a regular guy with the same name (although I do love Bitcoin, which doesn't help with the confusion).

Don't underestimate the bot!
