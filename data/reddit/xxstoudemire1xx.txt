It's tricky it seems like the US and Canadian government doesn't care. How can the feds do anything about a theft of virtual currency?
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:38:19
I mean the dude could have easily made his $25k with the exploit and probably not get caught. This is just going to make people go from white hat to gray/black.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:36:08
They're not. The only people who are claiming Greeks are running to bitcoin are people who are holding onto bitcoin.

Have you been on this sub for a year+. Some people think it'll even replace USD and that they'll become billionaires.

How is it supposed to work as a "Universal" currency when most people have no internet? That is the question and the only response has been attacks and downvotes.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:09:33
They don't work without the internet... 
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:14:33
So the people without internet are on there own then?

Shit I lost 5 btc because I lost my keys. My backups didn't work and old walkers where corrupted. I just keep then all on coinbase now
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:36:06
Don't know why people here treat Bitcoin as a "stock". You will lose 99% of the time. The  of people who've made millions of of Bitcoin is less than that of people who traditionally traded. You people are nuts.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:41:12
No, What is your point? That 30% doesn't need one. If they acquire $1 they have one $1 that anybody will accept. If they receive 1btc on paper... Tm it's useless if they have no internet access to do anything with it but hold onto it. No one in there community will trade for it because they too have no internet, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:10:11
I've read from users here that they wanted bitcoin to be Universal...
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:38:02
Your an idiot
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:37:06
Ok? How is that relevant? Email only works for that 40% while written letters I presume works for more than 40%...
Also a majority of emails are auto generated and sent. There instant. Where as with bitcoin confirmation takes time where as with currency its instant...
The world needs High Speed Internet before any virtual currency can take off

@_date: 2015-12-04 03:50:43
Yeah I tried from what I rember they were unsuccessful. It was a lesson learned. This was when btc was just below $200 so it's not as bad as some of the losses I've seen on here. Also lost like 0.5btc from MtGox.

What about those who have committed suicide. Was it fun for them?
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:13:38
I meant they don't need it to trade or buy goods. Why would I use an internet based currency over tangible money especially when im barely connected? That's my question.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:53:13
My point is that the average person doesn't know how to and won't want to understand what op did. And even if the devs fix this the hackers will always find a backdoor. And oh I'm just here for the drama associated with bitcoin. It's pretty amusing.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:10:57
^this is why I like dogecoin a lot mor than bitcoin. When this happened to the doge coin people they all supported each other like a family. Over here is just packed with greedy assholes
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:25:19
Having to do all of this is why bitcoin will never be mainstream.

Lol I can see this being a movie.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:44:38
Can't really compare mp3s to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital currency and it has value, and as long as it has value there will be hackers no matter what security features are implemented. Its a never ending game. Its not like insured physical money, and never will be.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:22:04
It'll take a century for bit coin to be fully mined. You will be dead by that time.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:30:35
What no one understands is that over half the people here or involved in btc in general couldn't give a fuck about bitcoin. They would rather see 1 = $$$ than it actually being usable outside of trading. You always see people treating it as a stock. When or if this shit goes under I wonder how many people will commit suicide.

Well most of the computers are actually updated and run on a network wide virtual machine running win7. But there's the 10% that belong to facility, or are in discrete locations, or are used to run the scientific tools in the labs. I told my physics department about it last year but it seems like no one wants to go through the process of updating and there worried about losing legacy software.

@_date: 2016-02-21 06:16:51
Lol the big elephant in the room is that everyone here wants the value of bitcoin to skyrocket. I'm 100% sure that 99% of the people on r/bitcoin would rather 1 btc = 100,000usd than for it to be sub $500 and universal. Most of the people here treat it like a stock. And like all stocks they will be burned guaranteed. I still don't get why people lust over "bitcoin millionaires". They got lucky its as simple as that. The odds are severely not in your favor.
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:40:14

Also listen to the teachers side is the story. Apparently they told him multiple times to stop bringing it to class then one day he "set it off" in the middle of class as if he really had a bomb. The administration had enough. The kid was just being an asshole.

@_date: 2015-11-15 04:55:58
Like Libya. There never really was a rebellion. The media labeled "rebels" were actually Al-Queda fighters and extremists (The rebels themselves mockingly admitted that they have ties to Al-Queda but the media still called them "Libyan rebels" ). The US and NATO funded them and killed Gaddafi and his kids. After that the "rebels" became apart of ISIS. When Gaddafi said he'd rather go down as a tyrant he meant that he'd do whatever it took to kill the "rebels" at the cost of civilians lives. And he was right because now Libya is complete shit. The current theory for the US's peculiar interest in destroying Gaddafi and his regime stems from the fact that right before his demise he announced that he was going to create a United African dollar to rival that of the USD and Euro and that any oil sold would have to be bought with that currency. It didn't bold well with the powers that be and so he was killed. Now what was an Islamic country that used to have a 85+% literacy rate, free housing, free education, subsidized oil and food is a shit land.
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:17:21
The powers that be will either make it unsuccessful or will be at the top, ruling. Even Bitcoin is already seeing a great inequality of wealth. Most of the coins are held by a handful of people one being the US government because of raids.

Used my $2500 refund check and bought in at $200 got out and was able to make over $10k. The money went straight to my education. I still have btc left over that I plan on saving.
The problem is that too many people are trading or are looking to make money. People need to start using it as it was intended for and that's currency. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:57:05
People can barely convert between units, or know how most things around them works. Unless bitcoin becomes as easy, fast, and insured like PayPal I can't realistically see it taking off.
@_date: 2016-05-28 01:52:35
Lol you'll lose every time.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:44:38
Stay away from trading you'll just lose your money. I guarantee it.
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:00:04
But it's false though
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:42:27
Just look at history and every other cryptocoin. I have yet to see solid proof that Bitcoin is set to rise. Do you really think the government, 1%, and banking Industry wont get their share, or dont know what their doing.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:58:21
You're delusional
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:43:11
Its people like you who were so sure that made people lose so much money.
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:15:21
But wouldn't you want it to drop to average down?
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:57:48
Nah its called learning from history. Look at other coins that halved.
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:29:14
You can't even hedge with bitcoin though. The point of my post was that you can't guarantee it will rise. I have yet to see proof of that yet people on here are throwing dangerous amounts of money at it. If it crashes, when people start posting here upset or making suicidal sounding posts all I'm going to say is lol. I'm invested but I have an exit plan and I put in an amount I could afford to lose. The people using those bitcoin lenders have already lost.
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:34:45
your arguement makes sense but what's stopping the government from taking control of bitcoin or the established banking industry implementing their own virtual currency that sidesteps bitcoin. One that the average consumer will have more faith in 
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:37:25
$1 = 1 BTC is a lot different than $100,000 = 1BTC
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:27:39
This is the reason why I cashed out all of my btc when it was $1000+. Was able to get rid of my school debt.
