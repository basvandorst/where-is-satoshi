An BCH transaction also takes 5 second to be complete, I think you meant 10 mins to confirm. At this stage, [I'm not convinced BTC LN confirmations are safer than BCH's 0-conf transactions](
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:55:02
As far as I know Gemini doesn't have segwit, so....
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:47:00
Would you support a hardfork to 300kb to promote more decentralization?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:34:49
Different use case. BTC is supposed to be as decentralized as possible as a store of value while BCH facilitates txns.
I support a 300 kB block size cap for BTC, as Core developer Luke-Jr suggested.
I support no cap on BCH at all.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:53:21
With fiat?
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:28:44
He also said 0-conf is safe. Well, then RBF was introduced and it's no longer safe.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:12:28
OP is not wrong, there were a lot of txns that are huge in size (lots of inputs and outputs), here is [a snip of miners mining 8mb blocks, almost consecutively]( today.
On BTC, I would say these txns are spams. But because BCH has a different use case and a different roadmap, I'm hesitant to call them spams.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:38:58
CT are much larger in size. Could make fee situation worse if widely adopted.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:21:51
"Over the course of a year, they'd need 52 TBs (drives that large don't exist), and even more bandwidth, which also doesn't exist for residential users."
For BCH to get that large transaction volume, a residential user will probably have to switch to pruning mode. For storage at least. The biggest problem though is validating incoming transactions, as this is hard on the disk, memory, and CPU.
"The bottom line is that raising the block size isn't a solution. "
You maybe right, but I support people pursuing different roadmaps. 1mb base block size and 4mb block weight is probably ok for BTC right now. But if I could I would support Luke-Jr's proposal to lower blocksize to 300kb. Decentralization is the primary objective of BTC afterall.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:24:51
"why a 1MB block size is totally fine and a 2MB block size would lead to a significant loss in decentalization."
Because if you hardfork to 2mb then it creates a slippery slope into hardforking into 4mb and beyond.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:20:45
So, BCH will sooon be accepted too.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:42:43
You recommend an alt-coin in the Bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:05:42
What do you think the ideal blocksize I'd for BTC right now?
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:35:52
If you only put little in, it likely won't help the network at all due to LN liquidity issues. Most people won't connect to s LN node with low amount of funds locked in.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:47:11
Well, if you use a LN hub, technically, it's no longer peer to peer.
Only the base layer is peer to peer as far as I know.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:26:33


How much scalability does it bring? Will the fees be dropping?
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:18:46
I think we should hardfork to 300kb on BTC to reduce block space demand.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:23:51
Yeah but with softfork you have all these drama of asking/boycotting exchanges because they are slow/refused to adopt these softfork changes.
Also, it's been half a year since segwit activated and segwit adoption is still LOW. 
 I just can't help but think what this means for future softforks that require user adoption (big exchanges are big users and they are slow to change).
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:26:01
I'm not a technical person but Core's leadership so far has been solid with solid codes. It's BTC after all, the priority is to stay decentralized. And of course, I use other currencies for transactions.
If [Luke-Jr says it's better for Bitcoin to not use segwit]( then that's good enough for me.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:48:20
"This is how Bitcoin should be done"
No it's not. We should teach people to use peer to peer transaction as it is originally intended.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:27:20
You still haven't answered my question on what blocksize cap you think is appropriate for BTC.
I think it should be 300kb, as Luke-Jr suggested. If you disagree with that it's fine.
I have many Bitcoins, probably more than you do. I truly think for Bitcoin, decentralization should take priority.
Eventually transaction fee will flat out around 1000 dollars, as Tuur Demeester envisioned.
 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:25:59
I used to be for bigger blocks but I have changed my mind. I think decentralization should be priority.
I oppose bigger blocks on BTC, and I oppose using segwit txns unless they are for Lightning.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:23:18
Should have hardforked 2mb. Fair to everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:46:27
Yes it's true. That's why they recommend LN only for smaller amount txns, day-to-day txn.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:06:19
No, the primary objective for BTC is to stay decentralized, if anything, we should reduce blocksize to 300kb, as Luke-Jr suggested.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:41:51
Most people here probably will never open up a channel anyway. Your concern on the LN fee not being what it appears to be, is valid.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:43:58
Is funding transaction on-chain? So I will have to pay on-chain fees?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:16:27
I think you need some Bitcoins to receive Lightning Bitcoins. The reason is that you might be attacked and need to settle on-chain to punish the attacker.
Also, LN doesn't actually give you Bitcoins. It gives you IOUs of Bitcoins. If LN gave you actual Bitcoins then there wouldn't be a need to settle on-chain later.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:52:35
Softfork is better than hardfork?
Monero hardforks twice a year, why don't they choose softfork?
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:20:29
Gemini doesn't batch txns. Is Gemini a failure too?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:52:02
End users need to have their node online 24/7, just to protect their funds. An average user is unlikely to do that just to buy stuff that requires instant confirmations. 
My prediction is that there wouldn't be as many LN nodes as mainnet nodes (partially due to the coin commitment). Also LN layer will be very centralized. Earlier there was a report that 30% of the BTC mainnet LN nodes are only reachable through 1 hub. These hubs need to be online 24/7 and DDOS-proof. Average user can't do that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:13:56
Checked today, no segwit address generation.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:15:17
Hardforks don't force everyone into one consensus. 
If you don't upgrade, you simply stay on the original chain. 
Due to BTC's difficulty algorithm, if you can get 75% of the economic majority to agree on the hardfork, original chain will very likely die.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:45:17
I don't think fees will drop substantially. XAPO has been consolidating their UTXOs on BCH chain for a while. If the fees start to drop on BTC chain, these large exchanges will start to consolidate their UTXOs, driving up the fees.
You are also imagining a future where almost everyone is using LN. That future is very distant from now I think.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:42:47
I agree, transfer funds into LN wallet is still an on-chain txn. Setting up, closing down channels are another TWO on-chain txns. That's three on-chain txns with the price of 20-dollar each?
Also, LN can only handle small amounts of funds. There might be security issues if you lock up too much in the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:54:13
That's like 4.5 months from now! 4.5 months of congestion I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:45:45
It fits human behavior well: " I would like to spend the least amount of money to do most amount of work."
Therefore, a typical user would probably open one channel to the most connected hub, so he/she has a maximum chance of reaching everyone (most amount of work) with the least coins spent, on just one channel (least amount of money).
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:05:00
They are block explorers, not exchanges. When exchanges mess up the address format there is money on the line. When explorers mess up there really isn't that big of a deal.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:50:23
The real bottleneck is CPU and memory IMO. If storage is lacking just prune.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:34:35
BTC is meant to be a store of value not as a transactional mean. We should use other altcoin for txns and BTC must stay decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:32:51
I don't believe that is true.
Running a mainnet node (to be a hub or some sort, to have as many connection as possible) doesn't require any coin commitment. You just need a good internet connection.
Running a LN node (to be a hub) requires you to lock coins into a channel. That's actual financial commitment. I don't think many people are willing to so that.
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:00:36
Can you do LN transactions through SMS?
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:30:26
Using Coinbase is not "peer to peer" though.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:13:13
I don't know why you got so worked up over this. My position on BTC is the same as Luke-Jr's. And he is a Core developer so obviously his positions carry weight.
For example, he suggested not using segwit unless it's for Lightning:
His suggestion on hardforking to 300kb is on this forum, you can find it by searching.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:20:32
Well you don't have to do anything. If a minority don't want to upgrade, then two chain co-exist.
I would argue that hardforks are more democratic, since you can choose which chain to be on. With softfork there is just one chain. (If you don't like the rules you are stuck with it)
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:32:14
I think decentralization should be priority. Because segwit makes blocks bigger, we should not use segwit unless it's for Lightning.
Exchanges should protect BTC by not using segwit.
Decentralization on BTC is what BTC does best. We should not lose that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:26:51
It would be a long list. I don't know any exchanges with beaches integrations.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:20:29
If it's opt-in, why is there a boycott against exchanges that don't use it?
If the goal is for everyone to use it, then why not just hard fork?
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:39:15
Of course! Litecoin for transactions, Bitcoin for store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:13:09
To be fair, I asked you first.
But, I think 1mb is just right for BTC. People should stop using segwit to keep the blocksize exactly 1mb (unless it's for Lightning)
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:27:45
No, decentralization should be priority, if we hardfork it should be reducing blocksize on BTC.
For BTC, it's all about decentralization.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:10:09
You wanted a softfork, you got it. Softforks are opt-in by nature. And use should be voluntary.
If you wanted everyone to use this feature you should have hard forked.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:53:02
If softfork depends on the users and Coinbase is that big of a user.
Maybe softforks shouldn't be designed like this to give Coinbase that much power in the first place?
Food for thought. So tired of the drama, this and that.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:23:35
"BTC Core SegWit GUI coming May 1, Coinbase incompetence exposed, more exchanges deploy SegWit (self.Bitcoin)"
I think it's interesting that you see Coinbase not implementing segwit as "incompetent", 
yet, Core failing to release software with segwit as default is not seen as such.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:41:21
You don't need to be online for the channel to be open, although, to conduct a txn, you need to be online.
However, it is recommended that you stay online to examine attacks that try to steal your funds. You can also outsource the job to a third-party, but then the protocol becomes trusted, and no longer trustless.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:00:27
So... Gemini (no txn batching and segwit) failed too?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:26:26
I'm sorry I did not phrase my question well.
"e.g an exchange could top it up for (almost) free (as long as you give them fiat, of course)."
So opening a channel is an on-chain transaction.
Closing a channel is an on-chain transaction.
Is this "topping it up" also an on-chain transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:53:49
If LN is massively adopted, we could shrink the blocksize to 300kb to make BTC more decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:07:37
RemindMe! 2 months
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:45:59
So basically, if you fix transaction malleability, you can run LN on your coin. There are several ways of fixing it, segwit as a softfork is one of them.
You can also do a simple hardfork to fix it, which is what I imagine what BCH will be doing down the road.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:41:51
I used to be for larger blocks, now I believe there is a definite need for BTC to stay at 1mb base block size forever. The primary goal is to stay decentralized on BTC.
I oppose any on-chain hardfork expansion of block size.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:13:18
Makes you think what would happen if the next soft fork is deployed, doesn't it?
How long before 95% adoption for the next softfork kicks in?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:56
Really? A technical guy like you left BTC on an exchange before the fork?
I don't believe you.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:36:26
I see.
Damn, I used to think 20 sat/byte was high. I guess I will never be able to consolidate my dust UTXOs now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:35:26


I have no objections if people want to use off-chain scaling as a solution. Personally, I prefer on-chain solutions, because for on-chain transactions, proof of work is being generated. Also, LN isn't very safe if blocks are full all the time. Compared to LN, I would just use an altcoin on-chain.
As for capacity, I think BCH is doing more than just increasing blocksize. They are experimenting on better code implimentations for bigger blocks, better hardware optimizations. I don't think BCH can scale to VISA level today, but it can reach Paypal level within a year.
With the implementation of [compact blocks]( (kudos to Core developers), the data required for propogation of a new block has been dramatically cut down. With further optimization, we could scale up to 100 txns / sec with relative ease. Users will have to purchase more storage though. But I'm willing to pay that price.


I used to think that is the case too. And, that is until I talked to an average user/investor like my relatives and my friends. They don't know anything about SegWit, blocks, scaling, let alone, Lightning. They just know that the Bitcoin fees are piling up and transactions are taking very long time to go through.
Have you read the customer reviews on any Bitcoin wallets in Google Store or Apple Store? Lots of them are blaming wallets for high fees and they had no idea that was because the network is at capacity. Asking them to push for SegWit on exchanges is unrealistic, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:20:49
SegWit was opt-in. Usage should be voluntary, because it's a softfork.
If you really want everyone on board, why didn't you support a hardfork then?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:23:10
If that's the case, would you support a hardfork to decrease the block size to 500kb, to make the network more decentralized?
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:28:28
I haven't seen any BIPs proposed by Core developers that increases blocksize that is a permanent solution.
Have you?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:00:35
I agree. 
I just opened a ticket to Coinbase + Gemini saying we don't need segwit. The status quo is fine as it is.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:36:49
Definitely interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:22:41
The bandwidth doesn't have that much to do with blocksize anymore. Because of the implementation of compact blocks, the traffic you see from your node is mostly transactions.
The more people transact the bigger bandwidth volume you will see (from your node), even if you keep blocksize constant.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:27:20
I don't know, sometime in 2018 I think.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:45:12
Does it have any downside?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:50:34
They should, because I'm their customer. Just as they should care about their users who support segwit.
Don't you agree?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:28:30
Well, except all devs with commit access to Bitcoin Core support status quo (segwit + 1mb base block). And with Bitcoin Core being the major software used by everyone.
You are stuck with Luke, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:54:14
Trolling or not is up to your perspective, but there are some people in the community who are in favor of high fees.
For example, [Here is a conversation of Ari Paul and Tuur Demester]( They are both for fees that are high to your standard.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:58:31
Not saying anything, except citing Luke-Jr:
"[It is better not to use Segwit until Lightning is ready.](
"[PSA: If you support reducing the block size (good for Bitcoin), avoid using Segwit for normal transactions. Only use Segwit for Lightning.](
He is also, **your** Core developer.
If you see it from his perspective, these companies are helping Bitcoin by keeping blocks small.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:43:26
How much transaction capacity increase does this result in?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:34:08


So let's make the block smaller so the traffic congestion is less of a problem?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:18:43
Which block are you talking about? BTC.com and ViaBTC have paid txn accelerator, so 70 sat/byte might not be the real cost. 
Also, low fee txns could be miners' txn that were not announced to networks mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:36:46
I see. I'm glad there was a split. We can pursue different roadmaps now.
Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:10:51
Segwit makes blocks bigger, Luke wants to keep it small.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:46:44
You probably don't know this but BTC Core has compact blocks and BCH has XTHIN. Both can reconstruct blocks from mempool. 
Basically, as long as you can download 8mb within 10mins (not very demanding), you can handle a 8mb block.
Also, I tested my 2008 Macbook, it can handle 8 mb blocks despite its weak CPU and small memory. So which computer are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:55:19
Pros (briefly):
1. fixes transaction malleability, paving ways for Lightning Network.
2. is a small on-chain scaling. The more people using it the more scaling it offers. If 100% of the txns are in segwit, it will be effectively, a 1.7mb hardfork.
1. fee discount for segwit transactions are considered unfair by many. Legacy txns have to pay more, because the way fees are calculated. In fact, Luke-Jr (a core developer) stated on Slack channel that if he could do a hard fork, he would extend the discount to legacy transactions.
2. code implementation is heavy (there could be hidden technical debt that have to be fixed down the road).
3.  Not a long term on-chain scaling solution. 
4. many speculated that segwit adoption would be slow, and the easing of high transaction fees are minimum (turns out it is the case here, after about 4 months, segwit adoption is [around 10%]( Many wallets complained about how difficult it is to implement it. In fact, [OpenBazzar implemented SegWit, but the fees didn't drop too much for them](
5. Because segwit relies on the user creating a segwit address and use it, and because many transactions are sent from exchanges. I would argue that this essentially give exchanges veto power on segwit: if they refuse to adopt it, segwit will remain an un-used feature.
Edit: added info on OB.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:38:30
I like your idea. You should propose a BIP.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:48:16
Now that Bitcoin community has largely agreed that BTC is a store of value, I see no reason to ever increase the block size.
Therefore the status quo is fine. Services that don't offer segwit are fine if they don't want to.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:03:09
Yeah it can be done, unless your blocks are full and your on-chain settlement is not guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:08:14
He said it makes blocks bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:22:07
"... My bigger concern is regarding bandwidth consumption and total transfer usage..."
If that is a concern to you, then I understand why bigger blocks make you hesitant. Perhaps, keeping blocksize as they are right now makes sense for you, and a larger number of node runners on the mainnet.
Out of curiosity though: would you support a hardfork to lower the blocksize to 300kb? What about 500 kb or 700kb?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:33:43
I think it's a good thing they moved to another coin. A lot of people from here considered SatoshiDice to be spam anyway.
But, I don't think this proves your point of "bigger roads don't work". Because BCH hasn't hit scaling limit yet. If they did, you would be correct.
Also, XAPO is able to consolidating dust UTXOs on BCH chain, while they couldn't do it on BTC chain. Coinbase has millions of UTXOs that are undependable, creating minor liquidity problems.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:43:50
Not saying you are lying, but some proof would be nice.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:25:05
It took them this long to adopt segwit. How long will it take for them to adopt MAST and Schnorr?
Softforks are problematic because you are giving exchanges too much power: since they send a lot of txns, they have veto power on your upgrade.

Really? The largest part of a transaction is the witness (signature), as part as I know. 
"1000 transactions could go out using less space than 1 does now."
Where would the signatures go?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:35:40
If the goal was always for every transaction to be segwit, and to have an effective 1.7mb capacity increase, then we should have had a 2mb hardfork.
That way we get the capacity increase and less drama about boycotting this and that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:03:04
Depends. I don't think that is a success. People are forced to use a layer-2 technology, which is supported by large hubs by financial institutions.
What makes Bitcoin successful is the revolutionary **peer-to-peer** transaction with no middleman involved. Lightning Network can be a lot of things, but as long as most users use hubs, it's not peer-to-peer.
Personally, I don't think txn cost will reach 1000 USD. I think people will switch to an alt-coin. Bitpay is starting to do that already.
**Edit:** despite my personal opinion, I respect BTC community. If the community doesn't think fees and blocksize are problems and the status quo is fine. Then I say no changes to the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:09:24
"I do support Bitcoin and a very gradual blocksize increase. "
What "gradual blocksize increase" are you talking about though? segwit now, 2mb later 2018"?
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:38:57

When you suddenly roll out multiple attack blocks they are very easy to spot. And no hardforks are needed, to repair the damage, you simple build from the last block that is thought to be valid. Since wallets and nodes defer to the longest chain, as long as honest hash control 51% , the attacks can be averted.
51% attacks are usually aimed at exchanges. The attacks can be made less effective if exchanges require more confirmations for big deposits.

@_date: 2017-12-31 20:59:27
Actually you don't need everyone to agree. A 75% economic majority would result in one chain, the 1mb chain wouldn't stand a chance at surviving, due to the difficulty adjustment algorithm.
Exchanges like 2mb so you already have a lot of players on that side already.
Given how high the fees are I think achieving that number is quite possible.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:50
If you want to make it mandatory, then why not just hardfork? And, before you say, a softfork prevents chain-split, BCH chain was activated because a portion of BTC users didn't want segwit on the chain.
That was effectively, a chain-split. The fact of the matter is, if your upgrading proposal is controversial, a chain-split will happen, regardless of the nature of the fork.

Yous.org used a LN style system for micro-payments, they had to set up their own node, costing the business bunch of money. Even then the micro-payment system didn't work because the cost bottle-neck is on-chain opening and closing of a channel.
They switched to LTC then BCH and realized that they can do micropayments on-chain on BCH. On top of that, they didn't have to run a node anymore, saving the business bunch of money.

Schnorr signature combines multiple signature into one. It saves space if you are sending a txn with multiple signature. But it doesn't do anything if you are sending with just one signature.

If you are going to do user activated, rather than miner activated. Why not just hardfork?

@_date: 2017-11-12 21:54:58


Yeah.. no that's not how it works. Even with EDA, you need to mine 6 blocks at current high difficulty least, to start the trigger of EDA. After one block would lower the difficulty by only 20%. 
So to reach CPU level you need to: buy millions worth of ASICs to produce blocks are high difficulty + spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on electricity to get through the initial hurdle.

People are getting into Bitcoins through exchanges and over-the-counters. Very likely that these new money have not touched on-chain yet. 
Being a method for store of value is fine. But many small online businesses could not afford fees that high. Don't mention LN please, the hubs are not here. If used as a method of transaction, Bitcoin is not working for the little people who are transacting in small amounts.

I think while that's a possibility, in reality, the resistance to bigger blocks would go exponentially high as blocks get bigger. So despite spammers spamming the network, blocks would reach a size of equilibrium where everyone is comfortable with. There are couple of reasons why I think that would be the case:
1. Bigger blocks increase the chance of orphaned blocks (wasted money for miners). I suspect this is the reason that Slushpool and Bitfury did not like bigger blocks. They fear that their blocks would be orphaned by other miners who have a larger share of the hashrate.
2. Miners could spam the network, but it might be counter-productive to them, because: a. if their spam transactions pay fees too low (1-2 satoshis/byte), then it doesn't affect regular users at all. b. If they spam transactions that pay fees too high, these spamming miners stand to lose a lot of coins because other miners might confirm these high-fee transactions, and claim their funds.
3. If miners just confirm their own transactions into the block, sure that's creating back-log, but they are also missing out on extra income.
And last, how do you define a spam transaction? 1-10 satoshi/byte? A lot of Bitcoin services use very low fees because their mixing transactions are big in size. High fees actually hurt their businesses, and hurt Bitcoin's fungibility.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:42:31
They say that, however, if you have followed the politics in the past few years, you know their statement is not true.
Adam Back proposed "2mb-4mb-8mb" to counter XT. Neither is implemented.
Then, on the Hong Kong conference, segwit + 1 year later 2x is proposed. Adam Back signed the agreement. Attacked by Core people, that agreement is breached.
The New York Agreement. Well you know what happened. Core has never proposed any serious on-chain scaling proposals (Hard Fork), and there is no reason to believe they will start proposing now. GMax had the "Flexcap" idea but that fell through as well.

I run a Classic client, if there ever is a consensus to stay within 1mb, that consensus doesn't include me.

@_date: 2017-11-04 05:43:49
More personal attacks I see. Even if you were correct, 2.2mb wouldn't be enough. Not to mention that, to get there requires everyone using SegWit transactions.
After what, more than 1 month since activation? We are only 12% there. Given how slow we are in adoption, by the time we reach 100%, that hypothetical 2.2mb wouldn't be enough.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:25:12


That depends on the Bitcoin community, if BTC doesn't want to be payment method, and doesn't see transaction fee as a problem, then BTC doesn't have to scale. You can even advocate for reducing blocksize, through a hardfork, so BTC will become even more decentralized. In fact, you can start a thread in this very sub-reddit, and see how many upvotes you can get. I think Luke-Jr supported a hardfork to 300kb, do you support that proposal?
In my case, BTC stopped working for me, and I moved to other coins. To me, BTC an immutable store of value is nice, but just that.
I'm more interested in transactions, especially payment across borders that can bypass all the regulations and banking system.
Also, judging by how different BTC wallets (Electrum for example) advocate for using SegWit to reduce fees, I think fees are becoming a problem. There is a threshold where even an ardent BTC supporter will say, that's enough, that's too high.
My 2 cents of course.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:32:12
One thing about Schnorr:
It's really not what it's cracked up to be. Offers 30% onchain capacity by merging signatures. Doesn't solve short term problems, might enable long term problems.

I use cryptos for transfering money between me and my family members and friends. I used BTC until Jan, when the delay became sporadic. Since it's between trusted people 0-conf was not an issue. And the transfer is usually a small amount so 5 dollar fee is totally unacceptable.
Currently I'm using LTC. So easy to use, don't have to worry about fees and slow confirmations ever again.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:11:05

I don't understand how you can do that to be honest. By definition the private key of the LN wallet must be on a hot wallet, because during a transaction, sender and receiver both must be present online to exchange information about their private keys.
Even if you store private keys on a hardware wallet, you still have to present that private key to the party you are transacting with. This introduces a risk of theft. In comparison, on-chain transactions do not require private keys to be present in a hot wallet. On-chain requires signature signed by the private key, but the private key never has to be exposed.

It's saving vbyte (virtual bytes) for transactions. I think there is a bit confusion here.
Transactions made from a legacy address, from a P2SH segwit address, and from a bech32 segwit address are similar in size in bytes, but because of the rules of segwit, they are counted differently in virtual bytes (vbytes).
**Miners use fee/vbyte to determine which transactions are included in the next block** (miners are greedy and they mine the transactions that pay the highest fee/vbyte to maximize profits).
Some examples:
1.  A transaction sent from a legacy address to two addresses are about [225 vbytes](
2.  A transaction sent from a P2SH address to two addresses are about [168 vbytes](
3. A transaction sent from a bech32 address to two addresses are about [142 vbytes](
The phenomenon of preferential treatment to various transactions using vbyte is known as "witness discount". Whether it is a good thing or not is up for debate. I personally don't like it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:37:25
Change of PoW is even less likely now with overt ASICsboost accessible to everyone (Slushpool).
Now Slushpool now has a LOT more to lose with changing PoW. There is zero chance PoW can be adopted.
You can always create your own fork though.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:56:44
Transactions with the same number of segwit inputs and outputs are counted as smaller in size, if inputs are from **bech32 segwit address** (addresses that start with *bc1*). And the size is slightly larger if it's a **P2SH segwit address** (a portion of the addresses that start with *3*).
This is important because given the same number (and type) of inputs and outputs, you can fit more bech32 segwit transactions into a block than you can with P2SH segwit transactions.
More transaction = higher scalability = lower fees.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:17:14

Not sure which group of developers you are referring to, but Core developers think 1MB is sufficient. [Luke-Jr even argued against using segwit for regular transactions in order to keep blocks small](
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:26:26


This is, true...-ish. The current block size limit on BCH is 8mb. BTC's 1mb handles at most 7 TPS (in reality it's more like 3 TPS). 8*7 = 56. So that's where it's from.
However, he didn't tell you that BCH can raise the limit of 8mb all the way to 32mb *without* any hardfork through miners' decision. So the hard limit for BCH is actually 32*7 = 224 TPS.
Always listen to both sides.

Yes, his argument is valid. The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment is not well-suited for multiple coins competiting for hash power. The adjustment is too slow. 
Look how [congested BTC network is now]( and there is only one coin competiting for hash power. Imaging that there are 50x more altcoins competiting for GPU-hash power.
If you are going to change PoW to a GPU-based PoW, you have to change difficulty adjustment algorithm too. Good luck getting consensus on such a short notice.

Most of your points are valid. LN is designed to handle small-amount txns.

While I agree that TSA is in the wrong here, I don't think suing them would yield that big of the payback. Mostly because:
1. Plenty of people are stopped everyday, yet, TSA continues to do this, TSA continues to do random/targeted search (without a warrant) at TSA checkpoints. TSA must have some solid legal grounds to do so. And even if they don't have a solid ruling yet:
2. [Supreme Court of U.S. has ruled in that past that within a certain distance to the border, border security agents can setup checkpoints and do searches WITHOUT a warrant]( I understand that border checkpoints are different from TSA checkpoints, but the court has a set a legal precedent that "the system" understands that "under certain circumstances", it is unreasonable to get a warrant for searches. So this could apply to TSA checkpoints. Terrible ruling nonetheless.
Edit: seems like I was right, the court system has also ruled that these searches can happen at port of entries as well: ["...did not only pertain to the external boundaries of the United States but also to ports of entry."](

I would be hesitant to call for fungibility in Bitcoin in its current state. This is mostly because at the very best, a confidential transaction (one implementation to fungibility) will be 3 times the size of a regular transaction. Confidential transaction alone doesn't solve the fungibility issue, it needs to be coupled with coin-join style shuffling to work, making the congestion on Bitcoin network much, much worse (if everyone starts using it).
We could be looking at sustained congestion (like the one we had 2017 May and Dec, 2018 Jan)
