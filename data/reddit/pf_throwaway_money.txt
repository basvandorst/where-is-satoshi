Indeed. I recently came out as a bitcoiner to my mom. First thing she does, is tell the goddamn neighbor I'm into bitcoin.  
Fortunately, the neighbor dismissed it all as a scam, but I had to give her the rest of the talk about keeping this kind of things private.

One of us. One of us. Gooble gobble one of us!

I bought less than $10 of the stuff, and let a miner run in the background on my unremarkable desktop gpu for a few months, about 6 years ago.
I didn't dollar cost average, rebalance, divest, take profits, or any of that complicated stuff serious people do.
Apparently, all this hard work and sitting around doing nothing is now worth literal millions of dollar.
Meanwhile I've had well paying full time jobs for 20 years, saved diligently, invested the savings, etc. My savings are barely keeping up with the bitcoin stash, and if this continues, they'll be left in the dust.
None of this makes any sense.

When you see thread after thread complaining of not getting an answer about large amounts of money inaccessible for over 30 days, "impatience" doesn't seem to fit.
Low customer resources seems to be an issue. For us.  
For them, it's one metric to tweak to optimize profits against costs. They're growing exponentially and onboarding customers at a much faster rate than losing disgruntled ones. So what's the big deal?

I don't talk much about bitcoin IRL, but I did talk to two coworkers about it a couple years ago, because I like them, even though this goes against my rules.
Of course, they didn't do anything about it, but one of them brought up the topic when Bitcoin passed $2k earlier this year. I'd never told him how much I had, but he somehow assumed I had a lot, and advised me to cash out my vast fortunes right away.  
I told him I couldn't cash out. He asked why not. I said "Because it's going to go a lot higher still", to which he just said "oh."  
Now that would not have been obvious to an outsider, but his "oh" was a very concise formulation, which expanded implicitly to "how can someone so smart be so dumb?"
Such is life. I stick to my rules now.

Identity verification steps can take forever, so if you were planning on timing the market with a new exchange, that's probably not going to happen.

Was that the reason?
[This]( says:


bitcoin are unregulated. Therefore, as the Exchange has not entered into, and would currently be
unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with
respect to all previously approved commodity-trust ETPs—agreements that help address
concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market—the
Commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.
That seems to point in an entirely different direction, one not so easily fixed, even assuming that the bitcoin ecosystem would ever really want to fix its unregulated nature.

&lt;$1 here. It's notable that even though you bought in 2 years after I did, and with a cost several orders of magnitude higher, it doesn't matter anymore. Our cost basis is fast becoming negligible either way.

It's about as relevant as GDAX being regulated, and that wasn't enough for the SEC either.
The appearance of new regulated markets for bitcoin doesn't make the "unrelated significant markets" to which the SEC decision refers disappear. At least not right away.  
If unregulated markets ever end up becoming a small minority in a sea of heavily regulated exchanges willing to enter those surveillance-sharing agreements, then that would give the SEC a reason to revisit their decision.
Frankly, a change of heart by some SEC commission appointees, perhaps coinciding with renewed efforts and incentives from various lobbying groups, seems likely to happen first.
