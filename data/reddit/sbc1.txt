There is a link at the right hand side of the page "Other ways to give, including electronic funds transfer" leading to the Donations wiki page linked further down.
Their address is:

A wiki-page can be changed at any time by anyone. So I could go and change the donations address to one under my control.
I would guess that the donations page is being watched quite carefully for abuse, and it hasn't been changed in two years, so I guess the btc address is really theirs.

In Denmark hungry.dk accepts Bitcoins as well, and they have payment integrated on their MobileApp :)

So that link tells me about the implementation, but doesn't document that it better than Xthin.
I'm looking for data (like the data presented in the article), to support the claim that Xthin is inferior to BIP 152. I just see a claim, no data to back up that claim.

Can you document your clain that core's working solution is in fact superior, compared to Xthin?

I'm guessing it's some kind of tax/accounting requirement.

my Insight's directory is ~45G, so I guess it is disk-space happy hour.
Twice the space usage for the price of one :)

Quick overview guide:
Make sure your **bitcoin.conf** has:
    txindex=1
(If it doesn't your node will need some time to re-index the entire block-chain... Don't wait up!)
While you are looking into the bitcoin conf file, make sure to set a rpcuser and password
    rpcuser=USER
    rpcpassword=PASSWORD
Install Node.js v0.10.x
 [ (so, not the newest 0.12.7 release)
Get Insight from github
    git clone 
and change to the new directory
    cd insight
    npm install
Run application with something like this:
(remember username and password)
    INSIGHT_NETWORK=livenet INSIGHT_FORCE_RPC_SYNC=1 BITCOIND_USER=USER BITCOIND_PASS=PASSWORD npm start
(Starting with **nohup** is recomende, else Insight shuts down when you close your terminal.)
Watch web-interface, browser to
Wait a long time for the sync....

I got the graph from  so it is the latency between their server (in Germany?) and my node.
Important part is that it is measured from the same external server both before and after upgrade.
So the drop you see is 'real', and not just because of another connection to a closer and/or faster server.

Nodes connect across versions. So that is not the issue.

And that is what I used.

We have had hungry.dk (same company) in Denmark for quite some time, and their bitcoin payment works flawlessly.
