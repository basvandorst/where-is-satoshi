Pirate's ponzi? I've been out of the btc loop for a little while now
@_date: 2012-06-29 04:56:31
I'm going to believe that's a joke. Nobody can be that stupid. Plus, if the "1%" actually puts money in bitcoin, it's because because proved to be somewhere they felt safe putting their money. 
You (shoseki) must be the kind of person who thinks everyone but you is an idiot, good luck with that. (FYI if that was true, why aren't you in the 1%? surely that big brain of yours can think of a way to get there despite the odds, right?
@_date: 2012-03-05 17:09:18
actually a lot. but the question is how many bitcoiners need armed bodyguards.
@_date: 2012-07-18 23:35:53
Yeah, anything with 7% return a week is obviously a ponzi, but. I don't understand how it effects the market price of btc?

I'd say you're probably right, I was simply saying they are both federal offenses.

... so is buying drugs.

I like what you said about being a "ruthless monopolist". It's called business. Sure it isn't always ethical but there are companies that do FAR worse than Microsoft has ever done. Linux is fun, but it's a lot of work, too much for busy people. You break something, any plans you had on your agenda go out the door and you have to bust your ass fixing 4 other things that broke with it. If you use the computer just for fun, and you enjoy doing that, then more power to you, but many people who make a living on the computer can't afford that kind of risk.
I love it when hardcore linux fans bag on other operating systems because they are "forfeiting your rights". The reason I love it when linux fans do that is because almost all of them use google search and their other services (gmail, android, maps, etc.). Talk about forfeiting your rights. None the less, I use Google's services, you use them, everybody uses them and we all like to ignore how much power we're giving them. That's a fact of modern life, if you choose to use the internet today.
Disclaimer: I use many of google's services regularly. It's a little concerning but I'm not too worried about it. I just like to point it out to people who ridicule other people for how they choose to use their computers because they don't like the idea of what could happen.

I'm located in Southern California. Sorry I forgot that Verizon has their iPhone now too. It is ATT, but it is both jailbroken and unlocked.
@_date: 2011-05-09 23:24:26
Good point.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:45:34
Hmm. how long is once in a while? Because I've found flashdrives from a few years earlier (~2 years) and they still had the files I left on them.
@_date: 2011-05-10 00:45:16
O my, I totally missed that part. Right on, genius idea.

People really need to look at the time that things are sold for BTC were posted. When I posted this, BTC value was = $50.00. Now I am selling it for 8 because that is the value of the BTC. The value fluctuates a lot and people don't seem to notice this.
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:04:04
Quite possibly. Thanks for letting me know though. I'll definitely be more careful with data I keep on flashdrives.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:48:31
Actually, BTC is against terms of service and will get your account frozen. You would be better off just accepting the chargeback.
Unless you don't care about your account and want their account frozen too. Then that works.
@_date: 2011-05-09 23:20:26
main problem I see with this is how easy they appear to be to forge. Get a card, print it, make a QR code for  "You got scammed lulz" then put a baseball cap sticker over the QR code. Am I missing something?
EDIT: To avoid any confusion, I'm not supporting the idea of forging them, I'm just saying from the picture it looks ridiculously easy, and unless the person transfers the coin with the person right in front of him, somebody could easily make away with that.
@_date: 2011-06-10 23:17:41
That theory actually sounds pretty... sound. :) 
Wikileaks would look into btc before supporting it. That is for sure.
@_date: 2011-05-14 06:49:56
You mean $90.00

I didn't think about it like that, good point, but people don't buy things with gold because that is out-dated. In my opinion, people don't buy things with bitcoins because we are all thinking "If I can just hold onto them until they are worth a bit more I'll have made a good profit!" which is true, but it will also put bitcoin at a moment of crisis, when some of the big dogs decide to liquidate their "crop" the value will plummet because everybody will start to liquidate. This may happen a few times until things stable out and the value of the coins stay stable, only then will people start to treat bitcoin as a actual currency as opposed to a commodity. Only problem is that this may take some time, and the bitcoin might not survive through some of those falls.
@_date: 2011-05-11 04:47:13
Yup. :P Thanks for link to chart, should help some people out.

Step 1: Acquire safe.
Step 2: Put safe in a safe (/pun) place.
Step 3: Acquire 2 flashdrives.
Step 4: Send coins you don't plan on using for a while to another wallet.
Step 5: Backup the wallet onto one flashdrive and delete the original off the other computer/partition.
Step 6: Encrypt flashdrive and have the other flashdrive be a encryption key.
Step 7: Shove both flashdrives into safe.
Step 8: Lock safe.
Step 9: Feel Safe.
Step 10: Sleep well.

Learn GoLang
Edit: I'd like to add, python is the first language I learned. Other than it being slow as all hell, I think it's a great language for the exact reason you described, prototyping. But I think for the most part, if what you're doing needs to be executed quickly, python's not your girl. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 00:03:45
It'd be slow for a DNS.
