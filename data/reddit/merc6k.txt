You’d make about 4-40c a day of Monero imo. Use Cudominer,
40c per day is perfect if you want to buy a completely anonymous VPN by mining your own coin, that would give you $12pm to buy NordVPN. Assuming you register with an anon email.
The referral link above is not mine, but I owe them for showing me, so please click through!
Cudominer just downloads and runs very easily. No set up involved just the settings on how much / when to use your CPU and what coin you want to be paid in

Most ATMs I see these days require ID and phone number. Although 18m ago I found an atm in central London didn’t ask

FB coin will be shit. BUT, it will shift a billion people who’ve never used digital coins before into trying it. And eventually a huge share of those (1%,10%, 25% ?)  will exchange it for bitcoin etc. The long-run effect will be massively positive for digital assets imo
