If you only have lost one or two words, it is recoverable. I have done it already multiple time. You can use [btcrecover seed recovery](
Although I must warn, that it will do a lot more variations than needed, because it will check faults in all words. But if you start with the seed and add a random word at the end. You will most likely be successfull.
If you don't want to dive into the specifics, you can always use my service:

What tools did you use to decrypt you wallet? I use an adapted [btcrecover extract]( tool for this. As I find that the most reliable. (Add print(data) on line 181)

Okey, you have your password back and have your wallet file. Still strange that there are no funds. Mostly that means that there are no funds there.
Several things that you can do:
* Try to decrypt the wallet.aes.json to get the private keys and really check there are no funds there. Are your comfortable with the command line?
* But maybe you created multiple wallets and you did backup the wrong one. So can you use  to check if there are no other wallets on the blockchain you forgot about?

If the funds were on your wallet itself, the mnemonic phrase is enough to recover the funds. Also the wallet.aes.json + password is enough to decrypt everthing and get your funds back.
If you import another wallet into blockchain. That is not saved with your wallet.aes.json or mnenomic phrase.

Is your password created like your other passwords? Or do you think you know the password? Then indeed bruteforcing your password is the way to go. Apps like  can do that. Or you can go for a professional bruteforcer (But I think the potential fee is to low for them)
Tutorial and quick start to do your own recovery:

Stormrockox, this is not a scam! We are a company in Brussels, having doing this in Belgium, we thought to introduce this service worldwide. We use a technique to make sure the user don't need to send the wallet and also create contracts between our company and the client otherwise. So we just want to help users get their wallet back.
I don't know what I could provide more to prove it is not a scam, so you may give me hints. I'm Nikos Verschore, having customers like EITDigital, IMEC, University Ghent. And this is something we started because we heard to many persons in our neighbourhood (Ghent) who lost their Bitcoins, because they don't know the password for their wallet anymore. So therefor we started this as a side-business.
As I'm was already really interested in the technology behind Bitcoins from the start and also lost some Bitcoins while doing it. Remembering Bitcoin24, MTGox, BTC-E. I took up the adventure to learn the inner workings of the technology. And now I want to use my knowledge to help the people (from my own company, to make sure it legal and we can provide trust for the clients).
Btw. very good to be skeptical. Don't send you wallet plainly over the internet! I don't ask my client to do that. Make sure the person either only receives a part of the wallet (adresses without funds). Or have a contract and make sure the other side is a legal person, you can sue if something goes wrong.

This is probably because you imported other wallets inside blockchain. The seed only recovers that main wallet, no additional wallets. How sure are you about your password? Maybe I can try to bruteforce your password?  
ps. Just started this service last week and have already 3 happy clients.

There are multiple options to get your wallet back. If you still have your recovery seed, then it will be very easy. Do you know parts of your password or think you know your password?

We have open sourced our script to extract the wallet information without needing the actual access to the funds. See
Now you can check if we are scamming ;)

We use a method of bruteforcing to find the password. This only works when you know a big chunk of the password. There is already a well known person doing this (walletrecoveryservices). The difference is that we also provide services to non-technical persons and aren't having waiting times of several weeks (atm)
By making use of a clever technique, you don't have to send the full wallet to us. This way we can help the clients without giving giving access to their funds.

Then definitely don't use it ;) Luckily there are options to recover your wallet without sending the actual private keys of your wallet. A technique tested by BitcoinTalk members. That is also the technique I use. The client used to extract those data is open sourced and can be looked into by anybody ( If you have the knowledge, I would advise that you look in the code and directly notify github if something funny happens
