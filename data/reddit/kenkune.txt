For the most part yes, but banks and credit unions are required to monitor certain types of financial activity, and if they opt not to(because of lack of staff or desire to do so as a business decision) then you may receive notices like this that they have opted not to support that sort of activity.

In this case its due to their lack of the capability to monitor the account. Because they cannot properly monitor these types of transactions, they inform the customer, and they have the choice to either halt further activity and keep the account, or find another financial institution, otherwise the FI puts themself at risk

As someone who works in the finance industry, hopefully I can shed a little light. Banks and credit unions are required to monitor certain types of transactions and activity. Things such as business accounts that conduct currency exchange, giving loans, etc. Currency exchanges like on Coinbase also fall under this sort of activity, and financial institutions can either decide to meet the requirements to monitor this activity, or opt to not support businesses and customers that partake in it. They're not doing this because they feel threatened, they're doing it because if they were audited and it was found that they weren't properly monitoring this kind of activity they would likely suffer rather significant consequences.
Edit: Just to clarify, anyone receiving these sorts of letters likely has a bank/credit union that currently doesn't have the capabilities to monitor this activity.  Therefore the only responsible option for them is to either close the account, or for the customer/member to cease those kinds of activity
