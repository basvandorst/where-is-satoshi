any and all periods: past, present, and future... because IRS thinks everyone has a fucking crystal ball on what these unelected retarded bureaucrats will come up with next
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:01:15
wow you guys are living the life ... well my wife is pretty pissed when I told her the btc price this evening, no sex for me this weekend it seems
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:45:31
oh I'm sorry, my crystal ball was broken back in 2012... 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:33:07
Defending IRS to the last straw makes you a douchebag
@_date: 2014-04-22 03:06:04
What do have against goats and camels?
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:32:40
tell that to the irs lawyers when they show up at your door
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:07:33
I'm going to take a portion of my bitcoin earnings (say 20%) and will happily donate to a charity of my liking or a food shelter or gift it to noobs, but I'll not share a penny of it with the thugs that run this country and trample on our liberty, so they can squander it like the rest of my taxes. Didn't we already go through this with King George III
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:27:57
No, its the same as mining bitcoin and just holding it... I just made an egg sandwich from bread, eggs and mayo. Let me note down the fair market value of that and put it in for taxes as gross income
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:08:20
Did the IRS just gift the entire "mining" operation to China, now that its now longer possible to ever reach ROI here, with especially with hardware and power costs. Great fucking victory for the btc millionaires and their wall street peeps though
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:18:15
Fuck it, I really hate that dueche bag wall street scumbag and his scumbag pals on Fast Money
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:42:12
when its accepted, file a stupid amendment ... ugh this is such bs
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:39:59
Well I'm pretty nervous the price will drop and I'll be sleeping and won't get a chance to buy low...
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:18:37
yes, this is magic internet money afterall... 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:20:10
Businesses will be okay through bitpay etc... its the consumers and miners who were fucked by this Obama administration
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:34:28
so wall street can now buy and sell this? yeah great day for the community
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:41:08
Did IRS just kill all the reddit tipbots? Remember you need to record those tips and report them as gross income 
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:55:39
I'll never mine your transaction if you are not paying up... If you are looking for freebies, maybe try out a freebie coin like TIPS
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:05:38
Darkcoin, baby... Suddenly you see why only something like Darkcoin will really stick. Everything else is just a tool of the MAN.
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:06:40
Holy fuck... did someone just buy 100k bitcoins on bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-11-01 01:42:23
Donald Trump: Gold is so cheap I'm gonna gold plate my tennis courts
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:30:43
Will this ruling also apply to mining altcoins like Doges, Vertcoins, LTC, Panda 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. What if they are all worthless and the devs have already scammed you? How on earth do noobs find prices for each doge they mined over last 4 months? This is such a retarded country.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:56:27
Thanks for the post... would never have know about it otherwise ...
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:05:17
Remember you can sell sperm and put it all in bitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:19:13
If you don't use a tax attorney, is it true that they butt fuck you without even using lube?
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:57:01
Running a program on your computer makes you self-employed?
I guess every Halo player is now a military contractor, by the same logic.
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:43:35
not much is known about it though at this point?
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:41:57
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:05:01
So basically the lesson is: don't buy anything with bitcoins... Just collect and wait a few years to see how this all pans out. I guess I can live with that.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:46:10
The end is near...
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:46:11
Pics or there's no 500BTC/all fud.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:44:27
Ooo, look Economist hired another Econo-Moron
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:31:30
remember you now need to include anything you make on this same premise, like coffee, egg sandwich, turkey dinner etc... you need to calculate the fair market value of that and report as gross income ... in the same way as mining btc (without selling)
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:37:33
Damn you coinbase!
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:38:17
Then stop building aircraft carriers and all the other junk and stop sending our tax dollars to countries like Pakistan or Iraq who don't even like us 
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:19:32
Is it true that tax attorneys are worse than leaches?
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:18:16
i shop on amazon... they already fuck me good for state taxes in my liberal communist paradise state
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:15:25
Much better than the mofos who run the IRS
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:54:40
Either pics of the barista or this is just photoshopped!
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:23:25
So basically the solution is: don't shop anything with bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:45:41
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:25:06
And this is land of the free where no one gets fucked by their government hired thugs, right? Fucking IRS, fucking TSA, fucking NSA ... 
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:35:07
You already pay more than enough for the fucking public services like the grid you fucking IRS slave
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:13:20
If it moves and has a pulse, then put a tax on it
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:29:23
Be happy they are not triple taxing you ... just for the fact that you exist and breath
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:11:43
I see a bright future for coin mixers as well as others like darkcoin or zerocash. Always felt the blockchain was just a ticking timebomb waiting to be exploited by tyrannical governments
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:47:48
you are so lucky
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:11:47
Do they give out lube in prison before they butt fuck one?
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:23:57
probably deport
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:25:03
Yeah sorry to hear... thankfully my little babe thinks bitcoin is going to the moon. Maybe my giving her the very first BTC I ever mined as a birthday gift had something to do with it, but yeah seems like you are smart to buy BTC, so goes without saying that you married a smart intelligent babe... just sit down with her and introduce her to the technology, get her her own wallet perhaps and show her the ropes ... remember its what ma daddy always said: happy wife means a happy life
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:42:55
Stupid retarded bureaucrats, thats why
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:12:08
They don't give a shit about their popularity. All they want to do is make everyone miserable as hell.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:16:28
No by lube, I mean lube... maybe if you be nice and ask nicely, inmates let you use lube before they do you
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:05:06
Only fucking bitcoin millionaires support this move... so fuck them and their rich wall street pimps ... so they can take capital gains on this and dump this shit on all the other not so rich bitcoiners
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:23:46
Why don't we just fuck you
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:04:42
Fuck me! I just have a 270, which makes a few doge a day.... how the fuck do I find the cost basis of every fucking doge 3 weeks before tax day
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:59:14
Its fucking Josh from BFL
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:15:45
Nopes because unlike you and me, Microsoft and other corporations are above the law... they can just launder their profits to their offshore tax heavens and not pay a single dime.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:41:32
your parents are supposed to file taxes for you in that case
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:17:04
haha, dont see how its different than tipping in a restuarant ... unless i itemize it as gift upto the gift tax threshold :p
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:51:16
Jerks. I still remember the tons I lost on their newsletter picks like FMD ... These guys are the worst
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:54:57
Some good advice here if you value some anonymity 
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:33:58
The way I see it is: its either getting tits today like the party school that Harvard is or getting bitcoins, waiting for it to hit da moon (and $40000) in 10 years and then getting much more tits then... 
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:53:03
Seriously?!? So you can get a thank you card from IRS?
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:38:16
Time to dump BTC altogether and support something like Darkcoin. Fck this
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:39:20
do they let one take some lube with you?
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:34:46
I want to cry but the way you said it is too funny, so LOL :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:09:32
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:28:21
How do you spell bagholder? Oh wait

you mean: econo-morons?

What else can your barista do? Is she hot?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:39:05
Yes need constant inflow of noobs, otherwise how can we go to da moon
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:24:24
Why does it NOT matter if he got the coins or not?
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:36:11
Is there another good email service?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:38:03
Yes why search but you can get spoon fed ... and in bed with a golden spoon

“To compel a man to furnish funds (taxes) for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.”

@_date: 2014-03-26 01:31:37
Are there any good bitcoin mixing services out yet?
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:22:48
You really are fucked here... sorry no easy words to put it in... should take you weeks to figure out all the tiny amounts you made here and there. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:47:17
define "total despair"
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:31:28
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:47:29
it means you have to record daily btc/altcoin price and how much you mined else they put you in prison and dont even give any free lube
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:01:26
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:46:38
yeah fuck the government ... greedy thieving bastards, they all are
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:40:41
anyone made a good coin mixer ... or is Darkcoin the only solution/hope left for crytocurrencies (so they can enjoy the same anonymity as regular cash)
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:34:30
"Contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen, and then say 'what should be the reward of such sacrifices?' Bid us and our posterity bow the knee, supplicate the friendship and plough, and sow, and reap, to glut the avarice of the men who have let loose on us the dogs of war to riot in our blood and hunt us from the face of the earth? If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude than the animated contest of freedom — go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen!" - Samuel Adams
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:57:33
This is like George Orwell's 1984. Make sure you file correctly. IRS already knows everything through NSA, who's mining, who bought Doges from their BTC and what's the size of your underwear.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:02:59
Running a program on your computer makes you self-employed?
I guess every Halo player is now a military contractor, by the same logic.
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:36:41
Too bad, coinbase doesn't take a limit order... or else I'll put one in for 2BTC at 460, 2 BTC at 440, 3 BTC at 420 and 3 BTC at 400. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:42:32
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:21:58
Maybe you guys can setup offshore services that we oppressed people of USA can use too. Please help us in these trying times! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:28:16
Like paying taxes huh? You a democrat or what?
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:10:21
scam much huh?
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:14:03
Not in fucking Alaska you don't... guess I'm going to start packing up and move there
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:40:38
well tyrants gonna be tyrants
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:43:18
At least they should have had the decency to use lube before butt fucking me... this is just plain brutal now.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:46:02
Alright, I changed my email address on coinbase... is the name from the profile section... then updated that too to initials, in case the phishers haven't gotten to it yet
@_date: 2014-09-19 20:41:07
so depressed ... wheres the bottom ... what happened to all the cheerleaders who were pumping this stupid coin all past year

Return?!? No way, what the freeloaders at the central government take... never goes back. It's like a blackhole that sucks the life of the universe into itself
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:26:19
Roads and bridges haven't done anything for me, so screw that... we'll do cross country and cross them the old fashioned way... by ziplines
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:45:05
That sort of attitude is the reason why so few girls/women are getting involved in bitcoins... 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:55:35
So by the same logic, if I make an egg sandwich just now, I'll have to report this to IRS going forward? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:46:15
so every transfer of any cryptocurrency between entities is now a taxable event ... imagine if i had to track every single cash purchase and record its basis and what I used it for... btc is dead as a currency... i dont want to tell irs i used my btc to buy condoms for instance

Hope he rots in jail. Drug Baron Ross Ulbricht, the destroyer of worlds, the cancer of the society, the hirer of hitmen to take out his employees and competitors. Too bad we live in a hippie country now; else should've been hanged in the public square as a lesson for future criminal masterminds.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:31:13
Hahaha nice to see soem wall street bagholder scums among us
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:04:26
Couldn't have said it better, my friend
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:32:26
Not harsh enough. Should've moved the trial to Texas and asked for the death penalty 
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:34:10
I agree. Hang him. Dont even waste those expensive chemicals/poisons in lethal injections. I dont want my tax dollars paying for this crook's convenience.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:27:56
Oh cmon, DMV is a force for good. It helps daily to waste enough people's time to prevent society from becoming over productive and destroying itself in the process. People need to pause and DMV helps with that ... by making sure it takes you 4 hours+ to sit in a line to renew your id every few years... I think its brilliant
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:32:38
If you really care about Ross Ulbricht, you'd send him some lube from time to time. He'll be pretty butt-hurt down at the max security prison LOL
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:53:34
well the NSA knows certainly, so its just a matter of them making an api/web service available for IRS to use when fact checking your returns
