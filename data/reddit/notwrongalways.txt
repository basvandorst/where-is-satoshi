£60 Transaction, £12 fees... Still waiting for confirmation as per design, 10 minutes later.
Something needs to change :/

Can't - this one regretfully was transferring from Coinbase from a one-off storage of coins on the exchange.
It has taken, so far, this entire time, plus the 10 mins from the original comment and we're at.... 3 confirmations.
It also looks like my transfer was lumped in with another transfer, as there's one input, much higher than mine, and 2 outputs - of which, one represents mine.
You can take a look - 
No idea wtf is going on there. :)

Anything i need to do? I'm running a full node using Bitcoin Core  v0.14.2 (64-bit) - just my way of helping out the network.

They are testing Lightning Network for payouts:

Lightning Network has been amazing to me so far - i've sent 2 transactions via it to Coinbase from Nicehash. I'm not mining much, so my next transaction will be in quite a while, but those 2 so far have been about 2 seconds to complete. Which is incredible.
EDIT: Looks like i misunderstood - this is not Lightning Network - but has the same feel. Oops.

Good point, and they'd simply not use the same password.
What happens though, if they were to keep some data on the file? A hash of it before it was encrypted, for example?
Would that be a breach of data security? Or is that actually plausible?

Presumably it's as simple as "These two encrypted pieces of data are the same, let's keep only one, and in it's place in other locations, simply place a reference as to where to find it"?
