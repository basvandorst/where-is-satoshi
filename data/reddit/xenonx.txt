Yes I wonder that too. 
I dont get why everyone is always shocked that devs @ google use Macs. Google don't build their own dev-worthy OS.

Don't worry, always people like me who follow the hype and buy in at the wrong time ;)

I thought it was a good thing?

Yeah I was wondering about this. Seems like it great for nerds (I put myself in that camp) but not for general public. Great design process but at present very unequal wealth distribution. It does seem a bit ironic that those proclaiming it's virtues as a fairer firm of value exchange are making loads of money off it! I say this as an investor and a believer of it's motivations.

Yes, but is it a problem? if it had stayed low then it would be an issue. I think they had a bug and are trying to cover it up!

This seems very fishy to me. No other exchanges report this behaviour. Also is it a crash if it rebounds instantly?

With Fiat the merchant generally would not be liable for fraud if using up to date tech either.

In what way?
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:23:37
Great idea!
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:22:14
So would I, but worth noting that's still no fair.
It's great that Bitcoin is open source, but many crypto authors reap huge financial gains from the currencies they work on also.

Sorry I don't understand your question
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:03:17
I'm always hesitant to but stuff with btc when given the option, as I bought it to hold!
