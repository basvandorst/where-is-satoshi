This is  the best explanation I've read thus far. 
Only could you clarify which ones which?

Maybe I'm wrong but I think that was just Segwit. They are still deciding on the 2X part (doubling the block size). I think that is coming in November.

It's really hard to code when you are fucked up.
Regular maintenance? maybe. 
Testing? If you try really hard. 
Development? Good luck with that, here have a Gatorade.

Could you reference where or when it has been proven to be correct? 
This is really interesting  since apparently the US dollar was deflationary up till around WW1.

 You send the e-transfer, the receiving party opens their email, clicks the link, signs into their online banking, answers the security question, selects the account to deposit, done. The actual back end process may take a couple business days to be fully posted and complete. 
Yeah it sounds super simple mate. 
Meanwhile in other countries, you write account number and amont.  Click send and money appears on the other end. 
Why do you have to put e-mail? Security question? Receiving end has too confirm? 
Complicating things for no reason. 
Lets say you had to receive 300 or 5000 transfers. Jeez you only have to login accept the 5000 transfers one by one answer security questions send the money to the accont. 
Thats pretty much a full time job. For no good reason. 
See my point?

It sounds like sarcasm but it's true. 
The US and Canadian banking systems are extremely outdated. 
It's unbelievable that in some developing countries you can do bank transfers for a couple of cents in a couple of minutes. 
Meanwhile in Canada you actually have to go to the bank to do it and you have to pay 10-20 dollars. 
They just have no incentives to improve since there was no competing system...
