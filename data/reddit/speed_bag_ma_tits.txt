I thought bitcoin was about "money being yours truly" "no middle man" What is this "Better utility out of your money" ? If it's not easily applicable to the real world eg. easily accepted by any store, then how is it "...to get better utility out of your money?" I don't know, I'm asking. I am poor and have made dumb decisions with money. Please enlighten me (or don't). 
I realize you can use debit cards like Zappo. I just don't get what you mean by "better utility out of your money"
I got the virtual trading concept, we did this in high school as I said, we used virtual money.

Out of curiosity, if you had wage garnishment, can bitcoins be taken away? I thought I read somewhere that banks/the government can confiscate bitcoins.
My crazy idea today while hanging chickens in a factory like a mindless-drone, was to create an automatic buying/selling of bitcoins with a web-scraper, find specific events in the news that affect the price of bitcoins and buy/sell them. Not an original idea... hell I'm having a hard time just building a simple parser that lets me know if new episodes of shows that I watch have come out.... shiiiiii dogggg why don't you learn how to read.

Upload to cloud that sounds like a risk. But I get the idea as far as having your possessions seized. So I'm guessing this means a public cloud that you don't pay for like one drive or Dropbox?

Yeah I'm not sure if my wages are going to get garnished, I'm not smart enough to evade the law haha (RETARD). 
Anyway yeah that is true, I don't know shit much about "trading bots". This "artificial moves in price" curious about that I'll have to look into that. 
Regarding the virtual trading (we did this in a high school economics class, I didn't fare out too well) isn't that scenario forever gone though, do patterns repeat more than once? haha
Anyway thanks for the information.

I've heard of some better coins, one starts with an E I think. I'll have to see the options.

Yeah I'd like to get into it, but have to read a lot.

No they're "professional" emails, emails for my websites with my domain names. I intend to use Gmail as a fallback way to send out emails. What do you mean by a node?

What about 401K? Thanks for letting me know about IRA? The company I just joined recently has 401K apparently you can put however much of your r paycheck into it. It's not a style of work that I'd look to stay for several years but...

Yeah, one thing I've seen as a "potential savings" is technology. Buying the latest thing. I've had to sell some stuff and if an item is still hot, it's pretty easy to turn it around. Not saying you won't lose money. As usually you do

Only 1 or two trades a year? What about automatic trading systems that are triggered by certain high/low thresholds?

Thanks for the info

Nice I like that variable value, so long as it is going up haha. Do you have a preferred, reputable bitcoin vendor?
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:21:59
Do you need to have a good server or is it like a pool. A packet is sent to you and you do what you can?

I wanted to ask you if your Xapo debit card has fees per month or something like that. I use a PayPal Mastercard as a secondary card to put money on and use when I need to but the monthly bill of like $5.00 sucks... does Xapo/other debit cards for bitcoin have similar fees? It would make sense I realize. It's nice when banks don't charge you a monthly fee provided you have direct deposit but I guess it's a minor inconvenience.

Are you saying each person has a bitcoin for the total potential bitcoins that exist? Where there are zombie coins?

With the volatiitly, don't you have a high-risk of losing everything? I mean a drop from $1,000.00 something to $400.00 something
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:04:46
Have you just held onto them and not trade/sell?
