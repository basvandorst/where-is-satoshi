Let's be pragmatic about it - they are the gatekeepers of Bitcoin. And they are free to run whatever implementation flavor they like. You may not accept what they decides to run and you may exit vote bitcoin on behalf of there decisions or you may decide to fight there decisions with your own miner. That is really the two options you have if you disagree. He who control the hashing power ultimately controls bitcoin. And that is a good thing. Miners has the least economic incentive to adhere to consensus rules that the market abhor.

No but i can tell you what happens when the terms and conditions are broken. When backlog size rise and the bitcoin network shrugs  - the market price of bitcoin tanks. 
Satoshi envisioned a bitcoin network model that would scale on-chain. 
**Satoshi did plan for Bitcoin to compete with PayPal/Visa in traffic volumes.**
Quote from Satoshi: 
“The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling.” 
**The block size limit was a quick safety hack that was always meant to be removed.**
Quote from Satoshi: 
"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.  When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."

You don't have to follow whatever the miners say. The people that determine those rules is you! But only if you mine bitcoin. And when you mine, your power is limited to your hashrate. It's a brilliant system.

Lightning network is great and could solve some of the scaling issues off-chain. However both lightning network and segwit might not be enough. Here is some improvement that may or may not happen:
**Dynamic block limit flexcap**
Based on Bitpay's model, this long terms solution of the block size limit debate aims to tune the max block limit dynamically, in a way which is resilient to being gamed, is a good protection against malicious flooding by making it extremely expensive to do, while at the same time allowing for normal cyclical spikes in txn volume.
**Extreme Thin Blocks**
xThin blocks were originally proposed by Peter Tschipper as a method to reduce the amount of traffic that needs to be broadcast through the network when a block is found. This can significantly reduce the need for private centralized networks like the Miner Relay Network in keeping the miners competitive with each other despite variable internet connection speeds.
One of the biggest pains in running a full node is the 5-7 days it takes to download the block chain from the network. Created by Jon Toomim, Blocktorrent is a method to speed up the initial block download times and reliability by using DHT techniques similar to those used in BitTorrent.
**Transaction Validation scaling**
Information on any ongoing efforts to parallelize transaction validation (across CPUs) to improve throughput &amp; reduce validation latency.
**Datastream Compression**
Bandwidth is an issue for users that run nodes in regions where bandwidth is expensive and subject to caps, in addition network latency in some regions can also be quite high. By compressing data we can reduce the daily bandwidth use in a significant way while at the same time speed up the transmission of data throughout the network.
**Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT)**
Proposed by Gavin Andresen and developed by Kalle Rosenbaum and Rusty Russell, this scaling solution is similar to xThin blocks which aims to reduce the amount of data that is needed to be sent across the network by using bloom filters.
**Peter R.'s Subchains proposal**
Abstract: Orphaning risk for large blocks limits Bitcoin’s transactional capacity while the lack of secure instant transactions restricts its usability. Progress on either front would help spur adoption.

@_date: 2016-04-28 04:22:12
There is one thing the Austrian school of economic has tough us - that is that we ought to be very careful making predictions about the future. Because there is actually no way of knowing the future by looking at the current state, historical data or statistical data. 
For now bitcoin mining looks highly competitive even if there is a centralizing force of new innovation into the chip manufacturing space, this force is expected to weaken as 16 nm chip becomes more available to the broader market. And if the current bulk of mines decides to go against the economic  wish of the majority. Then the majority could always go into mining. There is nothing stopping that right now or tomorrow(hopefully). And in the universe of cryptocurrencys there is always a new world awaiting  
But ill hand you a point in that powers will try to exploit the system. That is probably happening already. If they succeed or fail is not a given. Bitcoin is a bottom up economy and a competitive environment that is hard to game. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 07:35:13

In a free market capitalism [currency competition would exist]( This is much like in bitcoin with competing alt-coins. If miners decided to inflate the block reward by by 720% tomorrow, most of us leave to another crypto-coin or fork bitcoin. In a free market capitalism you vote with your feet.  In a socialistic crony capitalism there exist a state monopoly on currency. Making voting with your feet impossible.

Block size will be a market value not an ad hoc value. It's not up to me individually to put a number on block size limit. Seems like you are making a straw man here. Most big blockers are rather conservative, who is talking about "gigabyte sized blocks", i certainly did not.   
For visa size transactions there will be better options. Like second layer solutions(Lightning, thunder, Cross-chain atomic swaps....).

I agree with a hard fork and I think it should be done as soon as possible, as it becomes more difficult over time to achieve consent. My concern is that this fork will require an additional fork further down the road to increase the block size even further.

Bitcoin is economy by the many not by the few.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:08:38
BECAUSE Bitcoin is very vulnerable with the 1mb spamfilter in place. It make transaktions unreliable when the limit is reached. As an attacker you just have to spend a couple of thousand to shrugge the whole network. Bitcoin is not top notch for transactions anymore, it's just a settlement layer of some sort. And companies like Microsoft probably don't need that or don't want the hassle with stuck transactions.

@_date: 2016-03-12 15:43:04
That question is not relevant as the limit is ad hoc and not based on supply of what the network could handled. A limit lika this would not make bitcoin stronger as it limits growth.

No doubt that the market is asking for a bigger block size. It's probably the reason that the price has stagnated. Twisting and blaming market forces for the shitstorm is not rational at all.

That's an rhetorical question. Does it matter? The block limit today is ridiculous from my perspective as a node operator. I want to set my limits high rather deal with the perspective of the cost of lost adoption in the wake of having people pay enormous transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:25:12

7686 NODES don't really seem to be some sort of a low-water mark if you ask me. And the reason people pass on running nodes i probably economic. There is probably a lack of economic incentive to run a node that is the biggest obstacle.

Thin blocks is awesome, it massively reduces block latency for everyone and is a win-win for miners and nodes. But it's a solution for a competing client as core seem entrenched in the relay network. The miner relay network does nothing for all of the non-mining fully-validating nodes on the network. If core does not integrate thinblocks, then they must have another reason not to want larger blocks.

You don't need to apologize. We are all stressed out from the situation. 
I really don't think I can help you if you don't see any reason to change the AD HOC limit that is the main reason we are having this debate. For god sake it's AD HOC ..... any fee market under it is artificial. Not changing it when it's need is as stupid as not moving decimal places when we need more decimals in the future. BU puts an end to this discussion once and for all and that's what I like about it. A market driven supply and demand block size limit what more could you ask for? I'm not against malleability fixes, fees, linearity, SW or LN. I'm against putting on clothes before showering.

@_date: 2016-01-27 11:38:17
It's not part of my social contract. Why would it be? It's an ad hoc limit to the protocol. Maybe it's part of a antisocial contract, like a decree? A positive law type of thing and totally independent of a social contract. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:45:28
And that has something to do with what i said? We where talking about social contract. 
But while you are at it, do you care to explain how a ad hoc limit that serve no other purpose then a spam filter add value to bitcoin? From my point of view it's the other way around. It's crippling effect would cause great loss to user experience and cause a direct toll on the price of bitcoin. Thus removing value from Bitcoin.

I run nodes for the health of Bitcoin. You see, no nodes, no stable Bitcoin. No stable Bitcoin - the price for bitcoins crash.
The incentive to run a node is to protect Bitcoin and my reward for doing that will hopefully give me return of investment in the future. The worst thing that can happen to me is lack of user adoption due to some limit that drives away new user to competing crypto currencies. That will mean no future reward like MySpace.  
More adoption could spring new innovation like “nodes” that is specialized : SPV serving, txes verifying&amp;relaying, mining, blockchain exploring.

I just explained to you what drives me. 


More user will not mean less fees? Surly you understand that miners are as dependent on adoption as I am? But your plan seem to be to cram more money out of every transaction witch will lead to less adoption and the rise of something else. 


You can do that only because it's cheap to fill the block with the 1mb spam-filter blocking the stream. Imagine paying millions or billions in transaction fees to to accomplish what today just cost the attacker a few thousand dollars. A cheap attack for the attacker but not for all the people putting the time and effort into Bitcoin. Just look at the price drop following the attack. It's the perfect attack for a wealthy attacker.

You are aware that devs broke the agreement with miners? Look up the Hong Kong agreement. Core clearly had miners on the boat with a 2mb hard fork that would be ready within 3 month of the release of SegWit which was expected in April last year.....
What was delivered was SegWit as a soft fork and nothing more. Such a shame!

That is not needed for a minor block size raise. Therefore, we should've raised the block size before implementing something grand like segwit or FT. As I'm sure that you know, flexible transactions also does solve the quadratic hashing issue.

I'm sorry to say this but it looks to me that segwit may only exist as a testnet pipe dream.

As for scaling, segwit was never the scaling solution for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:59:04


So up to 4mb blocks! Additional metrics could also reveal looser limits? Additional metrics like the revelation that thin blocks saves about 1.00TB of bandwidth in a month.  
Segwit will not be implemented any time soon, not as a soft fork anyway. Years of talking and core deliver something that miners especially said they didn't want. Good game.

**A Transaction Fee Market Exists Without a
Block Size Limit**
*Abstract. This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node’s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve. The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk. The latter represents the fees offered by the
transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees. The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner’s profit. The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market—where miners are
incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks—cannot exist since it requires
communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate. The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.*

I do agree with you, we have a strong tax collection system and small black market economy. Unfortunately this will not help save us from the inevitable. We have gone from a proud industrial nation built on laissez faire to a nation totally dependent on government spending. Government is the main buyer of goods and services produced in Sweden. Add to it that we are large net importer of most things, including food, because of the high taxes makes it impossible to produce here. This will end badly i think. We will starve when things hit the fan. 


The reason that you can tie an elephant to a rope that he can easily tear off is because you strap it on him when he was young and couldn't tear it. People here think they are free and if you tell them otherwise you get empty stare as they do not understand what you talking about. And our government are master at hiding taxes. People in general do not know how much tax they pay. In combination with that they do not realize how little they get back in services. If we take a salary that is pretty average in Sweden. Let's say 25,000 sek, then you pay 17 000 sek in taxes each month, all inclusive. That's 53% of your salary, little confusing maybe, but some taxes deducted before you receive your money in the envelope.

As a node operator i do understand you. I think we should have more stake in the game. The slave-/Tragedy of the commons-/charity model regarding nodes is not working in the favor of bitcoin. We should have more saying in how our hard drives and bandwidth is being used and we should prosper based on our contribution. This would make this whole bock size issue a none issue. However it's a bit ideologically because i bring no real solution.  Running a node will always be less risky, in terms of capital investment, then running a miner. And with lesser stake comes lesser responsibility.  
That said. There will always be a government of some sort. The big bulk of people are not fit to make decisions. Milgrams experiment showed that beyond a reasonable doubt i think. And the people that has most to lose is probably the once most fit to call the shots. 
Best option is to build a system that don't need any shots to be called by emotional humans. Flexible block size cap or removal of blocksize limit altogether. Not changing the block size limit is as stupid as not changing the decimal place when more decimals is needed in the future. But i'm sure we will run in to exactly the same type of debate when that problem occurs.

I do respect the core developers, but i don't trust them to have the final say. Having developers deciding what changes to run with is probably a worse option then having node operators running the show. 
I don't understand why you hate SW as a HF. It will be better and safer. It's a win - win. I'm sure you understand that SW as a HF will take some more time. And that is maybe why you don't like it but consider that SW was never intended as a scaling solution. It just happen to scale bitcoin, but the best and the most obvious option would have been just to increase the block size. But developers just had to go with the convoluted option... Developers developing for developers. That is why i don't trust them.

Yes but nothing that will help bitcoin in the near future. 
Like Block size increase?
Classic is standing still at 6% of the over all hash rate - forget it!
Like SegWit?
Much of the hashing power has already said they're not going to run segwit until a hard-fork is released - forget it!
Like Lightning Network?
It will not run without SegWit. - forget it!
@_date: 2016-05-11 12:52:32
What is wrong with SegWit as a hard fork? No one is taking someone as a hostage! All classic miners loves segwit. But remember that segwit is a big change and a hard fork is probably the best way to find if there is consensus for it.

"Much of the hashing power" - lets not argue about it. If you like to think it's just 6% that's your opinion. That is ok.  
Why is demanding a HF a threat? I'm sure a HF SW will pass. I have not heard anyone complain about SW on the classic side. And most miners are not classic miners. The only complain i have heard is that it should be done as a HF. And that is a fair and resonable demand in my book. 
Being "big" it's probably not the reason. I'm no expert in the matter and was likely wrong. I think the argument is that a HF of SW would make it more elegant and safer and it would improve its design and overall functionality.

It's an ad hoc limit. It has nothing to do with supply other then in an artificial way. A natural supply constraint would be a measure of what transaction fee a miner finds value to mine for him to break even or make a profit. A rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node’s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit.
 bitcoin.org/papers/feemarket.pdf


The current limit in transactions has nothing to do with "monetary supply". It has much more in common with the eight decimal places. Failing to change the ad hoc limit of TSP is as economic foolishness as failing to change the decimal places when more decimals is needed. It's economic foolishness because business will go to somewhere else.

Yes it would be next to impossible due to the prisoner's dilemma. 
I do think most miners will serve there customers first. And that is the power that is holding back corruption. Maybe state intervention into mining will change that. That's my only worry. The system works perfectly as it is. And miners are probably most fit to be gate keepers because they have the most at stake. Having some other voting mechanism would do more harm then good in my opinion. So the options are, be a voter and put your money where your mouth is by mining bitcoin, exit vote to some alt-coin or accept changes.

Why would i include the guys with worthless old ASICs? There voting power is no greater then someone that don't mine. Your voting power is equal to your hash rate. 


I don't see any problem with this, because i don't think more voters equals greater result. And some wealth stays with mines and some hit the exchanges. So what? Mining stacks of bitcoin yesterday was a lot more easy then it is today. And a miner today is by far more invested both in money and in knowledge then any old school miner with tonnes of bitcoin. The point I'm trying to make is that it is impossible to get an equal system and we should not even try to strive towards an equal system. We need to recognize that this system, as it is, is good enough. More at stake equals more to loose. And if old school bitcoin users with stacks of bitcoin wan't to preserver there wealth against some malicious bitcoin miner. Work those old school bitcoins of yours, start mining again!
So what solution do you propose? More voters for the sake of voting? One user equals one vote kind of western style """democracy"""? What is the beauty of your system? I'm all ears!

The block size limit is ad hoc. It has nothing to do with what you said.  
@_date: 2016-05-22 19:24:27


Clients do not need to keep the entire blockchain. There are going to be historical transactions that no longer have any coins associated with them. This means that clients could, today, purge a large chunk of the database.
This was mentioned in the original whitepaper:
\/7. Reclaiming Disk Space
Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:49:56
The only thing about SW that i don't like is the urgent high risk approach. Unfortunately all eggs are in the SW basket. And that is sad, because changing the block size to buy time would have been a less risky bet. That said i really like SW and run both a core- and a classic node. I don't know why we should fear that node operators wouldn't accept or block segwit.

There is no controversy behind the 21 million cap and therefore it will be immune to proposals to change it.

We are already at phase 2 it seems, the block limit hasn't always been 1MB - it has been changed before. 
So you are married to the idea of the unscientific ad hoc limit of a 1mb spam filter. And absolutely no one or anything will change your mind? I get it! 
The only reason to change the 21 million limit, as i see it, would be if YOU, gmaxwell, would block the stream of changing the decimal place when more accounting units are needed. And with your track record of being unscientific we might as well just prepare our self to raise the 21 million cap. Some FUD thrown back at you!

There is a theory that revolves around the idea of free-market capitalism which essentially is the idea that the ethereum developers should not intervene and that the economy could and should control itself naturally, heal and adopt. Ofc in the short run ETH would have take a bigger hit economically if history wasn't tampered with. But I think that tampering with the history comes with a enormous price in this case. Not only did they sell the "immutability" title for a mere price of $150m. But there will probably be no end to the cost of bailing out the losers. Urging people to no do something is probably less effective then to let them do things and fail. Because people that invested in the DAO should be parted from there money if it failed and rewarded if it succeeded. When history was rewritten the investors in the DOA could go on as nothing had happened. And that don't only derive investors from a great learning experience, it sends a clear signal to the market that risk is not associated with investing in Ethereum projects because if something goes wrong, then just put pressure on the establishment and they will go and rewrite history. 
And if you wanted a better option i would say, use some of the pre-mined coins and bail out some single mom who was brutally forced into investing here life savings into the DAO and make one hell of a media spectral about it. And let the rest of the fat cats starve. Bailing out your fat cat friend was probably the worst option. Time will tell.
