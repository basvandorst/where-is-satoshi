It's a Unicode character. There are only 127 ASCII characters and you've seen them all.

So Bitcoin Cash bad, Bitcoin Cash Futures not bad? I'm getting mixed messages here.

You can't actually know if something is secure, at best you can know that reputable people have tried and failed to find security holes.

The formula in the F column is weird, it is always based on E5 (the current price),  instead of the month prior. 
Oh I get it, never mind, it's calculating the average monthly gain since that time, as you were, I'll show myself out.

The authorities? I wasn't aware that using a pseudonym or just generally being hard to find was a crime.

There, there.

Jesus fuck, did you have to paste this exact bullshit comment six times into this thread?

As long as a 12 word private key. Unfeasibly long and expensive to brute force. There would be many better (cheaper) options for getting to your BTC, such as kidnapping, extortion, hacking or spying.

You can buy stuff directly with BTC. Not everywhere obviously but many places will happily accept BTC. Other than that, sell them on an exchange and wire the money to your bank, or sell on LocalBitcoin for cash.

Well technically, all of the other Bitcoin users end up with his fortune, because Abe has only half of the key and Bob can't tell him where the rest is.

Yes and no. The 12 words give him an entire different private key, but he's also halfway to generating the correct private key.

All this line-drawing-on-graphs looks so intimidating to a layperson such as myself. Part of me wants to wonder why those lows should be connected, and why not those other lows further in the past, or what it will mean when the lines of the channel intersect in the near future, or if it matters that the top line of the channel doesn't actually touch the highs, but then I remember that there are some things I will just never understand. So cheers! This sounds like good news!
