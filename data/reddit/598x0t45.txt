I tend to stick to what I call to alternative exchanges for actual exchanging, and then more regular exchanges for trading. 
Bitquick, localbitcoins, paxful, etc. personally I find cash deposits quickest/least costly to get fiat in so I choose bitquick. 
But yes sometimes people want to go outside of banking hours or waiting 1-2 hours is too long.

This may sounds stupid, but why are they restricting money going in. I get that capital controls stop outflow of money, but aren't inflows of cash what they want to happen? Is it just cause the companies wouldn't have the cash to give even if money was sent in.

No they had meant with that specific ATM which charges about 19-20% check that specific operator on coinatmradar they're expensive. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:12:35
People forget just because bitcoin is 'costless' or low fee, doesn't mean the world around it is. Rent, electric, internet, service providers. so if rent for that space in the mall is $300, electric $50, internet, $50, and let's say it is operator serviced so it's simply opportunity cost the owner gives up. $400 on the low side of the costs of running it, would be something around 3.3k a month in sales to break even. That is with the 12% fee. If we go off unicorn dust and hippy farts and only charge lets say 5% that number jumps up to 8k a month. Not to mention the cost of the machine itself needs to be annualized in there.

@_date: 2015-07-03 18:04:28
That's reasonable and for the majority I do keep off of coinbase. I just had some leftover there. The implication of the original poster seemed to be that I shouldn't use any central processes to receive btc and instead should only do local hand to hand deals or mine. I would love a decentralized exchange to get USD to bitcoin. The only exchange I saw required me to have double the capital necessary or something like that and it going in escrow last time I saw it. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:57:26
Or to just show we don't want to deal with this bullshit and will go to any alternative... I'm not big on coinbase, but short of dealing with inflated prices on Localbtc not many places to go to besides mining.

I think it's this one, 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:35:39
If they are in the US it sounds like they are operating as an illegal MSB or MTL, in addition the 10k or larger sale if they didn't file a CTR could also throw them in more heat with the feds as they don't take too kindly to those things. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:38:49
That's average, but local atm operators in Chicago usually charge about 15% to 20% rockitcoin and digital mint specifically who are two of the larger people in the market. This machine charges 9%, not amazing, though a lot more fair than the standard rates in the area.

If you sell on bitquick pretty sure it settles same day since they do cash deposits only. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 11:52:34
Because normal smart phone apps probably do not work with multisig uploading of private keys is my guess, you probably could do it on electrum with a laptop
@_date: 2016-10-06 05:32:18
So I'll get shit for this, but honestly an ATM might be a decent option for you. Yeah they overcharge, but even 10% on btc now is still only $60 over spot vs $100, most companies only want ID after you drop over a couple grand into their company. 
Other then that I personally buy on bitquick, similar to localbitcoins, but better escrow protection. I was on paxful for a bit, but those dudes getting arrested sketched me out to be honest. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:54:03
That and they probably charge extra fees

To be honest the ID thing is pretty standard across the board at this point. From my understanding it doesn't actually do anything like put you on a list or anything they just need it for accounting records and etc... like a normal business. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:32:28
How can you consider this legitimate if you count dark net markets in the mixup. They have an inherited risk of losing everything due to LE or exit scams. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:16:20
Which is understandable it leads to a bad precedent, and brings the whole marked coins fear about. Im curious who plans to keep these coins BTC-e or will they give them to someone, as BTC-e doesn't seem to be big on legalities. Then will they do this for all coins or just the 'big' cases. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:14:00
go to coinatmradar.com, there are cheaper machines in chicago. Check out coinflip or Athena, both have better rates. Of course the rates matter less unless you are buying more where the few % matters. Red leaf tends to charge murder 18-25% I think, the ones I mentioned are 8-11%~. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:51:14
No I don't expect the 'victims' to get their coin back, begging the question is btc gonna honorably just give it to LE or keep it for themselves?

Localbitcoins, bitquick, paxful all have options to get coins at spot range. They may not be liquid enough for some people, but that can be fixed by people using alternate markets more. 
Also coinbase exchange price seems to be higher by about 1% on top of their fees they charge.

At this point there are a fair amount of other ways to get cash into bitcoin then just circle or coinbase or exchanges.

Paxful has been doing it for a while secretly. 
Hi everyone,
There is absolutely no deposit fee.
Please keep in mind that when you send all your bitcoin out miners fee is not added or deducted from the send-out amount but from the remaining balance on the account as a result your balance becomes negative -0.0008 BTC. This amount is used to cover the miners fee and our costs to blockchain partner BitGo which is not a Paxful fee.
You may see on block explorer that actual miners fee for your transaction is sometimes smaller. Reason for that is we do not know upfront miners fee so an average amount of miners fee is charged. As a result when you make a new deposit or buy bitcoin again, this small amount is deducted from your new balance."
@_date: 2016-07-21 03:43:42
But is the eye patch real or fake? I'm too invested to not know if that fad is coming back. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:55:56

hes discussing a phishing sort of bitcoin program that displays false numbers. This knowledgable person in situation would send them a link maybe to download the program they think is equal to something like bitcoin qtin reality it is a malicious program designed to allow a newcomer to think they recieved a bitcoin. Its a con artist risk that is sort of akin to not false money but the deception they have the money when they don't. It's possible just requires the right market to use on if its a knowledgable person who doesn't jump in head first I have a hard time believing it would be as sucessful. I mean that risk is equal almost though to fake gold or silver, or a false site attack, educations probably the best defense.

I don't argue some of them very well may be. However please let us realize that there are plenty of morons in government who are just plain stupid as well.
