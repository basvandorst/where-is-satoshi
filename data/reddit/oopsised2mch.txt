True, I understand that in order for this to make any sense, he would need to be independently wealthy and just working his day job for the fun of it.  But for someone who actually uses the money coming in their paychecks, seems like it makes more sense in every way financially to get paid in dollars, then decide at that time if you'd like to buy more BTC or not.

I feel like it would be a lose/lose scenario.  If it's the first case and the value of BTC rises too much for his company's liking, they are going to fire him.  There's no way he can wink at them and say ahhh, but you agreed to this!  They will just say yeah too bad, we're not paying you three times what we were last month.  If it goes the other way and BTC crashes to $2,000 or $5,000, he's just screwed himself out of more than half his paycheck.

I feel like the important point to be gained here is that putting the mental energy into getting a side gig will give better returns that bitcoin ever could when you are talking a portion of $70 invested.  If you spend 12 hours reading articles and learning more about bitcoin, then invest your $20, even if bitcoin goes to $100,000 the the end of the year, you've only got $200.  
Spend that 12 hours of effort preparing to get a job (even part time!) making $16-20/hr over winter break and into next semester.  This could be seasonal work in a warehouse where they are desperate for warm bodies and pay at least $16/hr here in the midwest, or you could work in a call center doing the soul-sucking job of telemarketing (I made $20/hr doing this 20 years ago).  Just doing this for 20 hours a week means each WEEK you make $400 before tax.  
There you go!
