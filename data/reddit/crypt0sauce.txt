It looks like a lot of the other "Crypto sites" you see around.  I preferred the simplicity of the old/current one....but that's me   ¯\\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯

That's pretty damn cool. Please Jesus let it happen. 
How do we get it to become an official ascii symbol etc ?

Ok so that "Cointiply" site claims to be a bitcoin faucet but it's not really a faucet in my humble opinion if they are making you do work for it..ie filling out surveys and watching videos.   
Back in the day, many many moons ago...Bitcoin and crypto faucets were free, you could go and visit..put in your coin wallet address and you'd get sent a small amount to play around with.   
Then advertising got hold of this and yeah....now every faucet is some kind of survey filling shitsite.   
Even so, they pay out tiny amounts of satoshis and like you say that came up to £8.... again..many moons ago I saw articles where bums and people who slept on the street in the USA but managed to get an old laptop or smartphone were using BTC faucets to get money for food.. so while you might think it's a waste of time,  if you were homeless and doing surveys meant you got £8 to eat...Im sure you would do it ;-)

Bitcoin is not  anonymous...it's more **Pseudonymous**  \- where each wallet address can be tracked to one user or multiple wallet addresses can be tracked to one user   
example:  I buy 10 BTC from local bitcoins..    I then stupidly transfer those to an exchange for god knows what reason...and then I transfer them to an illegal site.   
All the police would have to do is get access to my localbitcoins.com account - once they have my wallet address there they can scan the blockchain and follow my BTC to the exchange..  if they manage to get access to my exchange account and get the wallet address there, they can trace it further and see where the coins were sent.   
It's all about how smart a detective you are... All the information is publicly available in the Bitcoin blockchain (public ledger)  - you just dont know which Human corresponds to what Bitcoin address.

Yep it's 100% real. I commute to Waterloo every day for work and I've seen this a few times.

Uhmm... Feathercoin and Litecoin can both offer cheaper fees than that....   
Please don't ban me, its a simple fact.  I support Bitcoin (BTC) 100&amp;

zoom out :-)    - the "bubble"  hasn't even started!  
Go Bitcoin!!!

I can confirm - I used the same and similar usernames on both MTGox and BTC-E
I've had password reset requests from 3 of my BTC-E accounts.

Read the original white paper from satoshi. 
In 10 years we will look at TB like we do MB now.

As the price swings up and down you'll see more transaction throughput....usually. 
a lot of people do think the bitcoin network was attacked/spammed and I think so too.   There are a lot of bad actors from (but not limited to) the Bitcoin cash community that are trying to hurt Bitcoin at the moment.
