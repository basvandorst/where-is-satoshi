You don't consider emailfromdeath a 3rd party?

Don't worry, you didn't miss anything

Can someone explain?

You're an idiot

150W * $0.06/kWh * 24h/day = $0.216/day
Each 1070 would only cost $0.216 per day to run. A 1070 can easily make $5 per day.

People already bid on transactions by the transaction fee. The higher you set your transaction fee the higher you're bidding for your transaction to be mined first. Miners get to choose which transactions to mine first, and obviously they will choose the transactions with the highest fees. So in the end, the highest bidder gets their transaction mined first.
Can you explain how what you're proposing is different that the current system?

Why would you link him to bitcoin mining...

The miners' rewards are not random. There is a set number of BTC per block mined regardless of transaction fees. The transaction fees are an added bonus on top of the already known block reward. The transaction fees are also not random because it's based on market forces (people competing for faster transaction times).

It does, as soon as your transaction is received by a miner and you're the highest bidder, the miner will start mining your transaction. Every miner that has received your transaction will be mining a block that includes your transaction, ensuring that your transaction will be mined in the next block. If a miner has not received your transaction because of latency and he mines the next block without your transaction, then your transaction won't be mined as soon as possible (next block) despite your being the highest bidder. But that's not solved by your proposal either.
Tell me how your proposal solves this.

A "fixed hourly wage per transactions processed" makes no sense. Are you asking for a fixed hourly wage or a fixed payment per transaction? If you're asking for payment per transaction, that's already how it works (fixed reward per block + transaction fees). And a fixed hourly wage is just fucking stupid, payment should only be given for work done, and how would you prove how much someone has worked if not based on how much work he submits to the network?

Passwords aren't assigned. Each possible password corresponds to an address which is calculated by a hash function. If your password is the same as someone else's password, you two will have access to the same address.
