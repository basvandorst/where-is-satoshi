You make a valid point. But does the poor and uneducated child care if a rich person donated a hefty sum of money to help build a school carrying his name? I'm not sure that the child would care. Giving your last penny to charity may seem noble, but in the end it isn't wise to do that, considering you don't have money to eat anymore. Of course I understand, that the poor lady makes a much greater sacrifice than some guy who empties his money bag onto the offering table. But well, people much wiser than me probably already took that parable apart piece by piece and came to a different conclusion than me.

Ha! Look at us! Talking in a foreign language (English isn't my first language either) about some guy who maybe lived 2000 years ago on a magic internet money board! ;)

I didn't want to discourage you from giving to charity. I think that every penny helps. But I don't think that Jesus should look down on the people giving a lot of money and maybe making a grand gesture out of it. Pecunia non olet, money doesn't smell.

I don't agree with Jesus here. At the end of the day, all coins go into one sack and the coin from that poor woman will be one of hundreds and her sacrifice will not mean that much. To her, the sacrifice means that she doesn't have anything to eat that day. Or week. I don't know the parable, but I think that was a stupid move by that poor lady. :D

Right. Best thing you can do is to secure your wallet tightly. A very good password (&gt;20 characters), backup on one or multiple USB devices, don't use online wallets, because they are bound to get hacked. Only use offline wallets. Don't put too much coins in one wallet; instead use multiple wallets with different passwords.
