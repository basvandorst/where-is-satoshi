Very helpful - thanks :)

I have put some numbers together, I think it is trivial for a majority miner to flood the mempool with low fee transactions, so other txs have to add higher fees.
Peer review is welcome as I don't know if I have covered all angles:

Such a unlikely move by that govt, will help bitcoin to evolve beyond such an intrusion. The hash difficulty will adjust and miners outside China will continue mining with increased incentive and increased chance of reward. There will be temporary price adjustment until new difficulty is set (some days).

Chinese Miner's hardware is only good for the bitcoin mining algorithm 'sha256'. So at best, the Chinese govt can make an altcoin.

Volatility in Price has significantly reduced in recent month. I suspect a lot of the speculators are now moving their bets into altcoins, as the volatility seems to have come down as the market cap for altcoins has increased. Also, speculation is now not just in and out of Bitcoin/fiat. People are now staying in crypto-coins more when betting against bitcoin price.
This may not widely be seen as progress, but a drop in volatility does add a network effect as people can more easily price things in bitcoin. Not there yet, but on the way.

Thank you
I understand there are many competing for the block at the same time. My question stems from a dispute I had with someone about how consensus changes and network-wide acceptance. I posit that there is actually more security for a miner if they cannot be distinguished from other nodes, and they can gain some 'needle in a haystack' like obscurity when they operate among many nodes. If you cannot determine if a node communication is from a miner or a FVN, you still need to verify to then propagate/broadcast. This is more in line with headless network design. If the miners stood out as heads, they would be a lot easier to target. My concern is more about consensus level attacks.

I remember reading that thread - is it this one?
@_date: 2016-02-03 04:33:51
$10k/day now rivals a block reward at current prices - or $370 x 25= $9250. Also, this amount has risen from $5K in August - which reflects a wider recent adoption. So it is probable to say, that in another 6 months we could be looking at around $15K tx fees per day vs a block reward of around 5K - which of course is based on the current price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-03 04:39:12
and how does the bitcoin price factor in to that? The miners are well aware of the block reward halving and have factored this into their cost model. The price is the determining factor for them and their risk calculations. In general, the halving of the block reward makes bitcoins more scarce, and in theory at least this is likely to have an upward potential in the price. We can't keep our fiat hats on when doing bitcoin calculations.

Love your work Luke, but that is a terrible diatribe against anarchy - a hit piece if you will. Most anarchist subscribe to the idea of organising society without tyrannical rulers. They would be happy to do away with rulers (but still with rules) and they envision a more mature society where people are educated enough to realise that "harm to my neighbours ultimately harms me, joy to my neighbour ultimately brings joy to me". The part about doing away with god, family, and community is taking the literal concept to the extreme and is not something most anarchists ascribe to. Filing one's pleasures ends at the golden rule, you can fill your pleasures as long as you don't harm others, and your freedom to act ends where the freedom of another starts - tl;dr; courtesy, interest in the wellbeing of others as this creates a better society for the individual to exists in. Countries exist in a state of anarchy omong eacother and over time they develop rules and treaties to co-exist and trade and to benefit each other. If they are more harmonious like the Scandanavians, or more unharmonious like x, it has more to do with the level of education and cultural enlightenment. An anarchist can believe in God or a higher creator, and can have a direct relationship. It is a free choice if you want a man-in-the-middle, or organised religion - or not. 
Proudhon is so poorly charecterised by that definition, so artful, so distinct for his time, so hated by hierarchical thinkers. Such a shame that states and their war thrsty propaganda machines would have people think that anarchy is just looting and filling ones desires - propagating such banality; that is what is evil.

Can a node distinguish if inbound data is coming from a mining node or from a non-mining node like a full verifying node? 
AFAIKT, there is no way for a node to distinguish, and that is by deliberate design. If this is true, then there is no such thing as 'mining nodes', there is only nodes that got the block, and nodes that didn't get the block - or in other words, there can only ever be one node that can be called a 'miner' at any block interval, and any other nodes that were mining are indistinguishable from full mining nodes. This also explains why node/miner signalling is done over a block period, as there is no way for the 'miners' to all signal at once.

... fees are as follows:
- Bitcoin.com 2.5%
- Credit card processing by Simplex 5% ($10 minimum)

The healthy functioning of a P2P network requires nimble nodes to be able to replicate a truth state of the whole network. These were originally all mining nodes, when the network was small, but as hashpower hardware centralised, the network was at risk of losing its P2P essence. Without the implementation of FVNs, and if only left to mining nodes, we would literally only effectively have less than 100 nodes on the network, and 50%+ could be centralized to a certain legal jurisdiction. This would make them vulnerable to a state level attack (round 5 guys into a room). If left only to miners and SPVs, even the best-intentioned miners could be 'manhandled'. FVNs are a solution for filling in the void and keeping the p2p network headless. Nodes that misbehaved are ostracized by 'peers' (regardless if they mine or not) and this ostrification happens in tandem by all nodes on the network, so a state level attack would be ostrasized, even if it managed to coerce a large majority of mining nodes. By osmosis, business signatory attacks can also be rendered useless by the same token. 
FVNs, even pruning FVNs are a Bitcoin user's only defence that the network will not be changed without their overwhelming consent. And if that technically slows down the network by a fraction, that is a small price to pay, because, at the end of the day, the real Bitcoin network is the network of users, a social network if you will, and not novel to just technical parameters.

I had a look at the block and yes these were included in a block by a miner  -lots of them. Without moving into full tin hat territory, I wonder if a miner would do this and then include in own block to pay himself?

OK, so the opposite is true - the less "ASIC-resistant" an algorithm is, the more de-centralised the inevitable ASICs will be - as they will not need to be made by specialists to get around the "resistance", and so, the less specialised the hardware has to be - it can be accessed by a wider distribution of people. Makes perfect sense! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:39:29
Bitfury included these first in the block above other higher paying fee transactions &amp; straight after the coinbase in block 
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:13:33
Good point about it being a low fee - but wouldn't that also distort fee calculations? 
I don't think that the transaction with the address trying to pay itself is confirming - it is just repeating thousands of times. The confirmations have been when another input is added - see here:

Dr Craig Wright is very selective about the information that is out there in the wild about him, he is very cryptic, elusive - and i believe he is interested in deceiving new/naive Bitcoiners for his own means. This information sourced from his blog, which he since deleted shows that this is a man not to be trusted: pastebin.com/v566GLT8
Jihan Wu owns a the company that produces most of the ASIC mining equipment used by most miners. He also runs his own mining and as a result of being a manufacturer, he has influence over how these chips are supplied to the wider public. He is positioning himself to have more power over 4he protocol - i see it as a Proof of Stake move - something that would weaken Bitcoin.
Adam Back understands the core values of bitcoin in a way that is nearest to my heart, he understands autonomy and that Bitcoin is a world worthy game changing technology ( and not merely another payment system designed to enrich a few )as it gives Bitcoin users Autonomy over their wealth, money and ultimately families - one of the only autonomous tools that gives individuals and communities leveraged power against being dominated by institutions, governments or corporations. He has cypherpunk roots and shows more interest in upgrading the technology safely while maintaining its unique features -- and enhancing them with privacy enabling features -- as opposed to others who are more interested in Bitcoin’s payments capabilities be upgraded in such a way that suits their business models - and erode its unique capabilities.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:42:20
Initially, yes! Then he went on to explain how he was convinced that it works - explicitly. The rest you wrote is subjective and a matter of opinion, not fact. 
If you show any interest in facts, you can comment on the link I gave - pastebin.com/v566GLT8

Thank you for being tireless in explaining things - repeatedly.

There is one further angle that can't be ruled out, and that is a well-coordinated state infiltration of bitcoin to dilute its basic tenets and principles. It would involve a detailed conspiracy between multiple players, it would include a war theater, a carefully scripted timeline and hefty black budget. Courts cases, tax investigations and the like can all be used to create smokescreens to add depth to the characters. MO is to sow discord and ad obfuscation at every level that requires organic community support and coordination. In now way is it a takeover attempt, more likely a muddying of the waters so it can not gain strength through coherence and emergence of a clear narrative. To me, this is the only front that the whole suga would eb able to establish any success to further establish continual funding. Such incentive models exist within state and dificult to understand cryptography is fertile ground for establishing a budget.

I think he is in cahoots with CSW. I must say that I first looked into him around the time of PW reveal, and not so much since, so I am not sure where his narrative has traveled since. But at the time, it came to my own conclusion that he was piggy-backing on CSWs publicly available info. I am unsure of the motive. I imagine the rights to a novel/movie/expose to an isider view of the early days of Bitcoin, Who is Satoshi etc would eb quite expensive, if you could convince enough people that you have the goods. Again, take away all of CSWs claims and PWs claims, and there is nothing outside of these two peoples claims pointing to any of them having that involvement. 
I also wouldn't hasten to add multiples to anyone's credibility based on one person's claims especially when it divides to the one making the claims. All very fantastical and elaborate though !
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:10:42
There is basically nothing linking Kleiman to bitcoin outside of CSW's attestations and whatever they are worth. Even the ongoing court case is based on information CSW has volunteered. The only thing linking CSW to the early days of Bitcoin is his word and an endless trail of altered documents, dates, innuendo and technobabble.
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:33:39
All this is based on PW's own account. Interestingly his story corroborates with all publicly known information about CSW at the time that he penned it. So we have PW's own account and CSW's own account - and that is the sum whole of this line of reasoning. Also, PWs story reads as a 'fill in the gaps' to CSW's publicly available - researchable on Google and archive.org -timeline, and is most likely based on this research.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:58:34
Not entirely. I posit that in creating his story (PWs), he extensively researched the publicly available information around CSW - his claims, his ommissions, his known/researchable internet footprint at the time - and then worked around these, or worked them into his story's timeline. Authors of fiction use similar techniques when constructing a story and building up their characters.
I don't find PW to be entirely convincing - when challenged, he either doubles down or becomes vague - example thread:
