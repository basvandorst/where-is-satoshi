Thanks for your reply. But if it is susceptible to this, isn't this considered a big gamble then? It just feels like "verified by VISA" all over again.

This theory makes some sense, but I have two issues with it, although they may very well be false and this theory correct. 
First, I don't see how this is necessarily double profit as the buying of real BTC and selling of real BTC would in a perfect scenario even out each other. So unless the manipulator somehow manages to make the price increase less when buying than the decrease is when selling it would even out. 
Second, If I recall correctly the volumes on shorts on CBOE were pretty low (I don't have the exact numbers, please arrest me if I'm wrong), and the amount of bitcoins to move the market up to ~18K and then down to ~9K would definitely need to be in the thousands i would assume. So it would be pretty damn risky to buy such a high amount of BTC for such a small possible profit in futures.

How is running through big hubs like banks less centralised than big blocks? Serious question, not trying to bash.

I admit I don't understand much of the lightning network, but based on other posts it seems that running LN nodes is hard to do for regular users because it's very power-demanding, and will likely be run by bigger setups. So this then sounds very much of what BCH was criticised for; bigger blocks leading to the inability for regular users to run nodes leading to centralisation. What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:48:07
Thanks! Damn, that sure gives opportunities for manipulation - as if there wasn't enough already.

If I understand correctly cash-settled BTC-futures longs/shorts won't affect the market (directly), as no actual BTC are bought or sold. Am I understanding it correctly?

AFAIK every coin that is added by every exchange is added without notice, so to attack coinbase on this matter doesn't make much sense. Would you be as pissed if it was XRP?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:15:48
Sorry you are right, you used "people", I read it too fast. I don't think coinbase should differ in how they handle new coins based on the coin's reputation though, every new coin should be released in the same manner.

Come on... This is just shady promotion of Karbon, similar stuff happening in r/monero
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:44:49
Is there a blockchain explorer for Bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:04:22
This is just shady promotion of Karbon. Similar stuff happening in Monero thread. Whenever I post link my post is deleted...
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:12:01
Hard to tell, you'll have to wait 6 blocks, and they show up quite irregularly: 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:59:16
Christ guys, don't fall for this shitty Karbon commercial. Similar stuff in Monero thresd

Possibly dumb question exposing my non-tech knowledge, but is there anywhere you can observe % of transactions that are segwit. I realize the number is probably extremely low at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:03:15
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:25:16
Yeah, but that was the total increase. If you look at bitfinex you can see that it rose around 200 within one minute column (it was more like 7.5 - 7.7, than 7.4-7.7 that I said earlier)

Man, sometimes Americans believe way too much in the function of the free market. In theory you will have free choice, in reality probably not so much. Why do you think the gov is pushing for this? People don't know or don't care what's put on their heads, and will usually just follow the commercials/biggest companies. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:33:18
Regardless of your position on BCH and BTC do you really encourage this? IMO this is the exchange taking control of your crypto. Please argue against me on this one, there may be arguments I haven't thought about.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:56:12
Was anyone watching as it went from ~7.4 to ~7.7 on Bitfinex? I missed it, was that a single order or what?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:44:54
This was happening on bitfinex, not gdax. They correlate, but not 100%. Was just interested in whether there was a big whale jumping in on bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:40:00
Good points, agree with you - the exchange has no obligations. But that people celebrate the exchange doing this instead  of passing out BCH is just plain stupid IMO, but obviously it's better than not getting anything at all.
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:07:54
True, but his source is "a few local industry experts" with no specifics and no citations, which honestly is about as good a source as what he is criticising de Vries for.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:34:37
Thanks, but my argument was that security and centralization are issues with lightning, making it no better than some altcoins. My knowledge here is very limited though, that is why I am asking.
Edit: why the downvoting? I'm seeking knowledge and asking questions
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:42:57
you may very well be right, I'd appreciate some elaboration though. Regards to security I'm pretty sure even core devs have said txs on lightning is a lot less secure than on the main chain. My wording in the last reply was bad though, I should say less secure instead of security issues
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:55:34
Not what I said at all. I tried to get a grasp of it, as my first impression was that it had the same issues as altcoins are critizised for. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:33:47
At what capacity would you consider LN to be "safe"? I know this is a very relative term in this matter, but say as safe as Visa (and yeah I know VISA isn't perfectly safe?). 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:37:53
Thanks, and I agree. But what I meant was I felt previous poster believed they did so for strategic reasons. I've seen this conspiracy been mentioned a lot, yet noone explaining exactly what the exchanges would actually gain on it. My bad in not explaining well enough.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:38:51
Please enlighten me, as I don't get why there is any reason for an exchange to ever go offline. Aren't their income fees, meaning more txs --&gt; more income.
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:46:53
Reasonably safe from transactions not going through and malicious activity being extremely costly. I realize safe is still not defined, just want some thoughts on at what size it would make sense for a reasonably big actor to prefer LN for (smaller) payments. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:31:19
This is interesting. Is the number 2^24 set in stone or can this be changed in the future? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:57:10
Are there any estimates on at what size (nodes/Btc staked etc) lightning would be considered "safe"? "safe" meaning all transactions going through and malicious behaviour extremely difficult. 
I realize there's a lot of uncertainty, but any feedback appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:43:34
Good news! Any date on this?
