Thank you for your reply.  Beefjerky.com has been in business on the Internet since 1995.  It is a reputable company with thousands of satisfied, repeat customers.
Your suggest to change to "Shipping included" will be seriously considered at the next website refresh.  I again thank you for your insight and good suggestion.

 accepts bitcoin for beef jerky.  Shipping is included in the pricing; so the more you buy the lower per-pound cost.  For example, USD$56.80  will buy 2 pounds, including USA delivery.  That's only $1.78 per ounce, delivered.
$56.80 is presently BTC 0.083456.

Thank you for your insightful comment.
The "free shipping" is explained here:  :: "FREE Shipping explained: The shipping cost is already included in the listed prices. There are no extra added Shipping &amp; Handling charges, nor taxes, added at the end of the ordering process."
A lot of people prefer to pay the first price they see, without any added shipping cost or taxes.  A lot of people think it is a rippoff to post a price then add a lot of shipping cost to the final price.
It is impossible to please everyone, so the Beefjerky.com website attempts to make it easy to order with the first price you see, is the price paid.

Thank you for your kind and thoughtful comment.  The link is to a landing page where the visitor selects their choice of delivery, USA or International.  The shop is on the other side of those links.  Please try it again.

Thank you, 101111.  I have made the correction to that page.

I went to the USPS website and looked up the rate for sending a large envelope via first class to Canada, with one bag of beef jerky.  Because it is a Large Envelope containing items that cause more than 1/4 inch variation in thickness .... The postage rate is: $9.15.  Two bags of jerky would cost $11.95 postage.  Three bags of Jerky would cost $14.75.
I prefer using the Priority Mail Flat Rate envelopes and their fixed postage cost.  Why?  They arrive to the customer faster, and they encourage the customer to buy more than one bag of beef jerky.

The jerky is made from sliced, whole-muscle beefsteak.  It is not a ground/chunked &amp; formed product.  It chews tough, but tears easily along the grain of the meat.  It can be cut with scissors to make bite-sized pieces.

A lot of people appreciate paying the 1st price they see.  They do not like added shipping &amp; handling charges.

Interesting comment.  I've been in business with Beefjerky.com since 1995.  I quit my day-job 10 years ago.  Most of my business comes from repeat customers.  The website has been redone 3 or 4 times to improve its looks and operation in the last 18 years.  In your professional opinion, what is it exactly about the site that "appears unprofessional"?  In your professional opinion, what are the specific features on a site that engenders "trust"?  And finally, what parts of the Beefjerky.com website is making you think its a scam?

Can you recommend a shopping cart that accepts BTC as payment?  The non-BTC area of the website already has a shopping cart that accepts fiat.

I emailed a mate in Oz just now for his mailing address so I can send jerky to him to test this news.  Thank you for posting!

See:  where: "FREE Shipping explained: The shipping cost is already included in the listed prices. There are no extra added Shipping &amp; Handling charges, nor taxes, added at the end of the ordering process."

What are these tools?

In two days thirteen people were able to place bitcoin orders.  The website works just fine!  Stop on by Beefjerky.com and look around.

International shipping is $23.95 to send up to 4 pounds via Priority Mail.

Beefjerky.com does not charge a "premium" for accepting bitcoin.  The website lists the prices in USD.  At the time of a BTC transaction, Coinbase converts the USD total amount to BTC, at that instant's exchange rate.

What is it about the e-junkie cart that is a problem?  It functions quite well and costs me $10 per month with no percentages tacked on each sale.

How much does a "professional redesign" cost?  What surety will be offered that the present top 5 SEO ranking will not go down?  What surety is offered that sales will actually increase enough to offset the redesign cost?  There is a lot of risk to a complete makeover.  Every coder I ever talked to about redesign has never offered any surety to bond their work.

Google Translate is where the existing hilarious translations come from, lol.

 BTC transactions at Beefjerky.com are processed via Coinbase at the current USD/BTC exchange rate.

The site looks just fine to me.  Look at it in the Wayback Machine to see how ugly it used to be in earlier incarnations.
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:10:06
Every time the content is changed, all the translations need to be changed, to keep it "perfect" .

Here is a bag of Final Frontier Jerky next to an inch-ruler and a cm-ruler:   Thank you for asking.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:48:05
Do you have any specific suggestions for improvement?
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:29:42
The shipping cost is already included in the prices.  There are no extra added shipping &amp; Handling charges, or taxes, added at the end of the ordering process.

It cost $5.05 to send a Priority Mail package to a USA address.
It costs $19.95 to send to a Canadian address.
It costs $23.95 to send to every where else.
Its free for me to send to the Space Station, when an astronaut orders it.  Got 20 bags of teriyaki jerky going up soon.
