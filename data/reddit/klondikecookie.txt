There might be a reason for the delay. You might have an input that hasn't been confirmed, hence, your transaction is not confirmed until after that input is confirmed. If you can share your transaction ID here, I can look it up for you. (Remember, only post the transaction ID, and NOT the private key.)

Every transaction has a transaction ID. Which wallet were you using? When you first made this transaction, did it show up on blockchain.info right away? More likely if it's not there now is because it has been expired from mempool.

Try channel  on IRC Freenode. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:36:06


What does this even mean? Your mum has a channel and you respect her and her node but if your mum has no coffee/whatevr that people can buy from, why would they open a channel with her for you to route anything?  You still have a lot to learn how LN works. EXPECT most of channels are sets of channels between buyers and sellers when LN starts out.  And from there they can happen to be "middle nodes" for routing, otherwise, why should anyone keep connecting to useless nodes and waste money in tx fees just to hope that they can "hop" over other useless nodes? 
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:17:04
Were your channel funds all swept by the remote nodes and all long gone? If the answer is 'yes' then I don't see how you can get those funds back, unless you know the owners of the remote nodes and beg them to return your part of the funds.

No. Unless his lnd node was on version 0.6.0-beta or 0.7.0-beta and he has the `channel.backup` then he can restore coins from his channels. If he has only the seed words he can only restore onchain coins that were already in the wallet **before** the rpi died.

@_date: 2019-07-27 08:30:03
This is not true. Eclair and c-lightning often force close channels as much. Eclair is just easier to set up than LND, easier for windows and non-tech users to understand how to set up a lightning node. But LND is better for people who like to build/develop stuff.

@_date: 2019-07-20 04:02:39


This is your amount from that channel, and because it's a dust amount, it's not enough to cover a tx fee so this is why it's in pending and not in your wallet.
Now if you continue to use this node, and if later you have another tx (like if you close out another channel) and you have a bigger amount to sweep, LND sweeper will sweep this dust amount and batch it into the bigger amount, both have enough to pay a tx fee and both will be swept into your wallet.
Also, in such a case like this `abandonchannel` won't work, so don't even bother to try it.

Ugh.. Sorry I just realized my mistake in the post.
CORRECTION: I've been using bech32 address type on testnet LN for over a year and mainnet LN for 8 months... My previous statement was referring to the other segwit address type (P2SH). Needed more coffee to stay awake haha... :-)

@_date: 2018-09-02 22:16:26
One of the reasons for Lightning Network to exist is to save fees. Here's an example: Suppose I'm a coffee addict, and I like to visit Starblocks coffee shop twice a day because it's next to my office and it has great coffee. If each cup of coffee costs around $5 on average, I'd spend about $10 a day (2 txs on-chain), or about $50 a week (5 working days), or $200 a month for coffee (not counting the fees for 40 txs on-chain). 
Suppose we have another fee spike, and let's say the average on-chain fee for each tx is $7, my monthly coffee consumption would be: ($7 x 40txs) = $280 + $200 = $480 
But if I used LN, I'd only have to pay two on-chain txs: one for opening a channel and one for closing, so the txs fees would be $7 x 2 = $14. Monthly coffee costs would be: $200 + $14 = $214. There are  Lightning routing fees but so far they're very little, and I don't think they would be as high as on-chain fees. If someone tries to rob you on Lightning, the worst can happen is you avoid them by having a direct channel to the merchant/person you want to pay, and there's no fee when you pay directly.
Lightning is a great way to save fees for repeat users and customers who want to use bitcoin for their purchases. Coffee purchase is just one example of many examples out there. The sky is the limit.

I'm not convinced either. At first I heard it was someone anonymous who isn't a bcash dev who discovered this bug, now some dude named "Awfulmany" discovered this, who has a disgusting attitude, who wrote a distasteful shitty article and trying to claim credit for himself, at the same time gleefully collecting donations. It's all just a shit show from these ungrateful bcashers.

@_date: 2018-09-23 00:20:55
I would not give this asshole even 1mSAT, not because he doesn't deserve some donation for finding this vuln, but because of how vicious and evil he is from the way he attacks other developers. It would be an insult to all the people he attacked who have protected bitcoin 100 times before without being paid. Did Cory Fields act like this when he disclosed their vuln to them and saved them billions of dollars? Hell no, Cory did not. Cory was more humble and careful in disclosing the vuln to them like a responsible developer, he protected them,  he did not post his BTC address and tell them "here's my address, send me donations here.."   Cory is much more a humble man, did not attack bcash developers one bit.  This is the example how awemany should follow, but he's done himself a big disservice by attacking other developers.  You don't shit where you eat, man. Even if you have some personal anger and grudges, you don't take it out in a blog.  And definitely you should not talk like a bullshiter creating all kinds of crazy conspiracies like this guy has done.

It already happened a few weeks ago with Shitcoin node by Andreas, no organic growth, this number is just all bullshit. Someone's trying to be like Andreas? This isn't helping the LN until there's real organic growth, aka real useful merchants getting onboard, same with growing real users who would buy goods and services from these merchants. People who set up nodes but don't buy or sell anything are just idiots who do harm for LN than help.

Hey, u/CoinGate, thanks for keeping the testnet node up. We're still using your test site to test LN nodes, it works, but I think the node and also probably the site need an update? After an invoice is paid, the site doesn't show that it's paid until we click on button "Mark as Paid". Does your real site do the same thing? if it does, this has to be fixed.

OMG.. dude... please educate yourself, "fork" or "forking" is a very common word in open source projects. That bitcoindotorg site has been created by many contributors, all of the documentation and information on that site were created by the labor of love of many contributors, and Cobra just happened to be given the right to own the site.  So forking the site just means moving/copying the contents to another site, and Achow or anyone in the community has their full right to do so. 
Here's some example of "forking" a website:    Read the first few lines: "Am I allowed to fork Wikipedia?"  YES.  
Here's another example: 
Forking doesn't necessarily mean something dirty, don't let these altcoin forks poison your mind. English has some limitation in word meanings, we just need to understand what each word means in each situation.

u/CoinGate I'm still playing with your test site here... I'm not sure if this is a test site for a real coffee shop but if it is, I would recommend you look at starblocks.acinq.co.  To purchase an item on Starblocks from the first click on an item to the last click for "PAY" it takes only 4 clicks, while on your site it takes 9 clicks. Starblocks has a cool button for "OPEN WITH YOUR WALLET" and when you tap on it, it opens the mobile wallet for you, no copy/paste needed. I think this is cool, so i thought i'd let you know from a user's perspective.

SegWit transactions are bitcoin transactions. But because Segwit is not activated on Mainnet right now so of course your wallet wouldnot be able to receive a Segwit tx even if someone could send it to you. But on Testnet Segwit has been activated for almost a year, get on Testnet and I'll show you how your wallet can send and receive Segwit transactions and they are bitcoin transactions. Do you know Segwit uses P2SH tx type and P2SH was created by Gavin Andresen? You are insulting Gavin by saying P2SH txs aren't bitcoin txs. Stop the fuds and get on testnet, let me know and I'll send some Segwit txs to you.

I haven't listened to the show but this wallet won't die as long as there are supporters/sponsors/shills behind them. They need to point out the real assholes who promote this wallet, and Bitrefill is one of them. As long as people still want to buy from Bitrefill (which I think is a great company btw) but they use this wallet and Bitrefill promotes this wallet, it will keep doing what it's been doing, incompetent or not. One can make excuses for this wallet "because its developers don't know what they're doing" but can't give this exception to a company like Bitrefill, they know what they're doing.

Try to restart your wallet with -zapwallettxes on command-line. Or use your text editor and create bitcoin.conf, then type in one line: zapwallettxes=1, save it and put it in the Bitcoin folder. Then restart your wallet. (It will take some time for the rescan, so be patient and let it rescan.) The coins should show up on your wallet. Then resend.  But before you resend your coins, check with bitcoinfees.21.co for the current fee per byte. (I think 60 sat/byte should be enough to send your tx fast.)

Bitcoin is not just the price.

This is partly Satoshi's fault for designing bitcoin with so much coinbase rewards at the beginning, hence, miners didn't care about accepting free txs.. and users got used to "oh wow.. this is better than other payments with no fee, free transactions" kind of mentality.  Then rewards get chopped off in half every four years, another bad design, now miners have to come up with how they can make users to pay fees and it's been a nightmare drama all around.

We all know that Jihan has never been an honest person.  We also know that Jihan, Haipo (ViaBTC), F2Pool, and HaoBTC want to be in control of bitcoin, because they want power and they want to make bitcoin their own currency.  They are using BU and Roger Ver as tools for their plan. Suppose if they could succeed this plan they would get rid of BU and Ver.  This is the mentality of some Chinese people who think they can own the world's finance and now bitcoin.  And I'm not saying all Chinese are like this.  We have Johnson Lau,  a brilliant Chinese programmer who has done a lot for Segwit. We also have Samson Mow who understands the importance of decentralization and he has done a lot for bitcoin, and there are many other Chinese bitcoiners who support Core roadmap.  But there's still a serious problem with centralized mining China and the chinese mentality of taking  control of bitcoin is real.  Bitcoin is not for you chinese miners to own, you need to get this idea in your head.  There are more users and miners in other parts of the world who will not tolerate your primitive behavior and they will not let you destroy bitcoin.  Shame on you.

This might be true for some altcoins but not for bitcoin. It has been proven on bitcoin that miners don't dictate the course of direction in bitcoin, just look at the UASF BIP148 movement in 2017.

This info is not complete. BLW only receives if you have a channel with another Eclair node and plenty of liquidity there.

And BLW cannot connect/open channels to any c-lightning nodes at all.

So according to your logic, Satoshi was a cartel, because _if it's true that Satoshi was the only miner at the very beginning_ he alone mined about 19600 blocks so he was a cartel. If you have problem with miners allowed to mine empty blocks, go take the blame on Satoshi! 


This is backward thinking and just doesn't make any sense. If bitcoin rewards are low, miners would seek to mine more txs so they can grab the fees, why would they do the reverse and wth does it mean they "will hold bitcoin ransom"? Miners don't always agree on a same thing, so if some miners don't want to mine certain txs they leave money on the table and other miners will grab them.

A big node isn't always a best node. On the contrary, because of the strain on their resources by having too many requests from so many nodes, big nodes are mostly very unstable and flaky, for example, rompert.com node was down for several days. And currently SLEEPYARK (Blockstream node) removed their IP to cut down channels. So, think about it, a channel to a well connected node which is a stable node, not a 'big node'. "Big nodes are good nodes" is a falacy for Lightning Network. Also, often times these big nodes are spam nodes and they might be data collecting nodes which spy on your nodes and transactions. Beware.

I think this command works best with v0.13.0 or v0.13.1, and if it works, your wallet will show the bitcoin you tried to spend again.  But if it doesn't work, try this:  set "mempoolexpiry=1" in bitcoin.conf, restart bitcoin-qt, wait 1 hour, do "abandontransaction ae362692f069880bb65521f89bce541ee8642a1b1a2092b9719575e9e0bdf7af" in debug console again.

I heard he was adopted and they tried to raise him with principles, regardless, his parents aren't responsible for his actions. Roger even called the cops on his father because the father didn't want him to have a car or something, I can't remember the details. Roger is a grown man, he probably has cut his parents off for a long time. Has anyone ever seen him with his parents, or even mention his parents in all his talks? I doubt it. He seems to hate them. So they're not responsible for his actions, and sure, they probably feel bad for his actions but they're definitely not responsible for them.
Some people are just born evil, but not because of their parents. And each person is responsible for their own actions esp. when they're adults, can't keep blaming on their parents, and it's absurd to blame on their "mother", it's totally unfair.

We've already got what you call "cartels". Bitmain is the largest "cartel" there, you're probably a new kid on the block and didn't know. You really need to do a lot reading catchup what Bitmain did the last few years, and surprising that bitcoin is still around. The bottom line you're missing is: Even miners would not want to hurt their income and profits, contrary to what you're saying. Why would a "cartel" want to damage bitcoin after they've spent millions and millions of dollars in mining? There was a chinese millionaire (that I forget his name) who said he had 100M of dollars to hurt bitcoin if bitcoin would not hardfork to his liking, and yea, did he do it? NOPE. It was just a gangster's stupid threat. Miners want to make money, a lot of money, that's why they have their skin in the game by putting up their investment in mining. A cartel could have a lot of hash rate and whatever but if that cartel causes damages to bitcoin, they will lose because holders will dump, bitcoin value goes down, and miners lose the most because they have **sunk costs** in their mining investment. So they are NOT as dumb as you think they are, they're ones of the smartest and most logical thinkers in this space.


Giving what "keys" back to who? You're just rambling nonsense. Anyways, please go do some reading and learning for yourself.

Rasing the blocksize isn't a simple thing. It takes a hard fork and anyone with a simple brain can see it would fail. If we haven't learned from the ETH hf disaster, we shouldn't be too quick to say bitcoin should have a hardfork like that. Literally, bitcoin can't scale on chain. If big blockers want scaling, why are they blocking Segwit?  It seems to me they do know "on-chain scaling" can't work, won't work, won't happen but they keep selling this "idea" to simpletons.

I don't think we can ever know exactly how many txs happen daily on LN because txs on LN are designed to be private. You can write a script and send thousands of txs within a short time on LN because you don't have to wait for blocks.. so yes LN tx volumes are much higher than onchain, whether the chain is BCH or Bitcoin.

Currently we're already using `millisatoshi` in calculating fees on Lightning Network, although it's not used in reality and in settlement on the blockchain. 1 sat is still not worth anything but if some day 1 sat becomes a significant value and needs the next smaller unit then msat is in line.

My node has been running stable since March 16, 2018 (the day after LND Beta was launched on mainnet) and it's LND. I have seen many LND nodes fail because of their hardware, mostly because they run them on fatigue rpi's, some run on flash drives. Hardware plays a big part in running a node, whether it's LND or Eclair or C-lightning.  And because most nodes run on LND so when so many of them fail due to hardware problem or they go offline due to their Internet problem, it makes you think LND has more problems than Eclair. I'm not saying Eclair is not as good but why is it that most nodes are running LND? Have you ever asked yourself that question? If something is not used much and it goes offline, like a tree falls in a forest, does anyone hear the tree fall or even care to know? /s
EDIT: and btw, i think i know the answer why most people would rather use LND than Eclair, but i want to hear from your point of view on it. :D

Very simple. He could have run the SCB recovery that LND now has since v0.6.0, current version is 0.8.0 so this recovery method has been provided for several months now and this guy knew about it but didn't use it, he preferred to run his backup of his .lnd data which has never been recommended since day one. Here's the docs how to run SCB recovery:  
Also, if this money is so important why didn't he ask the devs or volunteers on the slack for advice how to do it before he took it into his own hand. Also, if the breach happened, has anyone seen extra  coin in their wallet? I haven't. He said he had more than 400 channels, if the breach happened, why haven't we heard from 400 people who would say they got some free coins? I am sure someone would be willing to give it back to him. Someone please fill me in on this. Thanks.

It's sexism because we haven't seen him accuse two men (whether straight or gay) of having sex when they do business with each other, but he goes for the common stereotyping prejudice that a woman can't have a rich man to invest and promote her company without sex. There are thousands of men who do business with thousands of women without sex. There are thousands of women who have male friends without ever having sex with them. Roger knows it's not about the sex, but more about the fact that the owner of Square would not invest in Bcash but Bitcoin, and Lightning is just something Roger is using out of spite to insult two individuals who refused to be his friends.  Maybe Jack likes LN because he sees it can make bitcoin more valuable, idk, but saying he likes it because of sex with Stark is just plain stupid below the belt, and it makes Ver a sexist.

The versions they want you to upgrade to have been released the last two months. You can also inspect the code to see if they're "malicious". My guess is the vulns exist in the older versions and nobody knew until now. And I hope most nodes have already updated.

Cool. Currently LND doesn't create invoices for less than 1 sat yet, only c-lightning does. But if bitcoin price keeps going up and there's practical use for msat on bitcoin network then I think we'll see LND move to this direction. Otherwise, there's not really a practical use for unit msat in reality except in calculation for lightning fees currently. But LND can accept invoices for less than 1 sat if you put the configure in lnd.conf `bitcoin.minhtlc=1` under category `[Bitcoin]`.

If you're not familiar with how to set up bitcoin, I would NOT recommend Btcpayserver because you will be on your own.  It would be better to go with OpenNode. Here's their website:   You pay a little fee but it's better than if you try to handle the server by yourself and lose all money there.
EDIT:  And from their pricing page, it says "First $10k free". So I guess your first $10,000 sales will have no fees. OpenNode is pretty reputable, I would go with it.
Here's an example of some well-known companies that signed up with OpenNode:

What kind of "complete backup solution" do you expect? Lightning channels are always in dynamic state, SCB is the best available solution for *the last resort* if you lose your channels but you have the `channel.backup` then you can run a recovery and get your coins back. When the next protocol is rolled out, there will be even better solution for everyone. 
So, what is "a complete backup solution" do you have?
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:21:47
There will be a Lightning conf in Berlin in two months:  
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:00:35
With LND you don't need to do a manual backup, plus it's not possible anyway because Lightning channels are in very dynamic state, if you do a manual backup you have to back it up every second which is impossible. So since v0.6.0 LND has SCB as the recovery solution for last resort. LND does auto backup and saves in a file callled `channel.backup`and it's a static backup, it saves once every time you add a channel. If for some reason you lost your node due to harddrive failure or whatever, all you need is the seed and this `channel.backup` file to restore your funds. 
Here's the docs: 
Help is always available on LND slack. Hundreds of people have been running LND the last two years with no issue, you shouldn't be afraid of running a lightning node. And you can always run a node on Testnet to learn how it works, test coins are free.
@_date: 2019-08-31 04:59:45
It is **smart and responsible** not to disclose the serious vulns so users can have their chance to update before getting robbed. And that doesn't mean "Keeping the vulnerability secret is security by obscurity", that means you're a responsible grown-up. The LN devs have their reputation at stake, I don't see how they would want to make the upgrade "malicious". Besides, the versions they want users to upgrade to are versions that have been released the last two months, only older versions are affected, so it's a normal procedure to upgrade anyways. And if these current versions are "malicious" they would've been discovered by the same person or persons who discovered these vulns in the older versions. Users also have their choice to listen to them or not, but the devs are responsible enough to let them know the fix is available, has been available for a while now. And yes, like other people have told you, if you're not sure about the upgrade, you can inspect the code for yourself.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:47:33
You are welcome to submit a proposal on the Lightning mailing list if you think you can do better. This is the best solution that LND has right now. I think Eclair has their own backup solution also. Until we have the next protocol to solve the data loss with random number and static backup for all impls, this is the best we can have right now.
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:36:26
Currently LND doesn't do penalty. If you run an old invalid state, your channels would just be closed and you don't lose your coins. Try it on Testnet to see. Unless you do some hackery stuff then maybe the penalty would kick in. But someone who "accidentally" or "cluelessly" runs an old invalid state is probably not someone who knows how to cheat.

Bigger blocks will make tx time even longer, Core has a better plan for scaling than just making bigger blocks.  Segwit is in the plan, LN is being worked on, Schnorr is also being discussed... MAST might be next..  But big blockers don't understand any of these. Just think about it, big or small blocks, you still have to wait at least 10 min for a new block and with the diff adjustment it can take longer.  Miners' reward gets cut in half every four years, how can they survive if not for transaction fees?  So if you don't want to pay for tx fees or pay too low, then your txs have to wait.  The security of bitcoin blockchain also depends on hashing power, in the future if there's no profits in mining then there goes the security.  Big blocks also allow for a lot of spamming and it's another problem that you do not want to have.

Ah. Eclair mobile is pretty good. Do you have any channels?
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:51:23
He had 400 channels, so if he had lost the coins into the hands of the owners of those 400 nodes, we would have seen a bus load of people talking about the extra money they got from this dude, would we? BUT so far we haven't seen one single person say they got a "gift" from this dude. SO, what's the real story here? I can tell you, this is either a story of an idiot who fucked up his node, never lost the money, those coins are still onchain waiting for him to sweep. OR: this is a story of a goddamn fudster. He should go find his coins, sweep them, and get out of Lightning Network, get his ass out of any tech that he has no goddamn clue about or want to fud, go fud somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:42:18
Ah... I see, but can that work with an outdated backup like what he has?
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:52:30
I think this is how it happened: He had a power outage so on October 2 his lnd node data was corrupted by the power outage. He had a backup that he had made a few days prior to the outage, so instead of running the SCB recovery that LND provides, he decided to run that outdated backup that he had made. The backup was of course had invalid channel state, so when he ran it, LND had to close all his channels, and the closings were just normal to get his coins back to his wallet. He did not get penalized by running an outdated invalid channel state. He did not lose his coins to his peers. Because so far we haven't seen any of his 400 peers say they got extra coins from him. 
So, that's how the story looks like to me. Now, what should he do to get his coins back? LND has a guide to restore onchain coins, and here's the guide:  
All he has to do is use the seed to recover his coins by using that guide.  
But do I think he'll do this? I don't know. At this point I am not sure if I should believe his story, he was so rushed to make a thread on reddit claiming he "lost" these coins to his peers when so far nobody has seen any evidence. With 400 channels taking his coins (if they did, which they didn't) you would think there would be a bus load of people yelling "yeehaww.." for the "free money" they got but none of these node owners have said anything.

This is a fud thread, OP did NOT lose any coins. If he had lost coins to his 400 peers we would have heard from those people by now, but nobody has said anything. Last year there was an incident with someone who actually lost his coins to his peers because he accidently ran an old channel state, and he had only about 30 peers, people came out from wood work and said they got free coins, even me got it too and we gave back the coins to him. 
But for this story, I think it's a hoax, this dude didn't lose any coins, yet he rushed to spread fuds on reddit, and people fell for it. Has anyone seen any extra money around from this guy? I sure would want to know!

That's exactly what happened, I've tested LND and when I tried to run an older state, LND closed all channels that had the peers money, I got my share of coins, and my peers got theirs. No fund was lost, there's no penalty. So I don't think he lost his coins, they're still onchain waiting for him to sweep.

Again, the top purpose of this app is for spenders to send more than to receive. Do you see the app pubkey exposed anywhere on the GUI? Before talking about 'balancing', look at the app and look at the fullnode lnd, find the difference, see it?
The app can receive, but before you can understand how it can receive, i want you to understand the purposes of the app and why it's not a gui of the lnd fullnode, and why it's not designed to be a routing node, while the lnd fullnode can be a routing app with all the balancing bullshit.

And free test coins here:  
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:02:19
I think 5 is an additional step because it was a force closing transaction. Maybe the remote peer is not a dependable peer, but did you restart the app or phone when the channel went inactive? Sometimes a restart can help it to be active, it also helps to get 'unconfirmed' txs to show as 'confirmed'. But i'm glad you got your coin back. The app is still very buggy, don't put too much money in it. 
If you would like to play with the app without worrying to lose money, I would recommend the testnet version. Not sure what phone you have but this is Testnet version for android:

Since day one of Lightning Network, the advice is "DON'T DO A BACKUP!" So if you don't have a backup you won't run that backup and you won't lose your coins! Why? Because Lightning channels are in dynamic state. Your backup can only do a snapshot of a state at a given time, but it does not have the current state of all time, and the backup this dude had was a few days old. Think for a moment, suppose you make a backup of your node now, let's name the state as "X". Then you restart your node, after a few hours or day another channel is opened, or you make a payment, or you forward a payment.. you don't know and the software makes a channel update.. OK so now the channel state is at "Y".. Next minute it changes again, and the state is at "Z"... Suppose something happens and you can't start your node, You decide to run the backup "X" ... That's when fubar happens... Your peers think you try to cheat them and disagree, a breach happens. That's how the software works currently.
Now with LND, it's better. LND has a thing called "SCB Recovery", meaning LND does auto static backup for your channels in a file named `chhannel.backup`, you only need to save this file somewhere one time for each channel you add to your node, since it's a static backup. So if for some reason your node can't start, you can run this recovery, you don't get the channels back, but LND will have to ask your peers to close those channels, and the coins go back to your wallet. 
Here's info how to do this recovery:

At least they are honest by telling you what's going on, not like Coinbase which would tell you a lie like "your transaction will take a while due to the backlog on the main chain" when there's no back log, and yes, they did this a few weeks ago when the main chain wasn't being spammed and there were few transactions going.

Ok, thanks for your quick reply. Also, don't you think it's just a matter of time Chainalysis will have a tool to crack wasabi txs?
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:52:40
Because you don't know if the spending tx is an actually cheating attempt every time someone closes a channel, and if your app (which is your node) is offline then it does not know if the tx is a cheating one. Only when your node is online then it gets to know if the counterparty is trying to cheat or not.
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:10:07

No. The app is not designed to be a routing node. It's intended to be a light wallet with small pocket amount of money for users to spend on small things like coffee, lunch, etc... And great for travelers to where bitcoin is accepted and better to use than a credit card which could be stolen.

Dude, i've been using Segwit txs, and so have many others.. Right now the critical part is how to deal with this bullshit fork coming that has no replay protection. Core devs would love to have this release with full implementation of ready segwit addresses... but then if they don't do anything to deal with this fucking fork, you would have something else to bitch about too. Be a helper, not a bitch, please. You can help test this and make the process go faster, this is an open source project, it fails or succeeds depends on community collaboration, and to remind you, you haven't paid a dime to these developers to make nice software for you.

When you update from LND v0.5 to v0.6, if one of your channels is with a peer that does not have Data Loss Protection in their node, your channel with that peer will be closed and that peer is banned from connecting. If the rest of your channels are with peers that have Data Loss Protection, at that moment your channels with them are automatically backed up in a file named "channel.backup" in directory `.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet` if your lnd node is on a linux system. You can export this file to another location to save. Don't run "restorechanbackup" unless you have lost your channel due to a catastrophy incident. 
All the guides are here:

This thread is in the wrong sub. However, to answer your question if a coin has very fast confirmation is because 1) it has a different algorithm, 2) it's not as secure as bitcoin, 3) nobody is using it, hence, its blockchain has less traffic so transactions seem fast.

Hi. They made the first transaction with a very low transaction fee at 20 satoshis per byte, hence, the tx did not get confirmed (i think it would have got confirmed but it would take a long time).  So they created a second transaction with a much higher fee and it was mined.  So, if you want to know how to get your tx get mined fast, use this site to find the fee rates:    
Right now the fastest rate is 70 sat/byte. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 03:09:58
Please run a few Lightning nodes on testnet and learn how routing works. Ask yourself why many people have said their payments are stuck, can't find routes. And ask yourself why most large payments can't be routed when there're so many large channels, should be able to route large payments right? What a joke. I guess you don't even understand what I'm talking about. Putting a lot of money into LN and opening big channels do NOT mean helping the network, and esp. when one entity shows up like this, it's NOT organic growth for LN but it's just a FAKE showcase, quite embarassing. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 04:50:04
Agreed. Bitcoiners need to wake up and use another exchange.  Coinbase is harmful to bitcoin not only because of their dishonesty but most importantly, it's run by toxic people who have been doing a lot of damages to bitcoin price and image. When Armstrong announced Coinbase started running Classic nodes, people dumped their coins, the price dropped, that was around last Christmas. Lately Armstrong has been kinda quiet but his employee J. Cliff has been on his FUD campaign, arguing from his rear end how bitcoin needs a hard fork to scale, it's like he's too stupid to see the ETH consequences from a hard fork. If Bitcoin had a hard fork like ETH... I can bet you, the same replays would happen, and for sure, Coinbase would never honor the replayed bitcoin like they're not doing it with ETC right now. This company is seriously detrimental to the future of bitcoin!!!

Hello, I would not recommend any rpi guides as they are written for advanced users, not newbies. But I would recommend a light client for you to try out.  Check out "lightning-app" from this link:   
All you have to do is download the app on your desktop and run it. Currently the app only runs on testnet using free test coins you can get from here:  (I would also suggest you use testnet to be familiarized with Lightning before diving into Mainnet where you can lose real money.)
Or if you have an Android phone you can download Eclair wallet (testnet) from here:    
Once you're familiar with the Eclair wallet you can get the version for Mainnet also on Google Play. If you need more help, join IRC Freenode channel  someone will be able to help you out. Good luck. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 13:02:45
Nope.  Zero confirmation means just that: zero proof to know if the transaction will be confirmed, and nowadays if your transaction has 0 tx fee or very low fee, it might never get confirmed.  So if you are the receiving end waiting for someone to pay you, 0-confirmation is not a wise thing to accept.

Bitcoin is still a currency whether this sub has lost its sight or not. I think you've lost sight that Bitcoin users are not the only ones on this sub, far from it. And who cares if this sub has lost its sight? Which i don't think it has, but that's my opinion. Discussions of bitcoin are on many forums and social media, reddit is just one part of it. And more importantly, get involved with bitcoiners in real life, such as business activities and meetups to get a better view.

Dude, I am not "spreading negativity for no reason". But I will not buy your products with this attitude. I've been testing/running Lightning nodes for almost two years, probably longer than you have. I've also helped a few people who run BTCPAY servers but have no clue how to do troubleshooting because the way BTCPAY sets things up does not help them to know how to do troublshooting. Docker is not my favorite thing, and Luna is some unknown vps that i have no interest to open an account with. I'm just saying BTCPAY needs to have a plan where users can just use it with their own system and not to depend on Azure or Luna or whatever. And it may sound weird to you but I introduced BTCPAY to someone when it was using Azure, it turned him off because he thought you guys were shilling for Microsoft. Now are you guys shilling for Luna? who knows.

More capacity doesn't necessarily mean more "liquidity" or "bandwidth" which is what routes payments.

You can always contribute to LND by first off, contribute to yourself, and by that I mean by 1. Get involved, don't be on the sideline.  2. To get involved, learn to install the software, it seems hard but not hard at all, and you can always ask for help. 3.

I've seen new users all the time, and of course anyone can transact bitcoin on the network, it's a trustless system open to anyone who has bitcoin and knows how to use it. Bitcoin isn't a thing that's owned by a private bank or company that you have to ask permission for it. The problem with many new users is they have no clue what bitcoin really is and how to use it.  So, if you're a new user, please read up and learn how bitcoin works as much as you can before spending money on it.  Also, learn to choose a wallet and how it works so you don't lose your coins.

If it was an attack from a govt who doesn't care about profits and would be willing to spend millions to billions of dollars then it's possible, otherwise I still think this type of attack is unlikely, Jihan might try some other tactic though, i'm not saying he's a good guy or he will stop trying to take over bitcoin. But right now any possible attack that i can think of will make miners lose more than anyone. Either that or the game theory needs to be thrown out of window. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:44:54
But ask yourself, if you're a miner and you have invested a few million dollars into mining equipment and facility, would you want to cripple the market by causing such a havoc?

The question doesn't make any sense. Users should be the ones to start to use Segwit transactions and first off, if you have no clue what Segwit is, please read up. Secondly, if you know how to get a segwit from your wallet, when you buy bitcoin from an exchange, withdraw your coins to your Segwit address. If users start making small steps in handling their own transactions, that's how the ball can start rolling. Exchanges are just middlemen to make a buck, the less we make them relevant, the better.

I thought of that too. Could it be that when he created his paper wallet on a compromised system, the hacker planted a trojan in his private key, but he also created a good password for it which the hacker could not figure out but the trojan was already in the private key, and had to wait until he unlocked the password, so when he swept the key to electrum, it was unlocked and that was how the coins were sent to the hacker's address? I don't know if the paper wallet could be compromised this way, just a thought. I would never use a paper wallet though.

Hm.. i think my post was meant to reply to your previous post.. lol.. where you said "full nodes aren't magic"... Hey but full nodes are the strongholds that keep us thus far, and this is why those damn forkers have been trying hard to tell us we don't need to run full nodes. So, I would say, "Yes, full nodes are our magics right now, always, and forever!" :D  Why? Because they'll will ban those damn invalid blocks, and trust me, we do have enough sane miners who will not abandon the main chain, they know this would be suicide for them!  But on the contrary, evil miners will have to surrender when the market gets so shocked and the price tanks like mofo.... All in all, miners have the most to lose, they mine where it's most profitable, I still don't think they would be so stupid to listen to Jihan-the-goddamn-fucker and even that goddamn fucker might not be too crazy to tank bitcoin.

No i'm not talking about AMP. I've seen satoshis.place invoices for payments split into multiple invoices so they can be paid easier, because currently most people don't keep a lot of money on their nodes, hence they don't have big amounts for liquidity. And in case someone doesn't have a direct channel to Satoshisplace they have to depend on liquidity small amounts to route their payments, try this on testnet.satoshis.place you'll see them.

I was curious about what you said so I downloaded the windows version from bitcoincore.org. It shows the correct version as you can see here:   . I'm not sure which site showed an older version for you? Probably at the time of the release the two sites didn't get updated at the same time? Human errors can happen? But to let you know, bitcoincore.org IS NOT a scam site. However, which site you choose to get the binaries always make sure to check the integrity. Also, currently there's been  a going on debate and questionable issue with the maintainer of "bitcoin.org" site, if he would surprise the community by replacing bitcoin binaries with bcash binaries there, so I would say everyone who wants to get bitcoin software should start paying attention. I would trust bitcoincore.org more than bitcoin.org. Even better, every bitcoin user should learn how to compile their own bitcoin software, and it's not hard to do it. The guides can be found here:   .

Nah. I don't think he's that dumb at all. He actually knows how LN works from what he says in the blogs, so he wouldn't embarass himself if he tries to cheat, and no, "to pull a fast one and cheat all his channels" won't work. LND has a command to close all channels (`lncli closeallchannels`) so I think he just wanted to see if that command could really work .. lol .. And because LND has the command to allow closing all channels at once, if someone shuts down hundreds of channels at once and it causes problems on Lightning Network, then it's the software's problem that needs to be fixed. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:56:54
The receiver should and would reject it, even if it's 1 satoshi more, yes, 1 satoshi. I'll tell you a true story: LND used to have the max limit for funding at 16777216 satoshis,  the specs says that the funding amount must be less than 2^24 satoshi (i.e. 16777216). LND interpreted this as "equal or less". So one day I tried to get my LND node to open a channel to my Eclair node with 16777216 sat but Eclair said "ERROR". Found out Eclair was doing what the specs say that it has to be "less than 2^24 satoshi", and when I tried with 16777215 then I could open a channel to Eclair, but if I tried 16777216 sat with another LND node I could too. Currently the max limit for LND nodes is 16777215 satoshi. So you don't have to change the code, but if you do to raise the max limit, none other LN nodes would let you open a channel with them, unless they change the code too.

Nope. Direct channel payments have 0 fee. Many hops also have 0 or close to 0 fee because those node operators changed their fees. Some other hops have higher fees than defaults. So fees can't be used to figure out amounts of txs.

It's okay to welcome these tests from anyone. If we want Lightning Network to be strong and effective, this early time is the best time for any types of testing, from anyone, friends or foes. Bitcoin is the most secure coin because it has gone thru many testings, so bitcoin lightning network should be subjected to rigorous testing as well, and I believe we are building the best lightning micro payment system right now, so much amazement to be unfold. You have to admit though, Adreas Brekken is the first from that retarded camp that has some brain to even try out with his node and wanted to be as neutral as he could be in his assessments. The rest of them only could fud by using either false info or outdated info that LN is not using, solely for their purpose of misleading and fudding. Lightning Network is still in beta and there are plenty of issues that need improvement, what we should do is help LN with testing and contributing... If we don't do this ourselves, we can't blame someone from the opposition who's willing to do it.

Zero satoshis. Nada. Nil. Nothing. Lightning Network is not an altcoin or a PoS system as so many uninformed users think. So if you only park your BTC on LN and hope for a return you can wait for eternity to see it doesn't give you any return, and it doesn't help with the Network at all, only makes you look stupid because you can otherwise earn some fees if you lend it out on some exchanges.

You are comparing apples to oranges. Increasing blocksize is something to be done to layer1 and it requires consensus. Lightning network is layer2 and does not require consensus. For example, if Amazon has the largest node with the most channels, can Amazon change layer1 by increasing or decreasing the blocksize or by increasing /decreasing the 21M coin supply? Heck no. This type of "centralization" (if we can even call it "centralization" which is not true at all) cannot, does not affect/threaten layer1 like the mining centralization which you should be more concerned about.

I think you need to learn how Bitcoin Core wallet works first before buying bitcoin.  Currently the blockchain takes up about 100 GB and it depends on your hardware system + bandwidth to know how long it takes to download the blockchain.  You should not send bitcoin to Core wallet until it's fully synced before you can see your coin. I would suggest you to download the wallet, play with it on Testnet first to see how it works. Testnet blockchain isn't big so it doesn't take long for the wallet to sync, and I could give you test coins if you like.   Another suggestion is download Electrum wallet, it's a light wallet that doesn't download the whole blockchain, ready to use in a short time. You need to figure out where to buy bitcoin, then send your coin to your own wallet.  Localbitcoins.com is a good place to start, but read up on their site first to see how it works.

Bitcoin is not a centralized private company, so Core devs (as a group of hundreds of them or how many..) can't decide for all bitcoin users to do a contentious hardfork, they would not have support from the majority of users. Anyone who wants to fork off always can do so, Core devs aren't your leaders, they're just maintainers of the Bitcoin projects and they're not paid by you or anyone so you can't tell them to do a hard fork at your demand. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:32:42
UASF BIP148 is not designed to split the chain, the chain can only be split if miners decide to split (and miners can decide to split at anytime even if SegWit does not exist), but the chain cannot be split when miners agree to signal for Segwit until it gets locked in and activated. But once Segwit is activated those disagreeing miners don't have to mine SegWit transactions if they don't want to, this is how softforks work. They only have to agree to activate SegWit, they don't have to agree to mine SegWit transactions. But then they will miss out the fees. I hope you can understand this point that so many people can't understand, which is baffling.

You mean you want to lock your fund for years?  Greg Maxwell had a small discussion on IRC a few days ago, he advised not to lock fund far into the future. I put the convo on pastebin:

So now there're two chains and two coins as a result of this, and ETC just got listed on poloniex a few hours ago:   ETC will also be added to Bitfinex and other exchanges soon.  Imagine if this happened to Bitcoin, there would not be just two coins but more, not just two chains but more, and it would be 1000x more complicated and chaotic into oblivion!

It was stuck for a month and then you created more stuck transactions?  You could've solved the first stuck tx by restarting your wallet with -zapwallettxes, and then resend your tx.

I think because many users still don't know there's a BIP148 going on that will give them this 75% discount in a few months, and some other users would rather wait for this BIP to be merged into Core before they would run it. But Core would not merge BIP148 code into Core in spite of many begging requests from users. It's not users' problem. The whole stupid scenario is Core's problem.

I'm wondering if Reddit owners now are in cahoots with Coinbase to hijack Bitcoin. The big blockers are back trying a new tactic to push for the stupid HF again. First Armstrong published the blog about ETH and now this. This idiot keeps digging his grave, Coinbase must be in big financial trouble and it would not be a surprise to see Coinbase go under. Every bitcoiner now needs to stop buying BTC from Coinbase.

Restart your wallet with -zapwallettxes.

I don't know what software they're using to verify IDs now because it's been several years since my ID was verified without any problem.

I know with CLTV you can't unlock with the keys until the date &amp; time or the block height has expired. CSV can let tx's be unlocked anytime?

Heh.. I was going to say "Eclair" but you beat me to it haha.. With Eclair he can also use it for onchain transactions, a nice mobile wallet for both onchain and lightning. :D

If we can call them "noobs". They had been warned over and over but they would not listen and instead they would get very ugly, mean, and vicious to you if you tried to explain to them. Sometimes you just have to let people learn the hard way, otherwise, they do not believe you until they experience the consequences.

The fastest way is install Eclair mobile wallet on an Android phone, you can get it for free from here: 
And if I were you, I would get the testnet version and play with it first to find out how it works. Test coins are free, I can give you. The testnet Eclair wallet can be downloaded from here:  
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:33:02
Thanks but I want to try testnet first. Not sure what the issue is.

u/Green-Machine- Thanks for this thread. We can get segwit activated in a few months by UASF BIP148, all you have to do is running your bitcoin core nodes using BIP148 binaries. Please ask DNM vendors and users do the same. The power to get segwit activated is in your hand and please do this ASAP. Thank you.

Very disappointed in seeing you behaving as reckless as you call bip148 "reckless". Hate to say this to you, but BIP149 WON'T HAPPEN. Why? Because most of you core devs have no guts to stand up to Jihan, hence, I do not believe at all you would ever merge bip149 
 because Jihan would be in worse rage than he is right now.  Only Luke and a few other devs have the bravery to carry on BIP148, very sad to see this. But no worries, you can keep wasting your time on here and rbtc like an idiotic troll. Sickening.

I don't give a fuck if Cobra is a shill, and the other guy said "Cobra is a dubious actor.", he didn't say cobra is a shill, so now you're accusing him of saying cobra is a shill. Learn to read.
This account named "Cobra" has had a record of being dubious and suspicious, the problem is he's holding a site where newbies go to download bitcoin software. Fuck knows when malware shows up on that site.

It is not reckless. BIP148 is a softfork, only miners can do the hardfork and they can do it at anytime whether BIP148 exists or not.  Please take a read of this article and prepare yourself:

| Getting segwit earlier isn't remotely enough.
It's been several years since the time of discussion started on Segwit until code testing until release, this isn't "getting segwit earlier." What if Jihan and co. gets extension block implemented in a few weeks or months, who are you going to cry to?  You smell like your intention is trying to block BIP148 and Segwit altogether so Jihan can do just what he wants: - EXTENSION-BLOCK TO THE MOON ! 
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:16:57
This is awesome, we can choose to enforce BIP148, or not. This should have been done in the fucking Core v.0.14.2 but no, Core is too fucked up right now. Thanks, Luke, for being the champion!

That's what a HF is for, to correct a flaw if there's a flaw in the protocol, and it's not for changing the blockchain ledger at a whim like what ETH did. It's also stupid to do a **contentious** hardfork just to please someone, and if you can't see how messy the ETH hardfork has caused to this coin, there's no use to educate you.
