A lot of you people really don't understand the difference between the value of a technology, and the value of units in one instance of that technology. Mobile phones are a valuable idea and will remain a valuable idea for a long time. 
Now, how many of you still use a Nokia 3210? 
And how many of you will be using a Nexus 4 in the year 2025?
And what will a bitcoin be worth 1000 years from now?
It's a question of when, not if, the price on your bitcoin falls to zero, and which sucker is holding it at that time.

This is zealotry. This is what it looks like when people just aren't capable of even imagining a counterfactual universe.
Flooz. 


Sure, 1) force of law (e.g. police) to enforce its use (or prevent use of alternatives) combined with 2) requirement to accept transactions and 3) requirement to pay taxes in that currency (both of which enforced by police). 4) Stability, the value of the currency should be broadly the same from day to day, not prone to 20% changes. 5) Inflationary, i.e. there must be some incentive to spend the money rather than keep it, or it will never be used as a currency no matter how good it might seem in principle.
(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), none of them apply to bitcoin, which is why it's not a currency, it's a joke of a ponzi scheme.
I might add that these factors are well accepted by all economists as features of fiat currencies. But you'd know that because you know what currency is, don't you?
I'd add things like 6) central bank to deal with surges/declines in the velocity of money [or other economic crises] and 7) initially distributed in a broadly fair manner to all citizens - you really didn't look up the history of the Deutch Mark like I asked, did you, dumbass?

I am completely right. All computing technologies (software, hardware) have been subsequently made obsolete. This is no different, except that it's surrounded by a horde of young people who've never been burned in a ponzi scheme, and a bunch of financiers looking to parasitize them. 
Ever spent Flooz before? Even know what Flooz is?

What a utterly delusional set of arguments. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:39:08
Don't be a retard. I was talking about wealth allocation, which is an issue that an actual currency would care about (rather than, say, a speculative ponzi scheme for shitheads). If you create a currency, how do you initiate the starting distribution of the currency? 
It's not a trivial question and '20% to one random unknown guy, 20% to his geek pals, 30% to their geek pals' is not a sane answer. It's a fucking stupid answer that only a fucking moron would consider. Fortunately bitcoin is not, and never will be, a currency. 
Fortunately, bitcoin will be replaced by a government backed e-currency which is actually a) stable b) not prone to retarded infights c) not requiring you to handle coins tainted by endless criminal transactions. At that point, your bitcoins go to zero, where they belong. That is what obsolesence will look like. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:47:17
The use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is pretty much rare and accidental (and insane, but that's another issue). 
Do you think all the adverts I see covering my facebook homepage have anything to do with currency?
Do you think all the HODL-ers on here have anything to do with currency?
Or the ones talking about profit?
It's rare that anyone uses bitcoin as anything resembling a currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:00:08
I can't provide counterpoints to arguments that are founded only in your imagination and ignorance of economics. 
I mean look at this, what a clusterfuck of stupidity:






No other country has volatility like bitcoin. It's literally 'worse than a 3rd world country currency'. Thats your selling point. lmao


Yeah, because a currency that is unattractive to spend is obviously great at being a currency. lmao


Yeah who needs that? A 'currency' 20% owned by some random fucking stranger, 50% owned by that guy's buddies, that there is a solid basis for distribution of a new global currency.
I know how blockchain works. I've implemented AES-256 by hand, I've built my own blockchain pretend currency as a proof of concept by hand. You want me to explain any part of the technical detail? No problem. 
But I also spent a good part of the last 20 years studying economics and finance in my free time. So I also know how currencies and economies work. 
This isn't a technological issue, it's an economic issue. It's hilarious to watch newbs re-explore the last 300 years of economics theory the painful way. The three most obvious lessons:
- "BAD MONEY DRIVES OUT GOOD" - people don't spend depreciating currencies. So they become useless as a currency. At which point you fall back on the underlying value of the material (e.g. silver roman coins for their silver). Bitcoin has negative underlying value. lmao!
- Highly volatile currencies are useless either for purchasing or as a temporary store of value. You all know this in your gut, which is why you talk about how many dollars a bitcoin is worth, rather than how many bitcoins a dollar is worth. Listen to your guts, ffs.
- A database that runs 3 transactions per second globally, literally using the power of a city. It's like we decided to back to 1930s era computers, but 100x slower and 10000x less power efficient. It gets worse as bitcoin gets more 'popular'. Incredible.

**an investment swindle in which some early investors are paid off with money put up by later ones in order to encourage more and bigger risks**
Now then... those who are taking profits just now...those early investors... where are those profits coming from, exactly? What generates that money? Is it perhaps the ... later investors? If not, then where does it come from?
That would be the literal definition of a ponzi. There isn't even an argument to be had. By definition, bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.
Interesting thing about ponzis. People sucked into them always become convinced this time is different, that THEIR ponzi is not really a ponzi, it's a new way of doing things.
Yawn. Seen it all before. Some of you will do nicely; but most of you are going to get fleeced. Ponzis just rearrange wealth, they don't create it.

Sorry, your argument was so badly phrased that I didn't realise that was the point you were making. And you ignored my point about HTTP and FTP.
Well, you tell me: do you use NCP? Do you even know what NCP is? NCP is the original internet... which we don't use. 
Even HTTP was obsoleted - twice. HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are very different beasts. 
And HTML... how many times did HTML get obsoleted and replaced by a new version?
As for FTP; look at p2p protocols. FTP used to carry the bulk of bulk data transfers, now it's practically nonexistent. 
Time for you to look up the history books. Your example offers up a whole fountain of proof that your own view is wrong. I think just maybe if you're this ignorant of a topic you should think twice before getting into an argument with someone about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:28:34


Cryptocurrency as an idea has value. I would be all behind a govt-backed e-coin. Of course I wouldn't base it on public blockchain because 3 transactions per second using the power of a city is frankly all kinds of stupid and utterly useless as a national currency. 
A lot of people on here don't understand this sentence:
"The fact that the idea of blockchain has some value as a technology, does not mean that units of bitcoin have value as one example of that technology"

If gold had no industrial uses or electronic/dental/cosmetic uses, and was simply a meaningless blob of stuff that wasted energy and did nothing whatsoever useful in itself - and assuming that fiat currencies have already been invented - and especially if it was being marketed on the basis of the appreciation that would occur due to new idiots coming in - then yes, it would certainly be a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:02:42


Cigarettes have been used by some people as a currency too, but that doesn't make them essentially a currency. In the same way, a few people are buying things with bitcoins as a currency (mostly criminals), but what we see in this forum is the reality of it - it's a ponzi scheme with people telling each other to HODL while planning for their own exit... 
You ever seen someone saying "HODL your dollars! They're going to the moon"? I haven't.


And which is two reasons why it isn't a currency... 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:19:51
1. It wasn't a radical innovation, it was an incremental innovation on ideas going back 20 years, that happened to catch on.
2. "Value" - it has none. Actually each coin has negative value, since it has risk (risk of losing it, hacking, etc) and no inherent purpose in the world, and requires vast amounts of energy for the blockchain to continue to exist. Surprised more people don't understand the difference between value and price but there you are. 
3. Price, it does have. As for how easily that can be tracked? Well it really depends on how much you trust exchanges, doesn't it. And if you're if you're talking about the 'price' of a currency it generally means you're seeing it as speculation rather than as a currency. At which point, it stops being useful as a currency. Because people don't spend what they speculate on.
4. All of which is irrelevant to the fact is IS a ponzi by definition, downvotes be damned. People are buying bitcoins not to use as currency but expecting a 'profit' measured in terms of a real currency. That 'profit' comes from other greater fools buying in after them, and nowhere else. That's a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:37:29
Bunch of ignorant people haven't heard of a ponzi scheme, joining in the vinegar strokes part of it, they're not gonna like the refractory period.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:16:02


"Fluctuate"? I think you hardly know what the word means if you think you can describe bitcoins price history with it. 
It moves around (and mostly up so far) not because it's new, and not because there's a limited supply, and not because it has a fixed inflation rate. It moves around because it's a speculative, emotional bubble. 


Not a part of the definition of a ponzi


Doesn't need to be paid as a dividend to be a ponzi.


This part is true. It's also completely irrelevant. 
No, I'm afraid that you redefining a ponzi to be only a limited subset of ponzi is not going to work here. The only place that 'bitcoin investors' are getting money from is later investors. The **only** place. That's what a ponzi is. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:11:07
Plenty of examples? Stop pretending there is false 
equivalency between the degree of evidence for our positions. 
Literally *every* example presented by *either* of us supports my argument. None of it supports yours.


I'm aware of hardforks. 
Now tell me, why in god's name would anyone seeking to allocate wealth in the world choose to start by giving 20%+ of it to one random unknown guy, another 50%+ of it to some geeky early adopters, and so on? That's retarded. 
The people currently invested in bitcoin seek to do their upgrades by forking the blockchain because if they don't, they lose everything. 
But that's no fucking reason why anyone else should care about it or seek to avoid obsoleting both the bitcoin protocol (and its  infighting, continual forks, threats to shorters (via forks), and weaknesses to various attacks such as 50% hashing) as well as obsoleting the current blockchain.
Have any flooz? What can you spend it on? 
Once upon a time, people were paid in salt. Once upon a time the Zimbabwe Dollar had value. 5 years ago, so did the Venezuelan Real. "Forks" exist in real currency too, and even with tax collectors, police and armies behind them, they still devalue to nothing in the presence of a better alternative or loss of confidence. A lot of hard lessons going to be learned by bitcoin zealots in the coming years.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:51:43
A difference which in no way invalidates any point I made. Operating systems are a great idea. Are you writing this on Windows 3.1? AmigaOS? ... hmmm didn't think so.
Bitcoin will be made obsolete either by a government backed fiat e-currency or by a subsequent coin with better anonymity. When that time comes, good luck cashing in your obsolete magical wizard points for actual currency.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:51:10


I think you'll find MSFT and AAPL shares pay a dividend. There are plenty of people who have bought early, never sold a single share of either and have made a hefty profit from them. Not a penny of that money came from 'later investors'. Ergo it is not a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:31:33


Err... no.


Technically true, actually, but I do think martians watching people on this forum would be quite bamboozled.


I'm really not, I just happen to be familiar with the long term history of cryptocurrency exchanges and how completely flaky they all have proven to be over time. 


Nah. Some ponzis do. A ponzi in the broad sense is a scheme where early 'investors' take their gains exclusively from the investments of latecomers. That would be bitcoin, in a nutshell. 


If 'this forum is filled with zealots that have dazzingly little familiarity with economic/finance history &amp; definitions and are signed up to one of the biggest ponzis of the last decade and have to do all they can to encourage groupthink to inflate the bubble' is a good reason, then yes.

Neither; I'm trying to save some of you a tremendous amount of pain.
