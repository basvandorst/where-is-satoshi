Hey guys so I have some BTC, LTC, and ETH on Binance and I was thinking about moving them back to coinbase for convenience. Would I be able to trade within the cryptocurrencies in coinbase or would I have to go FIAT —&gt; Crypto all of the time?

Guys I bought in at 17k. This was definitely a mistake but how could I have known? I guess I just gotta hodl now? I don’t know how else to get back to breaking even other than waiting...

If you held I bet you’re doing pretty alright right now XD

Can someone explain SegWit to me? I keep hearing about it but am clueless to the topic...

So I’m under 18 and can’t use GDAX. Is there any other exchange I can use that has no transaction fees? I’m using Binance already but I’m just looking for input.

You’re wrong.

Hey guys so on coinbase can I say turn BTC into ETH or last LTC into ETH? I’m just wondering because I bought some BTC a while back and split it into the other two on Binance. Now I’m wanting to send them back over to Coinbase for convenience but I’m not sure if I’d have to do everything through my bank account with USD at that point...?

So would the reasons be able to look something like this:
1) To potentially make profit
2) Just hodl
3) Hodl until a certain % profit
Let me know if I should be looking at this differently...

Hey everyone! Recently I have bought some bitcoin (and I know the market is iffy rn) but I’m looking to do some trading with it within a crypto currency exchange. I had a Bittrex account and I knew that to be able to withdrawal after my trades I’d need to get a “Basic Verification”. The problem is is that Bittrex is saying they can’t find my information with public service providers. They recommend upgrading to an “Enhanced Verification” however that is a little to personal for my comfort. Does anyone have any suggestions as far as crypto—&gt;crypto currency exchanges that have low to moderate fees and the big one: SECURITY AND REPUTABILITY. Please let me know, thanks!

Does anyone have any advice for actually finding altcoins to invest in? I’ve just started expanding my portfolio for trading but I’m not entirely sure where to start with some of these lesser known currencies...

So like a lot of people that contributed to the 19k spike a few weeks ago, I decided to buy some BTC at 17k (not a lot don’t worry).
Since then it’s been going down but I’ve told myself that no matter how it goes I’m going to hodl.
I was planning on doing trading but as I started it was a little to complicated (and bear in mind slightly stressful) so I decided against it.
What I did decide to do however was plot my BTC up into BTC, LTC, and ETH. That way it became more like a “cryptocurrency mutual fund” where if one goes way down and another way up, I don’t lose out a whole lot if I were invested in the one that went way down.
Now I’m looking at all three (BTC, LTC, and ETH) and wondering if it was such a good idea... any thoughts???

Thanks for replying guys! You may have missed my point though. 
I understand that verification  is inevitable, however if you read my Bittrex explanation you can see that they’ve given me trouble. Is there any cryptocurrency exchange that has a simple verification method? 
For example, Coinbase was quick and simple however they only do fiat—&gt;crypto or vise versa. Which crypto—&gt;crypto exchanges have a quick and simple verification process like Coinbase???

Thanks for the advice! Yeah honestly I’m in high school and I didn’t even put in your day trade suggested amount. So I’m not worried at all about losing it. 
I’ve got it all in Binance so I may start trading, the hard part is actually finding a coin to put some BTC into. I can read the charts but it’s impossible to predict anything at all! Will it go up? Will it go down? Is this it’s ATH or am I gonna put in and lose it all? 
I guess I just gotta take some risk in my life.
