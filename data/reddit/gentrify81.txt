Why do you need to hide it?

BCH is down 50% since transfer... suckers! Who's laughing now?

Thanks for the info! I'm not sure how all the 'one and zeros' work with blockchains however if I am sending BCH to a BTC address I would think it would be rejected as invalid.  Guess there is still much for me to learn.

So here is the deal... I accidentally send BCH from my ledger nano S to my Coinbase BTC address.  How in the heck do I get it back?  Will I have to wait until January 1st or is it gone forever?  Any help from someone that has know in this would be very much appreciated.  
The transaction has been confirmed:

Got to love lines.  If you don’t like the results then just redraw them.

If you are a US citizen and bought that Bitcoin 11 months ago then you will have to pay short term capital gains on that purchase which would be around 59 USD. That’s the real inhibitor of crypto.

They should get rid of LTC while they’re at it.
EDIT: Forgot which sub I was in...

Even better! I’ll get 20 people to give me $10 each then I’ll give you a cut for coming up with the idea. The key is that each of the 20 people I recruit will get 20 investors of their own giving me a cut of those proceeds which I’ll then give you a small percentage.

The dip

Dang.. the premium must be outrageous.
Looks coinstar is the first to break 10k.

I sent BCH to a coinbase BTC address right after the fork.  Coinbase’s BCH FAQ clearly states that BCH sent to a BTC address after the fork and before adding BCH support in December would be credited.  
Customer support has been giving me the run around for over a year now. I have the transaction ID and can see the coins sitting on the address.  To add insult to injury, all my case history has been remove from my account for some reason.
