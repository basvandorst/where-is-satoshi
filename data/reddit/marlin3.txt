True, and by the time we get there it will be time for a new calculation. This calculation only speculates on the price during the next peak based on the scarcity of currently mined btc in relation to current estimated stock of gold. When any of these two variables change so will the outcome of the calculation.

Precisely, and that is why this only looks at current gold stock and not speculative future stock

Nor the lost/unrecoverable gold stuck at the bottom of the ocean or in electronics sent out in space.

Since we are talking price of unit based on the amount of units available the numbers would still add up to the same result.
If you want to use a smaller denominator you are also talking about a vastly larger stock, so if you want to calculate the price per satoshi just multiply by (0.00000001) the results will be the same.

The point of this calculation is to measure current estimated stock of gold against current BTC mined, not to compare future 21 million BTC to future unknown amounts of gold. If the variables change so will the result of the calculation.

400000 usd = 356852 eur
Given that stock to flow calculation points at a value very similar to the result of this calculation based on scarcity in relation to gold, I have raised confidence the number since both approaches point in the same direction.

Would you say that this is a good time to buy in for beginners? Should they buy the dip or wait for a more stable time to enter?

I find no source for this or even anything close to this.

That would be linear growth, percentage growth is exponential. A 10,000 move in a day would only mean a change of 1.01% if BTC was at 990K

Replace as the default store of value. Gold is an element  with a lot of uses and will never go away. The theory is that it replaces gold as the go-to store of value. Most of the gold the average person owns is as conductors in technology or as jewelry. Very few people use gold as a store of value. That useage of gold is mostly done by financial institutions.

Good, spread the FUD so I can buy cheaper
