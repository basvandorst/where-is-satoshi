Scan with what? Mobile phone?
The issue is that THere ios no point of holding it in coinbase because they cant verify me whenever I want to sell.

Because after selling my bitcoins I tried to withdraw the money to my real life bank account and it just wouldnt go. Now after emailing them they say they sent it and should arrive 11dec. Even though I see on coinbase that the transaction is completed.. Should I just wait more days? Please understand this is my first time doing this so I hope it all works out and I can still use coinbase.

Thank you for reassuring me ! You have been very helpful!

My question was have you actually sold your bitcoins in Coinbase. If you havent then how can you say it works?????
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:35:59
Cant sell because the ID verification keeps failing and locking me out for 24hrs. This is day 3 now, and customer support keeps sending same lines to me.

I sold the bitcoins yes. Now after customer support and lot of emailing they say the funds have been sent to my bank account. And they arrive 11 december. Is it normal to take so many time? Please understand this is my first time doing something like this and its not a good feeling if you havent yet received your money. If I get it then I can say coinbase works.

In a scam you lose something of value??? how about the money I spent there on coins and cant now cash out? Whats ur take on that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:21
I now finally managed to sell the bitcoins I had in coinbase and in moved them into my eur wallet, but now I cant withdraw them into my bank it says I must first deposit in order to prove its the correct bank etc. But I already did use my bank the first time , so I understand its not even possible to send it to my bank?

Thanks! One final question , how do I transfer the bought bitcoins to the wallet I downloaded from official bitcoin website?? Or what is the best wallet to use?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:34
How does it compare to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:16:31
Coinbase is down again!?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:46:43
No, of course not. I dont understand where it even came from, I was sleeping. They still show that the card details etc and the prices there :S So Im kinda worried because I dont want that money gone from my bank account lol.
