Not sure who to believe but here is another article that says it is banned in Macedonia 
edit: actually the article from that site  has a quote from the governor of the National Bank of Macedonia “In Macedonia, the legal means for payment in cash and non-cash payment operations is the denar,” I don't know if that they are just interpreting that as meaning bitcoin is illegal.

I tried to post that but it wouldn't let me. I think they have interpreted what the Governor of the reserve bank of Macedonia said as making Bitcoin illegal. I could be wrong though.
