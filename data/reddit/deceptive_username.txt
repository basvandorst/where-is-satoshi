not paying off your mortgage is an advantage because you can deduct your interest from taxable income. so not free, but maybe like 30% off.

Wouldn't the mortgage be free if you didn't pay it?

Don't spend half what you're willing to invest right now lol. 5%, maybe 10% sounds good.

whats wrong with lastpass?

I'm a super paranoid person too. And you are probably right about crypto keys. I am going to switch my methods because I too seek 100% certainty of privacy.
To play devil's advocate:
Why would they want your 200 dollars when other companies protect millions with last pass? Security is their business. Is security your business?
Would you know what to do with the code if you had it? Those concerns would sound half baked to a programmer.
Last pass is very transparent about the security precautions. They aren't hiding how it secures your data. Genuine security can show you how it works and still be secure.
Passwords get stolen. Your browser could be hacked and stealing all your passwords. Last pass allows you to use strong passwords that change regularly. So if they get your password, it doesn't matter, because you change it every month right?
But for crypto keys, I guess you're right.
I dont put my certificates in last pass. They aren't changable.
If u need a permanent password then last pass may not be ideal. But still decent. Ideally u'd have a physical storage but even that can be compromised or lost.
Theres no stopping it. You just gotta stay on the move and hope they don't want your shit. Like wanna cry only hacked like hospitals and shit. So its like getting cancer I guess. Its rare.
In some day soon, all our passwords will be instantly hacked
All our accounts will be wide open. Like the south Park show.

what are you talking about

A circle's area doubles if the diameter is increased just 25%! It's hard to visualize and compare circles.

Sorry, didn't know you were op, and I was genuinely worried about LastPass based on your response, since I use it.
I understand you are more paranoid. You're right that LastPass is closed source, is there a reason why LastPass is bad tho? Is it being closed source the only reason, and if so, id like to learn why that is bad so that I can switch to something else.

why did you laugh at lastpass?

So then hedge your bets by buying btc?

Don’t you already have none of your USD while it’s converted into crypto? How long would you have left your USD alone if BTC value slowly kept going up?

BTC’s dominance in the market cap has gone up about 10% in this downward trend. BTC is still king, make no mistake about it. The people with hope are simply just those who aren’t inserting fear in the market. Nothing about the technology has changed. The fear will remove and price will go up, that’s the nature of markets.

TA doesn’t attempt to predict the market. Predicting the market is impossible. TA doesn’t allow you to do the impossible.

When I trade , let's say .05 bitcoin, to an altcoin, my records show -.05bitcoin and + whatever coin... where does the bitcoin go exactly? And where did the altcoin come from?
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:10:01
Isn't that a really mean thing for the government to do?

If you can't use something for gambling, then it wouldn't be money. Being able to use bitcoin for gambling is good, because there is a recipient willing to take bitcoin as payment, confirming that bitcoin has value. The gambling part is irrelevant.
