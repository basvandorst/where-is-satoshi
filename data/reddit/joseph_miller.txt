So the CFTC helped nobody. It charged them $75,000 to eliminate the free option 0, which was to maintain their security arrangements. Relatedly, do you think the CFTC considered multi-sig with the VC-backed and regulated third-party security company BitGo to be lower security than BFX's previous arrangement?
On a meta level, I'm shocked to find someone defending Dodd Frank, let alone in @_date: 2016-08-20 17:59:06
They can and I'm sure they do or will once tx fees become a substantial enough fraction of the block reward to bother.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:02:16




So their customers' bitcoins were safe for 4 years until the CFTC decides that they were violating Dodd Frank by keeping their customers' coins in cold storage and fines them $75,000. Two months after they work with the CFTC to become compliant by moving all coins to multisig segregated hot wallets, they are hacked and 120,000 coins are stolen.
And your response is, in essence, "Bitfinex is at fault and should have known that becoming compliant by option A rather than option B would result in a theft of bitcoins that no customers nor the CFTC, nor the security professionals consulted anticipated."

@_date: 2016-08-16 01:37:11
You're asking about the median of the distribution. My math says ln(2) times the ~~rate~~ length, so ~6.9 minutes.
In other words, 50% of blocks should be found in &lt;6.9 minutes from the last block.

He's the guy who proclaimed "sell all your bitcoins. I've discovered that it is broken" a few years ago.
Anyway, I'm sure you can learn *things* from Ethereum. I just don't think they will be *useful* things. After a very quick skim of his blog, I see that it has a lot of generic reporting/forecasts/technical details about Ethereum and bitcoin. No clearly useful things learned from Ethereum, but maybe I'd have to dig deeper.


Optimistically, it may be called a "laboratory". A very expensive one that probably won't produce anything useful.

I'm PoS-curious. And not for the reasons that you refuted in your essay:


Of course, I agree with this. But what can we say about *cheapness* defined as *security/($ of block reward)*? That's the more important issue. Can we say anything about that? I haven't read Andrew's paper.

[The original Business Insider piece](
Some highlights with commentary:


A prediction that we are in the process of testing.


Milton Friedman used to point out how the fed liked to pretend it was "fighting inflation" when, as we all know, it is solely responsible for it. 2.5% average inflation (over an unspecified period of time) can get pretty big if you wait a few periods.




Everybody says this as if it's obvious. Not at all. Why is it better if two $200 bitcoins are spent than one $400 bitcoin? If this is a serious problem, we can all agree to start talking in terms of mbtc again, if we like.


"Climbs up" a mild 9000% but "careens down" just 55%.


I end on one he got very right.
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:44:41
Probably in some special circumstances but in general, that doesn't make sense. Simply changing the value of the units of currency doesn't change people's time preference and the real interest rate.
It's also clearly true that inflation encourages people to hold smaller cash balances (in real value) than they otherwise would which is a loss to the economy because it makes people less liquid.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:58:25
Yes, sorry I misunderstood you.
But "Live"? Just use a hardware wallet (though I'm sure it's not compatible yet). You shouldn't be reusing addresses anyway, so you'll want to access keys to generate new addresses in any case.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:28:43
Using the most generous possible circumstances to him, bitcoin went from $1100 to $190, an 83% loss.
He predicted $1100 to under $10, a &gt;99% loss.
On a linear scale, that doesn't seem like a big difference. But logarithmically, which is what matters for profit making, it's *yuge*. He wasn't even half right.
And of course, right now, bitcoin is &gt;40x what he predicted. If you shorted at $190 hoping to take 18x profits at $10, you'd be in pretty serious trouble.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:38:07
I wonder if you were even paying attention to bitcoin then.
[The article](
He "called" the crash a few weeks after it topped once bitcoin had already lost ~45%. We all knew it was crashing, having had its most spectacular year (on high enough volume to profit off of).
He then boldly stuck his neck out saying that by the middle of 2014, bitcoin would be $10. Not even close.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:57:01


Totally ignoring *his own* time frame, I'll add.


It sounds like you missed this.
@_date: 2016-04-23 16:46:01


In one sense, that is true: everyone individually optimizes the amount of money they hold.
But with respect to the larger economy, it doesn't make much sense that the amount of hoarding changes the steady-state growth rate of the economy.
What if there were an extra $1 trillion in USD in allocated storage divided up for each person on Earth? What if the vault with this money were sunk to the bottom of the Mariana Trench? The amount of "hoarded" cash would be substantially higher; price levels would be the same, and growth rates wouldn't change.
Simply moving this allocated storage to people's mattresses and increasing everyone's desire to hold a cumulative $1 trillion extra in cash balances is precisely the same situation.

Because other coins don't have the transaction demand nor the very inconvenient goal of being decentralized.


Payment channel initialization is an on-chain transaction. Strange to criticize LN for both being off-chain and being on-chain.
Anyway, LN is the only way cryptocurrencies can scale, as far as I know. It also offers way better privacy, uncensorable immediate transactions, and low fees. What's the problem?
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:37:27


What is your angle here? You think there will be fewer than 675 nodes on the LN network?
Yes, testing on testnet is free, but using LN on mainnet saves you tx fees and transfers real money.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:56:09


How is this now practical? If this is going to truly be trustless (i.e. not some script the tenant runs that sends out $X of Bitcoin every month for his convenience), you'd have to pre-fund some address with the entire balance of your yearly rent, right?
I'm not saying that smart contracts are *useless*, but I just don't see a niche.

@_date: 2018-01-02 06:22:07
There are two parties to every transaction. The recipient will know who you are and can investigate your entire transaction history.
LN is just about uniformly better than a regular on-chain transaction.  But if you don't like it, don't use it. You'll have lower fees thanks to most of the transactions moving off chain.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:32:44

How long does it take to sync an ETH node?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:56:07


Except they're usually using someone else's node, not an SPV wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:54:42
You can't reduce the blockchain size. It grows at about 1 MB every 10 minutes.
So initial sync of your node grows in time (offset by increases in efficiency and hardware improvements).
You don't however have to store the entire blockchain--you can use a pruned node. If you do, you won't be able to serve old blocks to help other nodes sync though.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:49:09
Sidechains are not the Lightning network.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:01:57
I don't think it's coinbase. It's just a lot of large Segwit transactions that have been pending for a while in the miners' mempools.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:02:34
Never been through a tollbooth?
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:35:05
There is no getting around this: all of the data in a block must be relayed multiple times by each node, and further adds to the sync time for new nodes. Are you sure you want to increase on-chain throughput for temporary relief?
Once LN is used widely (it's currently in limited use), fees will probably fall back to very reasonable levels and we can spend the next few years debating HFs to do all sorts of things including increasing the block size, while still having a decentralized bitcoin.

The guy who wrote [this](


I agree. Would like a better definition
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:12:35


Ok, yeah it's likely more risk for a merchant. Though I don't see why  they can't just wait until the end of the business day and use their key to sign hundreds of balance-updating transactions with one manual step. Am I wrong?


True, you're right. You can generate hundreds of addresses at once and access the private key only one time, whereas on LN you need to access the private keys to sign whenever you want to update the channel balance. I'll grant that it's a substantial difference, though I think you're still moderately overstating the importance.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:50:11
TIL. How does the system know what the value of the coin is relative to the dollar? Some voting scheme?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:11:48


That's obviously up to the economic majority to decide. But it seems to be after some LN implementation has at least been formally released.
Note that if we had started with an 8MB block size, development of off-chain, scalable solutions would have been even slower. Fair to say that BTC could have been better off with a 500 kb block size.


Then you're not paying attention or reading widely enough. Try this:
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:03:26
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:36:02
You're not being dumb. It's just how bitcoin works. When you send a transaction, you use inputs to your address from old transactions as the "bills". So if someone sends me 2.32 BTC in one transaction I have a 2.32 "Bitcoin-bill" and must get change when I send it.

There's no maximum. Opening/closing on the blockchain will occur occasionally, such as when the counterparty isn't compliant or more funds are required.


If nobody is using the blockchain, then it'll be cheaper to use. It's in equilibrium.

Depends how you define hot wallet. To most, it implies that the private keys are on a device connected to a computer. LN doesn't have to be hot in that case.

I guess you'd know...
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:49:19
No, man. Once again, you're judging LN on two different standards.
Your original point was that it CANNOT be used in the same way that on-chain BTC is used. I'm showing you that it can get relatively close (though you correctly point out ways in which it is not close).
You then, again and again, keep coming back at me with "but then you're not taking advantage of the LN!". Well duh.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:02:57

@_date: 2018-01-07 06:08:26


Was specifically talking about Kraken's bech32 support, but yes, this applies even more so to other exchanges that don't use segwit at all.


Thanks for the info, but I don't personally think this complication excuses them. Seems clear to me that they're just waiting for Bitcoin Core to do it because they can, just like how Coinbase didn't bother supporting segwit because they thought they could push the 2x fork on us instead.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:10:36


Yes there is. It's the current plan, which is to raise the block size after exhausting other options.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:26:03
No. A signed transaction is not a private key. Where do you learn this BS?
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:43:43


Missing the point. If you're running a node to earn tx fees, yes a HW wallet would be inconvenient. But we're comparing using on-chain bitcoin (where there is no such capability) to LN. The only difference is that you have to sign to receive txs in LN, which you can do securely through a HW wallet.


Again, you're not following my point. On-chain, you need to use your private key to generate a new address to receive payments. In LN, you need to use your private key to sign and update to receive payments. There is a difference, but it's not as much as you make it sound. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:45:45
Spend, sure. But invest?
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:10:09
No, we love privacy. Transparency in transactions is a drawback. We just like that blockchains (and, importantly, LN) are trustless and make it so you can't cheat or violate the 21 million BTC limit.
The transparency of blockchains is instrumental. If we had an open-source currency that was still audit-able by anyone's node and decentralized, had a coin limit, and had perfectly private transactions, we would want to use that.

Yes I was going to mention LN actually, so I definitely agree there. It uses a small set of smart-contracting functions, e.g. timelock and multisig, and is obviously important.
I guess I'm thinking about ETH/RSK-styie smart contracts. Is there e.g. an entire class of things that you need an open-ended programming language for? I'm skeptical that there's a ton of business value

Yes, on In reality, anyone can route payments through their node as long as they have two open connections. Competition will balance the topology of the network, so even if only a few wanted to open multiple connections, the "hub" won't be able to charge high fees for very long until others compete.

I'm not sure how "more development" can be defined, but when I say "the world", I mean that there were no businesses supporting developers, many of the current devs weren't involved, and many things that could have been rewritten when it was less mature and didn't hold billions of $ of value weren't.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:13
Any reasonably well-connected node can be used. The graph probably won't be entirely distributed and flat, just like the current bitcoin network isn't. E.g. many particular bitcoin nodes (and any bitcoin node in general) acts as a "hub" to many other users and nodes.
But it won't be centralized, because then the centerpoint can charge monopoly prices for sending transactions and others nodes will compete.
The only way to get complete decentralization is by *forcing* users to run software. The LN and BTC network approach is to simply make the barriers to entry as low as possible. On the other hand, more than half of Bcash nodes are run by the same entity and the cost of running a Bcash node, if it achieves usage, is far higher than the cost of running a Bitcoin node. But even now, almost all transactions are broadcasted through the "hubs" of Coinbase, Bitcoin.com, and blockchain.info.

They already did. Blocks up to about 4 MBs are possible. With full adoption of Segwit and current ts-type mix, they'd be ~2 MB.
It's a bad idea for a few reasons. First, it would be a further increase in maximal and immediate bandwidth requirements for nodes. Second, it is a hard fork without anything approaching consensus. People are not willing to threaten decentralization just to achieve lower fees with LN around the corner. It also makes virtually every knows attack vector on bitcoin more threatening. That's why.

If the economy grows, the value of each bitcoin will rise. If you're worried about 1 Satoshi being too valuable, we can just subdivide Satoshis in the protocol (technically, multiply everyone's number of bitcoins by 10 and move the decimal over to the left one place). Even if we don't subdivide Satoshis, we can build systems on top of bitcoin that keep track of fractions of a Satoshi.

It's much more complicated than that. Miners, in equilibrium, don't make more money from bigger blocks, nor from increased fees. It's a competitive market and the difficulty rises shortly after miner revenues rise.
The real conflict between miners and users is that people who use bitcoin need to be able to trust the network. If there's not a diversity of nodes, a user has no reason to trust the network. Miners don't have to run nodes, and running a node is inconvenient and can become costly if blocks are too big.

Vertical would mean that quantity demanded is constant for all prices.
What you describe is definitely the case and is the typical downward-sloping demand curve.
In practice, people (businesses especially) would simply economize. Follow some Coinbase coins and you'll see that they do many transactions--lots of room for potential improvement. Long-term, it means that there would be more demand for LN and such things.

How could they have been any more clear:


If judges rule to overturn this, the future of smart contracts is bleak. They will be unenforceable and therefore worthless. I would be dumbfounded if a judge contravened in this situation.
Your first comment seems to be about the violation of The DAO's contract. I'd imagine that they'd go after the leaders and anyone who profited off "insider" knowledge of the soft-fork and potential hard-fork.
To the extent that the TOS of the Ethereum crowdsale has been violated, the authorities might have more reason to go after the leaders involved.


So why did the Ethereum Foundation bother to hire lawyers and move to Switzerland (or Sweden, or wherever) before they initiated the crowdsale? No, government/legal notions of property probably cannot be consistently applied to cryptocurrency. But they can be applied inconsistently and cause a lot of harm. Selfishly, as a bitcoiner, I don't want them to start. I think the Ethereum people's recklessness is probably bad for us both.
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:23:12


Utility? Maybe. So far, all smart contracts are good for is tricking investors out of $60,000,000 and allowing the "attacker" to provably bribe miners to keep his money.
But why should anyone use Ethereum as money? Why would anyone hold Eth? You can just buy some before you want to write a bribe contract to the miners.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:50:28
Obviously, there needs to be a way to rebroadcast stuck transactions.
But beyond that, remember that *no matter the block size, it is costless to spam transactions and fill up anyone's mempool*. If gets hysterical every time this happens, it will keep happening.
Also, the average fee per tx size is *lower* than the weekly average. This is obviously just a deliberate move.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:56:34
Yeah. They make that clear from their [ether sale blog post]( 
Looks like the legal documentation and TOS have been taken down though.
But securities or not, their terms of service came with promises which they might be violating, and commodity or regulation in whatever jurisdiction they are established certainly has rules against front-running, insider trading, and so on.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:34:39
Sorry, I wasn't sure if you were asking in earnest before.


Yes, roughly this. Each person may make fewer transactions allowing for more people to use the network. Total "usage" (= # transactions) will remain the same. The reason that what I said didn't imply that usage would fall is because if *demand* (the whole curve) rises, which is how you model increased adoption, and the quantity is fixed, the price rises. "Usage", however, remains the same.
But we can be more concrete: each person has a lot of different uses for bitcoin, some higher values and others lower value. Increasing demand translates into increased price (in the short-run..LN and segwit are ways to increase supply), which will just mean that people will consolidate transactions more, businesses will be smarter about not wasting txs, off-chain services will be used more, and people will preferentially use bitcoin for higher-value transactions.
In the end, the block size is a decentralization/security parameter. Once it's set, the market will take care of allocating transaction space. Long-term, again, bitcoin can scale indefinitely. Medium-term, we will get a 1.7-4x boost in capacity which will pave the way for more and faster upgrades.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:07:55


WHAT ARE YOU NORMIES DOING IN CRYPTOCURRENCY
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:21:08
I'm not sure how to make it more clear than this: *any* block size can be filled at near-zero cost. Looking at the proportion of a block that is full tells you *nothing* about the status of the network or whether or not there is a problem.


Nothing will happen. Fees will rise until quantity supplied = quantity demanded. That's all.
And no, Mike isn't a concern troll. But he also doesn't know nearly as much as the developers (whom you failed to cite) who think that he's full of it. Thankfully, he made testable predictions which were wrong, right before he stormed off and joined R3.
And just looking at the last 10 blocks (ending at height 416574), we have an average fee rate of ~32 cents per kb. Again, not a disaster. Price is at 2-year highs so activity is high. And tx fees have been higher before.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:49:21
Why would even 10% of the hashpower shut down? Marginal cost of ASIC mining is very low.
And bitcoin has fallen in price by more than 50% many times before. Also, the price is up 55% in the past month, so marginal revenue has undergone a huge boost leaving much more of a cushion.
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:55:00
That is so full of nonsense I wouldn't know where to begin.
Might as well just wait until July so you can see that nothing happens.
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:00:49


And no, I didn't miss your point. We can be near any block size at any time. Low/zero-fee transactions are free to create--you only have to pay for fees on transactions that get into blocks.


That is an obvious point. But changing the fees will cause people to economize on transactions. Hence, demand curve is not vertical.


A little dramatic, huh. There are literally no problems. Some spammers wanted to cause outrage. They got uninformed people like you to concern troll. That's it.

Offline devices. How many times have you forgotten to log out of google on a friend's computer?


You'll have to clarify what you mean. They can "be" in multiple physical places in the same way that your google account can "be" in multiple physical places. Your keys allow you to send coins which are associated with an address on the decentralized bitcoin network. Your email password allows you to send emails which are associated with an email address on google's database.


If you have a ledger wallet, you don't need to deal directly with the keys. The keys themselves you'll never need to see or store--they're generated ad infinitum by that 24-word code. That code, however, should be stored safely offline. Put it (and perhaps a duplicate) somewhere safe--it'll allow you to access your bitcoins even if you lose your ledger wallet.

No. There was no GDAX back then, and there were no exchanges below $100 of the ones that I know.
Gox was $102 only because there were rumors that the BTC were stolen (or from insider trading on the platform after trading was closed). No way that counts. Otherwise, the lowest at that time was in the $400s, which was followed by a drop to ~$180 in early 2015.

Got a source? I've *never* heard it used before in any probability textbook because it's awkward. The PMF and the CDF are different things, and he referred to both separately (both were plotted on the same graph). He very clearly knew the initialism PDF, but knew that the distribution is discrete and so couldn't use the word "density", so he substituted in "distribution".
Because probability distributions can be characterized by a CDF or a PMF/PDF, talking about a generic "probability distribution *function*" is vague and (at the very least) nonstandard.

Unconfirmed transactions are simply signed transactions without fees high enough for miners to include (yet). If you re-broadcast with a higher fee, it'll get confirmed. If you change your mind and don't want it broadcasted, you're possibly in a bit of trouble because *somewhere* there's a signed transaction that authorizes a send from address A to address B. The solution is to broadcast a new tx to a different address with 1 more satoshi fee and hope that it propagates to miners before they mine the next block.

\&gt; The increased size of downloading mainchain ***and*** sidechain leads to the same consequences as a blocksize increase.
Only for the miners. My BTC node will not need to relay or compute on any extra data. I also don't see a compelling reason to worry if one sidechain out of many decides to trust centralized miners, or is buggy, or experimental--it doesn't affect the other sidechains or mainchain.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:25:45


They're not mutually exclusive, and all wallets I've used allow custom fees already. Also, I'm not sure that "adding support for rbf" is that complicated. It's just allowing users to rebroadcast unconfirmed but spent transactions.

A signed transaction exists and is not in the blockchain. There's no such thing as "returning" the money. It's yours up until the point that someone mines that tx. Realistically, they'll probably just delete the signed tx from their mempool after a while.
If you want to make sure it'll never be sent, simply send that output in another transaction to yourself and get that included in a block.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:42:10

@_date: 2017-08-26 23:56:00


Not this high. They were 50 sats/byte when Bcash had higher difficulty.
On Segwit, it all depends. Some people are fine paying $5 or more per transaction and won't bother looking up how to take advantage of Segwit. But you still can. I'm pretty sure Ledger wallets can send Segwit transactions as of a few days ago, which is what I use.

@_date: 2017-01-03 04:03:11


Easy and intuitive to make in ggplot, with a little practice.


Yes. Growth rates are highly correlated with one another, and that rugplot is a good way of showing it. Those bubbles had some days that were well over 10% growth and many more smaller % days (see histogram below of overall distribution). Another one like that would put bitcoin well over $10,000*.
I added some [plots]( of the histogram of the growth rates and simulations of uncorrelated versions of bitcoin's price history. The histogram is symmetrical, but the autocorrelation causes the bubbles. You can see how different the growth curves look compared to the real price history. Also how symmetrical their rallies and dumps look.

This cannot be a serious question. It depends on an enormous number of factors and circumstances. I will say that $5 per transaction on the blockchain does not seem like a lot if you have to settle only a few transactions a year through LN. And of course, credit can make it so you never have to transact on the blockchain yourself, which expands the multiplier enormously.

2. He himself never says or writes "probability distribution function". All of what he refers to as a "PDF" are various probability density functions. "Probability distribution function" is only in the title, which was likely uploaded by an OCW administrator who isn't an authority in probability.
3. Just because you can find something on google doesn't mean that it is remotely common out in the real world.
Because your "citation" only proves that you can find a wikipedia disambiguation for it, here's another source:


Again, I have *never* heard of a "PDF" referring to anything other than a probability density function and I wonder if you have.
And once more, the author very clearly meant "PMF", not the needlessly vague and nonstandard "probability distribution function".

Not sure why you think this. There are already P2SH transactions. If people are sick of high fees, they can use Segwit.


Bitcoin does. Segwit increases the max block size by 4x. You want another increase before, as you say, Segwit is even adopted?


Because it also means more bandwidth required which harms decentralization, opens up possibilities for attacks (because of latency in propagating blocks), and provides no change in scale.

@_date: 2016-11-28 03:10:31
There is no optimum that can be measured reliably. This isn't physics.
If the blocksize is too big, transaction fees will approach zero, which will be a problem for miners once the subsidy diminishes. It also exposes the network to a bunch of attacks by miners because of the lag in verifying and downloading new blocks. There's also that it will make the demand on nodes larger, which decreases bitcoin's decentralization (and is the whole purpose of this experiment).
The relevant people seem to think that 1 MB is safe and that Segwit will buy enough time to ease the transition to scalable solutions to processing transactions.

What kind of maniac spends 1 month in bitcoin and then has the chutzpah to tell us how it should be changed?
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:28:05
I don't see how watchtowers could possible have been avoided (but I could be wrong of course...). For LN to work trustlessly and settle permanently, you need this timeout period.
But I also can't imagine it costing more than a transaction, which we've seen is already far less than a cent. Relaying a tx require you to lock up funds in a channel, monitoring the network as a watchtower requires your computer to go online every now and again and run a script. It'll be highly competitive.
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:42:26
Use your heads, people. You can't argue that raising the block size will reduce transaction fees for users yet keep transaction fees the same for spammers.
This is why we think you big block proponents are ignorant.

Because it will never be optimally solved (not to mention UI improvements, improvements to performance, etc) so improvements will have to be paid for. It's a statistical problem--traffic patterns change randomly and forecasting even for this small part of the product can always be improved.

@_date: 2018-06-26 00:47:29

They *have* considered raising the block size to 2 MB. Segwit raises the blocksize with less harm, less controversy, as a soft-fork, and solves transaction malleability.

Sure, they can change it. But that would be yet another fork of the project. As it stands, the JM fork would be open source (in that the source code is available) yet centralized.
It's clear to me that we need both concepts--one doesn't imply the other.
For another example, what if the economics of bitcoin were such that mining was only economical when done in a single mining pool, all connected to a single node on the network? It's certainly possible. I think again that this should be considered open source and centralized.

"Dominance" doesn't mean "% of total market" (except in Bitcoin's case). Litecoin, Primecoin, NXT, ETH, etc have all lost dominance relative to the many newer coins.

No, the block subsidy has no impact on the tx fees. If it did, then when the price goes up (increasing subsidy), the fees would come down.

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:46:43
Np. Key property is that if you have a peer in common with someone else in the LN (or peer in common with a peer in common with...) you can pay any person. So rather than needing a transaction potentially for each pair of people (Alice, Bob), you need a single infrequent (trustless, uncensorable, etc etc) opening/closing transaction with a reasonably well-connected peer.
Since using the LN will require your spending funds to be locked up for the time in between closing/opening the channel, there might be people who prefer to trust a company/exchange to maintain their LN connection to others for a fee. But that's not necessary and the fee will probably be low because of open entry and competition. There might even be less-trust-requiring ways of doing this, but I'm not an expert.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:49:16

Ok, then I don't think you have anything to worry about. The coins you send to your deposit address should be credited to your account. No online wallet or exchange just leaves them there--they move them offline or to other users withdrawing coins at the time.

@_date: 2017-11-21 19:07:21
I'm guessing that's just your deposit address. As long as you can log on into your account at cryptopay (is anyone sure they're legit?) and see the correct balance then don't worry. They'll move the coins around but your account is credited on their internal database.
But I would NOT use an online wallet, especially if it's not reputable. Please get a hardware wallet or install electrum, mycelium, bitcoin core, etc. on a clean install of a trusted OS. As soon as you do, withdraw your coins and manage them yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:14:48

I'm saying that the fact that we have to pay taxes in USD (which I assume for the sake of argument, I don't actually know) doesn't "back" the USD's value. You can pay taxes in dollars no matter the market cap of dollars because market cap is a stock, and taxes are a flow.


The dollar has a tiny bit of utility because you don't have to exchange it before paying taxes. But it has the enormous disutility that it inflates.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:17:53
It's an *option* to insert a middle man. You don't have to. People (not me) seem to be okay with using Coinbase as a wallet, so I predict that they will also be okay with trusting Coinbase's (or whoever's) LN hub with a small amount of their money. Note that they can still keep all of their Bitcoins in their own wallet--just have coinbase charge your credit card when you spend BTC from their LN hub. This will reduce transaction load on the bitcoin network enormously for e-commerce.




Not even on these terms, no. For one, it's simply true that when blocks are not full, transaction fees are near-zero. This ensures that the network, in the long run, cannot have security without hard forking to eliminate the block size limit and pay for it through the inflation tax.
Second, on-chain scaling requires you to trust the middleman who is running your node. It sure won't be you when those 8 MB blocks become full and they hard fork to 16.
Off-chain scaling requires no trust at all (but again, you can optionally trust someone if you want).

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:28:00
In-chain? Depends what you mean. All transactions cannot and should not be broadcasted on the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin doesn't scale in that way.
But I think Lightning network is what you're looking for because it retains bitcoin's important properties. It's being developed by a few teams right now and exists in testnet. Should provide much cheaper fees and open, uncensorable use (no need to interface with a big bank or legal payment processor).
None of PayPal or Mastercard or any legacy institution have any connection to this. They're just goofing around aimlessly with "blockchain tech".

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:01:47
What wallet are you using? 
Understand that you've authorized a transaction and broadcasted it on the internet. In theory, if you haven't moved the coins, miners can mine that transaction 10 years from now.
In practice, most miners and nodes only keep a queue of pending transactions for a few days and then delete them. So your wallet should "forget" the transaction after some time or may give you the option to re-broadcast with a higher fee.
To get an idea of when it might be confirmed, go to [ click on the most recent block height, and compare the Satoshis per weight unit of your transaction to the ones at the bottom, which are the lowest fees.

No, under no circumstance are they lost. If the transaction is still "pending", there's a chance it'll go through. If not, it's back in your first wallet.
If you're cool waiting a few days, just sit tight. If not, you can just send the unconfirmed balance from the second wallet into a third wallet with a high enough fee to compensate and miners will mine it. I'd wait though, feel should come down soon.

There's a guide in the comments to bumping your fee:
which you should look into if you need that transaction confirmed immediately. If not, just wait a few more days max. Your coins are safe.
[Here]( is the current backlog. It was at almost all-time-highs over the weekend due to the bcash stuff. The transaction will either get confirmed in a few days, or miners (and Mycelium's node) will delete it from their queue and it'll be back in your first address.

Not sure. A related question that puzzles me:
What goes through a noob's head that makes them think that they can solve bitcoin after only a month or two of familiarity? To me, if an "obvious" patch hasn't been incorporated into bitcoin, I assume there's a good reason for it.
Is it just that bitcoin is new and people don't know what they don't know?

Denominated in bitcoins? Then it's a definition. We're arguing about the dollar value of each side of that conversion.


So why pay a fee at all? Do you not pay fees to induce miners to mine blocks in a way that *you* want? Are you saying that the risk of miners stealing your coins will be entirely independent of the fees you pay to miners? If so and true, then I'm wrong. If false, then I'm right.

Was that your point? In my initial comment I said "Yes, they are (minus one fee)", yet you disagreed. Now it sounds like you agree with me that fees are the only cost you'd pay, but are arguing that they can be very high. I don't think they will be, but I'm not interested in guessing games.

Yes, they are (minus one fee). They are 1-1 convertible, just like having 1 btc balance on Circle.
@_date: 2016-09-25 21:33:42


It's not correct to insist that people *store* that bitcoin on Circle in this mental exercise. The essential point is that they are backed 1-1 by bitcoins, like the LN coins, and can be exchanged for a small fee. If you eliminate the possibility of moving them on/off-chain then the comparison no longer applies.
If anybody is willing to sell 1 btc on circle for 0.99 btc in my personal wallet, I'll make that trade my day job and become infinitely rich.

@_date: 2016-09-24 23:49:28


Interpret the word "tx fee" as "tx cost", and none of what you're saying is inconsistent with what I wrote--you're just making things needlessly complicated. If the coins are 1-1 exchangeable, the price difference will be at most the cost of transferring the coins. This cost can take the form of risk (i.e. risk of not getting a confirmation if you choose to pay low fees) or cost in explicit fees.


This statement baffles me. You *pay* a fee to ensure that miners update the ledger to reflect that you want to peg your coins to transfer between chains. They are intimately related.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:49:17

That would be disastrous.
@_date: 2016-09-25 01:10:59


I obviously can't confirm this myself, but ok. If true, I accept the implications. But intuitively, you'd expect that a sidechain with a provably weak security model yet 1-1 exchangeable would simply not be used. I.e., 1-1 btc exchangeability must coexist with 1:1 dollar pricing. So where sidechains exist, if they exist (begging the question?) prices should be equal.


On a superficial level, the fees should align the miner's incentives more closely with the users (miners mine empty blocks occasionally), but sure, unclear.

Sure, we're mostly on the same page. But I just don't think "cost" is the right word. It's an average cost over a seemingly arbitrary quantity. E.g. why only look at transactions? What about "average cost per hodler-year" (annual inflation) which would paint a very different story.
Marginal cost per tx is the tx fee and is the true cost.

1. Yes, it's open source. No, someone can always modify open-source software to make it incompatible with other software. But that's not a material drawback.
2. Yes, LN will improve anonymity substantially: most transactions will not be pushed to the blockchain, so less information will be recorded. I'm also moderately confident that much fancier anonymity protocols can be implemented on it, but I'm not certain.

But until they're ready, this is the obvious way we use Bitcoin's network effect to our advantage: every top 10 coin should be regularly ported as an airdrop for BTC hodlers.

The definition of a sidechain implies a method to exchange bitcoins 1-1 with sidechain-coins.
If the cost of turning one bitcoin into a sidechain-coin is one tx fee, and the cost of turning one sidechain-coin into one bitcoin is one tx fee, then the prices will be within a tx fee from one another.
You're describing a sidechain in which there is a large potential tx fee to exchange back to bitcoins. Still, they'll be within one tx fee of the price. However, I don't think anyone will use that sidechain if it has no other benefits.

1 Sat/byte transactions are getting confirmed. A fee is either enough to get included in a block, or it isn't. There's no real meaning to "fastest and cheapest".
To answer your question though, it's a mix of a huge amount of new hashpower on the network (blocks are above 7/hour),Segwit's blocksize increase, less spam (which subsided around Aug 1), approximate profit parity between BCH and BTC so we don't have periods of 3 blocks/hour, and people being smarter about fees (never use the recommended fee).

You're doing it wrong. If you want to look at prime factors, 12 = 2^2 \*3.

$2,000,000 is a reasonable lower bound. Two ways to get there: taking the size of the global bond market with risk-adjusted yield below GDP growth, adding to that the size of gold and other wealth storage, and most global currencies.
Now of course, with competition by bitcoin, yields will be higher so this isn't an equilibrium but the first order estimate gets you well above $2,000,000.
Or, take projections of the total savings rate. How much of your income would you want to save as insurance? Globally, this is about 80-160% of GDP (so about a year's worth of income, which makes intuitive sense). If people saved in Bitcoin rather than property, gold, bank accounts, bonds, etc, bitcoin's price would be &gt;$2,000,000 each.
This is all conditional on Bitcoin succeeding by not getting hacked, governments not banning it, etc.

Quick answers: LN does use the blockchain, but only for dispute resolution. It is virtually as trustless as on-chain (minor, unlikely exceptions), uncensorable, has better privacy, and provides instant transactions.
Turns out, the scaling problems go hand-in-hand with being a public blockchain. So fixing one pain point tends to fix the other.

It's pretty clear from Satoshi's bitcointalk posts that he intended mining to be that incentive. He didn't consider that it would become so specialized. AFAIK, there's no way to specifically incentivize running nodes in a way that can't be gamed.
But as others have said, the incentive is for users of bitcoin to run their own code to verify the histories of the coins they receive.


This is why a lot of us here want to keep the block size as small as reasonable and prefer second-layer scaling.

Yeah. If the price spikes associate with the halvings, then S/F makes a better model. Otherwise, it's basically the same.
\&gt; For error measurement and charts (and in his whole code of github) he  seems to consider discrete data points for price.
As long as he uses equally-spaced (or at least not selectively-chosen) points in time and computed the ln(S/F) for that time, all is good. There is some arbitrariness in the times chosen and strategy for handling/weighting the pre-exchange Bitcoin prices since there aren't a lot of time points but I'll take it for granted that he's not doing anything dubious.

I wasn't moralizing. I mean that when dollars were backed by X ounces of gold, the dollar was worth exactly X ounces of gold, because if it were any lower/higher, you could buy/sell it in exchange for gold until it equilibrates.
When a currency is "backed" by the full faith and credit of the United States, that means absolutely nothing. There is no fixed amount of "credit" or "faith" that you can buy/sell with it to guarantee that the currency won't go to zero.
When it is backed by "the ability to pay taxes", but the tax system demands X% of your yearly income in value rather than $X per year like a poll tax with tradeable tax receipts, there is likewise no floor on the dollar's value. We're not buying anything with our taxes in any meaningful sense, because we can't resell it, so it's not a proper backing.
"The dollar is backed by [some non-salable concept/right/feeling]" is just a word game and doesn't imply anything about the dollar's value.

I'm a statistician.
First thought was that log(stock/flow) in bitcoin is essentially a piecewise "time since genesis block", so it's not clear which is better thought of as driving Bitcoin's growth. Not that it matters for price prediction, since they'll co-vary in the same way until 2140.
But silver and gold lying so close to the trend make it pretty interesting.
He also says that the relationship follows a power-law--I'm not sold on the extra significance of this. Any time you do linear regression on log-log axes, you'll get a power law. The interesting part is that the fit is good when you force the form of the relationship to follow y = a\*e\^(bx).
I've also heard people describe the fit as "95% accurate". This is not the right terminology, since we're predicting a continuous-valued response. What's 0.95 is the fraction of variance in the ln(price) "explained by" varying ln(SF). You need those ln()s, too. In other words, after using the model, the variance in the model's "errors" is 0.05\*var(ln(price)).

There is no equilibrium. If one is 1.01x as profitable, all the miners (rationally) will mine on it, leaving the other in the dust until difficulty adjustment and the cycle repeats in reverse.
There hasn't been a single BCH block in 4 hours because BTC is more profitable.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:23:09
Bitcoin's fees are high (not nearly $30-$40 for a 1 in 2 out transaction, the other day I was transacting for $0.01...) because the blockchain is used and refuses to sacrifice decentralization for short-term cheap fees. Bitcoin's strategy is to build a layered protocol in which the base layer is as decentralized and incorruptible as possible. 
Higher layers can only ever be as decentralized as the base layer. You don't build on top of a shaky foundation.

Yeesh, this UCLA *finance* professor measures the "wastefulness" of bitcoin in electricity? Simple arithmetic shows its economic "waste", all resources considered (which is the correct way to count "waste", not just energy), is 6000\*12.5\*6\*24\*365. It's just the total amount miners spend on minting new coins.
But then he might risk teaching his audience to realize that the US government's inflation costs the economy far more than that.

In general, skepticism that a decentralized computer is a useful application of blockchains.

I bet the DAO hacker could have done this, if not for intervention by the devs (violating Eth's ethic), possible only because the community was small at the time.

It is true. If blocks were unlimited, the price for a tx would be equal to the marginal cost of including an extra tx in a block: fractions of a penny. The network would likely not be secure because you also stipulate that all the bitcoins are mined.

But a more serious concern is how hard it is to prove that a universal computer slash digital cash system is even unbreakable. The game-theoretic implications are incomprehensible (at least to me, and possibly to everyone).

No, security is a public good and doesn't factor into the supply/demand for txs. Subsidizing it with inflation doesn't reduce tx fees. Tx fees are only dependent on the supply/demand of/for space in a block.
For security, sidechains can be merge-mined.
@_date: 2016-05-19 04:53:05


Yes, I agree. In practice though, I'm not worried. Bitcoin is plenty secure and things like the LN and sidechains will shift the demand curve enough to raise fees.

@_date: 2016-05-22 23:18:27
Both your points are very superficial.
1. *Of course* miners can choose what blocksize to use. The problem is that these incentives leads to *more* centralization of miners because propagation time scales with size. In other words, a larger parameter space means a larger attack surface (and there are many other attacks).
2. The world isn't static. As you increase the blocksize, fees will *fall*. You need to know the exact form of the demand curve to know what blocksize maximizes miner revenue and network security. You can't just multiply by the block size increase factor.
It's really unbelievable to me how redditors with no specific expertise feel confident enough to dismiss the *hundreds* of pages of arguments, discussion, and essays by the *actual* experts who have maintained bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-05-17 03:59:17


My economics are correct. You are forgetting that the difficulty of mining adjusts. Rethink your analysis with this in mind.


Mining costs fall to the level that ensures an average rate of 6 per hour. If miners can't cover mining costs (fees rise in the short term), and the difficulty adjusts. In the end, miners will include transactions at any cost &gt; than the marginal cost of including a tx in a block, which is a technological cost and is very minor.

I don't see why that's obviously true. People do a lot of things for fun that I dislike; doesn't mean that they are bad.
But more to your point, offering people a *cheaper* way to gamble will have two (conflicting) effects:
1. Lower the cost of gambling, which is good for gamblers and people who care about welfare.
2. Increase the amount of gambling, which is bad (in your opinion).
You or I do not know if the total revenue of the industry will be higher or lower, because nobody knows which effect is stronger.

@_date: 2016-05-18 04:12:02
Yes, though it's related to your original discussion. I think you made a mistake in your reasoning, which is why I challenged you on the economics.


I disagree with the causation here. The subsidy doesn't reduce fees--all it does is change the equilibrium difficulty. The author of that thread, by arguing that with an infinite blocksize the equilibrium transaction fees will be very low (and the difficulty will continually fall), implies that the subsidy does *not* subsidize fees--it subsidizes network security by raising the difficulty. Transaction fees are *independent* of this. Just imagine that you're a miner: you will include any transaction as long as it has enough fee to compensate you for increased orphan risk and the few cpu cycles it takes to do ECDSA (of course, in practice verifying the signature needs to be done only once for each mining pool). The costly part of mining is hashing the block header a trillion times.


Yes, this was your original point. It depends upon the previous quote of yours.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:01:19

Then why does he want to remain anonymous?


Satoshi isn't *just* a millionaire. If bitcoin takes off, he will be the richest man on Earth with hundreds of billions of dollars in untraceable digital cash. He may have a family whom he wants to protect. Rather than hiring a dozen full-time bodyguards for them and never being able to travel outside of a motorcade, it's just easier to remain anonymous. As far as the richest handful of bitcoiners go, only Roger Ver has chosen to be public. He has been threatened before and there's no reason to think that this will not escalate.
Finally, it's *still* not clear that bitcoin is even *legal* wherever Satoshi lives (let alone in the future if bitcoin angers too many governments).
I think you're *very* wrong about the risks the real Satoshi faces if he reveals himself definitively.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:05:41
Lol. Whose rule is that?
@_date: 2016-05-13 01:31:49


That's not at issue. PoW happened once--after which, coins can be spent any number of times. The closest you'll get is that you have to pay *fees* when you transact, which is money, which represents fungible "work".
If that's what he meant, it implies that the tx fees are too low at equilibrium, which is absolutely possible. It doesn't mean that bitcoin failed, nor that spam can't exist.

If tumbling occurred on-chain, it wouldn't obscure the history of the coins.
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:59:39
Except for sidechains...
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:16:07
So $60 trillion sovereign debt, $80 trillion in broad money, and $7 trillion in gold. That's $147 trillion of value in wealth-storage/money usage. 
Dividing by 21,000,000 yields $7,000,000/btc.
If people "invest" in government bonds, in the safest case, they're getting &lt;2.5% nominal returns (but less real returns because of inflation).
If bitcoin is at its equilibrium price, it will grow in price by &gt;2.5% per year, because its supply is fixed and GDP grows at around 3% per year. Bitcoin also can't be confiscated.
So holding bitcoin is inarguably preferable to bonds, gold, and fiat money. And there's $147 trillion worth of hodling demand for those...
@_date: 2016-05-18 00:04:04
That's not right. I don't know how to explain in the little time I have to reddit right now, but [here]( is a bitcointalk thread. I fully endorse the OP's logic re. the equilibrium transaction fee if there is no blocksize limit.
As an aside, I think both Gavin and Mike make many mistakes in their thinking through the economics.
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:09:10
Then even more will be spent on GPUs. There's no getting around this.

That comes pretty close to saying that you want the government to take money from Voorhees, Ver, and their customers in order to buy things for you.
Government already (separately) taxes property, income, capital gains, corporate profits, payroll, and many types of sales to spend on the things you list. How much is enough? Is it possible that there are better ways of funding schools and preventing crime?
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:47:38
The coins that originated in the genesis block cannot be spent already.
Those are the *only* coins that we know for sure that Satoshi "owns" and they are unspendable.


So offer to buy them from him.
@_date: 2016-05-16 18:44:09
I'd just say that bitcoin is anonymous but not *private*.
To:from links are publicly viewable by default. You need extra tools to make transactions private, like tumblers.
@_date: 2016-05-04 09:37:50
Good find. 


I skimmed the link in the OP. $5000 at $0.03 or $0.04 per bitcoin is ~100,000 coins. That seems plausible given Sergio's [estimate]( of Satoshi mining 980,000 bitcoins (of the first roughly 2,000,000).
But there's also that 1.1 million btc number in the .txt that Wright allegedly controlled. I recall that number from the December leaks as well. Then there are Kleiman's holdings which the .txt says were substantial.
Either we're double-counting coins, those three are the only people who mined substantially in 2009 through early 2010, Craig/Kleiman bought many coins privately, or 1.1 million btc is wrong.
Relatedly, does anyone have any thoughts about Craig's bitcointalk handle? I wouldn't be surprised if he were active there at some point, especially if he needed to buy coins.

Does Dr. Sanchez know that 51% is also a majority?
The democracy fetishists often talk as if the distribution of preferences is identical among the groups. But 75% of people might be only slightly in favor of a fork, and 25% strongly against. That 25% can still create a lot of contention, as we are seeing with ETC, and possibly win.

If you think sidechains will happen, there's no point to altcoins. They're all doomed.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:40:58


Depends what you mean by "back". Certainly, miners don't either. They just mine the coins that hodlers pay them for. They will mine whatever coins give them the largest profit.


No, don't misunderstand; mining was *supposed* to incentivize full nodes. Satoshi didn't anticipate that mining could/would be separated from the casual users who run nodes. Nodes in many different jurisdictions and operated cheaply by many different users are what ensure the fidelity of the network.

Can you give an example of something (useful) that we've learned so far from Ethereum?
@_date: 2016-05-12 23:53:35
C'mon dude, bitcoin doesn't use PoW to broadcast transactions, which your analogy requires.
Let's elevate the level of discussion here a bit.

Would have been better off with a lump sum.
@_date: 2016-05-13 01:28:13
Yes, *very* hard to measure. And the straightforward "gambling is entertainment" POV suggests that what you say will *reduce* welfare.
And again, even granting your perspective doesn't get you there: effect  might overpower effect  We gotta be modest.

As someone who considers the hardfork bad news, I'm also frustrated with the mods for exercising their pro-Ethereum biases by censoring that article.

Dumb rule, bitcoin is primarily a store of value. No blockchain is suited for casual on-chain transactions.

They've been leaving for Ethereum which explains the "we as a community..." addresses and cringey talk about democratization.
I've been following their exodus very closely. Good riddance. Bitcoin philosophy shouldn't get drowned out while ~~it's~~ Bitcoin's still young and relatively immature.
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:00:42


Which is what happened. The probability of a birthday on the halvening is 1/365. The probability of yet another birthday on the halvening is 1/365. Together, 1/365^2 .


Yeah, of course. Because there are many redditors.
I'm still not seeing where you disagree with me.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:29:31
Hate to be a fallacy namer, but this is a perfect example of the fallacy of composition.
If a single node find an invalid block, nothing happens except that they know that they can't trust the network. That is the point of bitcoin--to be able to check for yourself that no funny-business is going on.


No, not at all. Nodes are how you can be sure that the network is playing by the "correct" rules. They also communicate with each other, yes, which helps to make the network uncensorable.
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:14:50
Yes. Which was of course on full cartoonish display in as the community congratulated itself for violating the express terms of The DAO and the spirit of Ethereum because a majority of redditors demanded it.
@_date: 2016-07-01 14:27:30

Fair enough. But do we even have any reason to believe that software guys have learned anything generalizable from Ethereum? If you can point me to something that the Bitcoin devs, e.g., say they have learned about the Ethereum project, I'd be interested to know.


What does IBM have anything to do with bitcoin? I bet that you know more about bitcoin than this guy.
Hype, that's all it is. It's a violation of etiquette to call somebody else out on their bullshit when it has no effect on you. It also makes you look like somebody who doesn't see the *big picture*, even if it's nonsense.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:43:29


You can't have it both ways. The flipside of high fees discouraging use of bitcoin is that lower fees will *encourage* use. Blocks will absolutely rise to 2 MB, or very near.
The marginal cost to miners of including a new tx is very low. Possibly something like 0.1 cents per kb. If so, bitcoin will be "practically free" again and blocks will fill up once more, encouraging yet more whining from big-blockers.

That's your word. The HF is bad because it opens up new attack vectors, increases centralization, is not necessary at this point, Segwit is already in the works and is much safer. The HF is thus not in consensus.

Hm? That hinders fiat's adoption.
The subsidy is FDIC. Without it, I don't see why fractional reserve + fiat would exist in today's form.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:18:03


This doesn't disprove anything. One dev controls Ethereum, ETC is another thing.


If vitalik had opposed, it wouldn't have been supported.


Lol, it's value has fallen compared to Ethereum since Ethereum was launched?
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:21:07
Another security implication of that:
Allowing *new* behavior like not wearing a tie must be tested *much* more thoroughly. Will suited customers now get mistaken for employees and rob the company? Will the relaxed dress code hurt the company's performance?
On the other hand, before the fork anyone could have worn a red tie, so there's less need to test. The potential attack vectors are smaller than before.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:01:26
Smart contracts are very cool. But to build it natively into your money!? Any anonymous person can 51% attack the chain by trustlessly paying for hashpower with coins he hasn't yet stolen. In bitcoin, this won't happen because the attacker has no way of proving that he will pay off the miners.
There are infinitely many variations on attacks like this. And even worse ones by shorting the coin if you have oracles (which I believe Vitalik has been writing about). Yeesh.
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:35:56


But their indebtedness isn't increased..


I'm not sure how that causes ever increasing prices. It just multiplies the amount of money by some factor, but that factor doesn't necessarily grow. As long as that's roughly stable, I don't see a major problem.
The problem caused by *instability* is real though, so I agree about that.
But why call this "debt based"? All economies have lending. I don't see that as the problem, rather a weird fiat + fractional reserve system which doesn't make any sense to me economically. I think it only exists because it's subsidized.
Typo edited.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:48:09

Chance to get a block doesn't matter. Think in terms of $$ earned per hour.
It really all depends on the expected exchange rate of the coins on either chain.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:53:59


Huh? That's the point of the sidechain.
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:48:11
Coins compete for wealth storage. There is no room for more than one absent government fiat.
Protocols, on the other hand, can have different strengths. But these can all be taken advantage of when pegged to bitcoin via sidechain.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:28:38


Of course. But if the multiple happens only once, you don't get ever-increasing inflation (unless they print more).


Yes, but as do price levels, and income, and so on. So only nominal value of debt increases.
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:41:05


So is buying with a lump sum.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:37:45


The only reason they aren't is because sometimes blocks are found very quickly before txs have accumulated. But we all saw how easy it was to fill blocks during those "stress tests".


Demand wasn't enough and bitcoin's price wasn't doing anything interesting.
But listen, I'll grant for the sake of argument that there is less than 1 MB of "demand" for all fee levels. Now can stop complaining that bitcoin is "pricing out" those poor unbanked Africans who yearn for monetary sovereignty.
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:49:02
