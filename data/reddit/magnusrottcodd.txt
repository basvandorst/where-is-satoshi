The one who claimed:  "Bitcoin's low volatility may force big move" was correct! =)
But the direction of the move..

Dunno about "happy" but at least it isn't a boring stablecoin anymore. 
But I do have some complains about the direction it chosed to take.

So worst case scenario is a -94% drop.
That translates to low of 1,194$ from the current high of 19,900$
Ok, so if it crashes below that then maybe it is time so say: "It's dead Jim"

Well, the first time 4500 was mentioned was at the first big Bitcoin FUD regarding Tether. "Without it Bitcoin will lose 80% of its value."
Many obviously thinks that 6500 is the bottom, seeing how there are rallies everytime the value approaches that, but I think that will not hold and the next stop is 4500.

Bitcoin value is pure psychology, what we feels like is the "right" value. So if enough people will think that it is cheap at a certain value, then we will have a turning point.

What is true then? Can you say why Bitcoin shall be worth 7000 now when it was valued something like 1000 dollar last year and almost 20 000 in december?
The closest thing seems to be is a connection between interest based on web activity and its value.

Nah, I think we will have to hit rock bottom before we are going to see a sustained rally. 
I posted a month ago that I thought the bottom is at 4500, and still think that is the case.

Yes, that is from when PUBG was at it most buggy state and lag was turned up to eleven - thus allowing players from the past and the future to play in our time.
