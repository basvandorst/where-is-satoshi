Whats the rule on capital gains tax is you stumble across some coins you forgot you had and have been holding for years? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:25:54
Yes, what i meant is, here capital gains tax is around 15% on holdings of over 1 year, under that you can be taxed up to 45%. Id imagine the new found bitcoin would fall under the 15% bracket

So in theory, what would stop someone from just claiming the 50x gains for examples they made trading altcoins, was actually just some bitcoin they found from years ago they forgot they had. Thats a 30% tax bonus

That is far from mass adoption. I agree Bitcoin serves this purpose brilliantly, but mass adoption among western civilisation? We are far from achieving that goal.

We need bitcoin to be in some sort of circulation so that its current price is irrelevant to buyers.
I say this in the sense that people purchase bitcoin to buy things with it, perhaps on an instantaneous basis, thus meaning whatever the price is, it will have buyers, as it will be used in the real world. Then and only then will its price not be speculation based.

I should rephrase the speculation bubble part, bitcoin is very valuable in its current state, although current price is a reflection of what it will be, not what it is.
If bitcoin were to solve its scalability, then its current speculative price is nothing in comparison to what it should be.
Thank you for the well articulated response!

So this means that when you purchase bitcoin on coinbase, they are simply giving you access to their stores of bitcoin (already on their site) and allowing you to then move the amount bought from their address to others? I.e my ledger wallet?

So in order to have an instant service of moving bitcoin from one person to another, you would first need an absolutely humungous stash of reserves first.

How do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:15:10
Well then your comments do not relate to my post, as i evidently brought up the issue of mass adoption in the west, through a means of being used as a currency.

Community is already spread, hence why the fork occurs

How can i use it to be faster? And is it general consensus that x2 should not be activated? 
I sent bitcoin from poloniex to bittrex. 1 month it had taken

Incredible response, exactly what I was after. Thank you for going through the trouble of giving such an in depth answer.
