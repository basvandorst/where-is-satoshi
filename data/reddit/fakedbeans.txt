Can anyone explain how the market cap increases, whilst all of the direct to fiat currencies are either stationary or declining? Surely the market cap can only increase as new money is brought in, via the purchase of cryptos which have fiat pairings?

any thoughts on the likes of Bitcoin Diamond? Will that ever have value?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:31:22
dont seem like much of an enthusiast ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:27:35
are we thinking that CMC will be reintegrating Korean exchange volumes soon?
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:42:25
but thats just it. New money coming in stipulates the purchase of bitcoin, ethereum or some other fiat/crypto pair--- which are all declining right now, but in some moments the market cap increases- where is that new money entering the market ?

any thoughts on how far the china electricity to bitcoin miners news will effect price in the days to come ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:08:21
this current one is the worst on record... not to be taken lightly 
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:04:00
 this would cool the FUD if more people saw it 
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:18:31
depends on your standing with the technology; A couple of years ago this price seemed absurd, as we now think $200 dollars would be absurd. In a years time the price is as likely to be 10x higher as it is 10x lower. There is no right or wrong time to buy in that you yourself do not decide

thoughts on how these prices/ market value is being maintained with such low 24h volume?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:39:10
till what ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:19:27
anyone wanna estimate actual total market volume, including those values from korea which for now are omitted from CMC ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:09:22
silly question, but how can it be falling this hard when the volume  is much higher than it was when it first reached these prices?

In order to get a feel of the way these markets work, It might be useful to buy a small amount of bitcoin or ethereum for the purpose of buying other smaller, cheaper and more volatile currencies. This way you can experience a bit more, and have a comparatively higher stake in those markets. ( $200 in a coin with MC &gt; $200 bil doesnt give much room for learning, but $200 in a coin with MC of a couple million might) --- equally, you can limit your financial exposure risk whilst offering maximum gains for reinvestment. It is not entirely un-common for someone to start with a few hundred in some altcoins with good fundamentals, making enough profit to come back and buy a larger amount of bitcoin. I started out with ethereum , and then forayed into ICOs, though 1 year ago that market was a little less toxic.  Basically, take a few bucks and put it somewhere with the assumption that you are going to lose it, and whatever profits you make are a happy surprise-- Go with the idea that you are investing $X at first to buy yourself an education about something that may become a viable income stream for yourself in the future.

you mean price will not hold, or that volume will not remain ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:49:52
anyone know any exchanges which offer trading competitions like binance? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:49:11
why the sudden turn ? At first its fundamentals seemed superior to all of these other stupid forks which have gone by now ? what changed?
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:24:21
 will this not still at least take the position from what is currently the Segwit2x futures ?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:49:25
block time doesnt seem on track to make that though
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:16:41
well done , so thats that fork done then, when do you think we will hear word from this scam ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:28:14
bitcoin gold transfer times anyone ?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:58:51
does anyone want to predict what time the fork will take place tomorrow ?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:13:16
so thats the segwit2x snapshot done then ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:31
lets not forget about the guy who paid 10,000 bitcoin for 2 pizzas back in the day
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:23:51
do people have any thoughts about a possible retraction at $10,000 ? seems like the kind of round number people could have put future sell orders in for . Thoughts ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:09
or they wake up, find the price very low and we get a resurgence buy ... ? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:20
here we go....
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:25:31
exactly. To say that tripling in a month is unsustainable, when doing that in a whole year is considered unreliable growth, is just funny 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:02:53
in most regards, tripling in a year is unsustainable
