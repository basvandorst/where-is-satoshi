70 years isn't centuries. Of the 317 years of its existence, the pound spent 247 years leeching off of the resources and labor of the people of India. The main reason the pound is strong today is because Britain literally built its economy using the wealth it drained India of for more than 200 years. 
We're talking trillions of dollars at today's valuation. 
India was to Britain then what 'manufacturing' is to China today. The greatest source of income. 
Plus, it wasn't just the wealth. More than 35 MILLION people lost their lives due to the colonization. Read that one more time. 35 million innocent people killed by colonization. 
Winston Churchill alone starved an estimated 3 million people by deliberately withholding food supplies to Bengal despite knowing full well the cost of his actions. Read up on the 'Bengal Famine'. It's usually referred to as a 'man-made famine'. Churchill caused it. Singlehandedly.
All the while, Britain kept getting richer and richer off of the Indian plunder. 
So today when some deliberately ignorant people sing the glories of Britain, consciously choosing to forget about what those glories were built on, their hypocrisy and misplaced sense of pride needs to be called out. 
I'm not saying British people of today are responsible, in any way, for what happened with India. Many Brits, in fact, acknowledge the evil that was the British empire and are deeply ashamed of their country's colonial past. But then there's this other group, much like the Confederacy fans in America today, who does the exact opposite. And that ain't right.

The currency with the bloodiest past of any currency.. Earned most of its 'success' and longevity through the massacre upon massacre of millions of innocent people. 
317 - 70 = 247 years ~ Period for which Britain colonized, plundered and laid waste to the Indian subcontinent.
