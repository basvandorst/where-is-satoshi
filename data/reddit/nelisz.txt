Can I bet hem, say, 100 bitcoin? Seems like a good deal to me!
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:00:00
I'll be crying about how dumb I was not to buy more
But I'll be laughing at the millions my coins will be worth by then
@_date: 2014-05-07 08:28:10
Yes, I have. It very well is a possibility, especially with all the secrecy around the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto (is it even just one person?). But it is a risk I'm willing to take, but also a reason to not invest to much in bitcoin.
Only time can tell whether bitcoin is the best thing that ever happened to the world, or just an elaborate scheme to make hundreds of millions.

I think this can really smoothen the penetration of bitcoin in (online) sales :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:41:48
Great development! Step by step bitcoin is gaining track

Bitcoin is a global currency and will affect all currencies in the same way it does the US dollar. When dollars will loose demand and utility due to bitcoin, so will all other important currencies like the euro, yen and British pounds. In this case, you better own some bitcoin!

Perhaps the best explanation of Bitcoin's current state:


@_date: 2014-05-07 08:13:35
Obviously, as an 'online payment pioneer' this guy stands to loose a lot if bitcoin grows big as it will be a direct competitor for his business. But still he makes a valid point, especially wit respect to the unknowns about Satoshi and his wealth in bitcoin.

Thanks a lot man, that was my first tip ever!
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:48:24
Perhaps the other way around would also be a good development for the community
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:13:35
Depends on the size of the asshole!

Perhaps they can add a 'boatride' to Changetip. Although I doubt somebody would ever tip that.

Tl;dr: here's the conclusion:

No, I did not know. Thanks for the heads up!

I would assume you can pay with bitcoin on a bitcoin conference

I'm waiting for the day that this comic has something to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:37:40
That's a good way to spend some bitcoin

Calm before the storm?
@_date: 2014-05-07 10:01:05
Cue next drop in price before people remember that it is not that important news and prices will go back up again.
Perhaps a good moment to buy?
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:47:06
How about this for a start: 100 bits @_date: 2014-05-07 09:48:02
Wishful thinking to the max!
Probably making something out of nothing, although I also hope it'll go up

Weird, when I opened it, it didn't have a pay-wall. Clicking the link indeed showed a pay wall. My apologies and thanks for the link!

There are some weaker points in the list (i.e. "It can be extremely hard to steal" -&gt; wallets get 'hacked' daily) but still a good list of what bitcoin can do
@_date: 2016-01-18 11:10:45
For instance for the Dutch users: 
I can buy bitcoin and pay with my debit card in minutes for a 1-2% premium. No id or other hoops to jump through!
