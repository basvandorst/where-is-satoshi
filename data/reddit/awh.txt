I'll send you a letter from Japan for $1.50!

It’s actually been a whole lot of prices today.

Of course it's not up to him; it's up to the bankruptcy trustee.

Haha, it's Cerulean Tower 15th Floor which basically is a business centre where you receive mail and can rent a boardroom for meetings.  They're not there at all.

Same here.  Apparently we're getting ATMs in a couple months.

By buying coins you are providing incentive for someone else to invest in mining equipment.
I'm living in a country with extremely high retail electricity rates.  It wouldn't make sense for me to invest in mining equipment when I could just buy coins so that some professional miner in a place with cheap electricity and who has the benefit of volume can invest in mining equipment instead.

I haven't read the rest of the article yet, but anybody who's mocking someone for posting about earthquake safety in April 2011 obviously was not here and did not see the effect that the earthquake had on the psyche of Japanese residents.

I have 0.06 BTC; I should do this as it's an amount that I don't care about losing.

The Japanese authorities have already taken an interest in this.  You can't leave Japan (either as a Japanese or as a foreigner) without having your passport scanned by Immigration officials, so I'm pretty sure that if he tried to leave, he'd be detained.

Pretty sure that the call centre is set up by the Japanese bankruptcy trustee; their main purpose will be to communicate with the Japanese public that have been affected.
If a company went bankrupt in your country, would you expect that a Japanese customer would be able to call up and speak with a Japanese-speaking call centre employee?

 Just this thread.  I admit that it's not a very strong source.

When Bitcoin hit $7 I said that was idiotic and spent all 6 of mine on a VPN service and some tips/donations.  Then Bitcoin hit $300 and I said that was idiotic and didn't buy in.  Now it's $6500 and I figure I can get in for a couple hundred just in case.

I have a mining contract on hashflare -- is it a scam?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:40:45
Well it's 733,141 in my country's currency, so there!

Why wouldn't he have just bought a call option instead?

Mine works the same as yours, but you send me even more bitcoin, so it's more efficient for people who dislike owning bitcoin.

These days you'll need an ASIC rig as CPU and GPU aren't really up for the task anymore.

It won't be priced in BTC; it'll be priced in some fiat currency and they will accept payment in BTC.
It doesn't count as "priced in BTC" until the price stops moving with every minor fluctuation in BTCUSD.

Apparently "people with a sense of humour" and "you" are also different things.

I think eventually it'll be both, but it's pretty hard to call it a currency when the vast majority of real-world bitcoin transactions are priced in fiat currency and accept bitcoin payment as an alternate.
That is to say, when a car costs 5 bitcoins or 30k USD today, and tomorrow costs 5 bitcoins or 28k USD *then* we might call bitcoin a currency.

Better than investing in Bitcoin these days.

Arbitrage has nothing to do with poor timing.  What do you think arbitrage means?

If only there was some sort of custom where you could perform services for local business for a certain number of hours per week in exchange for money.
