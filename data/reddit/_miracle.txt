You mean to say that bitcoin is not as good as the U.S. dollar for money laundering? LOL I say.

for now: peg it to the currency in your country and create clauses in your contracts that will address things such as intended or unintended delays in payments. Good luck on your ventures

I've been an Overstock fan for years and Byrne is what a CEO should be; a leader. Sign up for club O :-) you will get discounts and free shipping.
Overstock is different than Amazon with Prime (I'm a bit of a Prime addict but we'll see how I feel when the price jumps to $99. and they continue to resist bitcoin).
Overstock's items are sales of close outs or deals on items that were overstocked so the selection is not comparable to Amazon...but if I can get at O, I do :-) and I've a good 15k wish list on O

Overstock, gyft, Dish, bitify, open bazar, provident metals (which gives a discount when buying with bitcoin)

Would love to see Wikipedia accepting bitcoin.
You can spend BTC very easily at Overstock.com: choose your items and choose the pay by bitcoin button, a pop up will tell you the address and amount to send (I usually cut and paste both directly into my wallet to be sure) Overstock uses coinbase so it will be a perfect opportunity to shop and "check user experience" ;-)
Gyft.com has much the same process and a variety of gift  card options (including Amazon.com)
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:15:19
I think this is Overstock's response to their own cancelation: The buyer placed an order that could not be fulfilled so Overstock gives options. I've been an O customer for years and used to own stock (and will again eventually) because they are friggen fabulous ;-) .
They are not likely to let people "game them" by using orders/cancelations as a hedge against dollars or bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:03:59
spend and buy :-)

Andreas on The Daily Show!
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:31:48
I'll do my best to check your Reddit and/or Twitter after such interviews . "News" these days? That's why I stick to Colbert &amp; the Daily Show *tongue in cheek but SERIOUSLY! News outlets get too much wrong and when it comes to bitcoin... TOO much. I read the boards and watch the news...sometimes there's more truth in forums.
Wishing you luck and appreciating that we have you to speak up.

Planck should be the last (smallest denomination)It is an incredibly small measurement. I like this. Tesla has his face on a hyperinflationary dollar: I've been thinking about buying one just because I like Tesla and being reminded of inflation (a duel purpose collectable).

That's a really good idea...especially for an energy company ;-) It would be splendid not to convert my btc/xbt into fiat to pay for my little machine's energy use.

Dear Mark Karpeles,
please actually put some information on your page and keep it updated.
I hope you are all there doing your best to do the right thing.
Sincerely, Miracle

Paypal and ebay are under the same company. Gyft offers 3% in points if you use bitcoin to purchase gift card.
You can shop Amazon ect. that way but yes I'd like to see more Amazon's accepting directly. Always liked Tiger.

Thank you for your reply. (I'll keep your email handy).
Looking at my Coinbase balances: it pretty much evens out, no real loss or gain. It's for personal use, small amounts. I am annoyed that they are asking for blanket access but not surprised or concerned about what they may find in my account.
Should you report if there is no loss/gain? Seems a bit tedious; like accounting for every dollar that goes in and out of my wallet ;-)
@_date: 2016-11-21 01:03:05
What if you didn't report because you never realized a gain?
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:03:56
I wish you much success ....following
