Thanks for the answer! I'm just starting to learn about bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:06:20
Why would it go down? Amount of miners increasing or bitcoin value lowering?
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:54:48
Yes, it's tied to a specific phone. This is part of the appeal for the security measure - only the person with that phone can access the account. 
There is no paper backup because the code is constantly changing (it's on a 30 sec timer or something like that)

A lap burning the same amount of food energy that 0.42$ can buy.

With what's happening in Europe, I'd say the price is guaranteed to go up for now at least.

There are many posts pointing out its utilities and potential. They don't have to be enumerated in every post - go find them yourself.

I used all the money I made off Bitcoin to buy glasses so I could see the price of Bitcoin.

How exactly is an account (wallet address?) created? From my understanding one needs 200XRP to send to meet an account reserve in order for that account to be created.... How do you receive and send XRP without an account? Confusing. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:10:52
Thanks. I'll try the former if I really need to. Already did fill out the form though.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:49:22
I don't know exactly, as I don't trade. Forex, NYSE?
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:27:10
When it's back at 45.

This graph is so off in proportion from the actual market. We dipped 50% and are rising again. Also, we only dropped to a price level we were at a few days ago. The graph presented is much longer term if one is measuring the first half correctly - not to mention it's so generalized in OP's appliance that it would basically be overlaid on anything that fluctuates. (inb4 that's denial) 
But seriously, this was caused by an outside force - the panic was not caused by lack of faith in solely Bitcoin, but lack of faith in the exchange which then translated to panic about the currency itself for those that didn't understand better. If there was a  glitch (any sort of mix up/ddos whatever's possible) with the actually stock exchange, does that make Google worth less as a company? Apple? No. They might drop. There might be panic. But it doesn't change the mentality of what the asset is worth. Bitcoin hasn't changed - and in fact, the value is rising because the implementation of it is growing, not decreasing.

It's hard to believe .05 is that much now. Can't believe I was throwing .01s and .05s at SatoshiDice like it was nothing haha
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:32:05


@_date: 2013-04-10 20:24:21
I meant like stock/fiat exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:51:02
How can you get convicted of buying and selling stocks? (Srs)
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:28:51
You are making me so confused haha. People are acting like its real... But the transactions aren't being verified so it can't be @_@

He's still at like 60k right now.... He bought at 60 something.

95%. But I'm 18 so I don't have much else to do with my money.
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:26:28
dchoe offered a solution. You can only set up your Google accounts after reset, but other applications seem to be inaccessible unless they provide an alternative method to text you the code.
@_date: 2013-01-18 01:11:46
I know ):
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:08:35
If $5M worth of coins are put up to be sold at X dollars, then there's a buy wall because people have to collectively buy $5M worth of BTC at X dollars before the price can go past X.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:59:01
Bitcoin is now worthless because of exchange incompetency?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:56:56
Does this happen to other online exchanges?
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:35:58
Your incompetence as a company is staggering. It was quite obvious the amount of requests for new accounts and recent publicity were going to drastically increase trading. Over compensate for these changes, don't wait for mistakes to happen and then say, "Sorry guys, we're gonna try to fix this problem that collectively already cost people millions."
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:56
If it really gets that low, then there will be no comeback.

The only other banks I've seen in my area beside those that operate in a foreign language. There definitely aren't 1000s of banks at the average consumers disposal. I would estimate 10 at most.
Ps: If you lose the sarcastic douche attitude and false sense of superiority, you won't be downvoted as much. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:55:11
I'll update if I manage to get through.
@_date: 2013-07-02 22:53:15
Surprised you found this. I had to transfer the .json file to a new account actually. The file is the one they email you when you start the account. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:57:48
Quality fans.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:53:31
Etc, repeat.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:13:28
They don't care about manipulation because it makes them money is what I'm saying. Are you saying they make so much money they have no need to care about customer satisfaction? Either way its greed on there part.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:45:28
It explains why they don't care about the manipulation though.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:23
But this has happened before, so we've been in the denial stage like what? Three times? 
@_date: 2013-02-08 22:44:33
Your bitcoin wallet is full and you don't have room for the extra coins.

Thanks, I thought it was a unique QR code per activation. I'll be sure to do this in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:36:18


Same exact thing here! But I just moved the wallet and everything was fine - I actually lost my 2-factor with no QR code to reset. Try moving the wallet, it's very simple.
Also, you're right to not use the phone app. Android isn't especially secure  and it seemed to always leave me logged in. 
Blockchain is kind of local because you have the .dat file stored in your email (or wherever you chose). Is actual local hosting different?

That forum is cancer. "It went up a dollar. BUBBLE! It went down a dollar. CRASH!"

Let me guess... you bought BFL and are exaggerating flaws in the Avalon product to justify your mistake?
