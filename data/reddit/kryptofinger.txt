whats gonna happen to all the exchanges that have large holding of usdt if tether/bitfinex fail how is an exchange like binance gonna handle 500+ million in usdt going to zero?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:23:43
seriously as much as i hate bitfinex arent they based out of hong kong what authority do they have over there?
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:47:10
Bitcoin would go up capital flight will seek any safe haven asset pm's and crypto would win

Based on the recent news with the lightning network do you guys think it will be fully operational within 6 months and if it gets adopted what percent of the altcoins will most likely die off/ which ones?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:06:06
What are the chances of the us government shutting bitfinex down for counterfeiting USD? I feel like that is a serious case for cracking down on tether/bifinex? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:12:03
Why is the market going down there doesn't seem to any bad news going on that ive heard about???
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:51:20
We all knew at some point a crash was going to happen just like when the dotcom bubble burst as well but out of that shit show arose Google, yahoo, Amazon, ebay ect. This time will be no different guys from these ashes by the end of the year we will still have btc, ltc, eth, neo, ada, eos, icx, xmr, and a hand full of other that will be at new ATH by end of year
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:06:05
Does anyone else find the timing of bloomberg putting out a fud article thats 2 months old at this time now? Like right when the regular stock market is taking a hit? This all seems very suspicions because they intentionally left out the date of that fud article. Like seriously if it wasnt for that bs from them btc would be above 12k already. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:35:47
Does anyone have a rough estimate as to when this will be fully released for bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-11-29 01:19:27
It doesnt matter in end the smart money will buy up any major correction that happens in bitcoin just like every other time its happened. Worst case scenario would a bear market like back in 2014-2015, but just remember "What is dead may never die...but rises again harder and stronger"

@_date: 2018-03-10 19:22:08

@_date: 2018-03-10 21:36:21
i made the mistake of shorting at 8.3k totally forgot about the support line and it had a quick rebound cut my lose early now i think we failed the 9.5k test and we are headed down if you look at 4 hr chart it becomes obvious 9.3/9.5k weak as hell followed by giant ass red dildos
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:19:29
buy high sell low..when shorting lol
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:05:11

lmao pretty much what i have been doing for the past 2 months and iv just been getting burned losing more and more money as the whole market keeps on heading down i've had some good trades at least but then suddenly out of no where the world is ending with hacks and mt gox coming back from the grave to kill us all and i lose all my gainz again out of nowhere in a day that took me weeks of work to achieve  
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:56:11
have you tried out bitmex? you can go long or short btc and few other alts up to 100x leverage! I've been trying it out learning the ropes if you think you can time a quick pump or dump its easy gainz
@_date: 2018-03-10 07:44:10

@_date: 2018-03-09 19:59:08

@_date: 2018-03-12 20:58:51
the 4hr chart is looking bullish imo we tested the 8.3/8.4 lows and be survived both of them and almost made it to 10k and now we have another higher low set at 8780 if we keep this trend going i think we will hit 10.5 again by friday
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:47:51

Anyone else expecting a mad rush to the exits on binance once the withdrawals open up? Lol whats another 5 billion in total market cap loss?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:43:12
I hate shorting this market because i love btc but finally when i think we are making a turn up i go to sleep and i could have sold the top and bought the bottom again but of course at 5am which i have noticed is seems to be the critical historical hour of dumping or pumping it fucking dumped now im stuck with my long position again should have waited and just shorted instead... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:16:33
its not gonna hold brother...
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:34:25
im in agreement but i admit i fucked up my last trade the rsi was screaming at me no to buy but the price seemed to be going up/steady now i suffer until btc comes back
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:01:31
Question if i were to get audited and they see several bank transfers over the years to unknown back accounts across the globe how would i explain this?? im assuming this is a bank to bank transfer correct? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:05:24

And right now, I believe, that in this subreddit, we have the seed, that’s gonna germinate, and that is going to EXPLODE, into an AMMMAZING opportunity for us to change this entire world!
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:07:22

@_date: 2018-03-10 22:10:49

lmao oh i cancelled that out hours ago short now
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:54:10
if tether crashes were all gonna go down with it lol it would create a full on panic and race for the exits
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:45:55
Yeah if you guys could go ahead and buy that dip it would really help my long position lol
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:46:58
lol the capitulation in this market is insane we are finally climbing back to 10k and everyone just starts dumping 
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:15:02
Sooo wheres my cut lol?? i want free monies!!
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:59:18
 theres a hearing on blockchain in half an hour
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:03:28
its ok jesus coin is here for you......
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:28:44
doubt it withdrawals are still suspended a lot of people got burned hard this morning and are probably in tether looking to leave
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:37:19
when you realize all your positions are completely fucked...
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:13:59
if we don't close the day above 9.3k....than we are screwed 
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:12:40
lol idk i guess learn a new skill, or starve to death?
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:39:18
Most of those newer cryptos haven't proven that they are secure enough or well tested enough to truly be considered the next bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:12:48
i shorted it today on bitmex made 100% using leverage i don't think btc is that hard to short when its in a bear market last year would have been insane but the trend is down so its a lot easier now, me personally if we capitulate at 8k im going short at least 10x because i think us cross into 7k again is our Rubicon event for the bear market lol. And maybe go long again if we go to retest 6k
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:35:12
its no different then buying a crypto and selling it later when its gained value at its current market price 
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:03:25
Well at least me made it one day without crashing...off to a good start again!
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:09:24
the market hasn't really grown its just people dumping there alts back into btc
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:23:49
90% of people in crypto are speculating and everyone is looking at the same charts i think TA in crypto is WAAAY EASIER than anything iv ever seen in traditional markets.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:05:26
wtf is paccoin??
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:36:35
Thats why we have to get on there level...

Fear of losing everything...
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:11:52
Oh, you think Hodling is your ally?? But you merely adopted the Hodl! 
I was fomoed in it, a Whale by it. I didn't see the 20k until
I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but DUMPING!  
The Markets betray you!!!.....because they belong to me!
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:21:36
TA actually works better in crypto compared to traditional markets, outside of the wildcards with news in crypto everything is speculation and everyone is looking at the same charts and the majority of people come to same conclusions based on what everyone is seeing. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:25:04
lol when it didn't breakout at 9740
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:49:41
imo were going up the 4hr chart is showing we are we may actually be on the way up again higher highs and higher lows is the trend that seems to forming finally 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:10:53
That works great in a well informed and educated society not in world where people believe everything they fucking see on facebook and CNN is accurate or fact, which is also why i hate democracy cuz all its takes is for the people to get so lazy they just start voting anyone promises all the easy and free shit without realizing some else has to pay for it. And that leads to the other huge problem where those in power stay there practically for life because theres no term limits in state governments. You may be a fan of democracy but when you find yourself in the minority like our movement currently is we wont have the power to stand up to them to influence economic policy. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:53:03
technically yes 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:20:37

Does anyone know how profitable it would be to buy up a bunch of gpus and sell them a few months later thoughts??
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:46:28
9.5k....she will be missed 
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:18:22
TA literally comes down to expecting what other people are gonna do based on looking at the same thing. Support here at this number i think people are going to buy, if we break this line here i think people are gonna sell 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:33:14
we have been broken 
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:32:41
lol yeah god help me jesus coin save me!!
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:20:38
most of those alts are still over valued!! Half the coins in the top 50 have no purpose or use case or even a working product or blockchain lol 
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:01:18
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:50:03
Lol we need another Asian country to fomo again 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:15:08
lol kinda financially i can ride out the bear market and my job skills are limited to markets not in my area but really btc is worrying me we need some fomo like news otherwise btc is gonna keep slowly dying..  
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:26:04
lol dude im very much expecting Asia to dump on us in a couple of hours 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:56:34
4k would be an 80% drop from the ath of 20k and honestly i can't see btc going lower than 2k 90% i think 4-5k is the best place to reenter maybe 5-6k but its just too early in the bear market imo to be touching crypto
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:51:34
id rather hold Jesus than btrash at least Jesus Coin makes me laugh
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:14:49
on sunday?? lol no way!!
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:11:02
the book was written by a gay person lol
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:48:50
im just going off the 99 dma on the 4hr charts im assuming that whale people are thinking the same thing for buying back in at least for a quick trade just like yesterday the bounce was at the 99 dma at about 10.3k on the 2 hour charts just my thoughts. Since no one seems to care about all the good news going on with btc and theres no real fud other than the price the only way i see people making buying decisions right now is based off lines they see on charts and everyone is looking at the same thing lol 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:20:33
I think your right man im worried that the senate hearing isn't going to be enough to save us right now, all there probably gonna say is we like blockchain, and were gonna regulate icos, i dont even think there gonna mention bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:55:42
lol i just woke up not good after buying at 11.6 wtf happened??
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:55:18
No but im smart enough to learn from those past mistakes to not to dismiss btc after big crashes like this but im trying to do my best to buy at the right time and not fall for these bull traps
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:33:15
Ultimately what i think the community really needs to do to is work together to get our people or those who are at least sympathetic to our cause into key positions of influence and power in the government could you imagine how much progress we could make if we had a libertarian in the department of education, or in key positions for the department of the treasury? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:14:49
lmao if the government keeps doing what there doing million dollars will seem worthless 50 years from now like a penny is today!
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:34:16
what are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:57:17
I agree i think the coin counting system for btc needs a re-brand people don't like the idea of own .005 btc when they can buy 100 whole shitcoins this whole problem comes down to marketing and the idea sounds better to the average joe to own 100 whole units vs .005 units and its currently a huge problem with people learning about crypto because don't realize btc is divisible and again want to own whole units not .00 whatever  
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:01:02
lol this is crypto shill or be shilled...
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:14:37
lol life lesson never sleep without stops set 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:01:54
hopefully not but if this trend continues where theres a bounce every time we hit the 99 dma it could be a chance to make 5-8% each time until the bottom has been found 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:55:27
When hodlers hear the bear whales and panic sellers coming....
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:04:56
honestly other than the price everything is going great for btc segwit adoption is on the rise and lightning network is exceeding everyones expectations idk what more we can really hope for? Even some states in the usa are taking it as payment or at least being friendly tax wise.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:09:20
lol yeah im i have been testing out bitmex and playing with the leverage on the trades just made 100% on one trade so 1x in sats but the dollar value is dying so until btc decides to stop dying ill keep stacking sats 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:47:14
keep an eye out on elastos for merge mining with btc in q4 btc miners will get ELA for every btc that they mine fyi.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:54:50
Pretty much how everyone is feeling right now...
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:11:40

lmao is that blake from workaholics on trial?? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:23:20
Now this isn't to spread fud but more of a thought experiment say next week the economy goes to shit governments in there desperation and panic decide to rewrite the financial order each issuing there own cryptodollar all preexisting forms of money such as cash is obsolete and banned including the use of independent cryptos any business or person caught using such coins will be jailed under some new bs law about tax evasion or aml because there conducting trade outside the government sanctioned blockchain how is our movement going to be able to survive a such an event?? Now understand im a full supporter of satoshis vision and am trying to work my way into a gov position to help the cause but im also realist and massive financial/political changes in power are rarely peaceful 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:38:15
Hopefully we get to mid 10k this week then im bumping the leverage on my bitmex long position 100x!! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:15:11
Sovereignty is nothing with out an army to back it up. My biggest fear for this movement goes with the saying that "all armed Prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed Prophets have been destroyed."

your right the main cause of the last two months of hell was freaking mt gox dumping on the market 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:39:39
that only means the value compared to btc has increased but in usd everything is hurting
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:59:16
rebuilding my long positions the chart scared me a couple times when we tested the 8.3k area but i think so long as we close above 9.5k this weekend we are in the clear so long as another fud attack doesn't hit us
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:53:03
Anyone else getting ready to start looking for a job lol??

@_date: 2018-03-11 03:24:14
8.3k, 8k and 7.5k are all that's left if we lose 8k i wonder if its a straight shot down to 6k? Maybe a good shorting opportunity?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:44:05
they failed us
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:14:06
there's nothing wrong with buying and selling products that people want is the point

"anything worth its value is worth fight for"
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:50:43
that is a huge problem people don't realize it the suspicion alone as to why you want anonymity almost automatically constitutes a crime now a days "what are buying drugs? Why don't you want me to see your transactions? What are you doing? Are you laundering money? Terrorism??"

@_date: 2018-02-04 23:57:38
I'm fully aware of the history with the gold being taken away from private citizens back in the 20s. My point is how is anyone going to be able to buy sell or trade anything and actually make profit in a world where cash is outlawed, and ownership and use of non sanctioned blockchains is illegal how the hell am i going to be able to order shit on amazon? If the only thing they will accept is cryptousd or more likely in our shitty future crypto amazon which is way more likely to happen then them ever taking btc imo

I was explaining the problem in expecting western societies like western Europe to be able to make the right decision for there future because so far they haven't they gave up the rights, power and money to a central authority the EU leaving many people without a say in how policy should be made, they gave up the armies after the cold war so now they have to be almost completely reliant on a foreign power to come save them (USA) They created a terrible welfare system that incentivized laziness and then they decided to play hero and import millions upon millions of people who don't share the same ideologies or beliefs or cultural and will now abuse that welfare system. Im sorry i have trouble seeing them making the right decision for there future anytime soon and dont take this as ohh america is best its on the same road as Europe there just alittle more ahead of the curve when it comes to the problems society is facing.       
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:41:13

@_date: 2018-02-26 20:13:59
The market is still in the shitter overall wall street told us to go fuck our selves so there money isn't coming anytime soon and on the retail side everyone just got burned so its probably going to take months until we get a steady flow of dumb money again to buy up coins. Its a real tragedy cause there's so much good news going on we got segwit, LN is literally right around the corner, and one by one US states are treating it as legal tender. The only fundamental problems left is the monopoly on mining hardware and the monopoly on the fiat to crypto gateways but there's already crypto projects working on that front.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:23:56
mean while in the trenches of 8k....

Guys i don't think this hearing is gonna be enough to save us... to some it up they're gonna regulate icos and "they like blockchain" which is the stupid bullshit that everyone in government and banking has said all year!! Thats it!.. it doesn't say shit about giving btc more legitimacy i doubt they even give two fucks about providing the regulations to make cryptocurrency as a whole more mainstream/accepted all they care about is the best way they can get there cut and stop ico scams.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:43:00

@_date: 2018-03-04 20:25:01
lol a society of fat lazy entitled people who only want more and expect the 5% who actually work and provide for society to pay for everything i feel like thats the most realistic outcome of this.

Have you ever been, lived, or seen a society or culture that lives off welfare? It bad its creates a burden on society an incentive to do absolutely nothing with your life, and because they don't do anything or contribute to the advancement of society there literally just sucking money away from tax papers so they can sit around and keep breathing that's it! That money could actually go to something useful instead. Then you have ask the question why should i have to work when the other guy gets to be lazy and live off my labor? There's no way you can expect taxes to remain low in a system like this or inflation not to go to ridiculous levels those with money will leave and go somewhere else unless you plan to lock up those 5% and turn them into slave labor because...its best for society?

Europe is going to implode within the next ten years and come crying to the nearest strong man to save them from the Islamic horde they imported into Europe. They thought it was smart idea to import millions of and millions of people who have zero interest in our ideals, culture and way life other than to live off the welfare system. In time there going overtake the local populations and neighborhoods the governments put them in because at some point theres going to more them then there are of us mainly because they have shit ton more children then western cultures do and they are not going to teach there children our ways of life its gonna be their ideals that they brought with them from the middle east and africa and idk if any of you have set foot other there but you soon realize that trumps wall isnt needed for mexico its needed for all of the middle east.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:47:29

@_date: 2018-03-04 21:08:57
This is where i see a fundamental problem your trying to use the same model on different types of cultures and expecting the same results, it may workout just fine for Europeans so long as the population growth remains small, and everyone is educated, and the culture remains cohesive and embraces peaceful attitudes. If those factors fail all hell breaks loose. For example San Fransisco vs Chicago basically the same laws but why are a shit ton more people dying in Chicago? Well Chicago has the problem of thug culture and San Fransisco does not. Same liberal laws but the culture difference creates the effect that one city is hell on earth compared to the other.
