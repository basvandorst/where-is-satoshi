Maybe, not saying that I am right 100%, that just my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:13
Not crashing, just a little corection, it will be back soon

Not only best tech, transactions.. At first bitcoin is an idea, 
the idea of decentralized censorship free money, this is the highest bitcoin value
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:00:09
Yeah, yesterday and today all day "high fees, high fees", no do i believe in coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:52:17
Sure, maybe when they buy again at $9000, they would't sell that easy on first little market move.

It's not fair, people in china, japan, south korea are sleeping!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:36:03
balance has no impact on fee, you should not pay more then $3-5 fee if you are not in rush . Considering what is happening on market right now it would be not surprise that the network is full of spam transactions in order to make fees high and people complain about it... wait a little or set fee manual if you can

I think that its all the same, pump and dump coins, institutional money, alt coins, fud.... all this is just to take your bitcoin... I belive in this community, product, idea.. i belive having bitcoin make my part of history, new bright history of money. I will hodl, it's priceless!!

You can find a faster cheaper currency, but who knows maybe some kid freeze your money completely accidentally. 
Bitcoin is all about security, censorship resistent, decentralised... and by the way best developers works on it
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:14:46
Hodl!! Don't sell until 100k, do not buy shit coins, be smart ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:16:01
because the bitcoin is the basis for all off this crypto coins,and if base fail what do you think will happen to all the rest they are built on the same base?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:17:31
you know what's more important than high fees for the currency, that's security and all other above mentioned in the post title. There's a lot's of altcoins that offer low fees, and one day,one or two years from now when you take a look at coinmarketcap you will have  trouble to find them on the list couse they miss fundamentals and fundamentals are not low fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:40:02
Hodl, or sell and buy again at 9000 euro. Your choice ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:33:53
Bitcoin is an idea and ideas never die. So don't you worry and enjoy being part of one great idea ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:48:07
Don't get it. 
How they can not recognize that failure of bitcoin mean failure or all crypto coins. Or they do? Maybe they're working for banks etc..
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:13:26
I pay $3 fee today, just as high as it was for last couple of months. and I do not believe in this high fees posts anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:13:54
What is your tx id?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:21:55
"High fee, high fee" This is good sign that pump of btrash is about to begin ��
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:10:37
Just relax, and enjoj the ride ��
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:45:13
I agree, lower fees would be nice, but not if that mean less security, decentralization... And i am confident that bitcoin have best developer team working on this problem   
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:55:23
Again it's not a balance, it's number of inputs or traslactions
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:06:46
Not in next few years ��
I do a lot of research in alts, and really 99% of them are pure scam pump and dump coins. Nothing where i would invest for now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:14
Not sure about you but i will be happy to buy if it drop like you say. It's just a regular day in crypto world ;)
