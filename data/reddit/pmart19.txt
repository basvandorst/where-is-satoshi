Ok now I am understanding more. I will be giving him this explanation so I checked on some sites what block we are on currently we are block 309,980 every 4 years should be (210,000) blocks leaving us at 109,980 we have hit so we are half way there to our 12.5 block reward set correct? So what will happen next after rewards start shrinking and we get to the magic number of 21 million? In mining what do miners get? if there are no more new bitcoins to hit anymore?

So would mining be a dead game or do you think at some point we will be hitting a wall just in technology itself because if this is the case. If mining gear became accessible to everyone doesn't that even speed up the process and drop price even more dramatically. If that were the case it would be less ideal to buy the coin itself. Because in a situation where anyone can put a USB miner and plug it in their computer not the strongest but an average strength. You then can take it where everyone is mining it from your mom, dad, grandma, friends everyone and even if they don't hit anything they are increasing the hash rate as well wouldn't that even lessen of the time it takes to hit the last block wouldn't that render the coin useless in a pricing mechanism.

why don't we use the counterparty software itself on top of bitcoin?

Do you think difficulty will fix this by either sky rocketing to regulate the problem. I wasn't in it when it was out in 2009 I know a lot of people were not, just a good handful from what I understand but even those days it was at 50 BTC a block. Because if it keeps going on doesn't that take away from the 2140 rule the time it takes to mine the last one?
Edit: This is the only thing I found on the controlled supply of bitcoin
