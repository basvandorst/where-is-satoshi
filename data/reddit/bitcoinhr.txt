WOW are you serious? Let's rent the hashing power to morons with money and f*ck up bitcoin. Let the blockchain bloat so no one but Coinbase can have a full node. Fork off to Gavincoin already.

Those companies don't want you to run a full node on your mid-range PC. They want you to use their centralized/censored services.
@_date: 2016-04-26 11:59:44


These people are dead wrong and if anyone is going to be responsible for killing Bitcoin it will be this crowd. I personally do not think they will succeed, but governments do not worry me when it comes to Bitcoin. What worries me is Bitcoiners that do not understand the value of “fungibility” and why it’s 100 times more important then transactions per second. The Blockstream/Bitcoin Core team understands this well and as long they are the guardians of the code, I remain optimistic.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:00:50
Nice to see Bitcoin companies funding Bitcoin development in a transparent way. Hopefully others will follow this example.

What amazes me the most is the fact that rogue miners are trying to force an out of consensus client, without *any* testing and peer review, risking their own revenue. The BU dev is team is non-comparable to bitcoin core dev team, and BU client is trying to transfer all the power from users to miners. 
We as a community must protect bitcoin from this hostile takeover and start discussion on POW change immediately. If they push the HF, they will instantly realize that their rogue BU miner shitcoin has zero value.

@_date: 2016-03-09 17:34:35
50 kb transactions with paid fees is more secure than 1000kb free transactions.
This gives strong incentives to find REAL scaling solutions. Blocksize increase is NOT a solution to scaling.
Not to mention the bloated blockchain and reduced number of full nodes due to its gigantic size.
@_date: 2016-03-09 18:18:58
Guns are full nodes, not the mining power.

Those clowns are running a [Sybil Attack]( against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:57:22
Agree. But only increasing the block size solves nothing. Core is the only [innovative team]( I would welcome healthy competition if there was one. The only "Competition" is Classic attempt to gain control over the protocol. Otherwise, we would already have a consensus since Core increases capacity through Segwit (please don't yada yada how segwit is not safe and 75% hard fork is more secure) AND agreed to HF to 2MB blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-09 22:52:13
Shame that this topic is not discussed at all. This is something that can reconcile the community. I guess to many big egos around here:)
@_date: 2016-03-12 20:07:13
No my friend. Not even close. [This]( is FUD.
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:24:52
Totally agree. And if you have limited hard drive space, you can prune the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:52:08
Sorry but I have to disagree, because even after the Core addressed community capacity concerns through segwit and 2MB proposal (same as classic!) they continue to spam the network and spread the FUD on twitter, reddit and MSM. If their intentions were honest, we would have 100% consensus already. However, they continue to wage war against core since their real goal is to exclusively control the protocol.
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:25:46
Are you saying Core is fucking up? Get real.
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:26:18
Why we don't have a consensus? Core proposed capacity increase through SegWit PLUS 2MB hard fork. If Classic wants scaling they would support this. And yet we have this kind of stupidity. Instead getting on the same boat to scale Bitcoin, Classic folks are campaigning against core devs while using their code in Classic client.
@_date: 2016-03-06 12:41:53
IMHO Bitcoin is doing it's thing pretty well. The Sky is NOT falling. Fees AND limited block size are in fact ingenious mechanism which protects Bitcoin blockhain from junk/spam/dust transactions and thus make it suitable to run on average Joe's mid-range PC. This ensures that Bitcoin remains decentralized, trustless and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:39:07
Why Classic would not support [this]( Be cause they want EXCLUSIVE control over Bitcoin protocol, that is the goal. Blocksize is just an excuse for that.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:46:28

@_date: 2016-06-30 10:03:27
It depends on the exchange. 
If you use 1:3 margin, your risk gets 3x greater, meaning, you'll get margin called for a 3x smaller price move against you (25-30% instead 80-90% without margin). With 1:20 margin, you'll get margin called if the price moves only 3-4% against you.
Personally, I prefer to trade without margin.
EDIT: the buffer is there because every position is liquidated through a market order, insuring that your collateral is sufficient even in the case of big spreads/slippage.
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:21:31
Simple: Short 8 BTC with equivalent USD collateral.
If the price of BTC goes down, you're in USD profit.
If the price of BTC goes up, you re in USD loss.
If the price goes up by ~80-90% you will get margin called and lose USD collateral.
However, your BTC value would increase for the same amount.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:28:32
Increasing the block size increases the cost of running a full node. 
The number of full nodes validating bitcoin blockchain transactions (currently ~5700) is very important be cause it guarantees bitcoin as a decentralized, trustless and censorship resistant currency. 
If we increase the blocksize, we will eventually end up with several full nodes and thus lose all off the above features.
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:59:42
I'm sure there are many more nodes, which are unreachable to inbound connections and thus 'invisible' to the network. Personally, as a computer savy person, I had to do a decent amount of tweaking on my computer/firewall/network settings in order for my node to accept inbound connections.
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:53:10
Ver's agenda is not scaling, it's control of bitcoin. If he was honest, he would support SegWit. Unfortunately, he is spreading FUD, promoting altcoins and pushing alternative clients: XT, Classic and now Unlimited, all of which have zero organic support.

Core has a broad community support based on merit, not politics and hegemony. If anyone had a better scaling solution, everyone would happily accept it, core included.

Today's rally is related to meeting of Core and (mostly) Chinese miners which takes place today in Hong Kong. It is expected that they will agree on Core's Bitcoin scaling roadmap which includes a hard fork, and thus prevents Bitcoin network splitting between Core and Classic.

You made some strong arguments here. It is not that Classic is evil IMHO, they are pushing for their interests and that is legitimate. However, they should welcome other opinions too and recognize that they are not a majority. I would like to see **everyone** around the table discussing the issue honestly and openly and finally reach an agreement. That would be the best thing for bitcoin and the community.

I as an investor, I would rather take security, privacy, fungibility, decentralization, censorship resistance any day instead of transaction capacity. If you want transaction capacity, use VISA, Paypal. 
That is why I'm sticking with core, and prefer SW over contentious hijack "classic" fork.
@_date: 2016-02-16 09:39:53


But Bitcoin IS superior currency in all aspects to fiat. Blocks are not full yet. SegWit is around the corner with scaling solution superior to Classic. Why on earth would I support contentious implementation offering inferior solution?
@_date: 2016-02-27 19:53:08

Block size limit = decentralized Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:44:28
Yes, but what is more important to you:
- permisionless, decentralized, censorship resistant, resilient currency/store of value/freedom
- buying coffee at starbucks?


Do you understand that with bigger blocks agenda, we'll need exactly financial institutions (a trusted party) to validate our transactions?
