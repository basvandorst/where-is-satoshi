write it off as a loss... Should have stayed in some escrow system ebay or whathave you. theres no way to get the funds back that you sent and there is no way to get your ebayer to send you the coins. Plus post this in the SR reddit, not here. Its not good press if you have people googling btc sr and articles mentioning the silk road pops up

I dont think it would be worth it, nvidia gpus are not ment to data mine and get a significantly lower hashrate than comparable AMD cards. I think youd get like 300 mhashs and at this difficulty and the asic miners coming into play it would be counter profitable
