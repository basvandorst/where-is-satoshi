That's kinda the point. How many people do you actually think have even looked at investing in crypto *now*, much less 3 or 4 years ago? It's pretty easy to see that crypto is the definition of "unacceptably high risk", that's why you wouldn't (well, shouldn't) ever invest your life savings into crypto. While the stock market is volatile, chances are you won't actually lose a substantial chunk of your life savings if you diversify.

Well, not really. If you're 30 and investing now, sure. However, there are still Millenials that are barely 20, and if you put $2000 a year (~$167/mo) into a high growth retirement account at 20, you'll at the very least be a millionaire by retirement age. 
That, by comparison, is a lot easier to do than trying to beat the market in crypto, and it's much safer.

Depending on how willing you are to not spend frivolously, and how well off your family is (able to live at home w/parent(s)), it's not that hard. I'm 18 and I wouldn't really have a problem putting away $167/mo because I choose to live at home, hell, I wouldn't have a problem putting that away at 17 when I first got a part time job.
IIRC, the figure I'm thinking of is that if you put away $2000/yr for  10 years, starting at 17, and you have a 12% return on it, you'll have &gt;2mil by ~65. That's obviously not really possible to do when you're 30, but it's still possible for many Millenials.
Right now I'm 18 and I'm putting away $250/mo, though only $100/mo is going to a retirement account, the rest is waiting until I either hit a Class C on my retirement account and I can transfer funds in more easily, or for a big purchase I might need to make.

I'd suggest you realize that you're in Very few people believe in government, and they think that they can get away from it. You won't get them to think that *any* amount of money is good in government hands. It's the far right radical view on monetary policy. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:09:54
Any evidence for that, or are you just going to make baseless claims?

If you're trying to prove that the rich people's money trickles down, just think for literally one minute. Does a smart person save his money, insuring that he has wealth if bad times come along, or does he immediately go and buy services until all of his money is gone? He saves, and that money stays with him. 
Furthermore, some of the most rich people in the US who own companies (Zucc, Bezos) actively destroy overall jobs while still creating wealth. 
The problem is, that wealth goes not to most people, but the investor class, which again is massively unequal.

Haha, no. What you've just told me is basically "I don't like your facts, so I'm going to use my anecdotal evidence instead!" Had you actually tried to supply *any* facts about inflation and how "bad it's gotten over the last 10 years" I'd be more inclined to actually believe you. Had you even supplied a quote like 


From the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]( I'd be more inclined to argue past this point.

The amount of people who thinks this is actual "money printing" is sad. 
It's an adjusted monetary base. Look at the damn [wikipedia page]( before you start commenting on it.


Furthermore, this graph means [basically nothing]( (at least that you would use as bitcoin propaganda)

Yes, but the problem is that the bottom 90% of US citizens only own barely 20% of wealth in the US. Furthermore, the top 10% use their 80% to pay off politicians so they can take more of the money going forward, keeping the poor poor. It's the basics of what humans do, we fight to stay at the top, and the rich will not stop trying to keep the poor poor.
