I wouldn’t consider myself wealthy by any stretch, but being in the so-called American Middleclass is pretty awesome right now too. 
Saying there is a lack of opportunity in America right now shows how unbelievably out of touch you are with reality, this couldn’t be farther from the truth. A larger problem we do have (relates to poverty) is a lack of educated/technical people in the workforce. It is a challenge to actually hire someone competent and skilled right now in nearly every industry. 
Racism and inequality are issues we (and a ton of other countries in the world) continue to work on, we can and will do better.

No kidding, and we’re interested enough to be on this Reddit sub..... yet so many here think this will go “mainstream” overnight becuase it’s so simple for the common person.

Hmm yeah I guess I’m optimistic, all in good time hopefully!!

I get your point. The difference is now we live in a world where simplified graphic user interface is everything, and there really should be an easier way to handle this already. 
These coders need to be paired up with GUI savvy app developers.

This doesn’t sound convenient or useful for wide scale implimentation for the common person. They need to think Venmo merged with an NFC style payment solution (Apple/Samsung Pay). 
No everyday person, besides tech people like those on this sub, will take the time to open various channels for payments (even if it’s through a merchant), your BTC is stored separately from withdrawals for lightning. This needs to be handled by an App/program with a great UI.... do this and BTC will go to the stratosphere!

Dude fees are high a shit, it’s not realistic for P2P use at all (trust me I wish it was, I used to use it all the time for this). Just accept it man, I can Venmo my buddy for free, or use bitcoin simply as a novelty and lose 5-10%.

The quality of life in our country is absolutely fantastic. A few years ago, the area I lived in had a significant unemployment issue, which also fueled crime. If you had a decent job you were lucky. In the past year, there are more job positions (good, well paying careers) than companies can even fill. 
Just like many other parts of the world, the news does a great job of spreading fear and lies regarding the actual state of America. 
I’m aware that many other countries have a higher statistic for “quality of life” based on specific parameters and polls of 1,000 random people from a specific (preselected) areas, but I can assure you the mood, and actual climate is the best it has been in decades. 
Hate or love Trump, his economic attitude and policies are business friendly and are helping the United States remain an absolute powerhouse in the world. I don’t disagree with a lot of things our President says and does, but I will admit he is good for our economy, our jobs, and quality of life (overall). It’s much easier to be happy with a steady paycheck, this leaves us plenty of free time to complain about the other political issues. 
Source: I actually live in America, and frequently travel throughout the country and North America for work, so my observations are not limited to one geographic area or state.

I was 50-50 on these until the CTO of Ledger came on Reddit and treated everyone like shit. He is the biggest douchebag you’ll ever talk with. 
For that reason I am 100% pro Trezor, excellent customer service and product.
