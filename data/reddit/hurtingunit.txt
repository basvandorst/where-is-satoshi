All that would still take time. I am sure they will employer all methods to cash out. But $60 million plus in BTC is a lot. It's just speculation, but it makes sense to me.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:08:25
Hoping to get the word out to find out. I am sure someone will give it a shot. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:02:03
Maybe a method to move it faster. Turn your profit a little quicker, rather than sitting and waiting. idk.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:12:26
I just got beat down (down votes) in this same sub for explaining my opinion on this same type of slander from the MSM.  On that note, it is what it is.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:15:58
If I understand the technology correctly.  You should still be able to mine it, but what you don't gain in coins; the network gains in expansion.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:54:10
You can tell almost none of them know anything about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:57:14
Is it dependent on the amount of coin in the account or the age?  I just wonder what the hedge is here.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:41:35
Plunges?  LMFAO
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:41:25
Mind blown. Please add the Guinness I have had to this mind blown equation.

I'm an investor shibe on @_date: 2014-02-14 22:25:14
That's cool.  But within the two, is the question.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:34:51
But it would be breaking if someone was waiting on such news, and discovered the news while searching this sub.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:08:34
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:23:42
Can you do it via Imgur and Twitter?
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:09:43
doesn't get the new users because Bitcoin is too expensive of an investment for n00bs to get into.  The fact that you don't have to convert FIAT for BTC anymore has strengthened the DOGE community. Vault of Satoshi decided they would let you buy Doge with USD\CAD last week, and added a few others.  People late to BTC are flooding other cryptos for hope they will gain the relevance of BTC.  I don't surf this sub much, this was posted in the only reason I saw it.  I hope all cryptos do good.  Bitcoin is leading the way, no doubt.  
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:43:40
Cool.  Gotta say that was pretty cool.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:32:47
With Dogecoin we can tip Doge on Twitter and Imgur.  Not between the two , but within the two sites.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:32:55
Have any of those folks posted back with new phones yet?
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:31:48
Very Sweet.
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:23:42
We are all going to do well with our currencies.  
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:43:23
You offering up any money to help make a better exchange?  You putting ideas out?  What are you doing to make Bitcoin better?
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:41:42
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:24:24
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:24:19
Breaches is another good reason.  Target, Sony, Jimmy Johns, JPMorgan\Chase, etc...
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:12:07
Always willing to support a fellow Texan. PM me if their is anything I can do for you.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:32:27
Let's consider the facts.  Businesses in Feds pockets and vice versa stand to lose out on a lot of money.  Decentralized currency buying goods and services and banks not getting a piece of it, that's Billions of fiat that disappears.  Feds, Banks, and Media have a stranglehold on the citizens of this country.  Why wouldn't the major media outlets report the most discouraging things about a currency that they get no piece of.
If citizens are not spending or trying to get fiat, then that is a loss of control in all three major sectors.  So yeah, I have an argument.  Good Day.
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:20:32
I am sure we all know that the USD and Euro are backed by intrinsic value.  Perceived value.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:52:05
Agreed. I appreciate the good conversation. :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:34:41
True Story
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:30:22
Looks a lot like the exchange charts for BTC; as of lately.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:29:32
This comment was completely uncalled for a flat out stupid.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:28:23
Of course not.  Those folks are losing their minds knowing that fiat is on its way out the door.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:09:45
More than you can handle?
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:39:28
Cool.  Just asking about it.  We have been doing with Doge for a few days, I think it would be cool if we could do it with BTC.  Just on the exposure factor and gaining new adopters.  The Devs at Doge could for sure help with that, and I am sure would be most willing. If need be.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:44:42
Only time will tell.  You have an argument to pose, or you just trolling through with your insults?  
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:15:41
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:18:21
And a couple of more for making this comment.  I wish that everybody that down voted would express themselves with a viable comment or argument instead of down voting with no comment.  LMFAO
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:22:50
Agreed, I know ignorant doesn't mean stupid.  I don't believe that I stated you thought they were lacking in skills.  But that there interest are the fiat that helps them control or manipulate as they see fit.
People in power are good at talking out both sides of there mouth, if they believe that will suits their interests.  Be mindful of what you hear people in power say, I am sure you know that though.
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:23:35
and it begins or continues.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:40:04
I believe that PPC is the way to go.
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:23:09
And I caught a down-vote for even making the comment.  LMFAO.
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:53:36
With a shit ton of work
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:20:41
I was ignorant on some parts of crypto currency in general, before watching this last night.  I feel I have a much better understanding of the technology and the future of the blockchain technology after that talk.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:22:21
Bter been straight every time for me.  I hear crypsty is slow as hell sometimes, from what I hear.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:26:22
How different is this from NXT?
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:38:24
Not all citizens are trading coin to fiat.  Once citizens use the coins to trade for services, that is what will make bitcoin and other coins viable.  In fact I just watched this live streamed and Andreas Antonopoulos was saying the same things in the talk and questions after.  Unless Andreas is an unreliable source of information about bitcoin and crypto currency, which I do not believe is the case.  Linked below.
Edit:  
Well if you don't think that Businesses and the Feds are in bed together, please research. Example: Car Company bailouts and Bank bailouts.

@_date: 2015-01-04 08:29:54
Agreed money is already digital.  
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:48:54
Because they didn't get into a position of power with being ignorant.  They learned how to play both sides of the game and figured out how to manipulate rules to work in their favor, when need be.  I won't ever claim they are stupid or ignorant.  When the powerful do something it is to benefit them, and sometimes that means making the little man think they get rewarded to.
That's a good quote I wish I could oblige with one myself.
