Also, it is cleared out, so no need for trying private key yourself ;)

Donate BTC to the ones who are STEALING intellectual property from movie makers? This guy asked for legal way, he wants to actually support movies he likes. He's got some manners you pirate scum!

Since EVERYONE here is just saying how BAD investment you just made, I will try to do the opposite and actually tell you the facts. I paid for BFL miner 30 GH/s in February last year, and got it in September. I was promised for it to arrive at late May. I got screwed over for delivering date, yes, but they shipped the product, and it has been mining ever since non-stop (Unlike new scrypt miners from what I can see...) Also, I paid about 700$ for it including shipping, and it made me 4 BTC since then. You be the judge, but I won't be buying anything from them anytime soon :)

sorry, cant post there because I am new user (which is funny because I read Reddit for more than 2 years, just didn't make account yet)

Thanks mate! Really appreciate it! :D

If we take, for example, ENIAC, first so-called computer, It's processor was 16 bit and had speed of 1,1 KHz. I know This comparison can be off, because speed is not only thing that is important in hashing speed, but, if we compare that to Athlon 64 3500+, single core processor clocked at 2,2 GHz with speed of 1.18 MH/s, we would get speed of 0,59 H/s for ENIAC. That means it takes EINAC 1,7 times the age of the universe to take one bite!

50.000.000.000 MH/s 
= 1 BILLION cpu workers @ 50 MH/s (common cpu miners that were used when this all started, probably even less)
= ~143 MILLION Radeon HD 7850 GPU's @ 350 MH/s (first gpu I bought early LAST YEAR which mined me ~10 BTC since I switched to scrypt mining, talking about fast expansion ha?)
= ~17720 Tianhe-2 Worlds fastest supercomputers (Containing 32000 Intel Xeon E5-2692 2.2GHz processors)
= ~682 Bananas (Converted using "internet converter")
= 25 BTC (Every 10 min avg.)
Got any better picture now?

Not blurred private keys on Reddit? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

I will certainly do! Thanks for reminding me, I used it before and it went fluently!
