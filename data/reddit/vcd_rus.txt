Wallet is an address on the blockchain where you store your coins, while having control with private key. More precisely, an interface to send/receive coins.
Coinbase is an exchange, where you have balance on the account and can trade. It's NOT on blockchain, that's why transactions and trades are instant and free, and you don't have direct control over it (they can potentially lock you out, or delete balance).
If you just bought an investment you can withdraw funds from exchange (coinbase) to your wallet, whichever interface you might use.

Why are bcash, b gold, b diamond forks are even in top 100?? Why have they passed so many really great projects that actually make the future??
Never underestimate how emotional and irrational markets are.

So maybe mr. Ver is trying to pump it again in defence? ;)

Although all you say makes sense... But just people cashing out before holidays? When you see sellout of millions for BTC, ETH and LTC in blocks of hundreds, coordinated to the minute on GDAX? With simultaneous pump for bcash... looks a little suspicious :)

So this went under the radar but was known since August??
"adding BCH before end of the year".

If you bought large amount for long term, it's usually better to move it out where you have full control. Up to 1 BTC I'd just leave it, not really worth the transfer fees.

bcash trading is resumed on GDAX, SELL!! ))))
