It is built on Ethereum, but people will be able to use Bitcoin in the markets.

I have no idea what their current employee list looks like, I know a few who are no longer there and a bunch that are still there and doing great. 
All indications tell me that the company is doing fine, it's still a startup in a very competitive space right now.

I admire your trolling.
I did work at places four and six years straight before I moved to tech. The good part of all this is I would never want to work for you!

It also heavily depends on what your business is or what you are interested in as a consumer.

I'm always a big fan of going local with this stuff, the more local the charity, the more you are likely to actually helping the people who need support. From at my time at BitPay I realized that almost any charitable cause will happily accept bitcoin once they realize they can get paid in the $USD amount.
I personally helped Ferguson Library get set up one night and while we didn't raise a ton, I'm fairly certain the money raised went directly to help an awesome place and I'm good with that.
**Edit:** Full disclosure, I was also a part of the company when Red Cross accepted through them, I was not defending what they do...merely stating my opinion on charity. It's your decision to donate who you want, research is out there on good charities so do that and if you can support local is all I'm saying.
**Edit 2:** To directly answer your question I also add [archive.org]( and [eff.org]( Supporting open source projects is always a great way to support too.

Thanks again! I am not so sure it needs to be front page as it sort of is a "me me me" post, but sometimes I just need to post a "me me me" post!
What I do know is that if someone appreciates the fact that I whole-heartedly believe that being open and honest with the community. As long as I can stay away from the 24/7 hype ball that so many in this community seem to want, I am good.

Thank you, but the word hero is really not appropriate, although flattering. I'm just trying to promote a product that I sincerely believe in, in a way that's honest and without much bullshit hype.
The "bitcoin celebrity" thing puzzles me and it always has, I'm fairly certain it's been destructive too as it appears some of the people who  embraced the term have shown a similar attitude that creeps into their professional life (this is just perception, so would never drop names). I spent the first 6 months at BitPay in complete anonymity, then I started to realize that I need to take credit for what i've done. 
With that being said, the one thing I would like to do similar to that is a decentralizing music panel with Shooter and either Steve Albini or someone I know from Warner Bros. Records. If any Bitcoin conference reads this and wants to make it happen financially, I'm fairly certain I can get a panel that will be amazing, intelligent and unlike anything that has been at a Bitcoin conference before (in a good way).

No, I had nothing to do with the bowl game other than the social media campaign and commercials. Nice try though.

Thanks for the kind words. I mostly posted to share something personal and cool to me, unfortunately it's the Internet and all. But your post and others definitely gave me a smile!
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:42:47
Thank you and best of luck to you as well.
So far I've been a part of so many "firsts" that I smile just thinking about it.

If you look hard enough, and put the pieces together...you can have a very good educated guess of who Satoshi is. Just saying Satoshi is Szabo illustrates a failure to dig further for the True Name of the ideal candidate for Satoshi.

Our interview with Robin was fantastic, and we are hoping to record a video with him talking about Augur in the next week or two.
Having him as an advisor to Augur has been fantastic, sitting under that learning tree was amazing.

Thank you, I wish it wasn't getting so heavily downvoted because of the title. I want this podcast to be heard by everyone and there is way more to what he says in our hourlong conversation than this.
There is A LOT in that conversation that the bitcoin community could learn from.

I'm a big fan of Ill Bill and Non Phixion and I had no idea that he was into this. His brother Necro is a really great producer too.
I did know that Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw &amp; Head Automatica was into Bitcoin for a bit, no idea if he still is though. Always does surprise me more indie artists who make music about topics like they do aren't into this.

No one single integration is going to blow up to that degree but each one will grow and that's the brilliance of ChangeTip. Musicians are super plentiful and usually love money, so this could make a big splash but that's not the point.
The point is that "blowing up" is irrelevant as long as they maintain the ability to send money easily over various highly used websites, they are positioned in an amazing way over so many others. I admire their goal of integrating as much as possible as it's actually setting a standard and I also don't believe they think one integration will blow up. 
Nick is a very smart guy and their pacing and goals have been perfect in my eyes. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely things I would change that I think are very troublesome and do not help their situation, but in general these issues are few and the good decisions are often made.
Talking to him again on our show reminded me of how bright he is and reminded me of how much they are doing right.

The topic title is a bit misleading but getting to interview Steve Albini was an amazing experience, he's one of my heroes. I would recommend everyone check out the full podcast and listen for yourself, he has much more depth and understanding than you would realize and his opinions of the music industry are smarter than almost anyone I have heard.

Kevin Owens debuting on Raw by confronting and powerbombing John Cena was surreal.
The current state of Bitcoin was mostly expected and inevitable, but it still seems pretty cool.

Awesome and I didn't think the community would love his views but to be fair they aren't really focused on "crypto-assets" but they are more about Finance in general.
Steve is the kind of person we need on our side to create cultural change and the stink of people working in the financial world makes it difficult when that's the first assumption. In my first correspondence with him he basically said no and explained his position, I replied and explained where I thought he was wrong and how I agreed with almost everything he said, then he agreed to come on and was one of our best guests ever (no offense to other guests, but the guy has been a hero of mine for 10+ years and the only dream guest ahead of him is Trent Reznor).
Before I spoke with him I had years of fandom and hours of research so I knew how smart he was. Electrical Audio (his studio) has one of the best forums on the net and our talk inspired me to do start brainstorming on a project I want to begin working on when my time frees up later this year.
Yes this sounds like a total "gushing" post about Steve but in the non-stop hype bubble that is Bitcoin and Silicon Valley, here is a guy who is HONEST and has run a successful business for decades while being innovative and completely moral. Every single person who is in this Bitcoin game could learn something from him, that show was less to convince him about the greatness of Bitcoin and more to convince the community who listens (for us it's mostly developers) that the end users often could give a shit about finance.
If you need any further quotes or anything from me please feel free to reach out. I actually loved the piece you did, I just felt that the wording could have more accurately explained what he stated.

We distribute our podcast on SoundCloud and absolutely love ChangeTip so every part of this is great for content creators! 
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:17:05
It's sad the reaction to the article and title is getting confused with the content of my interview with Steve as I thought we captured something amazing in our chat. The downvotes are killing me! lol
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:05:43
I think the term "destroys the notion" is a bit much when his criticism was more toward contracts in general and the way he operates his business. The phrase "destroys the notion of contracts" would have been more exact and relevant as this was a minor point in an hour long interview. It's a bit like saying someone "hates Pepsi" when in reality they hate all soda, it's a bit misleading and that is why there are not more upvotes.
In general I appreciate any attention the show is getting so thank you for that. I just wish it made a bigger splash as these are the kind of voices I think both bitcoin and the decentralized tech scene need to listen to as they are sympathetic, smart and skeptical.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:55:16
Thank you for the compliment and the criticism, discussing smart contracts isn't easy and I want to elaborate further on my point about enforceability of contracts and smart-contracts as I think it's something that many others are confused about as well. In one of the future episodes I am hoping to do this as we do the episodes to educate both the audience and ourselves.

Shooter actually recorded the voiceover at the Sirius/XM Studio where he records his Outlaw Country show. I'm unsure on his recording process, but the team and animator thought it sounded great so we used it.
