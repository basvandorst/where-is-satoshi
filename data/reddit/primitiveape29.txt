Stay strong tonight boys, it’s going to get rough. Though in the long run, it’s going to do nothing more but prove again Bitcoin’s unrelenting fortitude.

Huge sell walls today for BCH. Serves em right

Today is a test and will probably get rid of a lot of weak hands. I personally haven’t been in crypto for that long (August it finally hit me that this was the future of money, so I opted in). And a month after, the September correction happened.
Being down and thinking I could potentially lose more, I fought the urge to sell day in and day out for a couple of weeks. But lo, I hedl on tight. 
Now four months later, I’m closer to the moon than ever, on this rocket ship with a bunch of other smart people with a mind for the future.
So to those who got in a little later, don’t let days like today shake you into selling out. If you truly believe in this technology, hodl. If not, good riddance. 
Also Lightning Network, from what I’ve read, will solve the high fees and transaction time issues. This is only going to get better, and gradually become more highly adopted. Congrats on an unprecedented year, gentlemen.

Someone just sold around 3300 BCH, among other huge sell orders. This was a massive, coordinated pump n dump.

I highly doubt it’s going to go that low.

It’s up over 130% from last month. The price is just consolidating after massive gains...this is normal. Do not panic. HO-motherfucking-DL.

This doesn’t look spammy at all! Good job, dude!

Cup and handle forming on the monthly chart.
Speculation: It’s gonna more or less stagnate and then take off again in about a week or less. 
idk tho *(kanye shrug)*
PS if you think this price drop is “insane” then I doubt you’ve been in crypto very long.

Just get a coinbase account and sign into gdax with your coinbase info and buy/sell on gdax instead. 
Then you’ll expand to other exchanges that offer more coins (binance, bittrex, kucoin). It’s an inevitable path deeper into the crypto realm. Coinbase is the American crypto gateway drug.

Hey if you’re a mall-cop or a liaison officer for a middle school then I’d say the Segway was pretty revolutionary.
