As an American expat living and working in China, THIS IS AWESOME. 
THANK YOU, BTC China. This is a complete game changer. I've been your customer for 6 months now. The CNY deposit methods are a little frustrating sometimes, but I know the banks don't want to do direct deposits. I stick with you guys because you are always innovating and always on the edge.

Yes, and it's almost identical to the April 15th "deadline" we had last month. You might remember what the price did on April 16th.

This should be higher up. I'm in your same situation and do the exact same thing to get my coins. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:23:22
On that note, if Bobby Lee decides to just keep on trucking and setting up ATMs and accepting cash payments (something that's been in talks for a while), I will certainly be making physical trips to Shanghai if that's what it takes to get my coin, and I live 4 hours away. China's going to have to try a lot harder to ban bitcoin completely. 
This also makes me think about Andreas' recent comments about where the first decentralized bitcoin exchange will be set up: wherever there are strict govt controls and brilliant programmers.

A lot of people gave Joe Rogan grief the last time because of his dim-witted sidekick inserting snide comments and drive-by FUD (I can't remember his name.) But I actually think that stuff is good as long as Joe keeps him in check. Public bitcoin discussion needs an "idiot in the room" to ask dumb questions because that's where a lot of Joe's listeners are coming from. And Andreas is arguably the best bitcoin spokesperson for shutting down uninformed arguments. I hope we get the same kind of format again. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:54:46
Apparently it was only BTC China which shut for a couple months, which then opened a voucher system at the end of January. Huobi and OkCoin have been doing business all along, which explains why they have completely overtaken BTC China's market share.

This is complete ass. I bought a ticket to Beijing and booked a hotel in hopes of attending the conference this weekend. Now I wonder if anyone will even show up. It's a good thing I asked to pay on-site, otherwise I'd be banging down their door for a refund. I guess I'm spending two days in Beijing sightseeing. Could be worse, I suppose...
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:14:23
I see this criticism a lot, but I have to point out, we've made our bed this way with the name itself, right? I mean, if we wanted to get away from the tangible money image, we wouldn't call it bitCOIN in the first place. 
I'm not saying we shouldn't, of course. Personally, I think our primitive monkey brains simply have too a hard time with valuating, securing, and frankly, imagining digital goods. So playing with words and images to fool/help the less technical among us come to terms with the concept of crypto currency is quite a useful thing in the end. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:26:10
I completely agree and I've been educating myself on how to do that.

I am not a Chinese citizen, but I live here and use BTCChina.com. BTC China may have been anticipating this move with their announcement yesterday about separating domestic accounts from international accounts. From what I understand, a domestic account may not trade with an international account. This may be a solution to keep Chinese investors in China?? 
We all know what a nightmare it will be for authorities to contain bitcoin within national boundaries, but perhaps Beijing doesn't know that yet. I know Bobby Lee has no intention to close doors and perhaps this is his way of complying with authorities.

I feel bad for asking, but I haven't really followed the development history of this product over the past year, besides the occasional comments about delays and a few customers finally getting the first Trezors earlier this year. 
With this news, is this now the first time Trezors are all caught up with back orders and are shipping new orders in "real time"?

If it had catch phrase on the back, this would be perfect.

I'm not 100% sure that twitter is legit as I cannot find any sources on Chinese websites. In either case, there is a very real, large international bitcoin conference in Beijing, May 10-11. I know because I have registered and am going there myself. Then there's the even larger Shanghai conference in August. 
**I have no idea how expensive international conferences with dozens of industry leaders from all over the world can be organized in a country which is about to ban bitcoin. In fact, I'm just going out on a limb here, I'm betting these activities are only happening because intelligent people understand bitcoin actually does have a future in China.** Go ahead and down vote me, China haters.

Got into BTC around July last year. Started visiting around November/December when I wanted to get more news on BTC China, the banking regulations (I live in China). I joined reddit last month and was my first subscription. 
Not a bad place, this reddit. I'm finding all kinds of sub reddits for things I like. among others...
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:23:55
Unbelievably fantastic news. Just five days ago I wrote about my life in China using bitcoin [here]( I said it is difficult to get Chinese merchants to accept now, but hopefully it would change soon. 
I had NO idea this was coming so quickly. This is 太牛逼！(too fucking awesome)
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:58:52
One more level: Spend a bit could also refer to the denomination of bitcoin "bit" (100 Satoshis) which many people are fond of. Though to be sure, spending just one bit on any of these websites is nigh impossible at the moment!
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:38:05
Joe has definitely warmed up to it. Wait until Andreas sets him up with a vanity wallet and the coins start rolling in. He's going to lose his shit.

Looks like part 2 of the previous interview segment that was posted a few days ago. I'm hoping there's more segments to come! Usually Andreas seems slightly wired from too much coffee, but here he's really cool, laid back, but completely cogent as usual.

If you read the post, this is more about foreigners living in China, not the Chinese people. I could write about average Chinese opinions on BTC. They are just as skeptical right now of BTC as any other main street investor in America or Europe. But that's not what I am writing about here. 
I see by your post history you seem to be waging a personal crusade against BTC in China. No one is impressed. I live here. I buy BTC here. You do not. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 09:06:37
I live in China and buy bitcoin here. This is pure speculation, please don't take it as fact. (But then, everything concerning bitcoin in China is speculation.) I personally suspect China wants to set up their own state exchange. This is perfectly in line with the rest of their economic policy, having state-owned enterprises managing what they consider important resources. I don't think bitcoin will be banned. Beijing is too greedy to let go potential profits. They simply want to control the narrative, the flow, and most importantly the profits of bitcoin in China. 
As I've said before, I wouldn't doubt that the first decentralized exchange will be created in China as a result of this. But right now, it looks bleak for completely private exchanges. 
Last note: all this being said, BTC China is not only still running, but rolling out new products and services every week, despite FUD coming out of the media. Either Beijing is looking favorably on BTC China, or Bobby has got some 大蛋 (big balls). We'll see what happens after May 10th. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:33:35
I live in China and I agree. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 08:50:33
Surprised we haven't seen a price drop. Either we've hit bottom or will soon. Either way, the international bitcoin conference in Beijing on May 10th (I'm going there) ought to be verrrry interesting.

I think we can criticize the presentation without criticizing Mr. Garzik. Look, not everybody has the gift of public speaking. Heck, the Winkelvoss twins suck balls at it. Doesn't mean they are not intelligent or are wrong about bitcoin. 
But we generally want dynamic, excited speakers getting the information out to the public, don't we? The most important computer science and monetary revolution in history should not read like a casserole recipe. This was painful to watch, especially because of the high regard I hold for TED Talks.

Pretty much any time money is mentioned at all in a CGP Grey video he uses the bitcoin logo. What I would love is a YouTube educator of his caliber to do an entire video just on bitcoin. He's technically savvy, a good writer, has the audience, and he's already putting bitcoin easter eggs in his vids. It's a perfect fit.

Sorry, do you have a source? I live in China and have been following development here. Not doubting you, just surprised I missed this.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:02:47
By the way, I got my funds out of BTC China a few days ago, sent them to cold storage. Partially because I'm a little spooked, gotta be honest, but mainly because it's fucking stupid to keep coins in exchanges no matter what country you live in, as we all know. 
Long term, I'm bullish on bitcoin in China. Short term, it might be a bumpy ride. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:39:38
Oh my god Chinese institutions love paperwork. My friends and family don't believe me when I tell them, but I am required to visit a physical bank location, bring my passport, take an hour filling out paperwork, to SET UP AN ONLINE BANKING ACCOUNT. How long does this take in the US? 20 minutes from home in your underwear?
Upgrading to bitcoin here is a butane torch lighter to a caveman's flint and tinder.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:50:09
Almost. Every voter is satisfied with the perpetuated delusion that they have some small control over your life. This is how the mob is placated. In democratic systems the state still has 100% control over your life.

Andreessen has said several times libertarians will turn on bitcoin like they have turned on the internet. On one level I know where he is coming from, but he's basically wrong on this.
Libertarians have used the internet to gather, exchange ideas, expand their numbers, and give their ideology a worldwide platform that has never existed in the 200+ year history of their movement. It has enabled the creation of the world's largest marketplace, and also made the gate-keepers of traditional media irrelevant. These are libertarian principles.  People will scream and shout about state intrusion into privacy (rightly so) but you would be a fool to deny the positive impact the internet has had on libertarianism. (and anarchism!)
If Andreesson is drawing an accurate parallel between the internet and bitcoin, we might expect immoral uses of the blockchain by government, but we can also expect this technology to empower the movement of liberty in many ways we can't even imagine. Overall it will be a net positive.
