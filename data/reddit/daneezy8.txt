I will copy and paste my exact question here. So you can see for yourself : "Question? What are good examples of tech stocks. Thanks." Where in my question do I ask for financial advice? Do you have issues reading?

I'm in the same boat as you...  im starting to wonder if my money was better off elsewhere.  Will there ever be a new ATH for bitcoin?

My horizon is long-term as well.  Just sucks to be apart of the bear market after having experienced the tremendous growth and amazing price increase in the second half of 2017.  I also receive a lot of negative feedback from telling people I've invested in BTC, telling me to pull my money out of there a.s.a.p., and its only a matter of time before it goes down to 0.  Most are not educated about it, and I am wondering how and when the average person will have a positive perspective and understanding of the fundamentals and benefits this new technology brings to us.

Question:  What's the site to see the BitCom's?

I dont understand something... cant the Rockefellers/Soros just buy out all the bitcoin supply and just hold them. Once that is done, there will be little supply available for regular investors to enter as btc price will be too high. This way they can control all the bitcoin and there is no way that bitcoin can be a threat to the banking industry? Id appreciate some clarification.
