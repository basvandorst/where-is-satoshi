Ministry of Justice is recommending a ban, but I believe it would have to be passed by the national assembly to go into effect. Basically, MoJ wants it banned, but they don't have the final say.
My prediction: just as happened with the China-ban saga, people will vote (and yell at each other) based on what they want to happen, rather than what real information we can actually parse from the news.
I don't know who this guy is, or who his counterpart is. I'm guessing this is getting shared because it's what people want to hear.

No. There is no scratch foil involved in the legit ledger Nano S. You get the device, and a blank card to write your seed on, which is generated by the device when you first turn it on.
The scammer initialized the device, and printed the seed onto the scratch card you see here, trying to make it look like it was printed by Ledger.

I couldn't find a whole lot about this particular speech in Chinese, but this guy does talk a lot about Chinese crypto policy. He's saying crypto and blockchain tech will likely not be completely banned in China,[ but they want to be able to control things well, so they can clear out scams and what he calls "inferior coins" and make room for the good ones]( He's also mentioned several times that he expects China [to release an official state-backed cryptocurrency in the near future](
Here's a little context. Renmin University provides a lot of policy thinktank capacity for the Chinese government, so someone high up like this is probably on a first name basis with many of the important players in Chinese financial policy. He probably knows what they're worried about, and probably plays a role in informing him. He also probably is not sending out trial balloons on behalf of the PBoC.
When he talks about control, and about "superior" and "inferior" coins, I see this as a judgment from the perspective of what is useful to the state and the party. I've said this many times: I do not believe the party can allow mainstream Chinese adoption of any coin that is widely convertible on international markets, because that leaves a channel open for capital flight. Paired with his statements about a state-backed currency, I have a feeling that most international coins, including the ostensibly Chinese ones, will not be allowed in China in the near future. We'll see some state-backed projects to try and design a coin that can't be used for money laundering, and we'll see some efforts to train kids in blockchain so they can export that as a skill to all the fancy silicon valley tech companies trying to develop sexy new blockchain tech. 
In short, China is not going to "unban"* bitcoin. Move along.
\*I know it's "technically" not banned, but for all intents and purposes, your average Zhou can't play with it anymore.

Even when a company directly accepts BTC as payment, the IRS will still want their cut. They would treat it the same as bartering stocks for a car. To calculate, you count it as if you sold the BTC for dollars.
The only way to change that would be for the IRS to decide to treat BTC as a currency, rather than as a security.

A wallet sitting in a safe cannot be hacked, but it's easy to leave traces of that wallet laying around. The easiest way to lose your paper wallet is by unknowingly making it on a compromised computer, or by making it with a compromised app. Also, there's a chance your printer may have a copy stored in its hard drive. Basically, there's a bit of research you need to do to make it secure.

It's not happening. What is happening is that a lot of new renewable energy production in China is happening in remote regions (often west of the Heihe-Tengchong line) with an abundance of sunlight, wind and sometimes water energy, and low populations far from the electricity demand.
Mining operations are following them there and taking advantage of the cheap electricity prices for energy that would otherwise go unused. It's not big enough now to subsidize more investment in renewable energy, but it is enough to help some individual plants make their money back faster and stay online long enough for the energy to hopefully make it into the grid soon.
It's not perfect. Some mining operations are doing the same thing at coal plants that are being subsidized in places like Inner Mongolia to try and support the economy there. We still need to be vigilant about the energy consumption issue, but looking at it the way Andreas describes it can be quite helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:49:49


I read it as they projected 30k demand at the beginning of the year, but the orders kept coming in and they kept expanding production to match that. I'm not sure how their production is set up, but if they're outsourcing to a decent-sized manufacturer, it could be possible. I know they were dealing with a large backlog of orders earlier in the year, so now we're just seeing them work their way out of it.

A security is an ownership stake in some venture. These are regulated by the SEC. You are not allowed to openly market shares in a venture to regular people (non-accredited investors) outside of SEC-approved channels.
He's basically saying that some ICO tokens behave exactly like securities because they are raising funds for startups and ventures, and so they will probably fall under SEC jurisdiction. Claiming it's a currency is not going to change that fact.
When you buy a bitcoin, you own a bitcoin, not a piece of someone's company. Ergo, it doesn't behave as a security.
It sounds like those kinds of coins will be fine (at least for now), but anyone dealing in them is still subject to the same anti-laundering laws as all other kinds of currency products and investments.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:21:17
"It has been asserted" is just a fancy way of saying "people said this." It doesn't actually mean they are barred from taking control. He's saying "I don't care how much you 'assert' it's just a currency, if it walks like a security, it's on our turf."

Part of it is probably a shortage of product. The official website lists it for about $100, which sounds about right. This isn't just a programmed USB drive, after all. There's custom hardware in there. The per unit cost to manufacture these at the current scale (Ledger said they made about a million Nano S's this year; not sure about Trezor) will be quite high. It'll come down eventually, when these things are selling on the scale of, say, a name brand smart phone or a handheld gaming console.

It's very simple. As long as you hodl, there is no taxable event. If you sell your bitcoin, or use it to buy something, you are realizing any gains or losses in its value since you bought it. Hodling on a paper wallet is not a loophole, and is the same, in a legal sense, as hodling on Coinbase. You're not taxed until you have done something to realize the gains, just as you're not taxed on your stocks unless you sell them or receive dividends.

If you can get a good rate for a mortgage, then you should take it. Let's say you have enough money to buy a house outright. If you take out a mortgage for the house, and put the money into a well-diversified investment portfolio, that portfolio will grow faster than the mortgage debt, and you come out on top.

I'm not so sure. It's a technical field that China is currently leading in, and can fund innovations that will be profitable in the future. The government likes that kind of stuff. And with the exchanges closed, the mainstream's basically going to move on. If a small percentage of the population keeps using bitcoin despite all that, they'll probably tolerate it, just as they tolerate VPN use and pirated satellite TV feeds. At that scale, it doesn't really matter.

MtGOX still holds a bunch of bitcoins, and at a certain point (I believe it was somewhere in the mid-$2000s range), they technically became solvent again, meaning that the value of their remaining coins exceeded the debt it owes to creditors (in Yen). Problem is, they're only allowed to pay those debts in yen, and selling all the bitcoin to pay those debts would probably cause a slide in the markets.

You're right that we're still not sure, but the picture is growing clearer.
This whole idea of "China has 'banned' bitcoin so many times before" says as much about the way bitcoiners in the West have responded as it does about China. There have been several regulatory actions. Each time, people freaked the fuck out and tried to build up theories based on google translate and poorly-vetted sources. Lots of people tended to oversimplify.
It was the English-speaking bitcoin scene screaming "China bans bitcoin!" Then the same ones patting themselves on the back when China didn't ban anything.
All the while, things were changing in China, with individual bitcoin dealers disappearing off the e-commerce sites, banks blocking transfers to exchanges, exchanges shutting down once or twice, exchanges temporarily halting crypto withdrawals, and regulators grumbling about licenses and scams. Each time, another avenue for wider adoption in China was shut off. Each time, some idiot would scream "China's banning bitcoin!", and others would say, "yeah right."
Now here we are with what's shaping up to be a major blow to bitcoin in China, maybe the biggest so far, and about half of this sub still has their head in the sand, because they're "smart enough" to know that the "Chinaban" is just FUD.

It's possible they got it wrong, but I find it interesting that they're reading trouble for the big Chinese exchanges in that PBoC announcement, in the original Chinese, while a bunch of internet sleuths on reddit are reassuring themselves based on the PBoC's sloppy in-house translation.
Also, whoever wrote OP's link almost certainly didn't read the Caixin story. They're not quoting a journalist, but instead quoting an unnamed source close to the working group that just released the ICO ban.

With collusion from Caixin, and the Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg and the New York Times, as well as with insiders at the financial risk working group, so they could time everything to coincide with the ICO ban...
Or, you know, the regulators might actually be gearing up to restrict, maybe even shut down the exchanges, as a growing chorus of people with analytical skills keep trying to tell you.

Caixin is not a government mouthpiece (note: in Chinese, mouthpiece is written as throat, hence the phrasing here). They claim to have a source close to the working group that has info on an upcoming all-out-ban, but we haven't seen that yet.

I, too, can quote the article:


@_date: 2017-09-11 05:42:53


Most of those sources are inaccessible from China without a VPN, and, more importantly, written in English. The fact that Chinese bitcoin investors haven't reacted to them means basically nothing. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:26:48
You're right that we're still not sure, but the picture is growing clearer.
This whole idea of "China has 'banned' bitcoin so many times before" says as much about the way bitcoiners in the West have responded as it does about China. There have been several regulatory actions. Each time, people freaked the fuck out and tried to build up theories based on google translate and poorly-vetted sources. Lots of people tended to oversimplify.
It was the English-speaking bitcoin scene screaming "China bans bitcoin!" Then the same ones patting themselves on the back when China didn't ban anything.
All the while, things were changing in China, with individual bitcoin dealers disappearing off the e-commerce sites, banks blocking transfers to exchanges, exchanges shutting down once or twice, exchanges temporarily halting crypto withdrawals, and regulators grumbling about licenses and scams. Each time, another avenue for wider adoption in China was shut off. Each time, some idiot would scream "China's banning bitcoin!", and others would say, "yeah right."
Now here we are with what's shaping up to be a major blow to bitcoin in China, maybe the biggest so far, and about half of this sub still has their head in the sand, because they're "smart enough" to know that the "Chinaban" is just FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:33:32
I'm sorry, but anyone saying China is banning bitcoin is in another conversation altogether. The big boys are actually talking about whether the exchanges will be shuttered, and if so, why and for how long.

The NIFA statement is telling. It calls virtual currencies all kinds of names, blaming it for scams, market manipulation, money laundering and all kinds of bad stuff.
Such associations are not actual government departments, but they are semi-governmental in nature. This one appears to be an alliance of the policy banks and regulators, with a lot of overlap with the working group that pushed out the ICO ban.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:59:39
I don't know all the technical details behind it, but from what I've been told, there are a few reasons. First, all kinds of organizations regularly use VPNs for reasons other than circumventing censorship. If you just block everything that looks like a VPN, you'll ground commerce to a halt. Second, that signal isn't easy to distinguish from regular internet traffic. You need to actually analyze the data being sent in what's called deep packet inspection. It's just not feasible to do that for all internet traffic.

Last I checked, none of the bitcoin exchanges had licenses. A financial exchange license isn't something you can just walk into the office and fill out a form for.

Whoever wrote this is an idiot. This is an op-ed. There is no new information from the regulatory bodies, no policy declarations, not even a source, named or unnamed.
[Here is the original]( for anyone who wants a crack at it. It appears to be written by [this person]( an academic at a private (albeit influential) university.
But, but, xiefeilaga, it appeared on People.cn, a government mouthpiece! People's Daily is certainly a government mouthpiece, and People.cn is their site, but not everything they post is a policy statement. They're also a media company, and they at least try to turn a profit and stay relevant
Call me when an **unsigned** editorial about bitcoin appears on the pages of People's Daily, and not their finance news website.

Here's the original: 
It's an op-ed, apparently from this [Liu Xiaolei]( an academic at a private university. There are no quotes from officials and no official statements.
It is basically explaining the reasoning behind the ICO ban, and voicing support for tighter regulation of virtual currencies and exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:31:16
I read the Caixin article in the Chinese, and OP's link gets basically every single essential point about the article wrong. It says all the exchanges will be shut down temporarily, but bitcoin will not be banned outright.
They're also a trusted source for finance news. It's of course possible they got this wrong, but they're not fake news.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:03:14
Nothing conflicting: they want to shut down the exchanges, and fiat-virtual currency exchanges, but not bitcoin itself.

Again, though, not for fiat, at least according to Caixin's source. Also, most OTC outlets were shuttered in the first "ban" round. Before that, there were hundreds of sellers on taobao and other C2C sites offering bitcoin. Those are all gone or underground now.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:55:45
I haven't read the others, but the WSJ story claims they have their own sources. I know WSJ has been cutting back on their editors and fact checkers, but standard practice is to show your editor that you actually have a real source. Otherwise you just quote the Caixin article.
The only problem with the Caixin article so far is that the exchanges haven't been shut down yet.

First off, those stories are *news reports* that attempt to predict the future by analyzing recent policy statements and speaking to sources they deem close to the matter.
This is an *op-ed* in which the writer explains why she thinks the ICO ban was a good idea, and what she thinks should be done next. She makes no attempt to predict the future, no statement of policy, and never claims to know what will happen next.
She says, "Banning bitcoin is unrealistic and unfeasible. But stricter regulation of bitcoin and other crypto exchanges is entirely feasible and necessary." (取缔比特币既不现实也不可行。但是对比特币等加密货币的交易平台加强监管却是完全可行和必要的。)
This is the equivalent of a Wharton professor writing in to the Wall Street Journal to explain why he thinks it was good the Winkelvoss ETF didn't get approved.

I understand where you're going about getting tired of all the focus on Satoshi's vision, but the question is a valid one, because this approach was actually known and available at the time, unlike your examples in Ford's time.

Here's [my comment]( from the thread over on I don't have time to do a full translation, but here are a few remarks after tracking down the original article.
The original article, titled *"The Post-Bitcoin Era": Digital Currency Oversight on the Agenda*, appears to be an editorial by Yang Tao that first appeared on People's Daily, often considered a party mouthpiece.
The People's Daily often publishes unsigned editorials that most people view to be official party statements. The signed editorials, on the other hand, can take other, non-official stances, as long as they are within a range deemed agreeable by censors and officials.
Yang Tao seems to be a financial reporter who writes a lot about Bitcoin, with some of his previous articles appearing on People's Daily as well.
The article is not about un-banning bitcoin. It's about banks in the US and Europe looking into the use of blockchain technology as a protocol for transaction verification. It states that China may do well to look into this as well.
As we know, many big US banks are looking into blockchain tech, but they all seem to want to do it without bitcoin. Seeing all the qualifiers about money-laundering and instability in the original article, I'd say Yang Tao is raising this as a possibility for Chinese banks.
Don't go out and get a bunch of long positions because of this. If the central bank really were seriously considering a change in bitcoin policy, we would be seeing huge jumps in the Chinese market, because there's no way to keep it entirely under wraps. I'm seeing Chinese forums scratching their heads about this as well.
Also, the "Ma" that keeps turning up in your google translate links is 央妈, which roughly translates to "Mother Central." It seems to be a slang term for the central bank. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:07:20
If they can't fully evaluate the claims laid out, they should not make such declarations, plain and simple. BBC said "man revealed as Satoshi." Instead, they should have said, "man claims to be Satoshi, provides the following evidence," which is more or less what the Economist did.

It's not that they don't extradite, it's that they don't have a specific treaty covering extradition. China has definitely extradited quite a few Americans on the lamb. I have a feeling the lack of treaties for a lot of these countries is more about who they would want the US to extradite, and not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:14:52
Renewables can be cheaper sometimes, but definitely not always. The  classic case people like to cite is Chinese mining firms taking advantage of new renewable power sources (mostly wind, solar and hydro) in less-developed parts of China, with the idea that their presence is subsidizing the development of those types of power sources in places where it is currently under-utilized.
But also in China, tons of mining farms are feeding off coal power, often given favorable terms by other less-developed regions that want a boost in GDP and stats showing a growing high-tech sector.
The moral of the story is we need to read the studies closely, and be skeptical of people pushing simple arguments on either side.

Basically, the coinbase vault makes your coins safer from a hacker taking control of your account and stealing all your coins before you can act, and it also protects your coins from a hack against coinbase as a whole.
It won't protect you from coinbase going bankrupt or the feds seizing your coins for some reason. Only a wallet can do that.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:36:32
The surface reason is that you end up paying more than you would on an exchange for the convenience of buying on Coinbase.
But what most people are really talking about goes much deeper to the nature of bitcoin. A good analogy would be buying physical gold versus buying shares in a gold-denominated investment fund.
Bitcoin is designed as something that can't be taken away by corporate banks or manhandled by governments and central banks. This appeals to people who don't believe the fiat currency system is sound, or want to use it for more independence.
It is much like gold in this way. Many people who buy physical gold do so as a hedge against shit hitting the fan, reasoning that it will still be valuable if the dollar, or modern civilization, collapses.
When you buy from a company like coinbase, you are basically buying a promise from them to deliver bitcoins on demand at some future date. You're basically still banking.
You can still make money off bitcoin this way, but not really taking part in what makes bitcoin so compelling and revolutionary. It's much like investing in a gold fund, rather than buying physical gold. You might make money off the investment, but you don't get any of the benefits of having the actual gold in your hands.

This is not an official policy statement. Xiao is a lawyer on an advisory board for the people's bank, but she presents her statement as a personal analysis of the law as she understands it, and actually adds nothing we didn't already know: Bitcoin is legal to own in China, but trading platforms are not.
Her quotes only appear near the end of a long report on a massive Bitcoin fraud case, so anyone looking for positive sentiments in China should probably look elsewhere.
