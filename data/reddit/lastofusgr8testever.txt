Anyone going to comment on the idiocy of playing with a phone while driving?

Yeah but realistically it is going to settle and go back down at least some.  So if he sold his 20 then rebought BTC, maybe it would pay off.  20 dollars to buy nuggets, bad idea.
I actually find it crazy people use BTC to buy ANYTHING

I can’t speak on that one way or the other.  I would say the only reason it is worth anything is people say it is worth something and assigned a value.  But I admit I don’t know much about it despite owning BTC (Because I believe the value will still increase)

I believe he paid to have people murdered (or tried).  That is what really burned him.  But overall, RICO would have applied.

I would love if the prediction came true, but I highly doubt it does considering we can’t seem to make it over 11 without a drastic collapse shortly after

Noob here, can you explain why?  I have the Trezor one and it does fine, but I wouldn’t know any better...
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:30:30
Nice, this makes me feel a little better.

☝��can confirm

Just buy bitcoin with cash as soon as they give it to you and it ends up the same result.

40 Billion dollars current value.  Wow
@_date: 2019-09-07 11:30:55
Yeah, Coinbase pro is the key.

Got it.  Sorry, I am new to the crypto world.  Scares the hell out of me that all my crypto can vanish with a typo...
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:24:02
I vote for this one!!!

Is this true?  I thought most viruses in the beginning were accidental code breaks and the anti-virus fixed the code break.
But I don’t know anything so I am likely wrong lol
