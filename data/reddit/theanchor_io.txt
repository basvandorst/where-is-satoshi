Amazing approach, way to go. You should also teach how to hodl and invest. You never know what may come out of that piggy bank by the time he/she reaches legal age!

First of all congratulations on your first purchase. Your plan is not stupid and you shouldn't allow anyone to discourage you or talk you out of it. If you have already set your mind on doing certain things, see them through. Your strategy is basically called dollar cost average. In other words, just as you described, it's continuous investing with the same amount regardless of the price fluctuations. A lot of folks from the crypto world are proponents of this approach. Now that you have acquired some BTC, you want  to make sure it's stored properly and safely. Going for a cold wallet would be the best option currently. Ledger and Trezor are two of the largest manufacturers.  
No matter what you choose, best of luck to you.

Mind blowing observation. It's peculiar how come nobody is mentioning this.

This is quite an interesting theory. It's obvious you've done a fair share of research and that you are quite well informed. Do you believe David Chaum could be potential candidate? [Hal Finney]( had a rather positive comment  on him:  
 "Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more centralization - and [David Chaum]( offers a completely different direction to go in, one which puts power into the hands of individuals rather than governments and corporations. The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them."

Although it is still considered hot topic in many circles, at this point it doesn't really matter. Blockchain technology has been present for a decade now and it is already being implemented in many fields.

Great art! Depicts the current situation quite well.

It would be super cool if things played out just as demonstrated in this chart!

By the current looks of the chart, Fibonacci tool could come in handy in this situation.

It's always a good time to invest. Dollar cost average.

A bit different outlook - certain groups do not allow posting comments unless the account is older than 7 days for instance or having some minimum amount of karma. Those people are literally forced to wait for a specific time interval to pass or to post in some random groups just for the sake of collecting points. Therefore regardless of whether or not someone has something to state that might contribute, he/she might find this frustrating enough and simply leave.
