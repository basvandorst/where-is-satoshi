Ok I think I'm starting to understand this. So the reason you lose your coins if your cellphone or computer crashes is because it's on an app like Coinomi where you don't have the private keys right? So when the phone dies you can't just download Coinomi on another device and recover the wallet? 
But that problem isn't on a paper wallet because you have the private keys. 
I'm trying to Google and read on this but I'm very new and it's hard to grasp. Thanks for your help though
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:02:46
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:41:30
Yessss. So glad I bought in earlier this week at 4100$ CAD. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:45:34
Hey everyone, I'm new to Bitcoin and I'm wondering about fees. I wanted to transfer coins from my exchange to a paper wallet but the transaction fee is like 0.00042000btc or 2-3$ CAD. That seems like a high fee just to move some BTC. Are fees fixed or can I expect lower fees in the future?
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:17:09
Ok thanks for the advice! So I transferred to Coinomi for no reason then T-T fuck
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:26:32
Yeah I'm not a fan of the brain wallet idea. I don't trust myself and I want my GF or family to be able to access the funds if something happens to me. I'll most likely generate the wallets offline, print them and then store them in 2-3 copies in a safe at home. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:03:37
Thank you for your answer. No clue why I'm being downvoted.... This sub can be weirdly toxic sometimes
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:49:05
Hey! Thanks for the advice. So I have a question. I bought ETC, LTC and BTC on Coinbase. I transferred most of it to Coinomi after the fact. My question is. Is there a way to avoid fees? I got raped almost 4% on buying and then I also got a fee when transferring from coinbase to Coinomi. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:56:53
Same for CAD!!! 
No brakes on this train.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:14:19
Is that 10% something you wouldn't mind throwing down a ditch? Because if the answer is yes then good.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:25:07
That's a good way to see it actually! I'm currently trying to make myself a paper wallet. I think it's a good way to store your coins. Only thing that bothers me is that it's a bit complicated to get your coins out of the paper wallet after. Most exchange don't let you use your own private key to import funds. You need to find a live wallet that let's you do that and I haven't found a good one yet. Open to suggestions
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:13:09
I made a mistake. I bought ETH. Not ETC. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:24:39
I'm praying for a crash/correction anytime so I can buy big and sit back and enjoy the ride back up.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:38:07
I mean... That's still 60$ish... And I'm buying every paycheck. Is it weird to not buy hundreds of dollars worth??
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:58:34
It's going there my dude.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:57:22
Just surpassed 5000$ here in Canada
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:05:39
Currently at 4,400$ CAD 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:35:50
Just my 2c but make sure you're aware that that money could be lost forever. Only throw in what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:51:16
I don't know it's different for me since I'm in Canada. I'm in a bit of a pickle right now because I trade and on QuadrigaCX but Coinbase is the fastest and easiest way for my to buy with the credit card payment. 
Only caveat is they're charging 4% per transaction sooooo I'm getting a bit of a shakedown. No other way for my at the moment. Best way would be a bank transfer to QuadrigaCX but they don't accept my bank so I'm fucked on that front. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:56:32
Stop I can only get so hard.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:39:10
OMG I didn't know Newegg took bitcoins. I know how I'm funding my next rig. Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:47:53
Well yeah it's pretty annoying but I'm sure it will get better with time. I prefer the ease of use of an exchange for now.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:09:53
Good! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:33:56
My unqualified advice to you would be to hold that Bitcoin but to start DCAing other coins. Like putting 20$ every paycheck in ETH or whatever other up and coming coin you want to invest in. Diversifying your portfolio. I'm currently DCAing LTC, BTC and ETH 
Edit : I meant Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:50:54
So where are the coins? Are they on the computer where I create the paper wallet? If this computer dies I lose the coins? Sorry if this is a dumb question
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:26:41
Why did coinbase close your account? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:44:46
Ah alright thanks! 
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:24:22
Great post OP. I'm just started investing in BTC a few days ago. I'm pledging to buy 50$+fees every two weeks (paycheck) whatever the Bitcoin price. I have to control myself and not spend all day monitoring prices though. I have to learn to just let it go. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:42:15
I laughed 
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:23:42
The moon /s
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:13:39
Ok cool thanks! So I guess the best way would be to generate 10 paper wallets or so on bitaddress and chuck sizable amounts of bitcoins in each when I want to get some off the exchange but only do one transaction by paper wallet. They'll become like little Bitcoin gift cards. Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:19:23
Gotcha thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:37:13
Hi , Bitcoin noob here. Can someone tell me if this will be compatible/affect my coinbase and my Coinomi? I have currency on both. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:31:22
Congratulations! I hope the market goes well for you. I'm I started buying Bitcoin for the first time this week. I'm doing another strategy though. I bought 150$ CAD upfront when it was 4000$CAD and now I'm DCAing with a 50$ every paycheck going for Bitcoin. 
Have fun and may the odds be with us. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:22:55
Thanks for the heads up. I entered! 
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:42:33
I checked and there seems to be a fee. So I'll leave my stuff in coinbase until I have more and the transfer fee is mitigated. But thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:34:44
Made me chuckle. I was lucky to buy at 4000$ CAD earlier this week. Now it's soaring st 4700$ CAD 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:27:29
Yeah that's what I've been thinking but everyone here seems to be screaming at me to get it off the exchange ASAP. I mean.... I will transfer some to a mobile wallet sometime but not while I'm trading. 
Got any good ones for me? Is Coinomi any good?
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:51:41
My first fraction of a BTC. Sorry if that wasn't clear. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:00:04
Good luck on your ventures. I bought my first 0.012 2 days ago and I'm already getting a return on my investment. Have fun.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:56:10
That's what I figured too. Only invest what you can afford to lose and I'm not about to throw in 4000$ just like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:38:12
I just transferred all my coins over there and I submitted my verification form! Hopefully it doesn't take too long. The fees seem low so I'm happy with that. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:57:51
Good point 
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:20:02
Thanks for the tip! I was interested in doing so but wasn't sure where to start. Are there fees to transfer my coins to the wallet and then back the the exchange later? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:11:49
Good thing you can always divide it
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:12:16
Can you help me with this. I have 100$ worth of BTC and I like to trade. Why would I pay fees and therefore lose money to ping pong my money to and from a wallet and exchange? Why am I not better leaving it in the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:19:04
I see you're using the PRICE THREAD that is stickied on the front page of this subreddit... 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:46:26
Yeah I know. Just very new to this thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:00:34
If you're going to be toxic please don't post on this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:26:53
What funding method are you using. 5 days seems long. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:19:18
I'm in the same boat as you. I want to get my coins off of coinbase to a paper wallet but I let them there for now because I can't justify losing all my profit through fees. So I'm waiting until I have more coins to move or the fees lower.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:34:14
Actually it depends. If youre someone who wants to trade often you're better keeping it on the exchange. Because ping ponging your funds between a wallet and an exchange will eat you away in fees. Also a wallet is as secure as the person who uses it/owns it makes it out to be. You could have your coins on coinbase and never run into a problem but have your coins in a hardware wallet and lose them to a dumb mistake. Both options are valid depends on what you want to do
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:37:27
I recommend QuadrigaCX if you're Canadian and Coinbase if you're from the USA. 
I'd keep a small amount of Bitcoin on the exchange just for trading purposes and transfer the rest to a mobile wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:37:56
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:35:53
I laughed 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:11:47
That's what I meant. I meant Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:07:19
What if 300 years down the line all the coins are lost? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:42:00
I bought 0.012 yesterday. Couldn't afford more and it was my first time. I'm hoping for more in the future
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:50:33
Thanks for the info! If I go on bitaddress and generate multiple wallets they're all different ones right? If I add to the public address of one of them it's on that one only and not any other? 
Can I add bitcoins on a weekly basis to the same wallet using the same public address? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:54:08
Yep it's been worth 2/3 of the USD for abiut 2-3 years now... We're getting raped 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:56:08
I used coinbase (I'm in Canada) coinbase has a very nice UI and it let's you buy Ethereum , Litecoin and Bitcoin at the same place and it doubled as a wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:25:22
Not the original commenter but I keep it on the exchange to avoid fees. I trade a lot and I would be chipping away my Bitcoin with fee if I kept ping ponging it between a wallet and an exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:57:46
Just breached 5000$ CAD
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:46:05
I wasn't into crypto back then but the price boomed this weekend. So there's bound to be a correction soon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:01:02
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:10:27
Not at all. Think what you will
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:03
You can own and exchange any portion of a Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:53:37
Depends where you buy but usually yes you'll pay more in fees if you buy smaller amounts 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:40
It sure is! You can buy any amount you want. You can buy 50$ worth of Bitcoin if you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:05:56
Look up Coinbase. It's the biggest marketplace/exchange for the USA
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:22:51
Bitcoins are worthless? Smh... they're worth more than they have ever been worth.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:23:51
You can buy anything you want with Bitcoin. It's a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:28
It's actually quite stable. It's rising fairly quickly lately but there's no big ups and down. Steady rise as more people adopt it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:07:57
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:47:45
It's not really recent. It's been rising steadily from 3000$ to 10,000$ for the past 4-5 months 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:59:48
You clearly don't know what you're talking about. Enlighten us oh wise being.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:57:07
It's easy as that yes. You sell on an exchange and you can withdraw the money into your bank account easily.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:18
I hope you're joking. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:01:15
Just buy a fraction
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:20:34
What do you mean?

If you're in the USA go to Coinbase.com and of you're in Canada go to QuadrigaCX.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:14
Bitcoin isn't "nothing though" like any other currency it's a tangible assets in limited quantity to which we've assigned a value. Like the US dollar. Like the Canadian dollar so on and so forth. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:25
Bitcoin is not a scam and spreading this misinformation is being against progress.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:15:28
First off, you're not very polite and second off, you can buy a bunch of stuff with Bitcoin. It's accepted most notably on Steam and on Newegg so you can buy computer parts and games.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:44
You're just saying nonsense for fun. Cool.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:58:18
People have already made profit and continue to make profit. At one point you gotta realize there's something here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:32:08
You are able to cash out though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:09
My tip to you : invest 50$. It's small enough that you won't be afraid to lose it and big enough that you'll have some skin in the game :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:28:57
You can do it. You can literally cash out whenever you like. You'll have to pay taxes on gains obviously but that's normal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:54:37
Dang that's random as fuck. Check pirate bay my dude.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:56
You can invest any amount you'd like. You can buy 25$ of Bitcoin if you want.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:03:22
I'm in a TSFA, Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:15:04
Not gonna answer to your buzzword my dude.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:24:23
I could literally take all my money out right now and sit on a nice profit. Nothing is stopping me doing that. Don't know where the scam is.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:19
Nice! Well done.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:23:24
Literally anyone. How do you think this works?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:51
^ that. Crazy how people are ignorant. You can easily spend Bitcoin and worst case you can convert it to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:09:04
I'd suggest reading the sidebar. Lots of info to sift through
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:07:44
Ooorrrrr it never goes back under 9K and you kick yourself for selling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:58
Please stop spreading literal garbage lies and educate yourself sir.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:07:14
It's not based on speculation though. It's based on offer and demand and tangible infrastructure. No speculation here my dude. Also Bitcoin has has tons of bad press in the past and it never made a dent in the price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:15
There are a bunch of other things you can buy and if that's not to your liking you can convert back your earnings in US money and spend it how you like. Not sure what you don't get here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:00:03
Fellow Canadian here. We're way ahead :p
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:20
You keep all your money in cash? You don't have any money in a bank account? You think that money is stored physically somewhere? lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:19:50
A bubble that has been developing and rising since 2009... Mmmh. Also you can buy stuff with Bitcoin so quit fooling yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:42:40
Just my advice but don't put more than you're willing to lose. Bitcoin has been going up since 2009 but nothing guarantees it won't plummet to death a couple years from now. Invest safely and intelligently.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:15:56
For sure. Dollar cost averaging still best option.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:34:05
Bitcoin is not a ponzi. Tell me exactly how that works.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:56
Don't just say shit. Explain to us why you think it's a fraud. You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:48:52
Please explain to me how exchanges will go bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:56:47
The goal long term is to not have to trade it for fiat. But that's not the case for now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:17:31
Wise words haha.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:06
Not sure if you're serious but you should read up on the subject instead of saying that. Why would you even say that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:15
Wait what. Explain to me how that works.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:53
You can buy literally anything you want with Bitcoin. Bitcoin debit cards are a thing and a lot of stores and online stores accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:30:07
Bitcoin is rising in value because of supply and demand. There is a limited amount of Bitcoin. There isn't an infinite amount of Bitcoin so when more people buy Bitcoin it reduces the available pool and the value rises. There are also other factors.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:55:54
Coinbase is not a wallet. It is an exchange and they do offer a wallet but people recommend having your own wallet. Coinbase is a good place to start though. It's the biggest and most trusted exchange available at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:26:42
Not really because mining is becoming more and more difficult and inneficient. There are calculators out there but for the average joe mining is not profitable anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:57:41
It is actually! For now it's not at the point where you can do everyday transaction but the eventual goal is that yes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:44
Malware scam. You're so funny. ����Have fun thinking that while I'm making profit and supporting the future of currency
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:28:09
I'm on mobile but you can google something like "places that accept Bitcoin". Most notably Steam and Newegg accept it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:46
You can buy what you want and you can exchange it for fiat
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:42
Wouldn't you say the same about any investment ever?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:34
You're not dumb! Crypto currency is complex.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:52:11
I recommend reading the sidebar. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:28:06
Everyone who actually knows about investments and about markets knows that there is always a possibility of a total crash. No one is denying that. You take your risk and you don't invest more than you're willing to lose. That's it.
