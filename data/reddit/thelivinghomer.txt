Most likely Google targeting based on history. Still cool though.

This was just under apps. Bitcoin Billionaire was under the games though.

Where in New York do you live?

Dwolla. In remember when that was relevant.

Which surface book is that?

Why do you say this?

Bitcoinwisdom.com is what I use.

Mt.Gox is at $319 right now and BitStamp is at $289.50

And now they're dropping below $105. I don't get why people wouldn't just keep buying. They have no confidence.

It just amazes me how they wouldnt figure out a way to do it. That's just bad business people involved.

They should be selling higher, not lower. Unless there is little demand for it which it seems to be. Now is the time to buy them since they're less to buy today. Why did prices skyrocket before but stay even now? There hasn't been a DDoS attack and Silkroad is back up.

I bought at $185 and sold for $235. Okay profit but I'm waiting to see if it slumps again.

Bitcoin trades are under 50% not Litecoin. I'm saying wont Litecoin be affected by this if Mt.Gox isn't doing as well as it once did.

I still have this on the website though:
Trading is halted until 2013-04-12 02:00am UTC to allow the market to cooldown following the drop in price. Read more details on the support. Additionally trading fees will not be charged within 48 hours of trading resuming (until 2013-04-14 02:00am UTC).
