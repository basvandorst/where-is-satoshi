Maybe something like this:

Fair enough.

For me, it is not at all certain that the same situation has to repeat itself in the future, if we rise the block limit and keep it fixed.  In principle it is not impossible that in the meantime someone will come up with a different solution to the problem and this one increase in retrospect will be regarded as simply buying some necessary time.

I don't think it would be a better poll.  The choice between a small increase and a large one is the matter of how you would implement a particular solution to this engineering problem after you have decided that the limit should be raised.  So you try to answer two questions at the same time which is what a poll should always avoid, I think.  Imagine your opinion is that the limit should stay as it is, but 20MB is better than 4MB, in case it was going to be be raised. You are convinced that the overwhelming majority wants to raise the limit, and you want your vote to have some significance.  So you vote for 20MB, even when you are against the whole idea anyway.

Even if this is true, it is far from making a poll like this pointless.  Because a poll asks a yes/no question, it doesn't mean it gives an answer to a yes/no question.

This is just for fun.  I want to see, what the majority of this reddit community would vote for. It is not intended to settle with such crude means that important and delicate discussion going on.
And yes, this is a throw-away account.

This is true beyond any doubt.

Then it is not a poll, but an entry exam.  It is not democratic ~~consensus~~, if uninformed votes are not allowed.  The task of the informed is to educate the rest and convice them in the open debate that a specific choice is good for them.
