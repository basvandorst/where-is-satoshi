I am buying not selling, do I still need more than 0.4BTC? And thanks it maybe the second reason.
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:27:32
I don't want to sell only 5 quid yet just wanted to transfer it back to localbitcoins for a test. I'm just transferring to see how it all works and what fees are put on. The blockchain link to my bitcoin wallet:

Cheers BobAlison and Jackten that seemed to be it! Also do you guys know of any better place to sell BTC apart from localbitcoins.
Dskloet why is it not a good idea to store bitcoins on localbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:54:36
I've seen other offers below £50 though.
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:48:55
Made me chuckle
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:16:25
They've not told me which if the annoying part, when I ask them they say that they are not obligated to provide any extra information. Super annoying!
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:05:03
Ahhh I heard about this, problem is I've also heard a lot of horror stories of people having their accounts closed with Barclays due to crypto :/ very conflicting 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:20:48
Ahh brilliant so instantaneous UK bank transfers then?
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:15:13
Ahhh nice, thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:36:57
Ahh awesome to hear, yeah I was thinking about starting to use them. If you don't mind me asking, what volumes are you trading and how long have you been doing it for?
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:04:37
Thanks for the list! I'll take a look at each one :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:17:32
Ahh brilliant cheers for ask the useful information. Will definitely take a look at Barclays and fidor!
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:06:32
Thanks for the info mate :) I've been using localbitcoins for years though and due to the rep I've gained on the site I can get cheap BTC unlike elsewhere. I'll take into account what you've said though!
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:37:41
Brilliant, cheers mate!
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:04:42
Brilliant thanks for all your help pal!
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:51:45
Hmm ok thanks for clarifying! I may have a look into Revolut. Have you ever done any outbound payments to another UK bank account (not a business account)? If so is it instantaneous too or does it take a few hours?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:38:13
I know about this, I study computer science and it really upsets me to see we are so far behind :(
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:40:56
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:43:14
I was looking into that. I've heard however that bank transfer times take about 2 hours to other UK banks. Is this true? Or is it quicker?
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:46:20
Ahh brilliant, thanks for the advice pal!
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:42:48
Ahhh brilliant, Barclays is looking very hopeful! Will definitely have to give them a ring. Thanks so much for the info and the advice to steer clear from HSBC. Very useful information, especially since you've been on the platform for so long. What's your username on LBC out of curiosity?
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:59:36
Oooo nice how does it work?
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:47:10
Yeah I guessed that those were the issues :/ I can prove all my transactions with receipts though! Anyways thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:19:15
Is bitbargain good for selling? Was thinking of using it but wasn't sure how popular it was
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:19:39
Brilliant, cheers! I'll check them out
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:52:23
Oh wow thats loads! I might give it a go then. Also last question, have you ever told Barclays about the trading? If so how did they respond? Did they ever ask you about the large transactions coming in and out of your account?
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:04:06
Thanks for your reply pal. I appreciate that you don't want to enclose any specifics and am thankful for the info you've provided :) I'm hopeful that HSBC are quite relaxed about cryptos! Cheers again!
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:09:32
Ahh ok, awesome. Yeah I wouldn't be going over that limit. Thanks for all your help mate 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:38:20
Ahh neat, I'll have to look into that!
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:38:49
I know right! My thoughts exactly, it's pretty ridiculous...
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:05:33
Is that their business account offering?
