That's a vague question.
They ship less first class mail today than in 1990 but they also charge more for it now, and have decreased costs related to delivery.

Coinbase would blame the retailer, while they're the ones converting the dollars amounts into bitcoin, meaning THEY returned a BCash quantitity valued at BTC prices.
If it was just that Overstock put in the wrong "currency" Coinbase should have shown a BCash quantity reflecting the BCash value, not the BTC value.
Given that overstock has accepted BTC for over a year now, clearly Coinbase changed something and did not provide adequate customer service to ensure THEIR clients understand the changes Coinbase made on their backend.
One would think someone at coinbase would review their BIGGEST client and notice the blaring issue.

Biggest issue is timing rather than fees as such.
Retailers want you to complete your payment in 15 minutes or the offer resets.
I use Purse.io which allows me to transfer the BTC first at whatever fee I want to pay, upon arrival i can make selections from Amazon which uses of purse then fulfill in exchange for the Bitcoin.

Pathetic situation for a conference with Bitcoin in the name. I paid three years ago with Bitcoin to get in but now there complaining about network connecting?
Do these people work for BCash? Screw this conference. They've increased the price 5x in less years and what exactly are they contributing to the community if they can't even get this one aspect together.

Due to current fees the issue is mostly that unless they're charging you at penalty exchange rate, or asking you to cover the transaction fee, you may not get the Bitcoin quickly.
So as others said make sure you have order confirmation before you hand over the money, and this requires making sure they pay a high fee to have the transaction confirm before you leave the coffee shop.

If they want it bad enough they'll find ways to get it.
If they can't get it because some exchange hasn't approved them yet that's not a very strong demand.

I've been wanting to buy a few items from newegg, and yesterday I was on the verge of making a small purchase (despite the dip in the purchasing power of BTC) but when it came time to send the BTC I checked the current transaction fees and it was more than 10% of my purchase!
Other than occasional purchases I'm a hodler, but I can't make any purchases at these tx fees!
any thoughts, comments?

With transaction fees so high, it also means that fewer of the desired transactions get completed.
With the ledger essentially backlogged how the hell are exchanges calculating price changes?
How can the price drop hundreds of dollars now if all the transactions being processed now are from when the price was higher a few minute ago?
i find the price discovery mechanism in these exchanges very suspicious

@_date: 2017-12-28 16:28:17
If I understand correctly you have to read the fine print of the contract for any particular exchange to see what guarantees they make as to the service they actually provide.
I've read speculating though not confirmation that none of the exchange accounts are wallets. They display virtual BTC you can hypothetically acquire from a centralized system if you migrate but otherwise you don't ever own any actual crypto as long as you're using a Central exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:30

On this I agree, however I think solutions will come soon.
As a "store of value" proposition alone BTC will continue to grow because it can do it better than pretty much any other store of value. Think of how many people buy art as a way to store value, and it's a lot more complicated and expensive to buy and transfer art than it is with BTC.
An insistence or expectation that BTC must be money, and as easy to use as FIAT seems to me to miss what's already there.
Like with all quality of life changing technologies to wealthy and well positioned will always have first dibs. It isn't fair, but it's the reality of our economic organization.
So what I'm saying is that as is BTC is worth a lot more than the current price, and once they figure out micro transactions it will be worth many times more still
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:44:10
How long has their support stonewalled you?
If the Amazon order got cancelled today, but you had the BTC in your account to withdraw it sounds like that went as supposed to.
If that happened today and you attempted withdrawal shouldn't it take a few days before your bank would receive a deposit?

@_date: 2017-12-28 16:41:18
Sometimes people sell thousands of Bitcoin in one go.
One can only imagine the price shock that would cause.
But 30 coin sales don't seem as much like manipulation as profit taking.
Could you by chance see the transaction fees on those sales? Or whether they even happened?
They're paying high fees the last week to make these sales, or something is even fishier.
I'm still trying to figure out the relationship between price and transaction confirmation time/fee.
With too low a fee a transaction never gets confirmed, however under the right circumstances this potential transaction could get marked down for purposes of calculating a display price.
For instance, someone could put a large sell order but send the coin with such low fees that those transactions never confirm, meanwhile the rest of the market moves down with Joe Shaky-legs fear-selling but paying exorbitant transaction fees.
Someone please fix my logic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:39

I think I'd rather lose their interest than make a compromise for the sake of mass adoption.

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:21:39
At this point I'm trying to get my mind around the propensity for transactions to get ignored, ultimately dropped altogether. If thousands of transactions keep adding at higher fees won't the tens of thousands of other transactions fail?

"Overall view"
Having read the other responses to the post I think this covers it overall.
The current drama is because Roger made a snide comment about Andreas' personal financial investment in Bitcoin. There's nothing disputed about that to the point that Roger takes credit for Andreas now being a millionaire.

I have some experience purchasing things with Bitcoin and these types of retailers.
I use Samourai wallet however it's in alpha, I can't recommend it. Use wallets at your own risk.
You don't need to transfer BTC to a wallet then Newegg. I think you can send the Bitcoin directly from your exchange to Newegg, hypothetically.
You may not want to do this for many reasons.
A big issue with making a purchase is that they want to receive the BTC within 15 minutes, which necessitates you pay a late fee to get the transaction through in time.
I suggest doing more research. Many generally suggest moving all your coin to private wallets and not to leave them in exchange.
To acquire retail items I suggest looking in to purse.io which I used successfully to get a book, but I've read about few scams. The escrow system should bypass the risk of scam.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:55:34
The only person you should reveal you have BTC is the person buying them in exchange for the local currency. You shouldn't ever tell them how much you have. And you should most definitely research the person before you meet in person. Ensure you have enough info collected in case you go missing after meeting with them.
Also, if you're a BTC millionaire you should know better than to keep large quantities on a wallet that you're carrying around with you.

@_date: 2017-12-18 15:07:13
I still don't understand how there are multiple sides of historical fact.
The only other thing they could do would involve reading Roger's tweet in which he States that if Andreas has invested even $100 in 2013 he'd have a bunch of money now...
This isn't about sides. That's literally what happened.

If you are a business person in Argentina you could use bitcoins to get local cash to purchase things in country. The bitcoins could come from foreign investments which can be transmitted online.

I'll join the chorus of people seeking proof of your claims.
It would have been preferable if you didn't tell us they sent you out to the doldrums for your efforts. Or if instead of telling us your personal story you just stuck to the facts of why bitcoin is a game changer.
Instead you give us a personal anecdote, and allude to the "facts of your report" which argue bitcoin is a game changer. But you don't give us any details about how it changes the game.
So rather than call the post a fake::
TL:DR= Tell us some actual details about HOW bitcoin is a game changer and leave the argument from authority (ooo, the feds are scared!!) in the original post.
WHY is Bitcoin a Game Changer? give us details and numbers, not allusions and condescension.
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:09:06
I imagine bitcoin evolution will be punctuated. Many, like me, are awaiting certain circumstances.
Must consider that buying bitcoins isn't an option for working class who can't invest anything and live paycheck to paycheck.
Entrepreneurs depend on fiat for purchasing and credit cards, etc.
I'm hoping to start a business which will accept btc soon, however I will rely on something like Bitpay because I need the fiat ASAP to pay for merchandise the company will purchase from companies that do not accept BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-03 21:51:19
I'm starting a business and want to allow customers to pay with BTC if they have them. I plan to use bitpay to process and their integration with braintree to process transactions. I don't know if this will result in money deposited in to my account showing up as having been serviced by braintree rather than bitpay.
Will be looking in to this shortly.
@_date: 2014-09-03 23:21:51
why would a credit union care where you're spending your money?
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:23:20
Dumb it down?
Um...sorry, but argument from authority is about as dumb as it gets.
"I'm an authority figure, I say X, therefore X is true"
Sorry, but I don't take that from anyone.
I know why I think bitcoin is a game changer, but someone with an economics/banking/finance/research background SHOULD NOT be allowed to call something a game changer and not explain WHY they believe that.
But thanks for you input, that was really enlightening.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:02:48
I am starting a business and want to integrate btc from the get-go.
The nature of my industry requires that I transfer most BTC i receive in to fiat immediately to pay off the materials we will buy, and my business partner would not accept payment in BTC. I am willing to take my own profit/income in BTC.
I've been told bitpay is the way for us to go.
Can anyone comment on that, or have any experience with it?
And what about taxes and reporting? How does that work out? I'm in the state of Florida
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:19:14
the industry I am in does not use any of the supported shopping carts for their POS services.
I imagine that adds some level of difficulty.
One of the services we're considering does come with an API, but I don't know if that has functionality to create invoices.
What should I look in to to understand what I should do next? Or should I jump the gun and just start talking to bitpay?

from what I see the problem is that there isn't a vibrant bitcoin commerce community that is actively helping good businesses which are accepting bitcoin.
most people using bitcoin still regularly use cash for most of their purchases.

Though you don't state explicitly, you highlight the importance of GOOD statistics. Understanding usage trends for BTC has use for entrepreneurs interested in targeting future business towards BTC users.

The idea that bystanders view BTC stability in $$ is problematic in many ways. While BTC may fall compared to dollar, it doesn't get its value from dollars, and certainly being dependent on dollar valuations are a hindrance, if anything, to the adoption and stability of btc.

Right now I have no fiat and no bitcoin. I have bitcoin wallet. I have time, physical capability, some meager talents.
Tell me how I can acquire bitcoin so that I can thereafter not use fiat anymore.
Also, how did you acquire your btc? if you mined it how did you acquire your hardware?
surely you STARTED with some measure of FIAT. That along with early adopter status...

These are the show notes for the Unchained podcast. Listen to my whole interview with Kathryn here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio.
The first time federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun heard about Bitcoin was when someone asked her if she’d like to prosecute it.
The assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice in San Francisco, who had previously focused on organized crime, prison gangs and murders, very quickly realized that wouldn’t be possible — that it would be like “trying to prosecute cash,” but it set her off on a path of discovery. She is now also DOJ’s digital currency coordinator, teaches Stanford Law School’s first class on digital currency and cybercrime, and, last year, put away two federal agents who tried to steal more than $800,000 in bitcoin.

In the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio), Haun, who was on my show in her personal, not professional capacity, tells the tale of how she unraveled that case — which begins with her being tipped off by an investigative journalist about one of those agents. “When the tip is, ‘You’ve got a dirty agent on your payroll,’ you’ve got to take it with a grain of salt,” she says. “I thought I had to put this, what I called, rumor to rest. So when I started looking into this matter, I was doing it from the perspective of, I want to clear this person’s name, but I quickly learned that wasn’t going to be the result.”

So when I started looking into this matter, I was doing it from the perspective of, I want to clear this person’s name, but I quickly learned that wasn’t going to be the result.”
She describes how she uncovered what were actually “the perfect criminals” — being federal agents, “they knew how to cover their tracks,” she says. Tune in to find out how she was able to follow the bitcoins, how tracking those patterns revealed to her that there were two dirty federal agents, not one, and what telling detail led her to suspect the second must also be a federal agent.
We dive into trends among, or common characteristics of, cryptocurrency criminals — Russian email addresses is one — and why some newer technologies called tumblers and mixers, which attempt to obscure the trail of bitcoins as they travel from bitcoin address to bitcoin address, could be unscrambled. She also tells us what she does when the people who created those technologies become the victims of crimes themselves and come to her.
However, Haun knows full well Bitcoin and blockchain technology aren’t all about crime anymore than cash is. She discusses many of the ways such technology can be used for good, particularly when it comes to fraud. In particular, she thinks it would be particularly revolutionary in the area of public records. “Of all the kinds of cases that I’ve ever done, whether you’re talking about the Hell’s Angels, marriage fraud, the bank officer I prosecuted for impersonating dead people or the criminals I’ve prosecuted using cryptocurrency, they all have one thing in common: there’s always been, somewhere along the way, a forged, counterfeit or stolen public document — even a murder case I tried,” she says.
Shockingly, she also notes that, in the United States, more than 6,500 entities can issue birth certificates on 14,000 different types of forms, making it easy to counterfeit a birth certificate. “We call these ‘breeder documents’ — because they quite literally breed new identities,” she says. “You get a forged, fake or stolen birth certificate and a name, and you take that down to the DMV and you get your photo taken with that, and now you all of a sudden also have a driver’s license. You take the driver’s license and birth certificate to the passport office and now you’ve gotten yourself a passport. And all of a sudden, with these three kind of identity documents, the sky’s the limit on what kind of criminal activity you could do — you could file for fraudulent benefits from the government, you could commit some kind a terrorist offense, you could purchase weapons, you could traffic in people, you could obviously commit drug smuggling.”
Another problem she sees in public records is that they are kept in centralized databases, which are subject to tampering. For instance, in 2008, the city of San Francisco’s network administrator became disgruntled and changed all the admin passwords and held all the records hostage.
Listen to the full episode of Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio) to find out Haun’s opinion on the latest cryptocurrency Zcash, which can be as private as cash, rather than public like Bitcoin, and what ethical questions it raises for her. “Is there a percentage that you’re comfortable with, as a developer, where your technology is being used more for harm than good? Do you think about those questions?” she asks.

Just to push a point. These people don't like the idea of tipping. Turning a sticker in to a "nudge" is an effort of angry people with some internal damage they project on to others.

"More scarce than gold"
A rather grand claim.
If the blockchain had a billion nodes would we still make this claim?
Inflation and divisibility argue against the claim. At some point the cost of dividing gold renders it useless. For example we measure gold in grams and ounces, we don't tend to collect it by the penny's worth.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, does suffer the transaction fee, but market pressures encourage us to constantly address the divisibility issue. Lightning network provides one example, but also further complicates things because you cannot necessarily convert tokens in a lightning network to actual bitcoin
But sometimes we can't turn off-network money like checks, or store credits, to US dollars immediately either. Many banks charge people for the service of converting their proprietary off-network money back in to legal tender.

Coinbase charges a fee based on the quantity of bitoin you purchase, at $15 it's 1%.
The amount the fellow in Medellin was willing to pay for bitcoin was never the same as the amount Coinbase wanted for bitcoin at any one time. Usually to me detriment since he was then selling those bitcoins to Colombians at about a 12% markup (go figure).
I however didn't buy all bitcoin at one time, and instead acquired them over time to hedge against these differences, and it definitely worked out over-all, but not entirely. Stayed well below losing 12% purchasing power, but it seemed I'd lose about 4-8% if I did an immediate purchase and transfer, instead of this vague strategy I just laid out.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:18:56
That's all you can say?
Wow, talk about a bunch of worry-worts. Maybe the person I'm going to meet will come with a knife, or a gun, but then they have to shoot or stab me, and they don't get anything except perhaps my phone...
but that's why I'd meet this person in public.
and the twitter search as for someone who had already done such a thing, I only used that person's contact in Medellin.
I can always use localbitcoins...if this person turns out to be a bandit of some kind.

@_date: 2016-07-25 18:43:18
A few important conclusions from the ruling:
on the first count of running a money services business the judge contrasted defendant to a company like Western Union, noted that bitcoin do not fall under statutory definition of "payment instrument", and finally that earning a profit is not the same as charging a fee for transmitting money.
At least on one point if the states or federal government changed the definition of payment instrument it could increase the force of the prosecutor's case.
In regards to counts II &amp; III the judge specified that the Defendant did not "promote" the illicit acitivites described by the detectives, and expressed concern wheter a higher court would likewise choose a definition for "promotion" so "individuals who believe their conduct is legal are not arrested."
