If you advocate freedom of speech, you will agree that their opinion matters just as much as yours does.

MTsa2019,  There are many places in the world that allow freedom of speech. Canada is one of them Perhaps you've heard of them? they're north from the USA
The United kingdom is a collection of countries that advocate freedom of speech. Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and of course, everybody's favourite, England, the country where the queen of England lives. She's a very nice lady and she tries to solve at least one of the world's problems before Christmas where she gets to talk to everybody on the telly.
these are but a few of the countries. there are many more. Some of them don't even speak English! (imagine that! no english? It's true!)

@_date: 2019-07-13 04:28:27
MT,  (may i call you MT?)  Why do you think those laws exist?
you know, being racist.. Sending correspondence with the intent to cause distress.. Speaking negatively of the state on a wide scale to incite a lowering of national morale?
Why do you think that's a rule not to do it?
I mean, it's common sense, to any decent human being not to do these things.. but, you know..  some people need to be told not to do it. yknow?
let's say you're a big shot twitter guy and you tell everyone the prime minister is a pedo. People might start believing it.  fck, lets say this big shot twitter guy says some random normal average british bloke who works in his local tesco is a pedo. There would be a witch hunt. The mans life could be destroyed. For no reason. It's a law so that you can sue someone for slandering your good name.
There are rules in place for all sorts of reasons. and yes, laws can be shitty, but that's why we are allowed to speak out about them and have them changed.
Dont like a law? write to your local MP if he agrees he might take it to the house of commons where they argue about all sorts of things.
If freedom of speech allows a person to call someone the hard N word with impunity   or allows somebody on a large scale to go around advocating that the government is shit and needs to be overthrown (with the intent to incite riot or panic?)  I mean, if this is the case? i don't want freedom of speech..  you can Bing Bong all the way to china with it for all i care, MT.
Small sidenote,
Ireland is not part of the UK.  It is a completely separate entity from Northern Ireland. The south of Ireland make their own laws. And it's actually pretty scary because they have a lot of gun trafficking problems.
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:11:47
This is futile, i can see you are serious now and it deeply saddens me.
It's 5:51am. It's not like any of this is going to change your mind, but for MY sanity. i'm going to respond. because there's just so many holes with your response i'm COMPELLED.
point  I was describing the united kingdom. Not china. You deflected that whole statement with an irrelevant fact.
point  An investigation would also occur in the UK likely with the same outcome as you described.
point  the rules are exactly the same in the USA. If you have a large following and you start talking smack about a person or entity, depending on what you say and how you say it, you are probably accountable for libel or slander.  Freedom of speech my FOOT.
Point  That's just fluff and contradictory. you insinuate that a person cannot speak out and then in the next point you concede that the person can speak out but their ability to do so is impeded by the person they speak out to. this point is moot.
Point  If the local MP is corrupt you can speak to another one. there are many MP's. They're like senators.
Point  It's not *what* you say, it's how you say it and to whom. If you call someone a hard N, in a negative or derogatory way, then that is probably a hate crime (there are rules about this stuff, i don't know the specifics, im not a cop or a solicitor, it's not my job to know the specifics, it's just common knowledge that you try to treat everybody with respect.) Context. Better yet, if you have proof of such things by someone saying stuff on social media then, yeh.
It's not okay to go around behaving like a bigot or any other hateful stereotype no matter where you live..  that's just common knowledge. And if you disagree then you're more of a grotty little troll than i first thought.
This conversation has run it's course and I've had my laughs but it got too real. So this is where i block and forget you and your kind exist. Have your last say if you will, i won't read it. Goodbye mr troll. you win i guess.

Ok, now I'm uncertain if you are actually trolling or not. because you said you're not and i'm supposed to take your word for it. ��
Not once, did I, insinuate any of what you're accusing me of. You've replied to the wrong person, sir.
In fact, I find this entire ordeal trivial and hilarious.

Underrated comment. This is exactly my sentiment also.

Honestly, bud, nobody knows.
gut feeling tells me that wasn't the real pullback and we'll see $13,000 tomorrow or later tonight.
But that's just an opinion and i have no idea what's going to happen =D  i'm still holding, bois!
pray for my wallet!

what a delightful fable. i’m ready to sleep now and see what the price is in the morning. goodnight dad!

unpopular opinion, but i feel the same way. i feel like this year's got at least one last crash left in it before the end of year. just a guess, of course, but that's what this is. just best guesses and betting =P
