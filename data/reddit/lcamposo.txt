BTC/USD where traders make profit in the short term and bitcoin evangelists in the long term. once it can be a store of value [value stability] - medium of exchange for small transactions [acceptability and tiny fees] and  anonymous, all other attributes of money  bitcoin already has. If lighting network in fact solves the problem of medium of exchange for small transactions, stability of value is only going to be solve by a counter part of a bitcoin (altcoin) that has to be back up by a mining process of creating coins backed up by a open real state open public registry of tittles, that would have to be within the scope of the law and could be seized by the government if law is issued to do so.

Appreciate your comments, I did not mean to mislead or try to make LN a person or community 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:08:35
Three steps: 1. Find solution for price volatility 2. Making bitcoin an user friendly instant method of payment 3. Create the streaming money feature on bitcoin a reality Everything else: segwit , sideChain, blockChains etc is just drama talk let’s get to work on what it matters 
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:40:15
No one just my community and I will make it swappeable with bitcoin or other cripto-token-community. Thanks for the idea 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:10:36
lightning network sorry
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:49:04
Yes but how do you scale that to cities and countries through the internet of money (cripto) where liquid fiat is just one of the papermoney you can exchange bitcoin for under the premise that “intangibles including p2p personal services can be tax or seized from a nationalist government ? it takes the next round on innovation on bitcoin, maybe bitcoin 2.0
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:14:24
When you see fiat as something that has less value to you than bitcoin. Wait as more money is printed that is exactly what is happening. LOL 
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:12:12
We live in a tangible world. Fiat is for selling products you can touch and see with your eyes, for citizen of nation and to pay taxes. Cripto is going to be useful for the service and content economy which more powerful that the tangible world because it shapes it, not makes it disappear or replace it. One borderless and virtual ecosystem is being build and nations and taxes are not part of it, because they are not necessarily.

LN is a solution to scale bitcoin, but Mass adoption is a price stability problem for the 4 billion unbanked and it is not a software problem 
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:15:22
I am talking about the LN not bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:43:26
you got that right We are not suppose to do business for business sake the federal administration want us to go broke because employees do not know anything about free markets and business in general 
@_date: 2018-05-08 16:06:35
Cloud you elaborate in what is a “pool manager”?
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:01:27
You are right. Utility comes first, then adoption and finally price stability after we build an international virtual ecosystem based on ... the new world service and content open borderless and uncensorship resistant market virtual place...
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:17:41
Those are anonymous but are not liquid and can’t scale 
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:29:41
Fungibility is imposible without descentralized cash exchange who interact with other cash descentrelized exchanges who in a way are anonymous. At the protocol level is not viable 
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:17:52
It is happening anonymity and fungibility is not an option for the current financial system. Cripto that plays by the rules will increase in value over time for the only purpose of remittances and international payments just because is more efficient and secure.Fungibility and privacy are off the table in bitcoin. Bitcoin maximalist and libertarians we are far from inventing something that protects are privacy in the way we conduct our own finances. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:23:42
Because 90% of the population can afford to earn in bitcoin and exchange for fiat for their basic needs and lose money in the process.  Local fiat or digital money serves that purpose fine.
Mass Adoption for the 4 billon unbanked is posible when it becomes useful to earn money in bitcoins or other cripto currency and you see acceptance of the currency is your local ecosystem, and that ecosystem has solve the price volatility problem 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:58:24
I did not explain myself correctly. Let’s  say I set up a payment node or hub in the lighting network with my employer or customer and I get paid back and forth but when its time to cash out for local fiat I see a decrease in my dollar value if maker it down,  if I need that money to pay rent, interest and punitive late payments I will not find convenient (the light network) I mean, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:05:16
The only scaling “issues” that need to be solve are: 
1. Decentralized interconnected exchanges that ask permission to reveal customer identities to regulator.
2. Price stability for the 4 billion we are trying to include (the would never like the currency if they have a 15% drop in prices from one week to the other, they live on weekly basis and have no savings)
3. Adoption as an international and local method of payment and unit of account
4.  Fungibility  
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:24:42
The end goal is the interaction between the two. Without one the other can not exist in this tangible physical world. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:41:39
got it thanks
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:45:32
excuse my ignorance KYC?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:04:00
How can you know it is an anonymous coin?
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:59:24
The problem is insurance. We first need to build an informal insurance organization that protect the community (riders and drivers) from legal issues such as accidents &amp; penalties for not complying for the law. We first build it then we as forgiveness. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:21:29
that is not what I meant. Retarded? You are just not worth my reply 
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:00:56
verified customers for the same drivers. For that amount of money I don’t think it would be an unmanageable problem with out a solution 
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:12:07
No I am referring that uber drivers login into a website and receive request to from the exchange from verified locals (btcoinners) 
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:00:24
people first laugh then you know it is an idea worth exploring 
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:42:35
Agree, but maybe this movement can merge into the bitcoin movement eventually in some business model that works better than centralized banking 
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:06:29
No connection here with my comment sorry about the Acronyms yes I you got them right 
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:49:59
The US has achieved that by militarily, corporate and financial imperialism and it took centuries to get there, why would I expect bitcoin to compete again this stablished ecosystem in decades when bitcoin can create new and better use cases that the mention above 
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:03:54
That is thing that once in the blockchain they are locked into the ecosystem 
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:20:45
That is Bitcoin’s biggest weakness. Now that its value not only is derived from its demand and usefulness, but mainly from the ability to converted into cash or digital money from well government regulated exchanges. The community has to solve the privacy, the exchange and second layer problem. 
When that happens adoptions is not going to happen in 20% of the population, it is going to happen in the 50% of the 1% that owns 50 % of all financial asset for one reason only: To avoid taxes and confiscation from a big socialist government that will bring the whole financial system down for good. 
.5 % adoption of the total population is all you need to make bitcoin go to the roof and beyond. only if you solve the privacy problem at the main chain.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:14:29
okay got it use litecoin
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:14:53
Every thing is alright now
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:44:58
That is only posible through the type of exchanges as a community are able to build: fungibility and anonymity are the not going to happens at a technical and software level: they we be developed by the space, type of business and exchanges we are able to create in the next 10 years
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:36:45
I am just say if that ever happened which I find not probable 
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:57:30
Definitely the only solution to price fluctuations is asset back tokens through smart contracts in a open distributed border less and permission less block chain that will set the basis of price stability even in bitcoin when exchanges star selling bitcoins per cripto-hardassets 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:00:23
I will like to talk about : cripto-asset tokens in a distributed open blockchain ledger that has the potential to be also decentralized, borderless and permission less

Let’s start building the bitcoin we all want to see. Let ‘s let bitcoin alone as a medium of exchange and payment system, that is not need it. See it for what it is now: remittances tool and money for payments over the internet for intangibles that the financial system does not aloud us to buy using their : digi adult porn and its derivatives, e-gambling and support for pacific activists (like julian ussange, weakeeleaks, etc)  among others. 
Let’s create the intangible economy outside the system we all want to see come to life. We should invest on developing this economy of intangibles that the system don’t wants us to to buy easily, and let’s do it buy first building other kind of none regulated exchanges where fiat just becomes a small percentage of the commodities, tokens or fiat currencies that are exchange and an ID is not more that and email.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:43:19
because is an open ledger banks already have adopted it as a faster way to send their own money. It will be more traceable that even dollar for taxation and other related money laundering schemes.
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:34:14
this is the only way to adoption: I want a service and I find it useful to pay in crypto instead of fiat, because my seller needs, want and finds useful to charge in crypto to reduce its tax burden or to keep the transaction out of the financial system. For that you need a mass adoption of meet up cash fiat exchanges, which bitcoin holders sell at a discount as a way to reduce their tax burden. For that you need to guarantee fungibility of the token and that is not a tech problem it is a cash liquidity market problem that the actual financial system has already hijacked through regulated exchanges. Without private unregulated cash exchanges for bitcoin, fungibility is imposible, and without it mass adoption will not happen
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:13:11
Exactly for now it is all bitcoin is really useful for: remittances and international settlements. If we as a community solve the problem of “fungibility” and “anonymity” because it is not a technical problem  and have the courage to solve it despite the risk that this endeavor will bring about with tax agencies of your country. if that happened The use cases can now expand as a mean to charge for a personal on demand service which cannot be audit-able only if you liquidate your bitcoin in an exchange that protects you identity and you receive cash or other tokens that are widely aceptable in local restaurants, merchants, or hotels. By doing this you only pay indirect taxes which are all taxes a government should charge anyway.

BitCoiners. It´s simple: Get on board, support the bitcoin community and the consensus algorithm. If you think exchanges and their users being individuals, governments or organizations are inflating bitcoin´s price artificially. Cash out then, and buy abilities, knowledge, workshops and staff you can profit from in the real world. Let them play; like my good friend Alex Millar (bitcoin blogger expert) said when I asking him: Why is the price dropping so fast?: "Only God knows what drives bitcoin´s price up or down". However there will be only three solid reasons or causes why the price of a bitcoin or any other currency goes up: "the value you think it has, its utility value (how useful is for you to use it) and the growth of its acceptance as a medium of payment for every day transantions.

not really because they require address and id don’t they?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:10:42
He has a point. But definitely bitcoin will always be the international mean of exchange of international cash and fiat. And if it becomes a failed experiment it will always be the token that show us the way to make it work
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:07:11
just like this forums “completely monitor by government agencies”
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:05:33
1,2 are features not problems because nobody has a problem to store money in a bank digitally using a payment system or pay or receive through the internet digitally. 3 rules can change if a hard fork is successfully and had happened. 4. If government fails bitcoin it is not going to be the saver of the day if it not already adopted massively and has become mainstream.  
All I can say about keeping the faith in bitcoin in particular not its ideals which I definitely blindly believe in is: find use cases where you find it useful; at the moment there are only two that are mutually exclusive: 1. store of value long term 12-24 months you “hodl”until you profit and 2. remittances you buy and sell immediately over regulated liquid exchanges when you want to send money abroad in large amounts (&gt;10,000 usd not less than a 1000 usd)
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:56:00
I agree. all we need is to keep the principles: open, neutral, permission-less, censorship-resistant, borderless and decentralized money or tokens to empower the individual and local communities to create an alternate virtual economy based in services and intangibles
