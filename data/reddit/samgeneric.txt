This is actually interesting. In this case, you are the one getting scammed.
Generally, when people offer leverage, it's in the way of a bank, or something like it. They take your coins, they promise you a return because they are going to loan out the money on a fractional reserve basis. In the case that you are personally giving out the loans, you are in for a world of hurt. Good luck, but you are not as smart as you think you are. You're making a high risk gamble in a currency that is prone to hyper-deflate. If you believe bitcoin is going to fall in price, your loan is a safe (not good) idea, and you're actually performing a small hedge against that decrease. Though if you understand opportunity cost, you would have to justify why that hedge is better than simply keeping your money in fiat where you are subject to low, predictable inflation and where you would have opportunities to take (nearly) no-risk investments in things like T-Bills which often act as a hedge against inflation, or you could go one step further and explain why you are giving up the opportunity cost to make low-risk investments in things like broad-based market indices like the S&amp;P which return an average of 10% per year to you.
Moreover, the only reason loans are such a good product for banks is because they bundle them up, and sell them so they can mitigate risk. If you aren't capable of doing that, then you are holding an inordinate amount of risk - which is funny considering that you're already holding an inordinate amount of risk by holding Bitcoins themselves. So you're exposed to all sorts of systemic risks, and you don't even know what they are.
My statement about people offering credit in bitcoins has to do with corporate strategies that are built on loaning BTC. If a company builds a business plan wherein they propose making money on BTC loans, they are almost 100% knowingly scamming you. Then again, there are a lot of people who are running to BTC like the 49ers, who aren't capable of actually doing the simple math involved in figuring out whether it's a good business idea or not. These are scammers, but not dispositionally so. They are scammers by accident. There are a lot of these in BTC. People who come up with a business idea that looks great on paper, but when you get down to it, it's a Ponzi scheme, and not even the schemers themselves realize it. A loan-maker isn't necessarily a ponzi schemer, but in BTC, it's definitely a scam - whether on purpose or by accident. If they are a corporation making loans, they are probably holding your coins - whether in escrow or just as a wallet. In that case, you are holding all the risk. They could disappear tomorrow, and your coins would go with them. It will happen, and you will be out of coins. The day that Coinbase offers fractional reserve banking to Bitcoiners is the day that they have signed their death wish. In the case that you as an individual are making loans, you are holding all the risk. Your loanee could walk away and you would have little to no recourse. If BTC were to hyper deflate, by the way, you would have an even harder time, since that person could use your BTC to pay law bills to keep you from coming after him, then just declare bankruptcy at the end of it to keep you from getting anything back. So, taking loans in BTC is as big a scam as claiming you are a corporate entity making them.

I'm saying that there are a lot of levers that cause inflation. Money supply is one of them. If you print money to oblivion, you will eventually cause inflation to happen in excess, unless you also make subsequent adjustments to interest rates and other nonesuch. But no, hyperinflation itself is not necessarily the cause of printing money. That said, you are right, in the case of hyper-inflation, specifically, super-excessive money creation is most often the cause.

Correct. And managed inflation is expected and simple to plan for. Savings outside of a coffee can is always relative to inflation. So if you can put your money in investments that gain 10% each year, that's something like 6-8% above inflation, which is a 4-8% gain overall on average. And so, while the milkshake becomes more expensive, so does the amount of money you have available to buy the milkshake.

@_date: 2014-09-25 21:50:57


I suspect that anything I say regarding this will be met with derision and a lunatic fanaticism. Before you even get into this, you have to talk about how you're going to magically eliminate inflation in the first place. You going to just ban fractional reserve banking? You going to ban people from dying? You going to ban inflows from other countries? You going to ban other currencies? How are you going to just magically disappear inflation?
That said, inflation isn't stealing. It's fundamentally different, especially when you can easily hedge against it.


How about those people put their money into inflation hedges if they're so concerned?


That may or may not be true. This is a statement with no supporting evidence. At certain times it would be true, at other times, it wouldn't be true. Currently, without th eprinting of money, we'd probably be in a period of deflation. When banks were allowed to do branch banking and fractional reserve banking became the norm, well, that would have probably been a period of inflation.


Well, the ad hominums are fun. But I do know what inflation is. I am not pro-inflation. I am inflation agnostic. And it doesn't make me economically suspect. It makes me reasonable.


Poor people are not average with regard to income. Your claim about my statement "Poor people can't save" is absent of context. And it proves that you're not an intellectually honest person with regard to being able to carry on arguments. That said, to be poor means that one's income generally falls a few standard deviations below the mean for someone in your situation.  But let's test your claim about a person saving a few million dollars. Let's just assume that the average person can save a few bucks a month every year, then gets a 10% return on that money each year when they retire at 60. That would mean your money doubles about once every 7 years. That would give people  40 years to save $1MM. 
* 1,000,000 - The amount they want to get.
* 500,000 - The amount a person would have had to have saved by 53.
* 250,000 - The amount a person would have had to have saved by 46
* 125,000 - The amount a person would have had to put away by 39
* 62,000 - The amount a person would have had to put away by 32
* 31,000 - The amount a person would have had to put away by 25
* 15,000 - The amount a person would need to have put away by 18.
SO your assertion is that a person who is a few standard deviations below the mean with regard to their wealth could save $31k by the time they are 25? or 62k by the time they are 32? Probably not feasible. For most of us that time is spent going to school, and we catch up along the chart. For the poor, generally, their income is much more stagnated. These are huge hurdles. So you can throw out idiotic platitudes about how your not as mean as me. Or you can just do the math. Saving a million dollars is a burden unless you have discretionary income.
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:24:55
Sorry. You're right. That was written in haste. Let me expand what I'm saying.
The point is that there are two sides of the transaction. In an inflationary system, people are incentivized to spend and to save in assets that prevent the devaluation of what they are holding. In a deflationary system, they are incentivized to hold and not spend. While holding is fine, it punishes sellers because it prevents them from being able to convert illiquid assets into liquid currency. So if they have a red wagon on their shelf that they had to purchase from a supplier for 10 btc, and now they have to hold it for a long period of time, by the time you get around to purchasing it, they will receive 9 BTC for it. So they pay 10 btc to make 9 btc. So, essentially, they have lost money. For them, carrying inventory becomes very very dangerous.
It's a little weird, but they are taking the risk up front, and they are participating in a system that forces them to carry that risk longer. So either you are losing value on your money and spending it, or a shop keeper is losing money on his inventory. While the supply chain itself becomes cheaper, often commensurate with deflation, the money within the system decreases. So while the shopowner's spending power is possibly growing (even though he is selling products for less than he bought them for), he would have been better off holding inventory in the currency than holding it in high-risk, non-liquid inventory.
So in a deflationary system, you are often punishing inventory holders while currency holders are rewarded. I'm not saying it's worse or better. But I am saying that this is way more complicated than 16 year olds who go to libertarian meetups think.

@_date: 2014-06-18 00:44:24
Ok.... So I'm genuinely interested in the answer here. So if you'll oblige, come with me further down the rabbit hole of questions I have.
Like, if you sell drugs in exchange for couches, and the FBI shows up at your house, they might confiscate your couches, but they certainly wouldn't charge you with money laundering, would they? Also, it's not laundering if you take couches directly for the drugs. It's weird, but you didn't launder anything. You straight up took the couches for the drugs? You just took property.
What's weirder to me, though, is that he wasn't selling drugs. So, this is more like a landlord renting his apartment to known drug dealers in exchange for couches. There is a level of obfuscation that, I would think protects him somewhat. He was providing services to drug dealers. That's a different thing, isn't it? Since he's merely providing a market, he's not exactly beholden to the same KYC laws as like a financial institution, right? That said, in the case of my apartment metaphor, were the FBI to come to his apartment and arrest the drug dealers, they might confiscate the apartment under civil asset forfeiture laws - especially if it was obvious that he knew full-well what they were doing. But, would they confiscate the couches that the drug dealers used to pay the landlord? And is there even a chance that the landlord would be charged with money laundering?
While the example seems absurd, maybe I'm a dunce, but I am having trouble figuring out the difference if BTC is merely property. And your point about selling money at an auction is exactly my point. If they found $1M in Singaporean dollars, would they auction them? Or would they simply pocket them minus a small exchange rate? Again, genuinely interested. I know these are obtuse questions, but I'm not really understanding where I'm going wrong with my thinking.

Made a point. My statement was short, pithy, and full of point.


Nope. You just acknowledged the insults.


It isn't.


Only if they save in cash. If deflation occurs, then the value of the object they are buying is falling in value and the holder of inventory is "taxed." So either it's a tax on the saver or a tax on the seller (if it's a tax at all). If you can't see that, then you're stupid. Sorry about the insult. But it's true. This is very simple math. People like you are proposing that there is a more moral way to run an economy. But your proposal is to either do negative inflation (deflation) rather than positive inflation (inflation) or some sort of stagflation. Inflation is complex and you can't wave your magic wand to make any of these occur. Also, money supply has very little to do with inflation. The answer to your question is no, it is not exactly tax-like in any way other than both taxes and inflation/deflation/stagflation are semi-predictable. The government's financial resources (the taxes they collect) are diminished in the same capacity by inflation.


No. It's inflation.


Wait... I made more than one point in that short sentence? I thought I made no points.


I think you probably don't have enough money to pay taxes or you haven't spent any time thinking about tax law, since you didn't pick up on the very simple, unnuanced word I used - "regressive." This is a tax that disproportionately affects lower income people. Even apart from that, it isn't a tax, and inflation can be avoided by using inflation hedges. Even gold is an inflation hedge.

I don't really believe in hunches. But I will say that the PoS suffers from all the same systemic risk as PoW. If you think that centralization is possible, or you want to call what we have in PoW centralizatino now, that's fine, but there are completely 100% exact analogous problems with PoS and more.
* PoW's problem is that you need huge amounts of work.
* PoS exists as a consensus mechanism because you can't have a second PoW blockchain that doesn't suffer from huge risk of an attack from third parties because the Bitcoin blockchain is so big
* PoS is not as secure, for the reasons that people say there is nothing at stake.
* PoW + PoS chains acknowledge that PoS is not adequate for a blockchain, and it's a response to the crazy inadequacies of PoS.
* Slasher is a response to the risks inherent in PoS, but, as it has always been with those proposing PoS, it is shortsighted, and will be easily and quickly circumvented by people who are smarter than you.
If you do not understand that work secures the blockchain, you don't understand blockchains. But let's not pretend that PoS isn't super-centralized. PoS way more centralized than PoW - there is also no incentive to not fork it since there is no work involved in its creation. PoS makes the problem that Bitcoin solves a computer science problem. PoW acknowledges that the Byzantine General problem is actually an economics problem. If you don't see this, you are in over your head.

This isn't actually wrong. You need to disambiguate the Blockchain from Bitcoin. Blockchain is a lot like paper. Bitcoin is a lot like graphite or some printing medium. You use Bitcoin's as credits to write on the blockchain. But they are credits, they pay for that opportunity. That writing can be in the form of transferring the BTC from one wallet to some other wallet, it can be in the form of asset allocation such as with programs like Counterparty.co... but the truth is, Bitcoin itself really is just money or some approximation of it.
I think the more important problem here is that the government is in-fighting. The IRS says it's not money, but the Justice Department says it is... FINCEN treats it like it is, the FBI is arguing that it is, the US Marshals sold it like it was property, so what is it? Not even the government knows. Maybe it's not money at all. Maybe we are in a post-money world. But waxing philosophical is not exactly what judges are there to do.

Right. sub-30 second confirmation times aren't better than 10 minute confirmation times. A bad actor who is planning on performing a double spend is probably going to do it algorithmically if he/she is going to do any damage. Most people are not bad actors. Insurance against current bad actors is about 3% on the merchant side for a 6 month double spend. So, yes, confirmation times do not matter most of the time. Not to mention there are basically ways to check for double spends presuming you are actively monitoring transactions. It's kind of the perfect place for some kind of insurer to step in.
Also, the point of Bitcoin is not to get rid of third parties and middle men. Many of us like that idea. But that isn't the "point" of Bitcoin. The "point" of Bitcoin is to make a protocol that distributes persistent, non-duplicable, scarce resource. As we have seen, there are some unique problems that have arisen as a result of that project. The problems are much less inefficient than the incumbent system, but they do have real world analogies. And their solutions are very simple. Removing third parties from the equation may happen someday, but it's not even slightly possible right now. It's like proposing that we remove trusted third parties from baking our bread. I mean, maybe someday we can have robots make and deliver bread based on a distributed consensus model - and *maybe* that's a better world. But we're not there yet.
By the way, it's absurd to posit that financial service middle men are the problem, and not distinguish among bad actors in any economy. The truth is, you can have a baker that serves poisonous bread, and that's pretty bad, just like a banker that steals your money. Bad actors are bad actors. It might be true, however, that good actors in the future, push toward decentralized consensus models. Maybe that's what insurance eventually will be. But the people best poised to solve the problem of decentralized insurance are incumbents who actually understand the logistics of insurance.

Do you really think that central banking is going away any time soon? Bitcoin isn't a viable alternative yet. Version 1.0 isn't even out. To paraphrase something Andreas said much more eloquently, Bitcoin probably won't replace the US dollar, at least not any time soon. But there are a lot of countries where it will become the most popular medium of exchange as a result of instability or devaluation of the currency. You can't do anything to not prolong the reign of something viewed as an inevitability. The central banks are going to be around for as long as the state exists. And, in spite of your allusion, the system has worked decently well for the last 100ish years.

But at the moment it is increasing at a standard rate, and it's increase is outpacing adoption in the short term. This doesn't mean it's inflationary. Printing money and inflation may be correlated, but they are not the same thing. So you're wrong, BTC is not 5+ years of evidence regarding a deflationary system. You're also decoupling all the other variables here and pretending that somehow this has all happened in an experimental bubble. It hasn't. You have so many factors at work, that you can't simply say the thing that works abotu BTC is it's deflationary-ness.

This is an assertion. The incentives on other chains only exist because of greed. People feel like they missed the Bitcoin firestorm. In the end, you need hashing power. And the only reason that anyone hashes on new chains is to exchange alt coins for bitcoins. It's arbitrage because of small market inefficiencies. If the ultimate goal of hashing on new chains is to achieve the results of hashing on the most robust chain, you have to ask yourself how those other chains will continue to survive. If your response is proof of stake, then we can have that debate. But it's a different debate. And I would say very simply, proof of stake exists because people that try to start their own blockchains are finding it to be an impossible thing to do all the while the BTC chain grows in hashing strength (and hashing strength is synonymous with security - security being the ability to unwind the chain). If you don't agree with this, you don't understand what hashing contributes to the network. If you need evidence, just look at the debate about NXT coin. They were considering rolling back transactions. Just the fact that they could even have that debate proves the ridiculousness of PoS. If you said the word, "roll back" in Bitcoin, you would be laughed out of a room because it's such an incredulous idea.

The claim was that American's have less discretionary income to spend on their families and that that discretionary income drop was related to inflation. This link only gives me a chart that indicates that inflation has occurred. No one will debate that. I'm asking for evidence of the first two claims.
My question is actually a bit of a red herring, to be honest. I doubt that most of you possess the ability to actually run a regression that isolates the variables of inflation and discretionary income and then discover what percentage of discretionary income's rise or drop has to do with inflation. People can actually do this. I certainly cannot. You might be able to find a study that has done it. But you would probably have a difficult time working through the veracity of the stats.

In a year or two when they finally release Ethereum using (probably) nothing more than the Bitcoin PoW or straight-up PoS Bitshares-like consensus, because after much research that's what they will conclude will be the only thing that will work, the project will quickly fail for all the reasons cited by those much more intelligent than Mr. Buterin.

This level of exuberance for a 1) untested product, 2) product that improves upon the Bitcoin ecosystem very nominally, 3) a company that lied about paying people who signed up early (were very cryptic about their only giving limited early invites out - made it sound like everyone who signed up early would get one, even advertising the deal until the day before launch), lies about the fees they are paying to credit cards (they could have not disclosed this but decided instead to lie). 4) Launches under the imprimatur of no fees but very obviously has their coins priced at a specifically pegged percentage above market. 5) Is launched by a guy who loves to bring things into compliance and take company's public which means his eye is on profitability (which bodes well for longevity but not creativity). The fact that there were more than 10 posts on the front page about that company raises my hackles. It makes me think that there is very little this company would do to not get 10 stories on the front page of reddit and downvote any story that questions the service's viability or integrity.

I know this because you speak like you didn't lose your shirt like the people that bought in at the top and are whining now. Your post-hoc rationalization about why you didn't get in earlier was because you said BTC was hard to obtain. So now, to validate your post-hoc rationalization you are projecting your objection onto everyone else even though that was never your objection to begin with. Classic Bitcoin fever. I've seen it a dozen times. Glad your here on the Bitcoin train, but trust me, ability to get coins is not the barrier.

I do my best not to address trolls, but you're scratching my itch.
Transaction times do matter. The longer the transaction time is, the more secure the network is because the bigger the hashing power to add blocks to the chain are going to be.
For the purpose of utility, however, the only transaction speed that matters is a 0 second time. So if your transaction is 10 seconds or 10 minutes, if it's not 0, you have nothing to brag about.

You are starting from the premise that courts=government or that jail=government. They certainly do today. But they don't have to. Anarchists don't believe in lawlessness.

Airline ticket prices are way cheaper. The tech in your pocket is the same tech that any rich man would use because you can afford it. Computers no longer cost $1500.
Deflation and inflation are sort of weird metrics that are measured based on a basket of goods that is adjusted from time to time. It's not a perfect metric at all. In fact, many of our metrics are heavily flawed. In recent years, gas prices have been a huge factor in that basket. So for those things that are essentials, like fruits and vegetables, there has been a huge underlying problem - it costs more than ever to transport them. Those essentials are often the part of the so-called basket that lower income people buy most. So while the value of your dollar is actually not decreasing, the basket of goods you are purchasing may be heavily affected by external forces that are not having to do with inflation.

Right. So, getting more than the current exchange rate points to why it's not ready. If that happens, that signals inoordinate volatility. When you do remittance, you put money in on one side, and out pops another money on the other side. Bitcoin as a mechanism to sit in the middle of those exchanges is going to be a amazing. But the ecosystem needs to evolve. 1) The company offering remittance needs lots of liquidity in both currencies being remitted. 2) They need to insure themselves somehow because it's not day-trading. So if you're remitting money, you want to make money on the fees you are charging, not the volatility of the go-between. That's why WU and other remitters use their own ledger - because the ledger isn't the money maker, the fees they charge are.
So what that means is when you put money into Bitcoin in one country, and you pull it out in another right now (unless it's a country that has remittance in Bitcoin) you are assuming the risk of that transaction. You are moving it between one, two, sometimes three exchanges (in Bitcoin exchanges fail regularly so that's a risk), you are probably paying a 1% to 5% fee on getting your money into Bitcoin, and you are probably paying a 1% to 5% fee to get your money back out. In all, the cost of doing remittance in Bitcoin if you are working on doing it on your own will probably be between 3% and 7%. Sometimes more, almost never less. That's not much better than Western Union or any other remitter.

That's not the case. Because if you hadn't sold the thing, and had simply held the coin, you'd be richer. I'm pointing out an extreme example where the value of your holdings deflates 10% over time. So, in a reasonable economic system, you'd have held that for three or four years. I was making the point that as a vendor you're going to make the decision about whether it is cheaper to simply hold money or to actually be an entrepreneur. And in a deflationary system, the incentive is goin to be to hold the money or exchange it for much more liquid product. This isn't even a bad thing. Again the point is that inflation and deflation both "hurt" people in the way that people are using it here.

So isn't the first thing you should ask be, if I can spend $10k and make $10k in my first month, by doing the most commoditized service ever created by humans, then why wouldn't they just keep those profits for themselves? They just did what every BTC mining company has done before. It's not about trusting a new company. It's about doing a single recursive leap, asking exactly 1 question.  Everyone does this, then Reddit becomes a bitchfest of people who got screwed by the guys selling them the pick-axes. Ya'll gotta realize, all the gold that was just sitting on top of the ground is gone. You need to be running a full-scale operation if you want to get at the harder-to-get stuff.

Yeah, it's not nonsense. But those are certainly good returns. Your rate of default is going to be higher based on BTC's deflation. So while you're doing well now, if we see a spike in BTC price, g'luck! That said, I'm sure you know that better than anyone considering you have an actual understanding of your accounts. So what I say is nothing more than speculation. But I think in a few weeks/months/years, you'll come back here and see that none of what I wrote was absurd. Ultimately, I believe that markets are smarter than you. Your incredible returns are a very strong indication that you are taking on ridiculous amounts of risk. I'm glad you're becoming so rich though.
Just to examine your claim (which I don't disbelieve, I just think you need to understand the absurdity of it)
You are saying that you are making loans in USD, wherein, you essentially give someone the equivalent of $1, and at the end of the year you have earned $13.08? And you're claim is that you are making returns on your BTC loans wherein you give someone $1 and they are paying you at the end of the year, $3 (several hundred percent return... I just decided it was 200%)? And all of that is after defaults?
Why would anyone take your loans over floating credit card risk at 18% per year (in most cases)? If they are such short term loans, if a person were able to take on the risk from credit cards, they would either not pay any interest, or they would pay no more than 18% (probably more like 24% if they were to do an advance).
Moreover, most people with decent enough credit can walk into a bank and get a loan for 15k+ at a rate between 7-9%.
So, who are you loaning to?
I know... these are probably people that can't get a loan from a bank. Why? Well, I would probably assume that it's because they are higher risk than you are claiming. Oh, maybe they're internationals and they need some quick money... in that case, they're not on the US' credit-verification system. So they're higher risk than you are claiming. Maybe they're too young to have a credit history, so no bank will loan them money and they don't have a credit card. Then they're higher risk than you're claiming. Ok, so maybe they are actually able to get loans, and maybe they are actually low risk, then they're idiots and they are probably higher risk than their credit score would indicate.
The problem here is that you think you're smarter than the market. Given enough time, people that think they are smarter than the market do get burned.

^ This. People don't understand that incumbents don't just disappear. Western Union has a global financial network already established. If Bitcoin starts to threaten their business, they will 1) pick a new business to be in or 2) add  or integrate Bitcoin into their services, and they will deftly navigate the laws well as a result of their entrenched knowledge. The result: cheaper, legally compliant remittance as a result of the company off-boarding their internal cost of maintaining whatever backbone they have to maintain.

Question: The Marshals are selling these coins. If it were cash and they had confiscated it, it usually goes straight into their own coffers, as I understand things. Doesn't the fact that they are selling it as property, invalidate any claim they have that this is money, which would make it difficult to accuse Ross of money laundering? I'm not a lawyer, but I would just think that their actions show that they very clearly believe BTC to be property; not money.

So, they happen right now at a rate of like .7% of the time. And this will be less and less as more nodes exist and as efficiency increases. Shorter block times would significantly increase this problem. And "just dealing with it" is idiotic.
There are times when certain parts of the world are cordoned off for a minute or two from the rest via the transatlantic cable or some other anomolous technicality. Could you imagine a world when miners in China aren't getting the notified of solved blocks in America for like 2 minutes? In your 30 second confirmation world, not only will we have an orphaned block, but we'll have two entire countries mining two different forks. You would be 4 confirmations deep before the fork is even noticed. That seems like a big problem, considering that you couldn't even trust the confirmations to be verifications anymore.
@_date: 2014-08-18 04:43:32
Like I said, I don't doubt your numbers. But your growth is unsustainable. I'm sorry, anyone who finds a way to earn any amount above 10% is an oracle in my opinion. And while Bitcoin may deflate to hell and go to a million, it's a fluke. But this, loaning money, especially with the returns your seeing, you are 100% either going to be the world's first trillionaire, or you're going to lose your shirt. Just do the math, if you gained 51.52% per year. Just do the math if you loaned out $100 in year one. You will double your money every 1.4 years (let's call it 1.5 for simplicity). So let's do the journey of a $100 investment today over 30 years.
* Day 1 - $100
* year 3 - $400
* year 6 - $1600
* year 9 - $6400
* year 12 - $25,000 (we're fudging now for simple math)
* year 15 - $100k
* year 18 - $400k
* year 21 - $1.6MM
* year 24 - $6.4MM
* year 27 - $25.6MM
* year 30 - $102.4MM
I'm sorry, there isn't any low-hanging fruit, just a re-inventing of what already exists kind of investment in the world that will allow you to turn $100 in to $102 million in thirty years. So I will stand by my assessment, your returns are a fluke and they won't continue. That said, again, if you actually found a market that allows you to sustain these kind of returns for any period of time, you should not be on Reddit telling people about it. You should get a business plan together and start a fund.

So this is the story: after being warned by hundreds of people all over Reddit, and the internet, and having the capabilities to do the very simple math that proves mining is a stupid idea for anyone not making their own ASICs, you bought anyway. Now you're angry that the company that is making the ASICs made the rational decision to mine the machines out before sending them because it would be more lucrative? Now you want to sue said company because they are smarter than you, and you're going to try to, what... put a lean on their property and take all their private keys? Good luck. You and your class action compadres are being scammed twice. First when you bought the miners, second when you hired a lawyer.

No I believe in markets. Individuals are generally pretty dumb. Lots of individuals, at least with regard to a market, are not.


This is often referred to as a discount rate. You are correct. Baked into the price of goods and services today is the expected rate of inflation or deflation in the future. I didn't make a qualified statement about which is better. I'm only making the point that you just made. People respond to incentives. The expectations of buyers and sellers is important. And those expectations produce outcomes. A deflationary universe has some different incentives, and someone is left holding the bag. In an inflationary universe someone different is left holding the bag. The question in both cases is not whether one is better or worse, it's which one produces the best outcomes. And there is probably very little evidence that either produces "better" outcomes. And a lot of evidence that, so long as both do not offer unpredictability, that the outcomes are roughly equivalent.


This is a futures contract. They need to find someone who will sell them that contract. It's a fairly complicated instrument, and the average store owner wouldn't deftly be able to manage inventory using them. But the answer is yes, there are ways to hedge against inflation or deflation. Most people don't really know how to do it effectively. But it's not that difficult.


This is 1000% false. I don't know how else to say it. It's just not true at all. Again, deflation is just negative inflation. It's not some new force. And yes, people can profit from it, just like they do inflation.


Inflation and money supply are not the same thing.


Money creation does not necessarily create inflation. Also, the poor do not hold on to money. So, the money they are holding is this week's paycheck.


I know Austrian Economics. I have read my share of Human Action. I recommend you go get an education and learn how to deftly deal with concepts that are not simple. Just because a guy wrote it in a book, that doesn't mean it's just true. Mises was very smart, and his philosophy is pretty darn solid. But I'm a firm believer of the notion that when people who are not intellectually prepared to read something very difficult (such as human action), they fail in their ability to wrestle with the concepts presented and accept them as wholly true. That is what you are doing.


Inflation is a thing that exists. You haven't thought through the issue if you think you can magic wand inflation away.


Poor people can't save because they spend their money. You can argue that they are affected by the CPI more than you or I. But it's a pretty difficult argument to make that they will somehow magically end up with more money at the end of a week so that they can save it. They spent it all. That's why being poor sucks.


Wrong. Just wrong.

No, the point is that not everything can be decentralized YET. Some things are better done by a trusted third party. And risk mitigation is one of them.

Trusted third parties are going to enter the ecosystem. You guys need to stop trying to think that everything is decentralizeable. If you don't want them to come in, then go Satoshi it up, and invent a way to handle this problem. But transaction speeds can be solved with Risk mitigators (insurers). I am 100% certain that risk mitigation can be decentralized. If it is, I bet the solution is built on the blockchain. But for now, we have what we have.
Everyone in the crypto world needs to understand that we solved a lot of problems with BTC and the blockchain. Not every problem has been solved, but lots of them have. You can't be here and not be a pragmatist though. You need to be an incrementalist. You need to understand that while we all agree that it's better to leave out the trusted third parties, for now, in some cases, they are more efficient actors. What's more, if transaction times don't matter to you because you are selling sandwiches at a sandwich shop, then you don't need to participate in any insurance scheme. But for those whom it matters, my point is that htere will be a solution. And the solution will be the same for every single blockchain that exists. All confirmation times for all blockchains will be made effectively 0 at the same time.

You mean like what the US does with the dollar? If you look at the fed over the years, while printing money is one thing that they do, the more important thing that they do to control the value of currency is control interest rates. Money supply is on of many levers available to currency creators to control the value. But here's the thing, it's a really really really complicated game of chicken.
Right now the fed is playing chicken with the money supply. They are printing more and more money, and they are controlling interest rates on the backend to control its release into the overall supply. So far the economy has done a really really good job of absorbing this printing. That doesn't mean it always will. That said, this isn't an easy game. And the US, which actually does it really well, does it with a controlled growth in value of about 3% per year. It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn close.
Just to articulate where I stand on this whole issue - the problem is not managed growth or decline. It's hyper or unexpected growth. When the rate of inflation or deflation is known, it becomes much more simple for a society to adjust expectations or to plan for them.

Nope. The market already knows that the reward is going to halve. If it took 3 months for the "market to realize the lower supply" then you have probably misidentified the market trigger for the event.  if you bought Bitcoin not believing in the project, you should get out now. If you believe there is no reason for it to go to $10k, then you might as well believe it will be $1 someday. Did you invest because you are a sheep? Or did you invest because you believed something about Bitcoin.
For those of us who understand, I think that we would say, if this grand experiment works, the world will be cashing in to Bitcoin and cashing out will be a laughable thing to do. if you don't see that as the future, then you shouldn't wait for the next bubble because in the future your question supposes, Bitcoin has no value.

Bitcoin doesn't forbid inflation. You can't forbid inflation. Thinking you can forbid inflation means that you don't understand the very complex economic levers that exist here. So the bigger idiot is not me, it's you. I don't have to sit here and prove it either. I can just let you talk. The idea that Bitcoin has some kind of ideology baked in is also absurd. I have read Satoshi's paper numerous times, and it's brilliant. You're reading someone else's mail though. You seem to lack the facility to deftly understand any of what is written there. In the section you describe, Satoshi is describing a limiting of the money supply. You are conflating, as so wonderfully points out, money supply and inflation. They are not the same thing. And claiming that they are means you haven't even bothered to read the wiki on inflation - and that's supremely low hanging fruit. So yes, I will take your libertarian currency and use it because I understand it better than you do and I've been using it longer than you have. And yes, every inch of what you said further affirms a yes answer to my question "Are libertarians just idiots?" Because it seems that no one here has any interest in developing an actual understanding of simple economic concepts.

Mathematically 10 minute confirmation times are way more secure than 30 second confirmation times. Like ridiculously more secure. What are you talking about? If a hash takes 10 minutes to solve it is a more difficult problem than one that takes 30 seconds to solve. Moreover, there are all sorts of problems with 30 second confirmation times. I can further explicate if you don't know what they are, but there are a lot of systemic problems with it. Shorter confirmation times have the potential to cause more forks, orphan blocks, etc, etc, etc. For the most part, double spends are basically only possible before a transaction propagates throughout the mem pool. So, you have between 6 and 15 seconds to perform a double spend. Mem pool propagation is publicly verifiable. So you say you want an initial confirmation, even a weak one, that sounds like you have one right there. Moreover, the block time problem will be solved at exactly the same time for every single chain when someone begins offering insurance against the transactions (sort of like what Bitpay does). So, sorry, you and everyone who talks about the 10 minute confirmation time being a bug are just wrong.

I think everything is a scam. If I had said this 8 months ago to you about Neo and Bee, you would have probably asked me, "do you really think that Neo and Bee is a scam." And with regard to the number of shills on this, there are 14 different circle posts on the front page of declaring that Circle is going to change the nature of the world. And what amazes me is that I saw this happen slowly. Over the last 6 or so months as circle declared invites, someone magically kept up the hype posting that they hadn't gotten their invite yet, or that they hadn't seen this game changing technology yet. This is screaming paid marketing to me. And when a company does this sort of paid marketing, it tells me that they are not as scrupulous as everyone here seems to think.

It isn't though. They can't want it regulated away if they don't know what it is. There is a pervasive ignorance to all of this. It's not simply a, "I don't know what it is and it's stupid," kind of ignorance. It's more like an, "I sat in a room with a bunch of people who I was told were experts and am parroting their opinion," kind of ignorance. These are the people who are supposed to be free-thinking, self-driven, type a's. But what I'm hearing spew from their mouth is very deferential to some master banking oracle. And what worries me is that it's bankers from every corner of the world. Why the hell is a banker from Cypress repeating the phrase "Bitcoin is not money" again and again as if that's a super important opinion to convey. That's the same opinion I've heard all bankers repeat in recent days. Who sent a memo out telling all bankers to start harping on Bitcoin not being money. It's weird and creepy if you ask me.

They used the defaults in teh software. It wasn't a consensus based default. But the software defaulted to 750kb. That should indicate to you how hard consensus is. Miners, for the most part, didn't think to modify the limits of the software they were using - probably because they aren't necessarily highly technical. It took a lot of lobbying and instruction to get them to up it to 1MB. Adding bigger blocks is a consensus change and not something you can simply adjust via the software.

RE: the gutenberg books, you are lying. You did not store 29,000 books and it's disingenuous for you to claim you did or to even slightly infer that you did. You hashed them, which is a trivial thing to do and a piece software that could be written in an hour by a competent programmer. The reason I know your project is problematic is because you lie when you talk about it.

Dearest Mr. Johnston, you have misrepresented proof of existence. You can hash the whole library, or you can hash each individual book at  which was a weekend hackathon project. What you said is that the difference between Factom and proof of existence is that factom can "facomize" each book individually, whereas proof of existence, which can hash anything, cannot. You lied. I know that Factom is a problem, because you lie when you talk about it. When are you doing the fundraise, I wish to know how much your bad notarization protocol is worth to 16 year olds who are currently hard up for money because the BTC price is down.

If it's trivial why would you mention it constantly? There is no difference between hashing the entirety of the Gutenberg collection and hashing a single PDF. But for some reason, that is the citation.

I don't think so. As I understand it, the story goes: Porsche was buying up VW. They did it quietly and secretly over many many years. They held the stock with no one knowing who had it. As VW rose, people started to buy shorts. And when it was revealed that Porsche owned as much of VW as it did, the shorters realized they had to cover their shorts and the only one to cover them would be porsche who could ask exorbitant prices for the short. So they got fucked. It ended up being a hugely profitable scheme for porsche. I think the VW buying porsche is a recent developemnt. Maybe related, but my point had to do with the manipulation of the market that occurred by purchasing secret shares.
That said, the result appears to have been what killed porsche.

Thsi has to be false. Like I agree, that's how this works. But people have been telling 5 other people abotu bitcoins. This is a market cap now over $2Billion. Telling people about BTC at this point is not going to move the needle much. These are big purchases that are making things move forward, not your next door neighbor. And that scares me a bit. This is banks and investors getting into it.

I have a weird feeling that someone is slowly buying up as many btc as they can and is planning to dump them all at once in order to tank the market. Don't know when that will happen, and I don't know who has consolidated the mons, but this could get very very interesting if someone has bought upwards of $100m worth of BTC. If the market is deep, it will tank, then crawl right back up as people eat up the coins. We shall see. Porsche did a weird market scheme with VW shares a long time ago that fucked short sellers right in the butt.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:32:34
And be greedy when others are fearful. Of course people are buying because they want to increase their wealth. That's why we do anything. But the rest of the world is fearful of this tech. So yes, it seems like it's the appropriate time for we, the few who are and have been involved in BTC, get greed.

Ok, instead of banning trades of a certain size, why doesn't MT Gox 1) look for trade blocks that look similar to the one above, and 2) stop trading when shit goes sideways. Take a lesson from real trade floors that have largely self-regulated like the NASDAQ or the DOW.
Not admitting that this was a DDOS pisses me off though. Victims of their own success? Adding 20k accounts per day? Really? 75k accounts created in April so far is not 20k accounts per day. Let me do the math for you MTGox, 75,000 new accounts/10 days so far in April=7,500 new accounts per day; or roughly 1/3 of what you claim has been created.
They're soooo far up their own ass holes.

We haven't touched LTC. We don't actually hold any wallets. We let you guys handle the transactions. We aren't sure how we're going to handle it all going forward, but I don't htink we ever want to take on the security risk or become a lightning rod for hackers by holding btc. I point that out because, while we're focusing on btc developement wise, I don't see why we wouldn't consider adding LTC support as well. The point of participating in crypto currency stuff is to support cryptocurrency growth. We don't have a horse in that race.
