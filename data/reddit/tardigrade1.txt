Yeah. I was using it as a channel of gettin bitcoin out of paypal for csgo deals. My biggest issues with the service where that the confirmation times where 24 hrs total, and that the fees were also dramatic ~30% .
Thats a lot. Also, the servise would be easy to abuse, but that scam button on paypal. (Hence the issues.)

Every red dot shows the balance of an address. i.e. as time went on the bitcoin became more distributed in a wide range of balance amounts, mainly getting smaller.

The bitcoin network is more than just the code. The people that use it, and build on it are just as important, if not more important. Those poeple meet here and at bitcointalk. Both sites are run by the same people, have the same content, and have a largly overlapping userbase. This is the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:02:31
This post reeks of BS. Afterall, changing the blocksize in no way implies the blocks will actually be the maximum size any time soon. People all think that changing the blocksize to 8 or 20 mb will mean new blocks will all be that size but that doesn't make any sense at all. It might be years before we even see a block approach maximum size.

@_date: 2015-06-16 13:11:16
I'm pretty sure it's an insult to the intelligence of Chinese miners to think that they really didn't think the blocksize would increase any time soon. Anyone with any brains could have known blocks would get bigger in the future, and make decisions accordingly. And even if they were dumb enough not to, simple economics rules apply and they either adapt, or rollover and die.
It simply does not make sense to halt innovation of the network for the sakes of someones dumb decision.

@_date: 2015-06-16 12:08:40
Why should the community bend to the Chinese miners who are slightly inconvinienced by slow internet, becuase they went to the remotest place in china for cheap energy. They already make tonnes of money, so they should be the ones to bend, not us. I'm sure theyll survive. And in the end, they'll all be dependant on the amount of tx in a block. So if by this time next year blocks are very full at 100 mb im sure most miners would be delighted seeing as how the blockreward is about to drop big time.

Yes exactly. The beginning of that panel is also rather cringeworthy when she starts to talk about how much she loves 'these men' who she barely knows and then goes on to say, not only in Bitcoin, but in life. She is essentially saying I will suck your dick because I know you have money, and will have even more money soon enough.
It's kinda sad really. The **one** moment we actually do see a 'woman in tech' she ends up being another money grubbing whore. It all becomes extra clear the moment Craig talks about how he's been testing scalability on a supercomputer. The only thing the girl says is 'ohh that's interesting' and moves on. Literally any, any person that has knowledge of bitcoin would be ALL OVER that answer for it was the most interesting thing said and scalability has been the top focus of attention in the community for years now.
She doesn't care and she doesn't know. She is just being a pretty girl(not that there is anything wrong with that mind you).

Think of it like this: Bitcoins current inflation rate is around 11% a year. Satoshi owns about 5% so in actuality the miners have a twice as much power as Satoshi.

7% is behoorlijk hoog. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:59:54
This is very true. But I think that actively spending more than 6.5 **Billion** just to keep the network running each year is a bit much. This is with a price of 10.000 usd. This is much... Not impossible but still much considering the network could in theory run off a million a year + transaction fees.
Every week we see post like "this or that is what needs to happen for the price to explode". The real thing that needs to happen is we need to remove this constant downward pressure by the miners. The only way for that is to make them pay their bills in Bitcoin. So if hardware manufacturers start accepting bitcoin we could help the price significantly. What companies actually produce the hardware?

So I bought a new phone with bitcoin (some Taiwan webstore), then a flight to Singapore using bitcoin (cheapair.com) and went to the Robocoin to extract asstonnes of Singapore dollars.
Then I bought a bitcoin Beer to rejoice in my success.
And led a happy, Bitcoin-funded, life in Singapore.

There is a constant selling pressure of 1.3 million usd on bitcoin right now eveyday. This is dramatically large.   Price will only start rising again when the blockreward halves.
 just 84 hard weeks to go...
The hard truth is... Bitcoin is unlikely to become huge before 2021(another halving to 6.25btc) ... Unless the miners eventually decide they won't sell every bitcoin they mine and instead settle their bills in Bitcoin or hold them and sell them later for more.
In 2020 with 1800btc released each day a bitcoin price of 10.000 would equal a downward pressure of 18 million USD each day (assuming miners sell all). 18 million is very much, but if bitcoin does become huge it might not be impossible.
This was Satoshi biggest failure. He didn't realise his creation would get this big this fast. Now we are limited by our own potential.

I'm no expert but couldn't we just update the code so that pools are denied their newly minted bitcoins if they have mined the previous 5 blocks. The bitcoin are then held ransom until a new block is mined by a different pool and given to them in addition to the newly created ones.
This would definitely favour small to mid sized pools.

The real big news here is that there are now **44.000** merchants in the world that use Bitpay! Thats not even counting the stores that use another processor like Coinbase.
Edit: Also,  the average store does $9,000 in Bitcoin sales per year. 
[According to Forbes](  there are just 102,000 online stores in the US that make more than $12k a year.
I'm absolutely stunned at how big Bitpay is getting.
Edit2: the article linked above is about revenue, whilst the 9k bitcoin sales is turnover (sales). Which is obviously a difference.

1. Convince them to make a public statement about Google integrating Bitcoin into their wallet system.
2. Ask them when we will see a wider adoption of google wallet outside of the US.
3. Google should offer the payment of all pruducts a small % off if payed in Bitcoin.

Bar idea. An exchange is not a wallet. The bitcoin are not controlled by you and won't be sent the exact moment you want them to. Could take hours in some cases and will possibly not be the same amount as you tried to send.

Yes I definitely suggest you do that. If you are using it to pay yourself it basically works like this:
* Once you get to the Philippines go to their website and fill out the form for who is going to pick up the money (you), then send the BTC and choose what place you are going to pick the money up.
* There are literally more places to pick it up then there are ATMs in the country. Most of these places are western union style shops (Palawan Express was the one I kept using 2 mins away from my hotel.) 
* After sending the bitcoin I would grab a drink at the beach and wait for a few minutes. After I'd go to the Palawan express where you show your passport, fill out a small form and they hand you the money (&lt;5min). 
I picked up about 1K usd a time or two this way. Fees are better than using a credit card and way faster than looking for a working ATM that isn't going to steal your details (happens a lot in the Philippines). 
*this was last February and they might have streamlined their website a bit. The only annoying thing at the time was having to fill out their website form every time. There was no save button.

I'm sure Gavin completely agrees with us, but he faces becoming isolated in the dev community, so he has chosen the path of compromise for now. Which I will reluctantly support. The scedule they drew up for that was also laughable. The blockcap would become 1gb in size in 2056 or somethin... I could see 1gb happening in 10 years with all the crazy things you can do with bitcoin. blockchain will be used for absolutely everything. It will become the internet of things, and thus the transaction volume will become dramatic. Way larger than the Mastercard standard (which is what the 8mb scaling plan is going for.  Bitcoin will be cable to do mastercard transaction volumes by 2036...)

Exactly. And if a specific miner cant handle a large size they can still mine at a size they can handle until they upgrade their internet/systems. There is no reason to hold back a system that is capable of so much more.
In addition this will bring mining back to Europe and the US because the Chinese in their remote deserts with cheap power, but no internet can't continue there. So mining will be viable for the rest of us again because we have good internet speed in the Developed world.

@_date: 2015-07-15 03:20:59
Discussion is good so no worries man.
* it's true that the spam attack has for the first time created a fee market (which is very good). But if a new wave of users comes in a 1mb block is still to small. Before the spam attack blocks where already approaching max capacity. An increase in blocksize will only temporarily reduce the fee contention until the next user wave.
* The future of ' spam' is very ambiguous. A lot of the new 'blockchain' startups will be using bitcoin not as a way to transact value, but as a way to do accounting. Say if an insurance company were to start logging things on the blockchain they will have lots of tiny transactions. This isn't a bad thing imo. As long as they pay their fee, and the transactions dont compete with time sensitive user transaction they are welcome in the blockchain. A potential spamfilter could very well cripple bitcoins innovative ability as a 100% trustworthy accounting ledger by making it too expensive to do this kind of work. But I do agree that this is a difficult issue.
* if the spammer wants to pay tonnes of money to fill up a block   they can go right ahead. The miners will be happy to take their money. This also conflicts with your first point as it would reintroduce fee contention. At 8mb it would take (at least) 600 usd to fill up a block. Thats 84.000 usd per day. Spammers are very welcome. (0.06 usd per tx @ 10000 tx per block)

Wouldn't the solution be to just set a transactions size limit instead of a blocksize limit?
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:03:43
Yes precisely. This spam-attack has been far more interesting than people here realize. 
What we learnt was that a very high rate of transactions can still successfully propagate across the world, from node to node. Then they just wait to be included in the block.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:09:16
Another of the many things bitcoin will improve. Now, especially if you try to take your animal abroad foreign regulations often make it difficult and tiresome to proves this. Now you cat could instantly be verified and granted access. Indeed they could also prove beyond doubt that this is the cat you are claiming it is. 
Edit: Thinking about this further, it actually makes a lot of sense to do the same things with live cattle. Every cow would have his own address, and everytime the status of the cow changes (say he gets a hormone shot, or he is shipped to another location, and butchered) there will be a small tx sent to his address with the info inside. on every box of meat in the supermarket a buyer could just scan the wallet address on the box and see what has happend to the cow.

Because you didn't provide any information on this whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:10:07
Glad you asked. I beleive in a joint approach to solving the issues at hand. 
* A blocksize increase (8mb) is essential, but it can't be the only solution for the time being as it puts the network at risk by isolating the chinese miners from the rest of the world. (They might start mining empty blocks to prevent block orphaning).
* Tx spam filtering through censorship leads us on a slippery slope. As an alternative I believe in enhanced prioritisation. Some prioritisation rules are already in place (higher fee and first tx seen). But we also need to prioritize transactions with few outputs over tx with hundreds (predominantly spam tx). This way it is ensured that any (normal) user alsways has his tx go through. Whilst also making a low output spam attacks much more expensive (benefitting miners).
* I don't have any issues with a fixed minimum fee, except for the fact that the would require a future hard fork to remove in the case of a price increase.

Thats a pretty simplistic view of society. The truth is that the values that once made America great no longer work. The world has changed and so should governance.

Yes a trezor works fine. If you also buy a micro usb to micro usb cable you can use it with mycelium on your phone(android). This is great because it keeps your coins in cold storage whilst being able to spend them easily on the go.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:06:19


No, I didn't. The mempool still gets filled really fast, because the blocks are too small. But, the point of this post is to demonstrate how the nodes itself did not get overrun, or that somehow the network integrity broke down as would happen with a website (ddos). 
 &gt; Paypal processes 11 million tx per day while Bitcoin can handle 8 million per month
The point I'm making about paypal is that paypal only does 114 tx/s. Therefore if bitcoin went at it like this the whole day it would process 38.1 million transactions per day. The network works. The people just need to let it thrive.
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:58:03


Now I'm not even sure you live in the US. The only values I see that are upheld are ones that benefit the elite, and are a detriment to the middle and lower class. If you want to see 'capitalist' ideals in action just take any 50+ year old Republican who has never lefy his own state.

Its because bitcoin aims to be much more than a way to transfer wealth. There are all kinds of accounting applications you could run on bitcoin that would often involve lots of outputs. If each output would be taxed then it would become way to expensive. 
A practical, and already in use, example is the big bitcoin betting sites (ie. SatoshiDice) they often have transactions with hudreds of outputs distributing bitcoin to many users. If each output would be taxed then the users would see much less reward. Its the reason we don't see any good betting sites for Litecoin!

Like I said in my PMs most users here are just not as into bitcoin as we are. Therefore these complex issues will never be that popular a discussion. It simply takes too much energy to understand. 
The best way around it is to slowly ease them into it. See my original post for example. It was a simple screenshot with a good one-liner idea as a titel. This I have found is the only way to tackle these issues with reddit democracy. 
Now I must sleep man, almost 5am ;)
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:42:32
This is because if there is a larger than 1mb mempool miners will only take transactions with higher miner fees. 
If you do a transaction with .0002 miner fee it will go straight through. I just payed for my food at takeaway.com with a higher fee and in went straight through.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:26:12
The strain is mostly from the fact that the difficulty to verify a transaction scales quadratically with the increase in size (i.e. outputs). Assuming  transactions dont change in size much the coming years this strain will not be an issue considering Moore's law.

It's bizarre how with bitcoin for the first time we have entered a realm of absolutes. Where morality and conscience play no role and everything that could go wrong by just benefitting one will happen. And must be mathematically patched. Is this even possible?
Is it somehow a trace of the bizarre psychedelic technology driven future we are speeding towards that functions on underlying technology that has no human, moral facade?
It's like the birth of a.i. malevolence through economic incentive. Unlike the movies where a.i. thinks humans are useless (makes little sense) this kind of malevolence revolves around the dehumanization of society through absolute capitalism.
In conclusion bitcoin proves capitalism doesnt work in a singularity, as it will destroy all.
Thoughts? This is kinda fucking depressing. How can I continue to believe in a systems that is somehow so fundamentally flawed by its mathemaical perfection.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:40:49

Well, not entirely true. There is more to processing a transaction than propagating and storing it. But now that discussion has proven wrong and confirming that the only problem is the blocksize. There is no reason not to upgrade from a node/network perspective. 
 
Before these spam attacks there was definitly discussion about if the nodes could handle the large volume of tx/s spamming them. This has now gone.

True, but those companies will one day roll over and die if they dont adapt. So arguably its in their best interest to learn about the technology and take advantage of it as this would benefit the much more. Also, most companies are not owned by just one entity. So getting the majority of the board to agree to something stupid and irrational is not something thats gonna fly. Most investors on the board will likely also have invested in numerous bitcoin/blockchain startups anyway.

In good wallets, like mycelium on android and most desktop wallets you can set a transaction fee. Right now it is strongly advised to increase this fee to 'priority' or 0.002 btc or more to ensure the transaction goes through without delay.

@_date: 2015-07-16 02:17:50
Indeed the issue is more complex than that. But most devs are more concerned about the techinal issues of increasing blocksize whereas Blockstream devs have a clear conflict of interest. 
Blockstream itself is a great systems, but it in no way should influence the decisions surrounding the blocksize debate.

I am serious. Like I said before most people that have bitcoin are techies, and have only a small part of their net worth in. The world has yet to follow. To realize bitcoins potential at its inception is something that is very unlikely, but four years later we are still the very early ones.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:48:52
I thought cities in china had good connections with the rest of the world. An increased blocksize might push the miners back to the cities, but I don't see how this increases centralisation.

They could, but that is one of the reason why we need lots of different small mining pools. Not large ones. 
The real issue is with the wallet developers, it should not be possible for a regular user to accidentally pay a too low fee amount. That is not user friendly at all. Mycelium is already developing a dynamic fee system. This is good.

I really dont think bandwidth is an issue. Today at 8 tx/s @ 600bytes/tx this is only like less than 10kb/s. When a new block arrives at a node most of the transactions have already been downloaded and verified by the node. Only the truely new ones does it need to download quickly. This often is not a lot als 99% of transactions are propagated across the world within a second.
I pay just 10 eur for internet per month and have 50 MB/s up.

@_date: 2015-07-16 02:08:37
Well unless you work for Blockstream™ the main problem with raising the blocksize is block orphaining. With a large block if two miners solve the block at the same time the miner with best internet wins. The other block is orphaned. But because most miners are in China(and have shit internet) they will simply mine empty blocks to avoid the risk of someone else solving the block first.
The solution to this is to just get a fucking decent internet connection. If you can set up a 100 million dollar minjng operation in the deserts of china im sure you can figure something out to get internet. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:37:17

Very good point. I was thinking about this a while back. In essence we have not had a cap for years now. It would not have mattered if it was 1mb or 1000mb the network would have acted in the same way. A cap is simply not needed, and based on outdated pre-bitcoin economic ideas.

No, they can't. The only censorship they can make is based on fee amount. They can chose to only accept the most expensive and if transactions have the same fee amount they will have to choose the transaction that was first seen. This was recently implemented. BIP 66 I believe. 
In fact if transactions could be censored **0-confirmation** purchases would no longer be possible!

This actually has been discused on reddit multiple times and is not a problem at all. Tx fee revenue is less than 1% that of the block reward. Also, this whole notion is actually quite idiotic becuase it would cause *much* more economic damage to a miner than profit.
* Putting this method into practice could create about $3000 a day, but a miner with 33% of hashing power already earns approximately $300kfrom the blockreward each day. As a result of this 'attack' the price would drop and seriously affect the 300k blockreward revenue, making it the dumbest idea of the month™.
* In a future bitcoin economy where most of the revenue is from tx fees this won't be an issue either, unless the blocksize is kept the same. I like this post though, becuase it creates a good case **against** fee contention (which is created by limited blocksize). Increasing the blocksize/removing the cap entirely solves this problem (and many others) permanently.

@_date: 2015-07-16 01:42:45
Yes indeed. The only way to secure bitcoins fee based future is to keep most transactions on the main chain by setting a very high block cap.
The only way a fee based future would work is if tx don't have to fiercely compete with eachother to be included in the blockchain.
If blocks fill up a miner could essentially set his own price for a tx by filling up the rest of the block himself.
As far as im concered this is the final **deathblow** to the blocksize conservation debate.

I guess you would need to gather a majority of miners and all convine them to do it together. Likely a couple of miners would ask a VERY high fee for this. So maybe a total of say 500 million might convince the biggest miners.

Wow this guy really has a huge stick up his ass. So people detrimental to the health of the network are now considered freedom loving hackers whilst they ironically keep censoring everyone talking about XT.

Beautiful thing is that it's still early. The whole history of Ethereum price action has happened in the last half year.
@_date: 2016-05-08 17:57:31
Well this is factually incorrect. Whereas unfortunately, due to reasons, bitcoin transaction growth has stagnated for months as seen in the links you so eloquantly provide. At the same time  a competing crypto platform has been growing at a staggering rate and now does 1/4 the amount of transactions bitcoin does daily.
The  beauty here is that Bitcoin has existed 13 times longer than it's main competitor, but it's competitor will soon see more daily transactions than bitcoin ever has and will.
@_date: 2015-11-24 19:16:58

This is quite literally the fourth time you have said this across multiple threads. How thick are you?
Edit: Well, who would've guessed? He deleted it.
, a buttcoiner, posted "I'll believe it when I see it". He had posted a variation of this multiple times across multiple threads, desperately trying to cast doubt on GBTC. Only a couple of hours ago hewas claiming the whole GBTC thing vaporware until he got proven wrong. 
What makes this thing even more funny(pathetic) is how a self professed 'bitcoin realist', claims that bitcoiners mindlessly repeat their BS, even when proven wrong. Well I think he will fit right in with us! Mindlessly repeating his BS is something he seems very capable of. 
He also claims that he is running 1/10th of all nodes in the Netherlands. W/e

Well I can personally vouch for the brilliance and usefulness of some of their services (rebit.ph), so I don't really see a problem.

Hey man. I just ordered the card. 
Would you mind telling me about the bitcoin scene in Beijing. I was there two weeks ago, and I found out there where two ATMs in the 789 art place. Didn't visit there because it was too far from the metro station. 
I was wondering where I can do bitcoin related stuff in Beijing next time I'm there in a month.

I applaud you for at least admitting that I have the right of it. Your comparison with Litecoin and Dogecoin is not really applicable as even during the peak of both those currencies they got no where near to what Ethereum is doing daily.
During Litecoins peak it averaged 13K transactions per day. Ethereum is sustaining 40K per day right now and will continue to grow as financial tools are released.
Take care. A lot is at stake.
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:50:00
I still don't understand it though. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:10:41

Well, safety is fine I guess as thieves never engage in violence. But robbery is definitely not uncommon as the penalty for being caught is rather low.

Hey man!  I'm going to the Philippines tomorrow for a week to go kitesurfing on Boracay. I bought my flights from Amsterdam in Bitcoin and now that I read about this I really want to support rebit by trying their services for myself. Since im a foreigner I have no idea what the hell all those pawn shops are. 
So my question is if there is one of those pawn shops on Boracay island where I can pick up money within hours if I use this service?
And do you need to be a Philippines resident?  I plan on sending about 1000 USD if it works.

Good find. The artikle is a letter from a reader.
He says that ING blokked his bank account when he tried to buy at bittonic.nl (a dutch coinbase equivalent). He called the bank and the guy in the phone seemed to read a text that had been written beforehand. They told him the bittonic address had been involved with 'trojans' in the past and that the blocked his account for his own safety.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:19:19

@_date: 2013-11-24 13:32:06
Yes. And about 300 bots.
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:37:44
This would actually be the most scientific method of testing the hypothesis.
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:58:53
In about one month you could also have gained 70% value in bitcoin, but you decided to sell for 10eur/BTC? 
Doesn't make that much sense really, after all. I have read that SEPA transactions are also heavily delayed, and considering the risk that the might never actually be processed at all a small 5-10% gain is just a risk not worth taking. But do whatever you like, its you money.

Ohh right. I get it now. It's pretty obvious. 
If you don't send them the id they would have no way of confirming it was you that payed, instead of another poor hostage. 
The only thing i dont get is why they wouldnt just create a sperate bitcoin address for every infected computer so that once the address has the funds needed the virus decrypts the data. No transaction id needed!

This is what is was hoping for. Thanks for excellent BTC theory.
Is there any literature on this?
@_date: 2013-10-15 17:33:49
But at the current rate that probably means the price will stay at 140 for a few days or so. But you are completely right. 
I just wonder if a wall like this might cause people to think the BTC value is not going up anymore which starts a panic sale.
