Good to see kids getting in on the financial revolution!
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:56:46
Sounds like a cool business :) Glad to have you on the team.

The newcomer FAQ is still only 5 months old!?

I see I'm a little late to the party.

Asshole 6.0
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:58:01
Well no appears to be your answer.

I mean, they look good, but a lot of the backgrounds seem completely arbitrary to the text and images. Also, is downloading protected in some way? I had to disable the css to be able to right click and download it.
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:59:54
That would be great. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:15:07
Looks great. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:36:09
Bringing the fun back to the ol' subreddit. I like it :)
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:53:49
Thanks for sharing this ridiculousness.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:16:45
Proffessor Buttcoin was right. Bitcoin is dead. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 02:08:01
Great idea!

Praise Satoshi!
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:26:32
That's a mighty fine sign.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:44:15
This would be fantastic, a great match for the forward thinking musicians at soundcloud. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:30:23
Title is a bit sensationalistic.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:46:46
Is this really legally possible? It says right on the dollar, legal tender for all debts.

I'm not sure how much he would even want to be associated with the foundation, but he would be an idea choice should we choose to accept.

If you care about bitcoin, get on p2pool.
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:21:26
You've exemplified almost everyones reason with this thread right here. The community. Perhaps a daily tipping thread is in order?
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:32:33
Not the best name.
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:01:27
I'm thinking decentralized exchanges?
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:57:47
This looks fantastic, good work!
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:06:53
What's the most promising decentralized exchange on the horizon?
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:56:12
Of course, get those services out there!
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:24:48
Good for you op, that's ridiculous.

Nothing like $0.5 to make you feel like Bill Gates.

My understanding is that when block rewards stop miners will continue to be motivated to mine by transaction fees. Do the transaction fees factor into miners profit significantly at this point, or will that only come later?
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:31:59
More details perhaps?
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:25:55
Just bitcoin transactions. Unless you have a significant amount of money to invest in mining equipment, electricity costs will outweigh your productivity. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:18:18
My apologies.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:55:04
This is really cool! I love all the creative ways people are making physical representations of their QR codes. Good work!
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:56:54
Without punctuation like "Hugh Hendry: Bitcoin could hit 1 Million" I thought Hugh Hendry bitcoin was some sort of special variety of bitcoin or altcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:22:17
Thanks for the reminder/finding it, I'll make sure to in the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:36:45
1. Block rewards half every four years until they reach zero at 21 million coins.
2. Mining is essentially verifying transactions, and the person who verifies the most gets the block reward. Ergo, the more computing power, the more likely you are to receive the reward.
3. Don't waste your time/energy mining, as even if you make a minuscule amount now, it won't be profitable for long. 
4. Bitcoin is usually compared to gold. While supply and demand is certainly a factor, it also derives value from its uses, i.e. transferring money quickly and cheaply. 
Hope that helps!

Glad the shark tank alumni are getting into bitcoin :D
