i also think the US dollar is going to tank this year.  I bet we see 100,000 dollar bitcoin.  
The bankers have been exposed, it's just a matter of time before the public figures it out.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:18:47
exactly.  The US dollar is going to tank harder than it did in 2008.  We are going into hyperinflation.  Bitcoin was created because of the bailouts that happened because of the 2008 crash. This is all happening again right now.  The bankers haven't changed anything about the way they conduct business and possibly have even done worse than the lead up to 2008.  
When the dollar crashes just like in 2008, people have an alternative this time... And by the time the dollar does crash, we will have a much better "infrastructure" built around crypto.  
If you trust the dollar and don't trust bitcoin, you are in crypto for the wrong reasons...

most people think bitcoin is fake because it is only numbers on a screen.  Most people actually are not very smart even though they have managed to make a ton of money.    A little piece of paper goes a long way for brainwashed people stuck in their times.  
I agree with you and totally think this is a step backwards for the technology and pointless, but some people will feel more comfortable.
They have to create bridges for most people to cross into the new currency in order for the new system to be widely adopted. 
It was hard for people to accept paper money, it was hard for people to accept credit cards, it will be hard for people to trust bitcoin as well until it is widely adopted. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:56:00
Maybe not the main form of currency but the main store of wealth.  I think another crypto will probably be used for peer to peer transactions.  
I think cryptocurrencies are still in the very early stage of use.  It's like the internet in 1990 when people still had no idea what it is.  
This clip reminds me exactly the attitude of the masses right now surrounding crytpos.  Most people don't have a clue what this is yet.   
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:11
exactly.  The bank isnt taking, 90% of your bitcoin and using it to fund wars as it sits in the safety deposit box.  It's just a safe place to keep something you dont want damaged or lost or stolen.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:07:54
they have had a monopoly on the money supply forever.  This is why Abraham Lincoln was killed, this is why JFK was killed.  
This is why we are in war with every country.  They brainwash nations to destroy eachother to set up their private banking systems to monopolize the entire worlds monetary supply.  It's not necessarily only fiat, it has been whatever currency is in circulation at the time.  
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:09:20

I just got my first bit coin about a week ago.  I was drawn to it by its insane rise in value. So i read as much as i could.
Once i learned it is a decentralized anonymous form of banking, decentralized being the main point.  I knew bit coin was the best invention Earth has ever seen.  I can't believe i just started researching bit coin.  Ive, been saying the bankers are satanic pedofiles for more than a decade now.  Time to level the playing field.  
It's only a matter of time, once the public is exposed to how corrupt the banking system is, decentralized digital currency is going to take off!

“Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.”  — Sir Josiah Stamp, Director of the Bank of England \(appointed 1928\).

Ok so i found the magnifying glass in my litecoin wallet.  Shows the transaction and time and all that. 
There is no transaction to click on for my bitcoin one.  I think it has something to do with the exodus wallet now.  Unless, is it normal for transactions to not show up on the blockchain site until they are finished?  its been about 3 hours now...
Sorry im a noob to all this...
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:24:37
no i wouldnt say risky. Risky if you dont put them on a trezor or ledger, which are basically banks to keep offline so you cant hack them.   But if you research other cryptocurrencies (refered to as alt coins by many)  you could see that some have a huge potential to make more profit than bitcoin.  
It's all basically gambling, but from everything happening in politics and the banking industry in the last 10 years, I personally am more affraid to keep my money in a bank than being my own personal banker, which is what bitcoin is.  
I do invest in gold and silver also mostly because i think the prices have been kept artificially low for a long time and at any moment can sky rocket as well.  
Everyone i know, even my mom, is leaving facebook though.  And zuckerberg is a sketchy bastard in my opinion.

@_date: 2017-11-04 22:14:34
right. But as we progress into the future more and more people are accepting bitcoin as money.  It will come to the point where you don't have to cash out.  You will be able to buy a corporation if the owner is willing to sell for bitcoin.  What makes bitcoin so attractive to these businesses is normally they would be charged enormous fees to trade that amount of money, bitcoin is emailing that money straight from one person to the other cutting out the bankers and the fees that come along with it.  
In my opinion we are betting on bitcoin to eventually take over the banking system during the next economic crash.

From my understanding a decentralized banking system means the community governing itself.  Exactly like we see happening with the community calling off the b2x fork. 
 Bitcoin is the start of a decentralized banking system.  Something the world has never seen before.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:12:10
i wouldn't put your entire lump sum into strictly bitcoin.  I would go 75% bitcoin and 25% alt coins.  
The alt coins I look for to invest in are ideas that seem like they have the potential to disrupt an entire industry and have a strong team of developers and programers behind them.  A lot of alt coins are complete scams but some do have the potential to have gains bigger than bitcoin in my opinion.

@_date: 2018-03-19 07:24:13
i own a restaurant/bar.  I am looking into accepting bitcoin but have no clue how to create pr codes that fluctuate with the price of bitcoin, and have no idea how to do taxes if i'm accepting multiple transactions a day with the price fluctuations.  It's a lot to learn and i'm new to the cryptospace.  I can barely do taxes myself as it is.  
But, if you did this i bet you would have a ton of people lining up  during a bull market.  I also have multiple friends that own business' that I have convinced to invest in bitcoin already that would most likely start accepting bitcoin but don't know exactly how it would work with taxes and how much work it would end up being.  
Even an online service, like   
If i could send in my menu, adobe illustrator format, and someone added bitcoin qr codes to it.  Simple business.  That would work.  Is that a thing already? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:32:43

but with a deflationary currency things work different.  
 
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:47:59
Kinda Confused about the question but, when you watch the prices on worldcoinindex.com, all the coins spike and dip huge amounts of money at the exact same time. Without these massive spikes, the coins have relatively random trading patterns.  Just things i've noticed in the short amount of time i've been into this.  
If you mean how can one person keep an eye on this all the time... it's impossible.  The government can't even do it. I think thats why they are terrified. 
If bitcoin does what it has been doing for the last 9 years, it will suck all the money right out of the banks.  I believe thats what it is designed to do. 
I'm relatively knew to the crypto game, but it looks like there are whales or groups of people out there with billions of dollars set up in trading bots that can manipulate the market at their own whim.  This is why we see massive spikes in all the coins at the exact same time.  People say it's because bitcoin causes the rise and fall of the crypto tide, but I think it's a couple peoples/groups bots making these massive trades at exactly the same time.     I don't think they will crash it, i think they are making it so appealing to the masses that it will be impossible to ignore. Hodl for the ride. I think the dollar and all other fiat has run its course and we are witnessing the biggest revolution in human history.  The public finally have a choice of what currency they want to use.  
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:03:16

@_date: 2018-03-18 19:11:22
right.  I see this as good though.   It will put into perspective what people consider to be worth buying.  Maybe then people will stop buying all this pointless shit like lambos and gold chains and 700 dollar bottles of Grey goose and start building business' that help people and make them more crypto.  
The world is destroying itself in the current inflationary system.  Don't believe people who tell you deflationary is bad.  Those are bankers that have offered us this bullshit materialistic perspective of the world so they can continue to sell us shit and keep us enslaved.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:17:43

@_date: 2018-03-18 19:04:43
yeah exactly. people will stop creating and buying stupid shit that no one actually needs. 
This will cause a huge restructuring of what we consider to be valuable all together.  No one is going to blow their money on lambos or gold chains or just shit they don't need at all.  We will see a ton of businesses go under.  
Just look at puerto rico.  Crypto people plan on rebuilding it into a future crypto city.  
 My plan is to use my crypto savings to start another business that makes more crypto and pays people in crypto.  Not buy a lambo or flaunt my money like some jackass.

the current system is a ponzi scheme.  If you keep a savings account in a bank your money depreciates in value by 2% through inflation every year.  Inflation is another word the bankers like to use for "we steal your money".
With the money they steal they use it to control the education system and media keep to public ignorant and keep the war machine/slavery system operating. 
If nothing more, the corrupt banking system is not using my money to fund the slavery/war machine.  
The current US dollar price of Bitcoin is 7700. But you can't put a price on freeing humanity from thousands of years of banker corruption and suppression.

It's so weird watching reddit, as the price climbs everyone asks for a huge dip back to 10000 to buy more.  When its dropping people actually think its going to 0 and lose their shit about the price not rising.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:48:33
right.  but at least it's a step in the right direction.  It makes it harder for the bankers to rob people.  Before it was a swipe of one mans pen would do the trick.  Bitcoin makes that harder to do.

i'm new to bit coin but it seems like it either goes way up on friday, (payday)  or drops  (party time).  
I feel like we should be following technology trends rather than stock market trends.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:37:07
you honestly think all these traders are just going to quit making millions of dollars?  It will hit the bottom and people will start buying again.  
The next run up will be insane because a lot more people know about it now, the stock market is in, the tech is going to start being actually utilized, this is still the very beginning in my opinion.  
The dudes who held through the first 9 years are getting paid out for their belief in the tech.  Now that so many people are aware of cryptos, it is impossible to stop.  
"they" are just trying to shake out the weak guys right now.

How is your money inflating a good pro?  
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:54:33
I disagree 100%.   Start this video at 39 minute mark.  Inflation is theft by the banking system.  The bankers created inflation to enslave humanity.  The Bible tells a  story of how inflation was discovered.

If you said bankers, your right....
You should watch this four part series.  This is Ronald Bernard.  He's exposing the banking system for being run by Satanists.   
Banks have always funded both sides of every war. They see humanity as nothing more than cattle and use us as  resources.

hmmmm.  This could have happened to me my first time trying to invest.  called my bank, asked about a wire transfer, told them it was for bit coin.  The girl said she couldn't help and hung up.  Then my account was locked for suspicion of fraud.  Had to go to the bank and spend an hour with a manager to get it unlocked.  quite annoying.

Or does the exchange just know how much you bought and use that?

well if all these politicians and hollywood assholes keep getting exposed like they are things will eventually lead to the banking system being exposed for blackmailing these people they put in power.  
That will most likely lead to a bank run and a spike in gold, silver, and precious metals like always happens in the past, plus cryptos which will be a much easier way to exchange wealth than gold or silver in my opinion. 
I think in 30 years fiat currency will be done. 
If these politicians and hollywood assholes somehow cover up their crime spree again, then I would expect the world to slowly be deteriorated to wasteland ran by pedophiles enslaving dumb drunk retards sending them to sacrifice themselves in war to their Owl God Molech.  yeah sounds crazy, i've gone down the old rabbit hole as they say...

Yes psychedelic of course.  The new studies on psychedelics show that they are one of the only substances in the world that can regrow braincells.  
Scientists have also had great success in curing PTSD.  
And from personal experience and many testimonies they will blow your depression right out of the water, slap you in the face, and say "get the fuck over your stupid bullshit bud.  Your problems are created by yourself and no one else.  Figure out how to be happy and be a good person cause your mind is very confused about reality right now."

Its weird but i think some people still actually trust the banks and don't completely understand that a centralized banking system is the cause of just about all the problems in the world.  
The more people learn how corrupt the banking system is, the more people will go to bitcoin.

Cool.  Yea work isn't bad just sounds like you were overdoing yourself a lot.  The actual city of Salt Lake is awesome.  You get the mtns and a city right next to each other.  Plus the mormon factor is a lot less in the city than the surrounding suburbs.  I'm sure it wouldn't hurt you to drop 1000 dollars on a pass to snowbird and enjoy skiing while your body still allows you too.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:28:47
really ? after reading all those quotes from the 'Elite' that say it's a flat out evil scam you still think fiat is legit?  Any reasoning behind that? Just curious as why you think it is more legit than bitcoin.  I think bitcoin is massively undervalued and the fear coming from the bankers lend evidence to them knowing that.

im also wondering how to set up cold storage.  I have an old macbook i never use anymore.  
I'm using and exodus wallet for bitcoin and some alt coins.  
I'm guessing I connect to the internet once.
 download the exodus wallet
 enter in the private key (20 words.)  
Then my wallet will show up with the cryptos.  
Then i can delete my old wallet off the computer i use to access the internet?  Do i still need to use a VPN?

Wow, I'm 32. I have $12,000 total.  I snowboard almost everyday in the winter, and camp every weekend in the summer.  I spent all my money on a restaraunt/bar that i own that just started making a profit after 4 years.  I consider myself very happy and proud of the way I set up my life.  
I figured out when i was real young that a 9-5 job is the cheese grater for your soul.  
Stop working, take your 100,000 dollars and travel around the world and surf and snowboard and bang chicks.  Get a hold of yourself man! You got a million dollars!

The thing is more and more people all over the world can communicate instantly with one another.  The world and technology specifically is moving much more rapidly today than it was even 5 years ago. 
The amount of money that is still available to be poured into bitcoin is insane.  Not even 2% of people have invested yet.  I think we are in the very beginning stages of 'going viral' right now.  The new healthy virus will take over and eliminate the old virus!

I rent a place in Salt Lake city.  The rent is super cheap and the housing market is just starting to go up.  I also lease the bar, started it with 30,000 dollars.  It was a shit ton of work but worth it in the end.  
If i didn't get out and snowboard and camp and mtn bike and rock climb i would be completely miserable.  It's nice being my own boss but you still need balance between real life and work.
