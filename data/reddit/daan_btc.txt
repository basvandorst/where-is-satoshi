An update from Bitonic:
This is not new to us. In most cases the bank will call the customer to verify whether the transaction is legitimate or not.
We suspect they were not able to contact their customer in this case, which resulted in a complaint on twitter, which then turned into the subsequent outrage on twitter. Most likely, the ING “webcare” employee 
misinterpreted the situation. 
It's not that we agree with this policy, but it has been in place with most (Dutch) banks for several years now.
So, ING Bank is **NOT** blocking their clients from buying Bitcoin. 
The latest comment (today) from ING about this situation:
(English translation):
"You can buy bitcoins with your ING bank account. Unfortunately, some confusion has arisen on this matter. We apologize for this"
