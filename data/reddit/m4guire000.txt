I think is about diversification: the stock market (as ETF or index funds) used to be the risky investment while real estate or bonds were the safe. Not that economy changed, stocks are the only way to get that 3-5% per year so it became the safe route compared to speculative bitcoin (or negative bonds). I think both investments can be in one person portfolio, for diversification.

Do they take cards or only bank transfer payments?

I mainly use Bitstamp that has a flat 0.5% fee on monthly turnaround of less than 10k, so no fixed fees whatsoever

Most of the exchanges use a % fee on each transaction value so it does not matter is you buy once a month or once a week

At the moment I got the screen pin configured on my Trezor, but I don’t have the pass phrase enabled. Does the pass phrase ensure total security in case of physical attack on Trezor? I was reading about that and Trezor seems pretty weak when physically attacked.

Agree, the more I read the more it makes sense. The dips are our pot of gains, so this could be more effective than a daily buy always st the same time of the day, which could easily miss flash crash and sudden rises!

Hi Vexcoin, just to be crystal clear, what password (i.e. of minimum 10 characters) are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:21:49
I did not get what you mean...the monthly allowance does not change and I know it’s money I could lose. DCA is a way to cope with fluctuations and unpredictability and seeing the high variance of the crypto market I just though that a more frequent buy action could cope better.

Lol, thanks for the great reaction to my initial question! Reading this now
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:22:57
Makes sense to me, just wAnted to discuss that!

True, I checked, but crazy high fees for small purchases. I’ll stay away!

If you read the article you'll see plenty of scenarios to talk about

Also kraken does something similar, that's why I moved to Bitstamp!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:39:07
Why you stay on kraken? Just move all to Bitstamp, Coinbase or Bitfinex. Kraken is a scam that costed me money. I moved away.
