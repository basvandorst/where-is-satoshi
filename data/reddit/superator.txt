aquentin... the first 400k address you mention has nothing to do with this, and it is easy to show. If you follow the transactions a few steps back.
All of the coins come from a ton of different smaller addresses through this transaction: 
If you follow _any_ of them 1-3 steps, you can see that they all come from mined addresses. Like this one here:
ALL of the 400k in the first address you mention come from generated/mined coins from their original 50btc addresses. Unless you suggest that gox has indeed mined those amounts themselves, these coins do not belong to gox. It is a consolidation of tons of mined addresses. It might be true that a huge part of this ends up being "deposited" into gox though. 
It is, however, interesting that an individual, or a group of individuals do control over 400k MINED coins, which is quite extraordinary.
EDIT: My mistake. as mister2au mentions in a reply ( some of the addresses leading into the 400k does not follow the pattern I so stubbornly suggested. I haven't yet checked all of them, and I guess there are several (many?) others like the one mister2au links to.

"Why is not possibly transferring individual "accounts" to a single Mt Gox "account" ?"
Sure, that is possible. If there are thousands of different customers who each has mined 50BTC around early 2011, and at the same time decide to put their mined coins into Gox. To me, this seems quite unlikely.
Sure, it could be a gox "account", but none of the coins have never been in any circulation after they were mined, before they were consolidated into the 400k address. So the only alternatives I can see are;
1. The 400k coins were mined by gox themselves (in which case they would belong to mark/gox, not their customers)
2. The 400k coins belongs to a miner (or a group of miners) who suddenly decided to move all the coins into gox - as a single accountholder. This does seem quite strange, no?
3. Like 2, but the owner we're not stupid enough to transfer 400k coins into an exchange, giving up their direct control of ~3% of all bitcoins in existence.
This is such a large amount of coins, that I'd guess they belong to someone who had a solid head start with asic-miners over the rest of the community. It would be very interesting to hear your thoughts about who might have been able to mine such amounts in early 2011.

As you can see if you follow that initial 400k transaction, all the inputs come from fresh generated coins (like this wallet: 
So unless Gox mined these themselves, none of it belongs to gox, and the days destroyed is merely the miners moving stuff around.
Still, 400k is a pretty insane amount. This all seems to belong to a single individual (or group of miners that started mining in 2010).

As I replied in another thread.. Part of the spike comes from a movement of 400k dormant coins ( that have nothing to do with gox.

I'm sorry, you are absolutely right. I only checked 20-30 of the addresses going into the 400k wallet, and all of them were generated around the same time and moved at the same time out of there. I will check the rest of the transactions now, but the one you point to has, as you say, a very different footprint.
Thanks for the info, and sorry for being so certain, when I was, in fact, wrong :)

Hehe, I'm just a reddit-lurker who haven't really logged into my account for a loong time. I'm interested in bitcoin, and decided to mention my findings. 
Sadly, I do not own a single bitcoin, let alone 400k.
I'd love different explanations. I have just pointed out that all of the 400k stems from freshly mined addresses, and they have never been move before the consolidation.
