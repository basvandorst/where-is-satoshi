You don't. You settle the trade directly with the other party, not with Bitsquare. Bitsquare only holds BTC locked until the trade is complete, and finds an arbitrator in case of a dispute.

Yes, if you can catch the thief, and unless he already spent/hide the cash, it might be possible to return stolen cash. If it appears impossible to seize the cash, police can seize his other property for restitution, or a court can order him to produce the stolen cash or an equivalent and (under some jurisdiction, e.g. in the US) hold him under contempt in jail indefinitely until he complies. But exactly the same applies to Bitcoin theft. If the thief is caught, the police can seize his private keys if they are found on his computer or in some other tangible form, or the police can seize his other property, or a court can order him to produce the keys or equivalent money/property and hold him under contempt in jail indefinitely until he complies. Bitcoin transactions moving stolen funds are even easily traceable than cash transactions (of course, it still might be difficult to unwind the chain of transactions back to the theft when stolen funds are mixed enough with other coins).

By the way, the same applies to cash transactions. Bitcoin was specifically designed to be similar to cash in this aspect.

The attacker does not have to pay tx fees with stolen coins. He could pay from his existing stash of clean coins. By the way, are you sure that every piece of BTC (or USD, for that matter) that you own was never stolen, used to evade taxes, buy illegal drugs or weapons, or were proceeds of some other crime? Money are considered fungible in most jurisdictions and crypto-currencies are intended to be fungible as well.

Why not to mine an old transaction if it pays enough fee?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:17
I do not follow you reasoning. A few weeks ago everybody posted here like "Coinbase must add support for bcash asap so everybody could dump it". Now that they've added it, they suddenly became enemies and conspirators. Wat?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:38
Perhaps you already know this, but let me mention that empty blocks are not useless -- they still add more proof-of-work on top of blocks before them and thus increase the blockchain security.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:46:40
Actually, you can, and it's quite easy. Just add a tiny amount of coins mined after the fork as one of the transaction inputs. Or even add a tiny amount of any coins whose history is tainted with coins mined after the fork. Most of coins bought from an exchange after the fork will do. Then the transaction will be valid only on one chain.

Yes, basically, just because they can. A miner will include any available valid transaction with high enough fee. If the tx fee is high enough on chain 1, it may well be high enough on chain 2. A miner does not care where a tx has originated from (and might not even know it), but only cares about maximizing the fees collected. Although the networks might be separated, but the insulation between them is not water-proof, and it only takes a single party to funnel valid txs between them.

Before trying to claim any forked coin, be sure to move your BTC on the main chain to a new different address first.

I do not think it is restricted to Delaware only. It is essential though, that to held you in contempt the judge has to believe you are still maintaining control over the funds and are able to comply with the order. You will not be held in jail just because you owe something but are insolvent and have no means to repay it. Unfortunately, there is still a possibility of a judicial error, when the judge believes you have the funds, while in fact, you do not.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:01:28
I'm not sure I completely understand your question. Economically motivated miners choose a chain to mine on based on their expectations of the exchange rate between forked coins after their coinbase txs are unlocked (100 blocks). They can have different expectations, so they can choose different chains to mine. I did not mean that the same particular miner would be economically motivated to mine on both chains at the same time. I meant that there is a possibility that the same miner may be motivated to select txs from both mempools to include in a block on his chain, in case those txs appear valid on his chain.

Why would it collapse? All hodlers have about the same amount of BCH as BTC.

It its current state, Bitcoin is not suitable for savings, but only as a high-risk investment. Everybody using it should be aware of that.

"Official bitcoin" is an oxymoron. There is no (and should not be) any single authority to decide what Bitcoin is.

There is nothing in a transaction that would make it "from blockchain1". There is no wall between networks preventing propagation of transactions between them. If it is a valid tx according to the rules of a chain, it can be mined on that chain. If it is valid on several chains, it can be mined on each of them. If it can be mined and have a fee large enough to interest a miner to include it in a block, it will be mined.

It also shows $252 VWAP for LTC (while the price is $62), must be some kind of bug.

In fact, in the U.S., if a judge believes you are willfully refusing to surrender stolen (or otherwise wrongfully owned) money or property contrary to a court order, you may be held in contempt of court and incarcerated indefinitely, until you comply with the order. See

There is no A1 and A2. Both chains still use exactly the same address A, controlled by exactly the same private key. Nobody have to do something special to "thoroughly mirror" you transactions. If a transaction is valid on both chains, miners have an incentive to mine it and include in blocks on both chains (because it has some fees attached). You can try to broadcast two transactions A-&gt;B and A-&gt;C at the same time (technically, a double-spend) and hope that each chain will pick up a different transaction first and reject the other as a double-spend after, but you might need to repeat this step (and pay associated fees) multiple times until you succeed. Another way, as I said, is to wait until some post-fork coinbase transaction will be mined on, say, chain 1, purchase some coins whose history is tainted with this transaction, and include any amount of those coins (however small) as an input in your transaction (A+taint)-&gt;B. This way you make sure that the transaction is valid only on one chain (chain 1, where the coinbase transaction exists) and cannot be replayed on the other (chain 2, where it tries to spend a non-existing input). After this transaction is confirmed, you can broadcast A-&gt;C. It will be rejected on chain 1 (as a double-spend attempt), but will be valid on chain 2. After it is confirmed, you have you balance on two chains at different addresses B and C, immune to any further replay attempts.

Txs can and will be broadcast and replayed across all chains where they are considered valid (because of their fees). One would need to add some newly mined coins to the inputs to prevent this.

Suppose you are a miner mining on chain 1, motivated economically rather than ideologically (we could safely assume that at least some miners have economical motivation). You have a limited space in each block, so, to maximize your profit, you want to fill it with valid txs paying the highest fees. Technically, you easily can have access to mempools both on network 1 and network 2. Both pools may have unconfirmed transactions with pre-fork inputs that would be valid on chain 1 that you are mining on. If you have to choose between some transactions from mempool 1 with lower sat/byte and some transactions from mempool 2 with higher sat/byte, why would you choose the former over the latter? There is no economical reason to do so. You do not care where a particular tx came from, you only care if it pays a higher fee (provided it is valid). The replay does not require any malicious actor, it just happens during normal mining process, in case of a chain split.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:47:34
Broadcasting two transactions A-&gt;B and A-&gt;C can have different outcomes:
 
1. (Replay) One of them is confirmed on both chains, and the other is rejected on both chains as a double-spend.
2. (Successful split) One of them is confirmed on one chain, and the other is confirmed on the other chain. Each transaction is rejected as a double-spend on the chain other than where it has been confirmed.
If your goal is to split coins, you can do this repeatedly until you get lucky and reach the desired outcome 2 (successful split). But you have to pay fees for every attempt. I do not think I can estimate probability of each outcome, or how many attempts on average it would take until the split is successful. So this approach should eventually work, but may require paying significant fees in the process. If two chains have different hashpower, this approach can be improved using RBF and time-locked txs. Once you have made at least one successful split, any part of its outputs (however small) can be used to taint other transactions, making them non-replayable.
Even if miners on both sides happen to select exactly the same txs for their blocks, the chains still will not be identical, because they will have different coinbase txs, and after those are unlocked and spent, all later transactions tainted with them will also be non-replayable. RBF and block interval variance can also make chains to diverge.
