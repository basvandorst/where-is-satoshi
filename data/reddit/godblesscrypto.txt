And what if the seller sent me pair rocks, instead of a pair of kicks that I actually ordered?

Bitcoin fan here .. if we go back to fixed money supply with no levers to pull in times of economic stagnation (think 2008 Great Recession), isn't that bad thing ...
One of the reasons we recovered from 2008 recession and create jobs (for young people) is by printing money and thus discouraging the people(esp old) from saving 
What am I missing?

Consumes a lot of power, though -- 1980W (S9/S9i is around 1400W)

It could most likely be proxies for other large miners not wanting to look like they control too much
It just seems odd that [BTC.TOP]( (owned by Jihan) hash rate fell from 25% to 13% in a span of few weeks

No one wants a POW change more than Bitmain .... With sha256 they're competing against a huge installed base.
Also, with Moore's law slowing fast \(Intel had to switch from tick\-tock to tick\-tock\-tock\), their\(Bitmain's or any ASIC producer's\) clout would only decrease over time ... bullish for bitcoin

They seem to charge $.055 cents per kilowatt hour .. that is about 5 cents kwh  = 36$ per kwh per month (24 * 0.05 * 30) = 50$ per S9 ... pretty good. But there seems to be catch: they take away 20 % of the rewards .. hmmm

But, isn't there the argument that going back  to fixed money supply will leave us with no levers to pull in times of economic stagnation (think 2008 Great Recession) ....

Aren't they (fabs, lithogrpahy etc), gonna come up with some shenanigans to keep the show going ie 4nm then 2nm then sub-nanometer ... There is too much money for grabs (to keep the Moore's law going) ... No?
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:46:24


It is probably, majorly this. It just seems odd that [BTC.TOP]( (owned by Jihan) hash rate fell from 25% to 18% in a span of few weeks

There are probably ASIC manufactures mining (secretly) with their more efficient (and thus profit making) next-generation miners(think Antminer S11), before selling them to the public ...
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:19:49
Well, the argument is that if fed did not inject more money, the young people would not have had many jobs (coz the older people would just sit on cash) 
In a way, inflation/money printing is seen as a mechanism to keep the old rich from getting way too rich and keep the young people(without trust funds) actively working and contributing to the economy and create new wealth in the process ...a net benefit for the soceity, or so they claim

does the "segwit" part of segwit2x kill ASICBOOST? or will ASICBOOST live (to die another day)?
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:37:19
Hmmm ...
Regarding ASICBOOST:
If a individual miner uses Antminer S9, but mines on Slush Pool (and thus not on Jihan's pools ie viabtc/antpool), will SegWit/SegWit2x affect the said individual miner, in terms of profitability

No one wants a POW change more than Bitmain With sha256 they’re competing against a huge installed base.
And, with Moore’s law slowing fast (Intel had to switch from tick-tock to tick-tock-tock), their(Bitmain’s or any ASIC producer’s) clout would only decrease over time … bullish for bitcoin

Seems like GMO folks chose to do place\-and\-route(as opposed to custom routing) for their physical design.
With shrinking gate sizes, efficient routing is very important ....

Federal Reserve is a bubble. We will go back to fixed money supply with no levers to pull in times of economic stagnation (think 2008 Great Recession)
@_date: 2019-06-24 08:34:51
Okay .. I have to jump in here .. what provides is not a "cloud mining scam". As an existing customer, I can vouch that I have control over the pool I point to and all that. In fact, I use slushpool paying directly to my wallet. The miners have been running consistently well (so, did not have the need to do VPN/awesomeminer and all that) . So, life is easy!!!

"FWIW, no one wants a POW change more than Bitmain ....  With sha256d they're competing against a huge installed base. "
So true. I hope this message gets across to more people ...

Why is running your own node considered more safe?
(Crypto well wisher here!!!)
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:33:30


Not to split hairs, but isn't 7nm being targeted already?
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:44:55
Wow!!! Awesome explanation. I appreciate it.
Now, to the next part:
if for some reason, I lose the node(harddisk corrupted, or burglary) etc would I lose all my bitcoin in there? Are there ways to remediate this?

Central banks have suits with degrees from pristine and prestigious institutions continually defending them ....
Bitcoin needs and has a principled community that continually defends it ...
DO NOT confuse people trying to make a quick buck (like Jinnah Wu and the two-lettered binance guy) as part of the Bitcoin's principled community
