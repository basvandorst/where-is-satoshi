avoid the deal if communication is not good.
do not deal with a new user (no history, low volume).
Meet the buyer in a safe place, go to the meeting with friends if you never seen the seller before.
Never sell/buy a big amount the first time (one or two btc, then do another trade when you're sure buye/seller is honest.
Ask for the verification code before giving him money, if he show you the code (the same you have of course!), you are sure he send the btc and won't be abble to take them back.
Localbitcoins is one the better place to trade btc, but go carefully until you have trusted partners!
You're are safer as buyer than as seller ...

your one!
programming one is quite easy (json request/php-html display)
I would be pleased to do one for you, as you give me your requirements.
I will charge from 0.4btc to 1btc depending how much datas you want to handle, and if you want it as simple html/php/js page that you can run localy or host on your own server, or want it embedded in an Ios or Android app. I do not propose .exe cause MS sucks..
You just have to read the API doc and determine what you want to monitor and what you want to be able to do...
pm if interested

sell or buy your btc by one or two, you will avoid predators...try first to meet the geek community in your town, that most often is invoved in other things, like hacking, electronics or art projects..then trade with cool guy you can drink a beer with...if you want to do trade with guns and bank, there is already a currency developped in this meaning, it's called dollar, or elsewhere euro...

take care with bank transfer, they are reversible easily, bank don't like bitcoin, and the buyer just have to say 'I've been scammed' or 'i didn't receive any good' and bank will cancel transfer

you forget the withdraw from mtGox, it could take 3 or 4 month if happy...what about your trick if btc cost $180 in 3 month?
if you don't withdraw, Mtgox show large variation (obviously market manipulation), where btc-e seems to be more rational...your benefit will be eaten by a big fall, or you will be to buy back at a really largest price..

beside, the documentation on localbitcoins is a must to read before anything...there is a lot of advises you must follow.

sell at 210, the parabolic behaviour of the uptrend let think it will go even higher, and the 200 one time reached will trigger a massive buy too..

use the API to get data from this site, but simplest :download metatrader 4 (from btc-e tradig platform for example) : I think what you plane to do already exist in MT4...

it's not off topic, bitcoin is now a serious saving option, that could escape to this kind of terrorist attack of bankers...
From my side, if I was IFM, I would better suggest to oblige all people (including childrens) to make a 100000 euros loan at 49% to bank, so they can pay back taxes to governments!

nice maths, but, up to now, btc crashes (and rise up) are all caused by unpredicable event or insiders manipulation...should work when btc go to really to mainstream..
