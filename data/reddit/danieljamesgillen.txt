Yes that is an interesting idea actually. Gold used to be the standard, but people didn't buy and sell in gold (usually), they used other currencies based on Gold itself. Maybe we will see the same in Crypto, what a fucking interesting future we are in for. Thanks for your reply.

No there really isn't, this sub is almost 80% nonsense like this. It offers absolutely nothing. Mods, please perma ban OP.

Cyrptocurrency is already replacing cash in several markets. For example underground dark web purchases are done very frequently in bitcoin, other criminal gangs use it as well.
Also in countries like Venezuela where the currency is rapidly loosing any value, bitcoin is a much better replacement for many people.
If the same thing ever happens to Western fiat currency (and it really really could), bitcoin (or similar tech) could replace the currency in peoples day to day dealings.

Aren't there fundamental problems within Bitcoin that cannot be developed further, and would be better addressed through a new cryptocurrency? That is the point I am getting at.

Very good point, very interesting future ahead.

I agree very much with what he says, but why do we believe that the currency of the future will be Bitcoin? I believe very strongly the future currency (that everyone uses day to day) will be crypto, but I'm not sure it will be Bitcoin. It doesn't seem fundamentally able to handle that kind of use. Maybe I am missing something though?

Can you link to a video? They sound fun.

Sure we are not there yet I agree.

Satoshi's opening lines mentioned Bitcoin being a peer to peer electronic cash.
When you restrict the blocksize, you make Bitcoin slow and expensive to use, to ever be used as cash it needs to be cheap and virtually costless.
For a long time, I bought into the Roger Ver hate here, but now the more I learn about it, it seems BCH are on the 'right side' of this ideological disagreement.
I can't for the life of me think what advantages BTC has over BCH? Can you name some?
I hold a very small amount of both coins, I'm not some 'coinomaniac' so would appreciate polite and helpful replies.

Hey so firstly thanks for the reply.
So from what I understand, you are arguing BTC is more 'Gold like' in that ten years from now, it's unlikely to change to much? Whereas BCH could do anything?   
An interesting point, but it does nothing to demonstrate BTC is a better \*currency\*.

" Bitcoin could be the TCP/IP "  
If only the devs were not strangling block size that could be true.

I'd say they are both part of the same 'church' but historically different. I can be married in an Orthodox church as long as I am baptised catholic. If I was protestant that would not be possible.

It was a schism not a total split.

It's a lot more fun than holding a fiat which only ever slowly becomes worth less.

Yup, the fact we even need lightning means something is wrong. Bitcoin is supposed to be p2p cash. I don't get why we need this hugely complicated Lightning Network on top? Why not just gradually raise the blocksize limit?

SEO of bitcoin here. Can confirm.

Fiat USD could also crumble in the same amount of time. Have you heard of hyper inflation in Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, or Venezuela ?
