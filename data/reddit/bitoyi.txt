Technically, it is not an insider trading, unlike company shares owned by company’s managements, bitcoin network is not owned by Korean officials.

North Korea is one of the reasons, not the only reasons. Of course people want to profit from crypto investments

Same things happen to public’s sentiments towards the economy. Human greed has no limit! I have never heard a Japanese who has experienced the crazy bubble during the 1980s saying the economy is good today, even though it is healthier now, but the bubble was too high back then, everything compare with it is considered low and bad.

Last time we backed our currency with gold and failed because mainly the French and German sensed the US has been printing more money than before and they were redeeming gold back to there countries in large amount, we simply did not have enough gold for all those paper notes we’ve printed.
The problem with pegging the money with gold is always human greed, people in power had and will always  debase the currency’s value in exchange for more political power and government expend without doing hard works and creating real value.

To whom can I redeem this for real BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:08:08
No, I use BitFlyer’s app, it’s a Japanese exchange. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:28:40
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:27:41
Pay with bitcoin you can still get 8% tax free, plus 5%off in bic camera. However, I got those bitcoin around 4000 USD. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:29:56
Tips: Download the BitFlyer app and sign up, it’ll smooth the whole process. Just think of it as a Japanese metro card.

Around 23 JPY.

I saw many comments says that it’s not really paid with bitcoin because it’s off chain. However, I’d rather think that it’s like a metro card, people use cash to charge the card, it does not mean the payment by metro card is not using JPY. 
You made a small deposit to the exchange which is still on chain, then use the system built by the exchange, in order to smooth the whole process. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:06:10
First you tell the clerk that you want to use bitcoin, and she will let you press ‘agree’ to the  terms on their iPhone screen, then she entered the JPY number to convert into BTC. Finally you use your phone to scan the QR code displayed on the screen. Done. 
FYI, I used BitFlyer, I made a small deposit to its App, it took 1 second to confirm the payment. However I’m not sure if you can use your own wallet app.

The merchant uses BitFlyer’s system. However it seems that you can use your own wallet app as long as you set the transaction fees on normal. (I went to read the term.)

First, it’s now 1USD=7.83HKD, 
second, it is not US government pegged the USD to HKD, it’s a monetary policy enforced by HK government, who might cancel the policy as soon as they run out of USD reserves, which will soon happen when HK people starting to run on the banks...
