This is the correct way of plotting a log scale. You chose a lowest number and the other prices are multiples of that number. It‘s impossible to start at zero. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:56:01
In that case, I'd calculate percentage from the top like this:
That's 8.46 % below the dick line.

Try visiting it with torbrowser or other proxy. It‘s only geoblocked. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:57:10
In order to calculate the percentage, you'd have to make an assumption where to place the lowest point on the y-axis. In my case it's $0.10. If you want a smaller number, you could chose $0.01 or if you want the percentage to look bigger, you'd use $1.00
That would make the whole 5%-number pretty unscientific.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:32:45
So you are saying the prediction is foolish and it is made by a fool.

@_date: 2018-08-31 14:09:46
The chart looks different depending on the rather arbitrary lowest number on the y-axis.
I can make the chart look like it's only 3%
or like it's around 7%
Both charts represent the same prices, just a different choice of where to start the price in the lower left hand corner.
I'd love to have an objective number and maybe someone with a better math background could contribute?

The McAfee dickline will cross 10,000 on May 23. So with a pretty high probability, the price will stay above 10,000 after that.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:09:24
That would look like this:
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:53:27
I kind of understand your point and I think it's a great idea. I'm just trying to come up with a formula that I can feed into the site.
Looking at the logorithmic chart, the difference looks more like 5% of the way, ... but: you can see that the chart starts at $ 0.10 and not $0.00 - That is because you'd get a division by zero error. of course the 0.10 is completely arbitrary. If I'd chose 1 or 10, the chart would look totally different.

Could you please explain how the mining cost keeps the price down? My assumption was that the mining cost would be around the value of the block reward plus mining fee.
If the mining network costs more to operate than it gets rewarded, miners start losing money and the least efficient ones will stop mining. Difficulty will adjust, thus making it cheaper to mine. If the fiat\-price rises, mining will be more profitable and more miners will join. My assumption was that mining cost would on average be slightly below the reward. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I used the start date of the original tweet: July 17th 2017 with a target of 1 million on December 31st 2020.
I thought about using the date of the second tweet, but thought it would be nicer to use the longer prediction period. Do you think we should have an option to change the start date?

Growth implies that there is a percentage by which the number increases. That inevitably leads to an exponential curve. Because math, you know?

With $1 million per btc ($21 trillion in total) it would be a little bigger than the current US national debt.

Nice collection. I should make my tracker more flexible so I can also show those other predictions.

Woops. Sorry bout that. I'm from Germany and we use the word billion differently (the confusing story here: 
Let's say there will be 19,000,000 btc by the end of 2020 and they are worth $1,000,000 each. That is 19,000,000,000,000 market cap. That's called 19 trillion in short scale. A huge amount of money, indeed.
Almost three times the value of all gold above ground. Almost 10 % of all real estate.

The price is rising exponentially for years. Is that sustainable forever? No. Maybe we are past peak bitcoin, maybe it will rise to incredible highs. Nobody knows. I'm not the one who made the bet. I'm just the guy who made a chart that shows the curve and compares it to the price.

@_date: 2018-03-11 20:38:13
I totally agree. BTC would have to be a game changer. Just like the internet changed the way we communicate, consume news, buy goods and services, you name it.
Bitcoin would need to do to money what the internet has done to mail, shopping, news papers, television, etc.
We will see if bitcoin can do that. What a great time to be alive!

Of course. And as far as I know, there is no asset steadily rising with an interest of almost 0.5 % PER DAY. But on average bitcoin does that. So far so good.

Thank you for pointing that out. I just bought this domain:
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:52:05
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:11:19
That daily growth with that rate over that period of time will lead to 1.000.000. That's fact. 
I'm not saying anything about the likelihood of bitcoin prices really developing this way. My site simply compares market prices and the theoretical steady growth. I think it's fun to watch this over time.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:54:43
Then how do you explain this (Chart of Down Jones on a log scale)
The Dow Jones grows exponentially, too. There are booms and busts, but on average it keeps growing. It's just slower than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:46:52
Thanks. That domain works, too. But later I thought bircoin.top sounded cooler.

Thanks! It's fixed, now.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:31:51
What growth rate do you use?
By the end of 2020-12-31, the prediction is 1263 days old
1.0048409570343102 to the power of 1263 * $ 2,244.265 = $ 1,000,000.00
Correct me if I'm wrong I'd love to make this as precise as possible. For the sake of simplicity, I assumed that the prediction was made at midnight and the year ends at midnight. (Did not want to calculate hourly rates.)

The red line is McAfee's prediction assuming it grows at a steady rate. Of course he never claimed it would be a smooth ride.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:37:31
Thanks for the heads up. It is on by default and I did not change that in bitcoin.conf
So that can't be the reason, either.

Interesting thought. I could load historic gold prices per day and alter the chart.
How do you mean „flat“? The gold price in US$ did not change much these last years afaik.

Nobody knows how the bitcoin price moves. But comparing it to simple exponential growth is fun.

Is that an upside down U at the end?
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:54:50
Good question. No they are not switched.
On a linear y-scale (counting $1, 2, 3, 4, 5...), the line is a curve because it grows with the same percentage over time. 
If you scale the y axis logarithmically (count $1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000..) the line looks straight, because the doubling time is always the same.

"Forever 21"? Is that because there will only be 21 million bitcoin?

Of course there are limits to this grows and ultimately it will be an s-curve or maybe the exchange rate will be irrelevant if fiat is not used very much in the future.

Interesting thought.
If you want it to go from the prediction day to 10.000 on 1.1.18, you'd need 0.894 % per day. If you extrapolate that to 2020, you get a whooping $ 171 million per BTC. I'm not sure what model he uses, but that can't be it.

If your PIN is not easy to guess, your coins should be safe. The device will make it hard to unlock it by making the user wait longer and longer after each try. (If you want to be extra safe, you can create one or  more hidden wallets that also require an additional passphrase.)
How do you get your funds? There are two options: You buy a fresh new trezor and use your seed words to set it up. When you are done, you have one exactly like your old one. The second option: If you can use the seed word list on electrum. But only do that if you fully trust the computer you are running electrum on. Only do that if you can fully trust your computer (spoiler: you can't).

Don't be afraid. You NEED the ability and confidence to recover your funds with a brand new trezor and your word-list any time. Image your trezor is broken, stolen, lost, etc.
Before you start, make sure you have your seed-list. On newer firmwares, you can practice entering your seed-words without wiping the trezor. You will see, it's actually not hard and not that risky.
