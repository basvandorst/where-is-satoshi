Everyone's needs and wants are different.  A second wallet can be useful for hodling crypto off an exchange for a hard fork.  With a hard fork, you may need to export then import private keys into a new wallet to claim the coins on the hard fork.  You wouldn't want to compromise your main keys/seed phrase by using the wallet for the hard fork.  So you have a second wallet just for the period of the fork.  A second wallet is also good as backup, in the event the first fails and you need immediate access to your funds.
For me, it's been an opportunity to learn about crypto and the tech surrounding it.  
For you it could be different.  &lt;shrug&gt;

Wait ... you DYOR, you invested what you can afford to lose, you have entry and exit plans, you have diversity in other investments ... **dafuq**?  You and your post don't belong here.  Needs moar whenmoon, CNY, Lambos and McAfee dick.
All kidding aside -- excellent post, thorough plan and I *would* wish you best of luck, but you don't need it.  You'll be fine, just fine.  Enjoy the ups and downs; don't forget to look back and give the rest of us a friendly wave, perched high upon that BTC wave.

Firstly you are going to need to preserve the printer and the area it burned in.  Hire three goons and give them yellow caution tape.  Cordone off the area with the yellow tape and tell the goons to keep everybody out.
Secondly you are going to need a container large enough to fit the printer in.  Put the printer in the container -- use the third goon if you need assistance -- and fill the container with distilled water.  It's very important that you only use distilled water.  Not purified.  Tap, purified and drinking water will contaminate the atomized bits of your private keys and you'll wind up with Bitconnect or Tronix.
Thirdly you will need to carefully collect all the materials that came out of the printer in the fire.  There are burned up bits of your paper wallet in there, so be sure to get them all.
Nextly pulverize the printer, the collected materials into a mash inside the container.  Carefully sift out all the electronics, wiring and plastic bits.  You will be left with just the paper containing your private keys.
Finally you'll need to put the wet paper mash into a centrifuge.  You likely don't have a centrifuge so use your goons to spin the container at exactly 132,009 RPMs.  This will reconstitute any paper wallet containing bitcoin.
Carefully peel the paper mash from the sides of the container/centrifuge to dry -- again use your goons to protect your paper wallet while it drys.  John McAfee is out of jail and may come steal it then give it away on Twitter.
Once the paper is dry copy the private keys to another piece of paper.  Now you have a backup.  Kill the goons; they know too much.
Note - this only works for a HP 8625 and all Brother printers.  I've tried it and was successful seventeen times.  Fuck Epson and Ricoh printers.
You're welcome.

Well the first rule of investing is don't invest what you can't afford to lose.  I can afford to lose what I've got in it.  I wouldn't like it.  I'd be pretty damn mad actually.  I might even fucking swear.  But I could still pay bills, make ends meet and generally get along without it.  
That said -- this was a worthwhile opportunity to learn more about the tech of cryptocurrencies.
Oh, gotta run -- need to use  [Gmaìl.ru]( to login to my Google account; the regular address is under going maintenance and thus inaccessible, so says the link I just received. WCGW?

For now, sorta yes?  However -- it's a good idea to not fall too far behind in firmware updates and/or Ledger Live updates.  Should a firmware update brick your Ledger, you just need a new Ledger + your seed phrase backup to restore access.  Moreover the Ledger uses BIP39 so you could restore access using another BIP39 wallet -- hardware, software -- in the event of a failure, lost, etc.  Not a lot of downside to keeping the Ledger updated, unless you can't afford another one, don't have your seed phrase backup or can't be bothered to figure out restoring to a software wallet in an urgent emergency.

If you used the old Chrome app to manage the Ledger you'll need to either update the firmware to use it with the Ledger Live or preserve a copy of the old Chrome app somehow so it won't auto-update since it's been deprecated by Ledger.

I CRISPR edited 24 pigeons so they each have a birth defect corresponding to the BIP39 index of one word in my mnemonic. I determine the wordlist order by the dots and bands on their plumage.   I trained the birds to fly back to me after every full moon.  With procreation, my mnemonic will be distributed and decentralized.  I'm now getting two each of word 3, 5, 18 and 21, three of word 2 and four of words 15 and 16 on the full moon checkin.  Word 6 is an overacheiver -- eight of 'em last month!
Now ... I gotta deal with the neighbor's cat.  The fucker keeps attacking word 24 everytime it flies home.

Do you mean 100BTC (\~$810,000) or $100 in BTC (\~0.0122 BTC)?  I don't have an answer for either however the former seems like an excessive amount to experiment with.  The advise from u/coinjaf seems appropriate in that case -- just adjust your coin requirement by an order of magnitude or more.

Voyager has no fee trades, yes.  But -- there is a not insignificant withdrawal fee for Bitcoin.  Withdrawing ₿0.002585 yields an "industry standard" fee of ₿0.000500.  So that ₿0.002585 (\~$21) becomes ₿0.002085 ($17) by the time it hits your wallet:  effectively a 20% withdrawal fee.
Even with the new %0.50 maker fee, Coinbase Pro wouldn't charge that much until a transaction exceeds $1,000.
