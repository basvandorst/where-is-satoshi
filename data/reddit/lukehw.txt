I said that bitcoin was about to go down, and people said that I was an idiot and downvoted. This is the same thing that kicked off the Great Depression; too many players in the market with no idea what they’re doing. Bitcoin got too popular for its own good, and at the first sign of trouble people quicksold everything.

People who bought bitcoins without any idea what crypto currency and pull out at the first sign of trouble to anybody willing to buy it.

I don't think this will last forever. It might last for a long time but it seems like this is the same mentality that lead to the Great Depression: people kept buying stock because they didn't want to lose out. When this ends, there's probably going to be a hard crash.

I don't know the exact websites, but from what I've heard they import and export people like cargo. I heard about some busts on the news a while ago. And Ross is not a hero for fueling people's drug addictions and creating an easy way for dealers to transport their product.

Yeah, my typo

Alright. I'm not going to argue, we both have opinions based on our experiences, and we aren't going to convince each other that the other is wrong.

I was thinking of another website with the weapons and humans. But that doesn't mean that what he was doing was right, or that it wasn't inspirational to other websites.

He created the Silk Road. His website allowed drugs to be sold and transported without a trace. He allowed crime to blossom worldwide. His intentions may have been good but he underestimated the monsters this world can create.
Edit: removed weapons and human slaves, was thinking of other websites on the Silk Road.

That didn't stop people though.

If he wanted to be a hero he could have tried setting up rehabs or stopped selling drugs. He was doing this for profit.
