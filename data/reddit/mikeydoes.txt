It gets you the best hash rate, and I'm not paying for electricity(which is why I think people don't like it/it loses points).
From what I've heard people don't like AMD like they used to. Or the few people I've watched on youtube like Nvidia. I personally wouldn't mind using AMD, but it doesn't bother me getting the 1080tis since we will be getting our money back and we can sell them after.
I was more interested in getting 1070s and 1060s, but my friend that I am mining with wanted the best. The good news is that the card is on pace to pay itself off in 3 months(not to mention we won't be cashing out).
Will be getting several more 1080tis. And plan on getting the new cards when they come out.
Any gamer needs to buy one of the better cards and always mine. The card pays for itself and eventually makes you money.. Xbox, nintendo, and PS cant do that.

I basically have money in that coin and im willing to put more in it because I have seen it perform well... Which is kinda true for every coin, but what is the reason you mention it?

How long have you been mining? How long do you expect those to make you money/should I expect my 1080ti to last quite a while? You are where exactly I want to be(or basically my goal is yours, having a whole warehouse), but I have to start somewhere and I feel like what I am doing is a good start.
I just started by buying my first 1080ti, and plan on getting several more here very soon(mining ZCL). Then working on getting the Nvidias that will eventually come out. I am in it with another person, and I see great things from this, but am also very new. Any tips?

I actually support hard work and when people do stuff for other people.

Yeah good point. The more I find out about crypto, what it does, and how it works the more confident I become in it. It gets me more and more excited that it is something special.
I'm waiting for games like WoW to switch over to crypto.

Thanks for sharing. My little brother graduated/is in finance and he just doesn't get it.
I also am doing both to give myself more sources of income. Everyone in my family won't touch it. I even told them that I've nearly quadrupled on bittrex and binance in just 2-3 months. I said wait for your money to double up and play with that and they still won't rofl.

Buy a bunch of alts and forget about them for a while again.

The thousands of times this has happened in the past is reason enough. Not many people know what crypto is still and most are still afraid to buy in. Just like people wouldn't buy goods from Amazon(or the internet in particular) early on. 
Now not only does everyone use Amazon without worrying it is expanding.
Plus with all the talk at Xmas, so many people are going to put in. Plus people are spending money on gifts right now. So all that money is going to be flooded in soon.

I asked the same question and I didn't get any answer either.
Bitcoin can become the Myspace of Crypto very easily if they can't get the fees down/take so long. I am not saying that is going to happen, but if the problems can't be fixed why would I hold? That is reality. I'm wondering if and how it's improved.
I'm not asking for a meme.

Yes, can someone please recommend?

My question is how is Bitcoin fixing the huge fees/improving?
Wondering if anyone has insight, I've been dabbling in altcoins hard while Bitcoin is on the dip, but my concern was how long the transactions are taking and how expensive they are.
