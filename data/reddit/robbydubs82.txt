So what happens to btc-e.com?

Russia completely banned BTC

Same here, I bought 1.0 at 450 the night before it broke 500. I just invest small amounts at a time regardless of price though. BTC is still very new technology and many people still don't know about it; that leaves plenty of room for development and adoption (potential rocket fuel LOL). It's safe to say that BTC will continue to have a strong annual growth regardless of the massive fluctuations it will probably face this year. But I'm man enough to admit I'm no fortune teller and smart enough to know that THIS market is completely unpredictable. I wish you the best of luck with your trading, hopefully we'll see each other on the moon one day.

Agreed, a dip means more will look to invest but not until it hits what they believe to be the bottom of this downward slope. The only thing the I could think of that would cause a true BTC crash (permanent downward slope) is if the deep web becomes forever compromised.

It's a redemption shot if you missed out on that opportunity China gave us a month ago. \O/

This is all that I needed to know, thanks mister.

If I could describe this in one word: BUBBLE

Or it could even be another bandwagon trend? (never forget November 2013)
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:25:47
What a relief, thank you good sir.

BTC pretty much went viral last fall and because everyone thought it was a good "get rich quick scheme" the value exploded to $1250/BTC. In short: The demand went up because people who never even heard of bitcoin saw the steady climb and then hopped on the bandwagon, thus increasing the price even more. The bad news is that theses bandwagoners have super weak hands. It's basic economics.

Good advice man, that's what I have been doing. I'm not using anything but other crypto-currencies to acquire different ones. Trying to play the markets of smaller currencies that don't follow BTC trends seems to be a way better way of gaining BTC.

What's your opinion on BetaCoin?
