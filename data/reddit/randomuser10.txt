Governments don't ask for donations.  They force people to pay taxes with the threat of violence.  Once you introduce voluntary funding, it's no longer defined as a "government".

Anecdote: I was in Las Vegas last weekend for vacation.  Did a quick lookup for Bitcoin atms in the area via coinatmradar.com.  First one I visited was the Mike Tyson bitcoin atm in the restaurant Off the Strip.  Before buying, the hostess notified me that the last person who attempted to purchase $1 worth of bitcoin lost his money with no bitcoin.  Thankfully, I heard this advice before putting $60 in the machine.  I opted for $20 first (dumb of me to try this much) but went through the process and the machine "timed out" while sending to my address.  I was not offered a receipt or a refund option. Also, no easy contact information for the operator.  I had to lookup via the coinatmradar site.  Sent an email but it was to the wrong company bitcoin direct vs btc direct.  Anyways, I gave up on that.
On a positive note, I made a stop to the Bitcoin atm at the D casino.  Made a total of 2 transactions there over my trip and it was a flawless experience.  Only information needed from me was phone number to send me a confirmation text.  I opted for a printed receipt as well.  Kudos to bit access :)
Interesting side note:  A few of the stores/restaurants/front desk within the D accept bitcoin. I asked the gift shop how often customers use bitcoin for a transaction.  She said about once a month.  I asked the front desk the same question.  He said he's been there 5 months and seen 1 person pay for their room in bitcoin.  My trip to Las Vegas is an annual vacation.  I will ask them the same questions next year and report back.
tl;dr Mike Tyson stole my money.
