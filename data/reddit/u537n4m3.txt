-Localbitcoins is not just for in-person meets. 99% of the business is online. Transfers go though instantly in some cases and placing an advertisement for an offer to buy at -1% of bit stamp rate WILL be filled in a matter of hours (maybe once you develop a little feedback). 
If you understood what an option was you may see the scam. Price up, cancel order, price down, accept request. Why a period of 7 days is needed I have  only idea.

Coinbase never "run out" of Bitcoin. They simply buy from Bitstamp and apply a very small fee. The part they take may now be zero, since the two prices hug so closely and likely they will still pay a fee even if they are coinbase since they aaren't really adding any liquidity, instead taking it.
Coinbase simply funnel the USD into Bit stamp and maintain a large float there. It does seem a little strange though, I would assume they could have deposits cleared immediately, although ethically maybe they can't. Still doesn't explain 5 days though. I'm going to bet it's the new bank they swapped (or were pushed to)

You seem to think rich people keep a bank account of safe full of USD. In the case of the elite slowmoon mentions, they in fact profit off any fluctuation in the value through non-usd assets. The only people that keep USD are the middle classes and let's face it they won't be around much longer, not that they have any swing anyway.

No, that’s not my address, I payed in BTC I was just trying to check the balance of that buyers Safecoin and i couldn’t see anything. Also the ask side of the orderbook on masterxchange is empty??? I am i to think that no-one is trading their Safecoins yet?

One more question, im trying to check the balance of some of the mastercoin addresses i can see that have sent coins and therefore should have received msafecoins using  but i cant see any mention of owning any msafecoins? Does this mean they havent been sent or am i doing something wrong? I appreciate your time in answering my questions

"Under market", not undervalued. I quit my job 18 months ago to trade and broker bitcoins, a huge part of which is done through LBC. I place under market bids which are filled for a living.

In the UK purchasing from an exchange like bit stamp or btc-e is a no go since the currency conversion from our banks will add about 6% without SEPA fees. 
Use localbitcoins,  pay with a bank transfer from your current account and your good. Don't pay more than 3-5% over bit stamp rate. 
Any questions, I'm a seller in the UK with over 7000 trades and 100% feedback, feel free to ask

Y poi may have entered your dob wrong for example. This would trip a strict (as circle will have to be) system to flag you as at least medium risk. They likely agreed with their PSP to only accept low risk customers to keep to 3% fee instead of the 4-19% the characteristics of bit coin would typically demand.

You are wrong on 2 points:
1) The 5000 coins that dissappeared were his coins not the companies, Danny was saying he was prepared to put his own 5000 coins into the company but he 'lost' them. He knew at all times that the company only had 140 coins left
2) The coins he held for 'customers' were a privae issue not the companies, he actually fled with the 140 btc and said when asked for them by staff that "his lawyer advised him not to send them", another direct lie.
2)

I cannot imagine a world where the service coinbase offers is successful but here we are. Coinbase are one of the biggest scammers going, worse than the banks even. Waiting for delivery of coins to be told your orders cancelled? That's because your giving them a free "option" at no cost.
It would serve the whole Bitcoin ecosystem well to boycott Coinbase immediately. Use Bitpay or place bids on localbitcoins to get coin UNDER MARKET RATE.  Incredibly simple and usually instant if you use a complimentary bank.
@_date: 2014-05-12 09:43:13
As you mentioned though it's an unreliable indicator. In most cases they refer to exchange volume since falsifying this cost money in exchange fees
