ROT is really not very secure. At least use a Vigenere cipher :p.

I was kinda joking.

For the fun of it, I guess.

Yeah, people always say that 'a billion is impossible for one man to spend'. There are yachts and houses which have cost a billion dollars.

I don't get how such legislation is even possible.
Will I be categorised as a threat because I have the programming knowledge to write fairly secure encryption? (along with many, many others).

Wow. 2BTC from nothing certainly impresses me.

If I generated a long enough binary representation of Pi, I could probably be arrested for possession of classified government materials. (assuming I had a very powerful computer with a LOT of space, and if the conjecture that Pi is normal is true).

So that makes you an idiot? Many people make mistakes in code.

Is there anything, anywhere, ever, to indicate that one million USD is anything close to a feasible potential value for BTC?
