yupp :) indian gov has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of the Economic Affairs Department Secretary,  deliberating over all issues related to cryptocurrencies to propose specific actions to be taken.. as there are no legal protections for people engaging in cryptocurrency.

many economically strong countries came forward to accept cryptocurrency and taking steps to legalizing it, and also the reason is bitcoin users are increasing rapidly, and administrators looking forward that bitcoin can play a major role in the economy, so we can say yeah, its good as long as it is good for the economy.
