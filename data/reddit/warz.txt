Yes. USA failed to kidnap the owners of btc-e, but they seized the domain and stole some of their fiat. After that btc-e re-branded as wex (officially they claim it's a new team, probably for legal reasons) and is working on repaying the stolen funds in full by using a token scheme.

There is no convergent encryption for deduplication on StorJ right? Since each file needs to be uniquely encrypted for the proof of storage? I wonder if convergent encryption could work well with decentralized networks of this sort.
(for those who don't know: convergent encryption with deduplication is using the file itself as encryption key, thus 1000 users with the same file will only need it stored on the network once, as in minimum 1 copy, instead of minimum 1000, a massive space saver, also uploading a file already on the network would be instant)

But if you don't allow it, it will be much more difficult to do the transactions. Because:
1. Buyer has no guarantee that seller will not contact forum admin/theymos after selling the account to get it back. High risk for buyer makes it less attractive.
2. All transactions will have to go through third party sites, fewer will visit those
3. You now have the power to ban sold accounts, this will minimize scamming.

I honestly think they're just using bitcoin and blockchain as one of the many buzzwords of the current times to promote their own agenda. Just look at their marketing; they're arguing that their service protect against bitcoins volatility, but what is really going on behind the scenes? Well, you're selling your bitcoin and storing USD in their reserves. Great, you get everything bitcoin is not: a centralized storage of USD controlled by VCs that would sell their own mother for profit. And they're making this out to be some sort of revolution, "saving" bitcoiners from volatility. What a joke!

No, I never gave up the domain. I suspect that's why they ended up changing name to uphold, because they knew they couldn't win against me and they're too high and mighty to not own the .com domain and only .org. It never got to the point that they tried to sue me or seize the domain through domain dispute system, which is probably because I didn't use it yet. The way I understand the law; since I bought it first and intend to launch a service, they do not have a case. 
But damn. These lawyers are unbelievable. Can you believe they had the audacity to demand an immediate response and that I give them the domain free of charge?

Of course, I said 25% extra. You still have to pay the VAT for products.
If we assume product costs 100 NOK, then you add VAT, price is now 125 NOK, then you add another 25% on top on bitcoin payments, making the final price 156.25 NOK. Without VAT on bitcoin the product will cost 125 NOK instead of 156.25 NOK, which means you save 31.25 NOK. 
Accepting bitcoin payment was economically infeasible, with this new interpretation it's equal to any other currency.

Most likely people who has fiat there are buying BTC as a way to withdraw fiat, and that is driving up the price. 
One can withdraw fiat only to WEX Code/ADVCash now. You can then convert it to btc using one of their partner exchanges, however that may seem a bit convoluted and come with some uncertainty and wait time.

BTC-E is really the pirate bay of exchanges. Despite having fiat seized (read: stolen) by USA and being "fugitives" risking extradition and 80-300 years in prison they decided to come back and give users the funds left. The BTC-E team deserves mad respect and support.

You're not special Olivier. We all got scammed. All of us could have tried to freeze his bank accounts to get the money out. If your claim succeeded you would have received back 28% while the rest of us would have received less than 20%. 
I'm glad you realized that is unfair and decided to not pursue the claim further. I'm not convinced however, that you're doing this because it's the moral thing to do or if you're doing this because you know it's a waste of effort as your claim will never be approved.

2. Who did you tell that mtgox was insolvent before it was announced. There were people in the know, and 10k BTC dump on bitstamp shortly before you announced it.
3. The leaked [mtgox crises draft]( mentions a 200k injection to get mtgox back and running again, what was that number based on?
4. In the [IRC logs]( you're talking about the missing 95k BTC, so you knew you were insolvent in 2011. You wrote that you had several strategies and plans, what concrete did you do to try recover the missing 95k?
5. Why did you spend time on bitcoin cafe, fancy door locks, and [personally creating yubikeys]( instead of focusing on fixing this massive debt?
6. Why did you blame malleability for the loss of 800k+ bitcoin when studies show it only accounted for less than 2k btc lost?
7. Why did you appear to not care at all about the loss you caused in the aftermath? Twitting about the weather and totally ignoring questions?

Blocking IPs from New York (or the US) is not sufficient since we all know people can easily get past IP blocking, you must require identify proof of all customers as well. 
Since BTC-E does not require identification on all their customers, they will be running a criminal enterprise and should accordingly be extradited to the US and sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison.

Olivier Janssens claimed **3 million USD** (335126397 JPY) he did not have. His claim was rejected. 
What happened is that he sold his goxBTC on bitcoin builder and was left with only ~385k USD on mtgox. He said that he wanted to set the date for all balances to Feb 7th. ( you can listen to it [here]( ). 
That would be very nice for him (getting real BTC out from bitcoin builder AND have a claim on his full gox balance), but screw everyone else over (especially those who actually bought his goxBTC who would get zero). I guess he tried anyways to claim his previous balance, but failed. I am happy that this part of his claim was denied.

Let's think about this logically. You didn't subtract what you *sold*, but the real BTC that you *got* from the sales.
Let's imagine you have 10000 goxBTC and withdraw all of that through bitcoin builder. Say you sell it all for 10% (1000 real BTC). Somebody has now paid 1000 real BTC for your 10000 claim. You have 0 left to claim. But what you did is to take that 10000 and deduct 1000, then claimed 9000 goxBTC, which is not yours! 
Where are those 9000 goxBTC gonna come from? It will either be from all the other creditors or from the person who bought your 10000 claim. In both cases you'll be robbing others! If you actually succeeded in this (and assume payout is 20%) you'd be eligible for 9000*0.2 + 1000 = 2800 BTC. That's 28% instead of 20% like everyone else is getting. How is that fair?

Peter Schiff will always have a place in my heart for getting me interested in austrian economics which eventually lead to the discovery of voluntaryism. But he really needs to get real when it comes to bitcoin. 
People I would like to see him debate:
* 1. Erik Voorhees
* 2. Jon Matonis
* 3. Vitalik Buterin
* 4. Trace Mayer
* 5. Roger Ver

E-gold was napster, liberty reserve was limewire, bitcoin is bittorrent.

I remember him saying in an interview after the crash from $266 that bitcoin would go above $200 again in 2013. He seems like a great advocate for bitcoin, everyone should check out this clip:

I stumbled across it in jan 2011 while reading about e-currencies on wikipedia (fan of e-gold and was looking for alternatives)

That's quite a bit of so-called "imaginary, worthless internet money" right there.
