The coins were already moved to an account held by the FBI.

Unambiguously no. People misunderstand the exploit that's possible for entities with &gt;50% mining power -- they *can not* do any transaction that they cannot normally do. What they *can do*, is delay any transaction they choose for as long as they hold the &gt;50% power, and make transactions they make look like they go through when they really don't. (Thus allowing double spend. Start making your own chain. Spend some coins, pocket whatever you spent them for, then spend the coins into a different address on your own chain, reveal your chain, you now didn't spend the coins.)

The important part is having a lot of coins from a lot of sources. No amount of moving coins back and forth between your own accounts is going to defeat even rudimentary analysis, you absolutely need more parties for it to work.

When governments actually go after btc, they won't do it through blocking, they will do it through detection and prosecution. To block currency arbitrage, they don't even need to be able to trace BTC, they can follow the flow of Yuan, which is easier for them.

Not so sure about that. The party allows for some less-than-licit financial systems to exist as a pressure valve of sorts. The current shadow banking system is half the size of the economy or so.
As it is, it's all up in the air.
