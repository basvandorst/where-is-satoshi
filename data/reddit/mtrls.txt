It makes no sense. You can split anytime You want like BCH, BTG or BTD did. There is no need to wait for hard fork. Even if You wanted to take over old chain, it's even bigger nonsence since that chain would quickly die without alteast 30-40% of hashpower. But it doesn't make any difference, comparing to the way BCH or another coin forked.


Hard fork is matter of time. It's not about if, it's about when. Why would You force people to pay high fees for such a long time, when You can repair it earlier? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:26:43
That's false. Full node is the miner. Those "full" nodes are passive nodes. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:23:14
Oh, that's right. That way, You could fork to infinity and old chain will never die. That said, it's impossible to hard fork sucesfully.
Anyways, the questions is, what does It change? I don't think it matters at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:23:47
Eeeee, but with BTC's difficulty algorithm, old chain will quickly die without hashrate. 99% miners want higher blocks so where is the problem?

You guys aren't better. Calling bitcoin cash "bcash" is as clever as calling bitcoin "bitcoin core" or "core coin". 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:22:15
Sure You can. But people will tell You bullish, that it centralizes bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:41:51
It's not about being lazy or not lazy. It's about being effective. Final consumer doesn't care how You repaired high fees, he cares how cheap and fast are his transactions. And if they aren't cheap and fast, he will switch to another technology. That's how market works.

What does soft fork change comparing to hard fork? Nothing special.

What do You expect from shitcoin CEO? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:31:46
Hey, but everyone knew in 2014 or 2015, that blocks will sooner or later become full. They had over 3 years to resolve that. If the problem wasn't resolved in the next 20 years, would You repeat the same mantra like?


Sorry dude, but time is the money, especially in IT, where things move fast. Either You adopt or get eaten by competition. With that attitude, BTC will sooner or later lose it's leader postion and it won't be easy to recover. Once people and businesses switch to another cryptocurrency, it will be hard for BTC to come back. There is no use case for BTC and the only thing that keeps the price is hope, that will it will be better. Once hope is gone (people tend to be impatient), BTC won't be needed anymore.

You can aswell divide 10 TB blockchain by 100 parts. That way, each node owns 100 GB blockchain.

When You run a business that handles huge amount of cunsomer's money, the first and most important thing is security. Segwit ain't even emplemented in core GUI.
That said, segwit doesn't resolve the problem. Even if 100% of network used it, blocks would be still full. 


There were numerous attempts from people outside of blockstream and each was rejected.

I don't think if there is anything to be proud of. Bitcoin is still -70% from ATH. That's how bubbles typically pop - the most parabolic move is quickly dumped (with bull trap after it) but then, price starts to slowly bleed. It was the same in 2013-2015 and is the same now. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:16:10


Well, looking at those fees it looks like it should have been increased long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:53:20
I do. You could have implemented segwit using hard fork and that wouldn't change a lot. Soft-forking everything is overimplementation 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:19:55
Hey, even LN whitepaper assumes, that BTC will require blocksize increase sooner or later. It's not about if - it's about when. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:15:34
Although I lost some money on bitcoin (fortunately, I have mostly secured myself with shorts) its quite funny to watch those scams bleed
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:06:33
ETF will be for sure accepted after those manipulations. 100% confirmed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:46:58
With those fees? That ain't possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:12:30
if the price fell down to $1000 u would be thinking it is going to 0 
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:51:45
Yes. Simply, accept the trend and cycle. You guys wanted bitcoin to go parabolic and now You need to accept consequences of parabolic moves.
2000% return in a year will never be sustainable, that's why it crashed.

Do You have any evidence or just shit talking? Bitfinex is the most important BTCUSD exchange, most of big players sit there. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:43:24
Look at the volume. Whales sit on bitfinex and most of people analyse BTC price from that exchange.
You can withdraw money via SEPA. Some time ago ING confirmed, that they're banking with them. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:20:18
I dont think so. Market simply went too high and too fast. Segwit implementation has like 0 influence on price. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:07:36
why would You get rid of 25% onchain's capacity to save 13GB per year? 
smaller blocks could actually increase centralization:
1. it forces smaller traders to keep their bitcoins on centralized exchanges 
2. people that usually would run a full node, now don't give a shit because they're tilted with $50 fees
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:04:59
~2,5%
