Try Coinsquare, the approval is fast but their service is shit. Also heard Einstein exchange was good. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:54:37
I've been waiting for a week and a half if not more. I read that they are swamped and it takes about two weeks to get verified. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:44:43
I use Coinsquare. You can also just buy BTC on Coinsquare or Coinbase and transfer them to Bittrex to buy alt-coins. I don't recommand Coinbase in Canada because it does not allow you to sell and you can only use credit cards to buy.

Yup, there she goes. It's like when the rain starts pouring after days of heat and sun. You can only keep mother nature out of the equation for so long before she bites back!

You shouldn't make this your full time job but there are ways of making good profit with crypto trading and not just holding. It's all about investing when the market isn't too volatile. LTC and ETH are having a lot of swings in between their support and resistance. If you study the market a little, you can profit off of these.
Just give yourself a realistic objective when you invest, say 5-10% return. Minimize risks. Once that objective is achieved, just pull out. Don't let your greed get you caught in a bad storm.

There is no lowest amount, it's all about what you can invest. They say don't put in more than you can afford to loose and that is true to a certain extent. I would say 100-200$ is a good place to start, you will see a somewhat significant return. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:19:04
I don't know, we have been predicting a 10k setback for a while now and the dip is always bought back, I doubt we will go below 14k 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:39:09
I certainly hope so. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:57:45
Never too late to invest. Any amount you put in is going to benefit the astronomical growth rates of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:43:48
There she goes, boys. Last chance to buy before the plane takes off. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:51:31
Really miss our last two months of green candlesticks and happy days. I know it wasn't sustainable but... damn it felt good to make so much money while we were sleeping. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:14:43
No one knows, that's the goddamn thrilling thing about bitcoin! Could go either way. It's certainly not for the faint of heart..
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:36:32
The real danger here might be that many are expecting a big dip or a crash and so it might just become a self-fulfilling prophecy if people start panic selling at the first bump. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:50
What people don't seem to understand is that even if you don't buy a full bitcoin, say you put 500 to 1000 worth, (that is merely 0,03 or something) it still allows you to grow your money better than anywhere else. You won't see that kind of growth and free money in any bank accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:26:59
You better do verifications right now on Quadriga because judging from my experience it'll take two weeks for your identity to be verified and approved. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:18:11
hahahaha. that is quite funny. my financial instincts are telling me not to trust someone with a name like that
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:20:05
Same here. Made a healthy 40$ profit, lol. Gonna buy diner with it when this settles down. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:33:34
Bought a little last night and more early this morning. Wish I had put more.

Because we have been waiting for a correction since 10k and it hasn't happened except for a small dip to 9k. The reality is that the media coverage of BTC has attracted a lot of individual waiting for a dip to invest and so whenever the market is heading towards a correction or a downtrend, a lot of money is put back into the market by new investors. I don't think we will see a strong correction (3-5k) for quite a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:01:53
Already did. Went from approx 17k to 14,8k. Slowly recovering. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:41:21
Sorry man, nothing personal. Just tired of that down trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:15
If I had to say i'd say something is happening right now and it'll either keep shooting up like crazy or it'll fall down just as fast as it went up. The market is way too fast right now
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:09
Natural selection. Trim the weaklings off the herd. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:17
Only a fool would see such a wave and watch it go by without surfing on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:38:56
The whole point of giving yourself growth objectives and pulling out once you hit them is really just to minimize risks. In crypto, your winning strategy can turn to poop very fast so in a sense it is quitting while you're ahead. 
Yeah, it's got nothing to do with day trading but it's an hybrid strategy between day trade and hodl.

Canada is really lacking good trading platforms. The fees are INSANE. Here are your options:
-QuadrigaCX : seems like the best overall platform and the lowest fees, but the verification will take at least 2 weeks if not three. They are swamped in applications.
-Coinsquare : has balls high fees and poor customer service but you will get verified quite fast. They also have an app that is pretty swell but man... the fees. 
-Einstein : it's a startup, a new Vancouver based platform. Interface is nice, seems quite good but I have personally never traded on it. 
Hope that helps. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:19:19
Fml. I have two economics finals this weekend (who gives exams on weekend?) and I've just beens staring at candlesticks for the last week. Hate that volatility. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:42:35
How legal would that be? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:29
Nothing you can do. I know it feels bad man but don't worry. 5 days from now it'll be on an uptrend to hit 20k
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:47:11
Too late to cut losses. Just gotta swallow the pain and wait for it to come back up. If you sell now, you will regret it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:56:23
We're going to wake up and it will be somewhere around 17k on an uptrend to hit 20k this weekend (and stable). 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:40:09
Nah, i'm in Canada 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:10:44
When I did that, it said on GDAX that "BTC/USD trading is not yet available in your region." Does it work for you?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:13:30
Self fulfilling prophecy. Everyone is expecting the market to crash because of futures so their own behaviour (panic selling) is causing the very crash they feared. At least that's my guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:27:44
I nearly doubled my money on my first investment in less than a month. I should've pulled out and cashed in. But greed said: don't pull out yet! There might be even more money waiting for you out there! 
There wasn't. The profit melted. There is no worse feeling on earth than to see profit disappear in a heartbeat.  
Never listen to greed!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:43
The stop loss at 50% is literally the worst thing you could do. You are going to loose 7000$. 50% crashes have happened in BTC's history and it has ALWAYS bounced back to greater heights. 
Listen to me because this is important : if you sell at 50% of what you bought that for, you are going to consider suicide when that bitcoin hits back 16k and goes up to twenty while you are out of 7k because of a really bad advice on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:17
This feels better than sex tbh
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:52:58
That mentality is the very reason people loose money. I've lost money trying to cut losses too but then you realize it's going to go back up and you don't have to take a loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:59:25
Last chance to buy before the 17k y'all.

Volatility of BTC market probably caused a lot of people to put their money in LTC while waiting for the market to stabilize. I almost parked my money in litecoin yesterday but didn't. Really regret not doing so. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:34:29
Yup. You are not alone. But hey, every bad move teaches us a lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:42
You are just going to have to handle some very stressful days and RESIST the urge to cut your losses by selling lower than what you bought for. It will go past 16k for sure, it's just a matter of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:25
I switched to Coinsquare, it's a canadian platform and it allows you to  buy and sell. It's not perfect tho, it lacks liquidity so if you want to buy altcoins you are going to pay higher price than the market price, but for BTC it's pretty good. And their app is swell. Canada really lacks good instant trading platforms.
