Not at all.
It is the talking about stuff he doesn't understand that I find more interesting because it seems out of character for him. 
I mean, I do that all the time but I'm young, dumb and not particularly wealthy. Seems odd to me that such a seasoned vet of investing would choose to opine on something they seemingly know so little about.

Get a fucking lawyer. NOW. 
The only way you can get people to do things in the legal system is to have a good lawyer talk with them or file some papers.
Chances are its gone though. Good luck.

The vast majority of USD transactions are just forex.
I'm sure the vast majority of BTC transactions are just swapping crypto/crypto and crypto/fiat pairs.
See, the vast majority of transactions using both are just boring legitimate exchanges.

Haha, yeah I watch CNBC a lot but I don't know everyone's name who pops in with a chart every once in a while. 
BK seems to really know what he is talking about and I am sure that Buffett and Munger have no clue what blockchain is...they are ancient. They didn't even buy Apple until fairly recently.
Like he said, blockchain and cryptocurrency provide the ability to potentially decentralize the entire internet with the necessity of exchanging a token (or tokens) for services. Interesting times we live in.

We're talking about investing in emerging technologies not making a logically sound argument for philosophy class. 
There are obviously no guarantees to any investment (or any argument about the future of any investment) and opinions from authority mean nothing for the outcome of an event. But dismissing the concept of studying an investment based on a logical fallacy seems foolish.
No one ever claimed that watching CNBC was the same as getting trusted investment advice from an investment advisor. Nor does being certified as an investment advisor by a non-biased third party give your opinion anymore weight on the outcome of an even than anyone else's.
Experts in every field are wrong all the time, finance more than most.

I don't usually like any of the stupid moon comments here on r/Bitcoin but this is gold!

This. I recently tried to explain it to someone with no understanding of the different types of problems and the rigorous mathematical proofs behind them.
Encryption is just math based and computer science and the source code is all available. It is all based on the idea that some problems are easy to check for a correct answer but difficult to find the answer - using classical computers, of course. 
Ex: You take 2 prime numbers with 100 digits each and multiply them together to get a result. It's easy to get the result and to check which numbers are the originals but it is very hard to only have the resulting number and solve for the 100-digit primes.
The whole point being, if you could break this type of encryption - by quickly solving this type of mathematical problem - with a classical computer it would probably win you a Nobel prize/give you the ability to hack every bank or credit card in the world very trivially. You wouldn't need to steal a few billion in bitcoin.

Bitcoin has raised its dividend every year for the last 55 years!?
Where did they send my dividends?
