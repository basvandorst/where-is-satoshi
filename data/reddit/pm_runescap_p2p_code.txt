Is the reason behind avoiding recursions and loops the unpredictable runtime of code?

Ok, I understood the part where the massive buy order ate up all the market sell orders until the quantity of buy was reached. 
So, if other traders put a sell order at a high price, and this buy order bought them, the market appeared to value the btc at that price, when in reality it didn't and it was just an out of control event?
Also, pardon for the lack of knowledge, but can you also explain what's the difference between a market order and a limit order, and how one preempts the other, and how it had an effect in this case?

Thanks for the explanation but I am still unclear of one thing, that is, how did that trader's margin call cause the all time high?
Like, by what I understand (i am a noob), the market value of btc was rising anyway, but at one point it reached the maximum free cash the trader had in his account to pay for his short position, so his buy trade was forcibly executed. So, the ATH seems to be going that way anyway, and this margin call seems to be a consequence of the ATH, rather than the causant?
 Oh wait, I think I get it. The margin call happened for a rise in price which was less that the ATH at that time. But the margin call made it look like there was a huge demand, and so, the price went even higher eventually reaching the ATH. Am I right?
