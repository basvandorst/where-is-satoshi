But what does the UASF stand for?
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:46:23
True, was just wondering if this was legit or some kind of pump
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:38:07
But does this look like some kind of pump? I can't find any communities on this coin where I can read all about it
@_date: 2017-04-10 23:20:06
Noob question, but what is UASF?
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:43:54
Oh ok, thanks bro! I think you're talking about bitcoin plus? That was some pump, 3000+%, like wtf!
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:51:25
