We also see you're the son of Gary busey. We've determined that's punishment enough 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:51:01
Does a bear shit in the woods?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:52:33
I've thought of doing this but my family doesn't deserve it 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:55:33
When they lose them then it's oh well, now I keep my copy. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:38:12
That's cus I've used all my money I can't even buy anymore
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:49
Hmm we audited your bank account and noticed over 5000 in bitcoin purchases.

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:48:07
In theory ����
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:13:11
You're here which assumes you also own or are interested. Does the dollar amount matter?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:29
I was in at 10200, I ain't scared
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:10:16
It really did. Stupid thing to lie about. I actually laughed and the kid looked at me. I kinda wanted to inform both parties that it's not get rich quick but it can be and that for the kids, gotta have money to make money so a job is still necessary 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:29:28
Currently doing so
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:11:28
Eventually there will be a category of people called the bitcoin millionaires- young people who invested in bitcoin and hodl till it was worth millions 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:55:06
So when it tanks in theory you're fucked
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:15:05
It's being shipped tomorrow. 
Edit: Actually it shipped today. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:02:57
Nice to meet you
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:31:25
I tried to creat an account, crashed. Tried to do it again, crashed. Finally made an account, log in, crash. Try to buy, crash. I gave up and won't use it. I've got chagelly.com saved for when I want to exchange for dash or ripple etc.

@_date: 2017-12-03 05:12:07
How is that even a better idea? 
This could also be the joke? 
Will we ever know?

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:03:32
What is the tax rate for these gains?

He always had a gun on him as well. Must have a ccw
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:12:02
Snagged this yesterday   
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:31:39
I've now seen it three times. It's not the funniest 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:46:29
How bout now
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:00:34
I hit the lock button and the home button at the same time usually
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:08:58
They were like 16. Bitcoin is really provoking thought of investing by younger generations which is good
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:44:38
Either a lot invested or you need a new job. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:05:15
That's 3k gone bye bye
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:23:50
I'd gladly deplete my savings and live on the streets for a year to be able to buy a year ago. I'd have like 1 whole coin by now. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:48:22
That's what I did. Said I was gonna buy for months and never did. Now I bought at 8200 and should buy more before it goes up more. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:53:29
I just did my first buy yesterday and am bummed I've waited this long.
