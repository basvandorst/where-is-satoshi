What are you even talking about?
The NY AG report provides to the public information about the various crypto exchanges based on those exchanges' responses to a voluntary questionnaire.  For those exchanges that did not respond to the questionnaire, the report states that users should investigate on their own.  Where they could, the NY AG appears to have attempted to ascertain certain information on their own and provided that information where applicable.
They never say that Kraken or the other exchanges that did not participate are guilty of anything\*.  
\* The one note they make suggesting potential guilt is: 


Note that only three of the four were referred to the Department of Financial Services, suggesting that the referral was based on a finding that the other three exchanges did, in fact, accept orders from New York residences despite claiming not to.
If Kraken is an above-board and professionally run exchange, then why are they lying about where they do business?  They could simply say that they don't want to respond to the questionnaire.

. . . because they do not do business in NY.  But it seems that they might.
When a company relocates or stops doing business somewhere due to regulatory oversight, it is usually (but not always) a bad sign.

It means not dealing with clients who reside in NY and thus not having to abide by NY regulations.  What does 'exchange' versus 'storefront' mean to you exactly that it is relevant to whether or not Kraken is doing business in NY?
Personal Jurisdiction in the United States is derived through 'minimum contacts,' and 'availing oneself of the jurisdiction.'  If you do business in a state, you are subject to that state's jurisdiction and the state can prescribe laws that affect you and charge you with crimes when you break the law.  If Kraken has no clients in NY, then they can ignore NY laws.  If they do have clients in NY or do business in NY, then perhaps acting like spoiled children is not a good long-term business plan.

Dollar-denominated bills and coins are created solely by the US government and as legal tender currency have intrinsic value to be used to pay your taxes and other debts.  How *much* value they have, i.e. what they are actually worth, is measured by extrinsic factors.

I never said that bitcoin wasn't worthwhile or a good thing or necessary.  I just think comparisons to the USD are not helpful in getting you there.
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:54:54
It might.
The question though, when looking at current value, what happens if bitcoin went away tomorrow versus what happens if the dollar does?  If the dollar collapsed, so too would the world economy.  If bitcoin collapsed, meh for most people.
Similarly, the likelihood of the dollar suddenly going away versus bitcoin being replaced with an altcoin or something else?
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:27:08
No, bitcoins are created by the software algorithm and are recorded in a ledger signifying who they belong to.
So your argument for bitcoin is that they can be used to pay for bitcoin transactions?  :)

So what, in your learned opinion, does have intrinsic value?
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:18:12
Gold has no intrinsic value, its only value is in it scarcity, much of which is manipulated.  Gold is soft and a lousy conductor.  It is primarily used for ornamentation.
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:11:06
Not to rain on your parade but the USD has inherent value because it is the Legal Tender currency of the United States government.  As such, pursuant to the Coinage Act of 1965, (31 U.S.C. § 5103), "United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues."

~300 million Americans.  And the US Dollar is the fiat currency in the world economy.  A lot of people outside of the US back the dollar, just as they back US Treasury notes.  
The number of bitcoin wallets ~25MM.  Not really a strong argument in favor of bitcoin.
Comparing bitcoin to the USD is not really the best argument for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:19:26
But a dollar has intrinsic value because the US government says it does.  As long as the US Government exists, the dollar has value.  The same cannot be said of bitcoin.
There are lots of great arguments for bitcoin but comparing intrinsic worth with the dollar isn't one of them.

You are right.  Anyone who disagrees with you is an idiot.  Point taken.  I feel like I am smarter for having been in the presence of your towering intellect and massive knowledge.
Perhaps you could enlighten a humble supplicant as to what you believe has intrinsic value?

The Zimbabwean dollar is worth $0.00276.  Just because it does not have a lot of value or as much as it used to does not mean it has no value.  A Satoshi, on the other hand is worth $0.000095.  So which is more valuable?  :D

Can you point to a time when the US (for example) did not carry any debt?  Countries always carry debt because income and expenses don’t follow each other exactly.  The issue is not running on debt it is the amount relative to GDP and other factors.

You can’t demonstrate a bubble using a single point on a graph.  Your figures are meaningless as presented.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:36:15
Sure, it does become a problem and probably is now but throw\_away seems to think that Countries running with debt is bad and it isn't necessarily.  It is about context and this 'meme' does not provide any so it is not really useful.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:39:00
It isn't 'bad' information it is useless incomplete information.
No idea what orange coins have to do with anything . . . you think bitcoin is physical or something?  I never said your point was incorrect merely that you portrayed it in a way that makes no sense and suggests a complete lack of understanding about the concepts you are talking about.

Cherry picking a single bubble that worked out is what makes this a useless comparison.  Why not look at Japan’s market bubble?  In 1990, the Nikkei hit ~41,000.  Today, approximately 30 years later, it is at around 21,000.  The Nikkei may never recover those highs.
Bubbles like 1929 NYSE, 1990 Nikkei, and 2017/18 Bitcoin show how something can be manipulated.  They are hardly an indication of future success, only of opportunity to bilk people out of their money.
In the late 1980s, lots of people were talking about how Japan would eclipse the US economy, just as people more recently have talked about China and Bitcoin.  They were/are delusional.  The forces driving these ‘competitors’ are often unsustainable or insufficient to provide a stable and secure replacement.

It is called “unjust enrichment.”  Just because bitcoin is not dollars, it does not mean that it is somehow exempt from the legal system.  If someone accidentally wires money into your bank account you can’t just legally keep it.  The same is true of bitcoin.
While it is true that bitcoin transactions, like a wire transfer, are not reversible, that does not make keeping the money legal.  It just means there is no way for you to unilaterally reverse the transaction.
