For those playing along at home, I was poking fun at the way OP wrote the date. Nine divided by eight is 1.125.

What does this mean? Can you elaborate?

Or... just don't tilt it. Corel Draw was decades ago.
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:10:18
Yep. Even with slow javascript in a browser on an old laptop it shouldn't take more than a couple of months.
...but then you could do it in C on a modern desktop...
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:19:32


Why not?
@_date: 2018-09-07 03:16:28


*Value* is tied to location though. For example the exact same type of umbrella would be more valuable in locations with high rainfall.
Just like 1 bitcoin is more valuable when you have access to it in Iran.

If privacy is a right, so too should we have the right to 'enjoy' no privacy. 
The invention of bitcoin has simply presented us with more choice, and IMHO, the hatred towards intermediaries is not always warranted. In practical terms, they have just become optional.

Ew. Hopefully displaying it like that is optional.

I object to this definition of 'owes'. Just because an extortionist decides to pressure you into giving them money, and sends you a bill for it, which you subsequently pay out of fear of retribution, that doesn't mean you ever owed it to them.

This is technically true of most things. e.g. You can buy a very small fraction of a car. The issue really then is about settlement/possession of your asset.
I raise this point because some newbies are not aware you can even send fractions independently.

Not that it would make a difference to broad approximations, but do most estimates take into account the satoshis that are stuck on small spam channels that can't be settled?
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:55:34
It's an IOU.  As in "I owe you this much bitcoin".
The same thing could happen with fiat. It's possible to owe somebody a fraction of a cent. But it can't be settled (i.e. paid with cash) until all those little debts add up to at least a cent.
With LN, all those sub-satoshi IOUs can only be settled once they combine to make greater amounts (at least a satoshi, but realistically a lot more than that because of on-chain tx fees).
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:24:36




Seems like a bluff to fool certain people into thinking he was twenty something. The identity was probably pretty damn smart, so any scenario is possible really. Including Satoshi being smart enough to be Craig and act dumb.

Absolutely. One way it could be considered more valuable is in the context of theft mitigation; at a rate of 30% for example, a coin is currently equivalent to earning $10k in income.

Transaction fees have more to do with how many inputs you're using to create the transaction.  Imagine the difference paying for something with 4 x $100 bills, vs 40000 pennies.  If the tx OP linked to had just one $400m input, it would be cheaper than a tx for $4 that had a hundred inputs worth a cent each.

@_date: 2018-12-02 11:27:04
Choose a long password - so that your coins are actually secure, but only send the last 8 chars or so to future me.
i.e.  ([long passphrase that you know] + [~8 chars that you somehow generate and paste into futureme.org without seeing them]) = key to bitcoin millions
The '8 chars' is a good length too in case of a plan B scenario where futureme.org goes down and you have to brute-force it - should take you about 3 months, which wouldn't be the end of the world.
