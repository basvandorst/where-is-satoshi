Well, I still hope that I'm wrong. But there clearly is a movement in the government to strangle Bitcoin. This is because it threatens their entrenched financial system and they cannot 'control' it by standard practices.

I don't think this is 'gloom and doom'. It's pretty much doom. 
Now it is possible that the IRS ruling cannot be enforced. It is a hope at least...
edit: also bitcoin is now at 465 and general trend is falling sharply.

I think in the very long run you are right, but for the next 10-20 years btc will IMHO be the most 'accepted' cryptocurrency system. When changes do occur you will likely be able to transfer your existing wallet to the 'new' system, thus maintaining value wrt fiat.
This is why the btc concept is so revolutionary. My prediction is that in &lt;5 years I'll be able to buy my new house and car with btc... in 50 years or so it (or it's evolved child) will completely take over the current financial system.

This is what has to happen before bitcoin or crypto can actually succeed. The CG tax basically makes crypto a non-investment unless you exploit some loophole. This is why it's not growing.

Super great book. There are so many gems of information/wisdom like this. Highly recommended reading.

Of course, but just like all new ideas, such as we are trying in my company with hyper-structures, its probably 5 or so years for people to catch up and understand even the basics.

Yup. It's already dead. 
People will always figure out how to ruin any altruism. This is just proof.

This is what I would have said. Good way to go, except you probably don't need the cash on hand so just get another coin or keep it going with the penny stocks.
