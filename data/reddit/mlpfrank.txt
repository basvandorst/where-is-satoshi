Hey Luke, I had talked to a handful of developers when I was researching this topic, some of the points raised such as 95% support and block size increase as a softfork I left out. other issues you talk about weren't raised, If you're interested I would greatly appreciate it if you'd be willing to provide technical feedback on future topics I cover to help ensure they are accurate and true. I'm on the bitcoin core slack channel so I can share scripts etc with you there if you want.

I could have sworn I fixed that, there's always something :)

Yes that's how it would look except your channel with a would have a 3 day nLT one day later than A - B. For every new member the nLT increases to insure the channels close in that specific order and everyone can pull funds if necessary.
As for 30 person chains, that seems highly unlikely but possible. The middle man needs to be really rich in order to be go between for users since they may wish to send 1000 btc. This is why the middle man will most likely be an exchange or service like coinbase already connected to millions of wallets.
It seems complicated but for an average user the system will mostly be automated, similar to using a contactless card payment, you don't need to know how it works just that it does.
So for example a 30 person chain won't necessarily take 30 days to move money across. It could be instant.

This isn't alt-coin discussion...
As the link says, 'Happy Easter' from myself and everyone at the Litecoin Association to everyone in the crypto-curreny space. This is a gesture of good will, nothing more.

They came from bitcoin core - 
Tom and Luke both had chance to provide input and review everything before the video was made. You can find a link to the script and sources used in the description of the video.

Yeah I'd be up for it, it's just the logistics of organizing something like this, it would probably be easier to have one on one discussions.
