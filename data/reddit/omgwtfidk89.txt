The value of money is arbitrary there's no reason why a loaf of bread is not 1/1000 of a dollar. If bitcoin can be sub divided like it is now, the only reason keeping us from saying a trillionth of a Bitcoin equals a loaf of bread would be, simplicity.

Yes, but nobody is trading with bitcoin, as in what is selling commodities like oil, grain, ECT for Bitcoin.

Liquor is the best currency in a end of the world situation.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:03:13
Bullets only real value come when unused. Liquor can disinfectant wound, could be use to start a fire and a bottle can be turned to a Molotov cocktail. Once you shoot a bullet all you hav is the casing. To re build it you need more lead, gun powder, a primer and they need to be in accurate to some degree of tolerance. For liquor as long as biomass exist and you have containers you can make it.

Are the people getting rich on Bitcoin selling after the price gets high enough or are they holding
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:58:58
I have been say this since I realized more people hoard then spend. Money value come from how much it is traded rather then the value we put on it. Right now bitcoin is like a stamp collection one can have great value but cant  be traded.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:14:55


[but think about](
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:53:57
I imagine this make Bitcoin more stable buy showing trade tho.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:26:01
    1. If a password is forgotten that wealth is lost and cannot be recirculated. This is made worst by a finite amount of coin that will exist
    2. Gold hoarding, if Bitcoin was to be the dominant form of currency if a upper wealth had control of a large portion of the available coin they could manipulate the market just as easily as they can now with less consequence.
    All of the other holes are mostly for the here and now, can I pay my light bill with Bitcoin, can I go to a gorcey store? After that long term, taxes being a cheif concern. If somebody does volunteer to pay their taxes how can it be enforced? 
Right now bitcoin is a great way to lander money and buy drugs. Even if it becomes mainstream tomorrow it would just be ,virtual gold standard, currency with a economy that seizes up if power goes out.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:42:39
The but does the block keep track of how many coins total there are or how many are spendable? If there are 21m coins half of them are unspendable will the block reflect that the value to the spendable coins?
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:49:14
I understand how the banks are fucking me over, but I see too many holes in Bitcoin to buy in.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:54:52
Ok but what about the coins already lost? It seems like once lost of time and resources with no real means of "recycle" of those resources. You can easily say the same for flait currency but the all physical currency today is less the .01% of actual money in circulation. Those coins already lost could be 1% of how much that has been mined which is a large amount of currency to remove from a economy.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:52:55
This is a good thing, now people can pay there energy bills with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:54:34
If you circulate currency do just hoarding it will be no different than having a stack of gold but nothing to spend it on.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:25:09
Holding doesnt help Bitcoin buying and using Bitcoin for Financial interaction does
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:51:40
How do we know what Bitcoin are not lock up and which are spendable? The block chain does not tell the difference on the ledger, it would just some the people aren't spending. 
Money is lander though the bank because that is already main stream. Bitcoin is a new alternative. Physical gold has more uses then just as and finding more doesn't change the value that much. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:50:23
and *you* can provide a service to others in exchange for bitcoin then pay bills with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:33:32
So it would go back to the system we have now

What is the power consumption of those things anyway
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:18:34


That's exactly how a currency become more valuable than other currencies. I can pay my rent with two goats and a chicken, if that's what the landlord want to be paid with, but if they specifically asked for a certain currency they're clearly valuing that currency more than other currencies. As of right now more people treat Bitcoin as a stock, not as a currency, because HOdL. Some countries are turn to Bitcoin because their own legal tender is worthless, they are doing more imo the who bought in at a penny and been HOdLing ever since.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:57:40
Frist heard about it when it was 30$. I don't really care. Bitcoin, to me, is a pipe dream until I can go to a corner store and buy a snickers.

I didn't put the 6102 in there as what I want I put it there to show it could be a problem. now if one person was a problem I don't think it would be a problem and all of what u/nimblebodhi and you have said is correct but what about a company. if  companies use bitcoin death does not come into play. Companies like De Beers are known for controlling a products flow to control price. what means are there to prevent that?

@_date: 2013-11-14 15:06:14
From what I can tell bitcoin is already regulation proof
-the rate of creation for bitcoins is set
-the exchange rate is based on who and how many people are willing to use them 
-the groups mining coins are not banks and interest does not work with the bitcoin model.
