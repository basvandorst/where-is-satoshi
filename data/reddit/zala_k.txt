Why does bitcoin need a documentary?
It's like 3 years old and hasn't even become mainstream yet.

I've wondered about the same thing.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:02:34
I wish this were real.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:17:39
Same here.

The third bubble begins, raising one bitcoin to over a million dollars.

Convert to USD and then to Bitcoins.

A way to buy bitcoins easily with just a credit card.

OH YEEAH!

What I'd like to see is cloud funding take over traditional lending and borrowing.
Now that we have the internet and an easy way to pay, why do we even need a bank to loan or borrow? It would great to see everyone in the bitcoin economy deciding for themselves what kinds of projects and businesses should be funded.
And you mentioned interest as something you'd like, but keep in mind that the value of bitcoin increases as it gets more popular. It's designed so that you don't even need to collect interest.

I had the same problem. Took me two days to download the blockchain and get my bitcoins.

GLOBAL WARMING! BUY BUY BUY!

This is awesome!

How much are you willing to bet?

A whole lot of hackers, drug dealers, anarchists, and teenagers are now the richest people on the planet.

Would this new exchange allow bots?
I'd hate to see another bubble burst by some asshole able to manipulate the price.

That's hardly a good comparison.
The government will most likely treat Bitcoin like it did E-Gold. Except this time they won't actually be able to do anything.

I think Wall-Mart now has a $1000 limit on moneygram orders.
The one near me has that. I don't know if that's their policy everywhere.

Found this. Looks like an eWallet service that acts as a bank and gives interest.
