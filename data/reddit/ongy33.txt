My transaction from 27/11 with 3sat/b has still no confirmation.. There's too many transaction volume. [Tx](
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:26:27
Could they do:
`Bitcoin --&gt; Monero --&gt; Bitcoin`
Through shapeshift?

I can't find out how to rebroadcast on Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:45:20
Take a picture of the QR code when activating 2FA. Keep it in a folder, AES-256 encrypt it. Store it on a cloud storage (Google drive). You can scan the QR code if you ever need it and still keep it safe

You can buy bitcoins on  without ID. However, prices will be higher than market prices
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:32:07
Placed some into Poloniex and lending it out, hoping to earn some profits. Hodling others
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:30:35
They will just earn bitcoins from miner's fee
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:09:08
I buy/sell coins at CoinHako. It is for south-east asians who wants to buy bitcoins, specifically Singapore. They have preety low fees (0.9%) and their support replies very quickly.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:26:41
Still waiting for Bitfinex to allow BCH deposits :\

No idea about that 
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:47:41
Damn.. that's shady from Poloniex.. Thanks for this information!
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:45:47
Tx ID?
Also wow.. 6mBtc for transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:35:10
I'm almost 9% there! 91% more to go :(
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:40:15
Dollar cost average? Spend a little every week (Maybe $50? I spent $7 every week because I have no income) to buy Bitcoins. When there is a drop, buy more bitcoins. Even if it didn't drop, at least you still have the bitcoins you bought every week. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:52:27
Thanks for the information!
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:08:42
Am I late? lol
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:04:34
June 2017! Got into bitcoins 2 months ago
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:33:44
You can put it that way. It is fee that you include in your transaction. If you place higher fees, miners will more likely pick your transaction and place it on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:25:23
ask over at r/BitcoinMining. They will provide more helpful answers
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:06:53
Ah, got it. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:43:26
Wow.. 3 hard forks in a month
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:07:25
Why do you say that? Do they have a bad reputation?
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:50:08
74 sat/b is still pretty high imo
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:34:12
localbitcoins ain't better.. They have higher fees
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:33:21
Did not receive a reply from gonna try here
After the hard fork yesterday, I followed Electrum's instructions to prevent my btc wallet from being hacked. I transferred my bitcoin about 2-3 hours ago to a new wallet. I tried to sweep the private keys on my old Electrum wallet but I did not receive my BCH.
Did not use Electron cash as my computer doesn't want to run it
Extra information:
* I used blockchair and I can see that my BCH is in the old address.
* I had all my coins on just 1 address, did not have coins on other addresses

Thank you for doing this giveaway! 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:27:24
Probably students?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:20:45
Now it's harder to buy 1 BTC... 
1 BTC = $5k Singapore dollars
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:41:24
I would love that, but I cannot run Electron cash... It gave me an error..
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:17:07


How do I send a SegWit transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:57:39
Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin-LTE, and BitcoinANONYMOUS
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:34:16
Don't worry about it, I had a transaction that took almost 2 days to get 1 confirmation
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:01:10


I wouldn't suggest you receiving fiat from PayPal. After you sent them their bitcoins, they can issue a charge back and you lose your coins and miney
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:20:34
I only have 0.09 Btc mate
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:17:35
Haha just wanting to earn some coins while hodling
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:36:21
He sold his bitcoin for Bitcoin cash on Nov 12
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:12:51
Undervalued, great development team
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:22:38
0:15 - Rise to $5,000. China fud hits, 3k support level reached
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:16:10
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:25:27


I got in at $3k
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:21:37
I would blame him for not introducing bitcoin to his SO's dad
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:56:14
Miners will earn bitcoins with fees set by the users.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:36:36
My ledger is coming in 2 weeks!!
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:44:07
[Here :)](
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:33:13
That logo is BCH
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:47:58
Same! Mine's coming in September!
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:32:47
Dammit... my ledger will only arrive in September
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:53:27
Yes, but what if there's a malware on my phone? I can't really put a huge sum of bitcoins in a place where it is not that safe. Trezor and ledger both uses the USB ports to turn on. It's much more safer to use a trezor/ledger.
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:25:00
I wouldn't mind, have 8/100 of a coin :(
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:49:10
The seed would be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:14:22
Preordered my Ledger Nano S and it's arriving in September! Can't wait!
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:42:32
I want to keep my bitcoins in a safe place. A paper wallet would be great but I don't trust myself keeping the paper safe
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:53:47

Where do I signup to get this cool wallet address? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:24:09
 Looks like they got payments already
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:23:59
I'm 17 and bought bitcoin at LBC. Just upload your ID and that's fine. Don't think there's age limit.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:42:55
Ah damn that last paragraph...
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:55:02
Who is this hacker named "Bitcoin" smh
