Another productive day of watching the price go up and then lower than it was at start of the day! 
Feeling that;
'...today is the day,
...Why am I hodling, 
...should I swing trade, DAY TRADE!?!
...that's it I'm done I'm not checking it anymore
...but what if I forget my password...nah I'll stay
...I've got a feeling'
Can we please start a Cryptocurrenty anonymous? I haven't invested more than I can afford to lose I just want to be rich as hell and retire and tell my company to go suck a dick and I'm impatient has you can get ��.
Oh ok rant over ��. 
ps. back to Binance I go before I come check here for the moon news then quickly check Binance again then maybe watch some YouTube guy be like "It might go up or down..." for about 34 minutes. ��������������������

@_date: 2018-08-15 17:26:36
Big short....what we thinking? I think we may have hit the bottom, Then again I know as much as everyone else...nothing.
Oh except the whales are manipulating the market and we are just waiting to surf their wave when it arrives ������‍♂️

Is this it?
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:06:26
Awesome, where you thinking? $4500?
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:55:53
I don't trade haha! I just hold, truth be told I'm still down. ��
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:03:29
Everyone needs to prepare themselves emotionally for a HUGE correction in the coming days. With tether being rekkt, chances are alot of people are going to cash out of crypto entirely until we see some kind of calming of the market, so expect volume to become very erratic has bitcoin tries to find it's new price and then fall drastically. Just my opinion guys but just hold your chin up we will see the moon again. ��
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:15:18
-Bitcoin "But mooooooN...??"
@_date: 2018-06-22 08:53:38
There's next to no support also...I see a black Friday sale on route!
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:43:35
Bart incoming...
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:16:05
Bit late...that was yesterday, I could be wrong but these things normally effect the price in an instant so I can't see how, this is certainly something else that we probably don't know about yet haha �� 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:07:17
Yea, not working.
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:17:39
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:46:36
But what of we miss the moon shot.?..JK
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:49:07
Don't invest until we see a certain upward trend that holds...Don't buy in a rush or emotionally...
@_date: 2019-02-03 22:54:17
Except that subheading number '10' - "Price" 
Try again..��
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:42:20
Hmmm...are you sure. Look at the title? "January recap"...think your wrong mate.
@_date: 2019-02-03 11:20:26
TLDR - Bitcoin continued to drop.
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:01:04
It certainly is on me that's correct...and all those that want a TDLR. ��
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:17:58
Ahh a true bitcoin price prediction.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:13:59
Swing and a miss!!!
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:08:07
It would confirm the inverse head and shoulders. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:54:26
Not until 6800+
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:44:11
What makes you say that? We were expecting a bull flag but that never came? I think this may be bad news...lower high at $8500 back to find new bottom...only joking ...No one knows it will go up or down we shall we haha!
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:50:54
If we ever hit $6000 again we will go a lot lower  in my opinion but then I don't see us dipping to that area again..IMO!
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:25:39
What a fake out that was.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:55:28
I agree we shouldn't sell has it's just plummeted however this is not that same as yesterday.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:30:31

@_date: 2018-07-17 16:13:08
Hmmm so yea that 6800 a bit of a bitch isn't she? No bullshit here ...the time to invest $1000 is at 6850.
