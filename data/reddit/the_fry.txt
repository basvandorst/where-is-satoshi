DO NOT STORE ON AN EXCHANGE LONG TERM.
 
Take it from me.  I stored about 75,000 Litecoins on Cryptsy when it went down and the owner fled to China.
 
Hopefully he at least got a nice house and car out of it, cause I sure didn't.

wirexapp seems to work.  If you setup the address in France be aware you have to validate your account before you can use it at all.

Guess I'll just live out of an RV and eat Ramen and watch my investments gain value and die without ever putting them to use.

So i didn't use bitcoin to buy a bunch of stuff last week?  Huh, wonder why they shipped it to me.

Because I got in basically for free and anything purchased with it costs me nothing.  And you don't have to verify at the very next block, plenty of miners are hitting the lower fees.

They're usually in malls from my experience.

We already have a BeeCash lol how far can this go?

Probably, but these sites don't and likely never will accept BTC so this is what I have to do.

To be fair you can buy/sell gold without moving the gold.

Volume.  If I have $10,000 in a legacy wallet, transferring it into a segwit wallet to save on future transactions is no problem.
 
And if you have it stored on Coinbase or whatever, that cost is basically insurance when transferring to a local wallet.

I didn't buy in this round, so we should see a new ATH soon....

Sounds like physical manifestation of depression.

He understands it, he just doesn't have control over it and will spread whatever FUD he can to discredit.
