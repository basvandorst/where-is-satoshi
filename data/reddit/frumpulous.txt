They've said before, it's not their call. They can issue the giftcard amounts in denominations dictated by the gift card parent company.
edit: whoa but egifter seems to beable to do it just fine? My mind is blown. Not sure why gyft doesn't do it now.

I was a believer in Gox. Gox was the oldest exchange and had endured many problems and my thought was ,
"what doesn't kill Gox makes it stronger" 
LOL I was wrong.

They do understand bitcoin. If you read further in the released ford Trend report PDF file they talk about coins.ph saying 


complicated, frustrating and expensive for those trying to send cash to loved ones
across borders. Now there’s coins.ph, the Philippines-based mobile Bitcoin wallet
that’s delivering the cryptocurrency to areas without secure banking. The app allows
users to buy and sell Bitcoin and store it in their digital wallet—and easily send Bitcoin
to family members and friends, bypassing long bank lines and high transfer fees.

I agree. Some people's think "micro transactions" are dust and satoshidice tiny, but anything between $1-$10 is a pretty significant transaction.

Assuming you're the main holder of a private address with a lot of coins, what's to stop you from bringing that address to the future?

or buy a more easily achievable 2.1 so your 1 in 10million. or any multiple of 2.1 so you can say"yes I own 1 in 5million, aka 4.2 btc" lol.

I'm too paranoid about the IRS to sell.
