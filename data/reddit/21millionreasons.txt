We are likely several orders of magnitude short of where we long-run need to be in terms of transaction capacity. Long term it will probably be all second-layer on top of Bitcoin but in the meantime the Litecoin network is a codebase compatible 5x improvement

*The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks*
Nakamoto remembers.
**Edit:** Shouldve mentioned that the headline above is found on the genesis block that starts the Bitcoin blockchain— back in 2009, around the deepest lows of the financial crisis.
