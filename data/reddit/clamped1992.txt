Before the argument, I'd like to be clearly stated I'm Chinese citizen who now live in Shenzhen, where the company of that website above is established. I was badly curious about why they were still running a exchange platform of BTC in China though the central bank of China  had banned such website from deposit CNY.
Frankly, the policy had already made itself clear, marking its end for BTC trading in mainland China. Then soon I background-checked the website company via Google and Baidu(Another mainstream search engine in China), it was a surprise-- the [website] company is located near my university district and holds less than 50 employees according to the local yellow page and ad. service.
From its self-introduction, it says "深圳智维网络有限公司由大量互联网业内精英组成，公司核心团队均来自各大互联网企业，有丰富的行业经验。经过将近半年的研发，公司首款作品《机甲2046》于7月11日启动第一次技术测试。深圳智维网络有限公司是一家专注于网页游戏研发与运营的公司，随着发展，智维网络欢迎富有进取精神和责任感，愿意迎接挑战、实现人生价值的有志之士加入，同创事业、展示自我、成就未来！" Translations I would highlight is that the company specialized in website game. Unfortunately, its official portal is unaccessible.

--&gt; one of their game URL(CLOSED)
A low-cost game company now has transformed into a uncertificated exchange platform runner, and is supplying illegal deal. 
HOW SAFE COULD THAT BE?

YES. Authority indicates firm cold attitude among these coins. U still can hold them but can't trade with CNY in the near further. There were so many new enterers rushing in, trying to make quick money over BTC.

Few moments ago, I checked the the website license. It was released on May 30th. No doubt in that early days, BTC value was on a rollercoaster. But since the new policy coming out, I suggest using these platform should be paying extra attention. There were some cases of frauds when dealing crypto-exchange and they are NOT NEWS around here. Basically I don't trust them.

No, they mean it.
Interesting thing is that, you can't access the web now.

Yeah, rivals are everywhere.

If they continue to supply LEGAL exchange, like without CNY trading, they will be just fine.

Sorry I'm a freshman in Reddit (I seldom use it and never replied till just now)...
I guess I'm confused by the replies on my post. Several conversations are going around here.

Nope, the Chinese gov. denies the BTC as a legal currency, meaning it's hard to call for help.
