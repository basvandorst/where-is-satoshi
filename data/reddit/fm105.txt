Interesting initiative. There seems to be a tension, however, between your stated goal ("let's liberate bitcoin"), and the way you are proposing to go about it ("Ultimately I will decide who wins"). A possible solution, consistent with the sentiment that one month is not enough time to project or set up the kind of thing you are envisaging, would be to allow for a short discussion phase in which the platform/selection process/bounty distribution are more clearly defined, with community input. Now you may not want or have the time to do the work of compiling and analyzing all the suggestions and opinions, which should be sought far and wide. But you could surely hire an assistant for a week, pay him or her a small fraction of the original BTC bounty, and try to get this project set up properly.

This 1996 paper clinched it for me. Those who do not know it should work through the intro, at least.

The conclusion is that money can be replaced by memory. Bitcoin does not have monopoly on memory.

- bitcoin has no intrinsic value: so it is with any fiat currency, by def. 
- bitcoin is not backed up by anything: false, it is backed up by the formidable power of mathematics and of the network. 
- bitcoin will be *the* universal asset register of civilization: far less certain. but simply providing a public transaction ledger is quite valuable, as is now clear.

Indeed. I do not assume that right now bitcoin affects all of a current commercial bank's business model (for example lending), just part of it, enough so that holding bitcoin (still under the assumption of continuous  increased adoption) would tend to be profitable in view of the deflationary nature of the currency. this is desirable for an entity like a bank, which needs to invest its cash to make profit, and would be losing business to superior technology.

It would seem the raking strategy only applies to people who acquired their BTC early, either by mining, or bought in when coins where much cheaper (e.g. &lt;$10) and are now riding it out. If you bought in later (e.g.&gt;$100) and are trying to increase your holdings for the long run, why would this work?
EDIT: read through the [rpietila plan]( understand your comment better now. Thanks for bringing it up.

Not sure I get it. You bought in at $150, sold some of that all the way up, but simultaneously bought using cost averaging?

Re: parting with your bitcoins. You can of course keep your holdings intact, purchase the necessary amount of extra BTC at the present conversion rate, and immediately go shop online with those. Cost to you is the same, maybe add some small fees here and there*, which are offset by the fact that (a) your stash is appreciating at some unheard of rate and (b) by moving BTC around, you are presumably contributing to this appreciation process.
Example (US): 1) Have decided to buy a $20 book on Amazon. 2) Exchange $20 for BTC at Coinbase at whatever rate. 3) Immediately buy a $20 Gyft card (denominated in BTC) paying directly from Coinbase. 4) Use the Gyft card to pay for the goods at Amazon. A little circuitous still, but in all it takes 3 minutes, not much more than it would take you to fill in your credit card info at Amazon in the first place. 
* Fees paid: to Coinbase 1% = $0.20, to your bank = $0.15, to Gyft = $0 (I take it they make money on the credit card fee differential), to miners $0.05. Total &lt; $0.50

You do receive the BTC instantly from Coinbase if you've gone through the hoops. Even if you have to wait, and you already have BTC, then as ntpl said, it makes no difference. Now if you have 0 BTC but still want to buy stuff with BTC and in addition want no hassle and no risk, this will not work. Sorry. 
I suppose that K. Spencer is seeing "parting with your bitcoins" as a problem because he is thinking of miners who earned BTC and do not want to spend them, as they constantly appreciate. But (a) by now several (most?) holders never mined, they bought and (b) miners are free to convert their fiat (e.g. dollars earned from their 5 to 9) into BTC in the way described in order to spend in BTC, if they so chose. 
EDIT: What if you'll never make a dollar again in your life because you've retired after mining so much coin? I suppose there are a few people in this situation. Then first of all you are going to have to part with some BTC in order to eat. But secondly, even if it means relinquishing even higher future returns, you are going to convert some BTC to fiat in order to diversify. For you know that Bitcoin may still tank after all, and it would be silly not to realize some profit.  So you would buy some real estate, for example.

Used to work fine. There is nothing in the spam folder. Can't find any messages even if I log on to voice.google.com. Not sure about Authy, is that a smartphone feature?
