It would have to be one hell of a solar flare. And then we'd probably be more worried about the radiation poisoning everyone has.

If you claim to be backed by Anonymous, you probably aren't.

You're not wrong. People don't want to hear it in this sub though.

This is important. If they have a quantum computer, they don't need anyone's bitcoins.

Why isn't it P2P?
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:32:19
Thank you for acknowledging this. People like to make fun of Y2K as a big hyped up non-issue, but I was one of the millions of IT workers putting in hundreds of millions of hours to fix it before it hit the fan.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:59:32
That's a good point. I figure the answer would be to make it a phone app. People are more likely to install and use that than a new software program just for social networking.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:45:25
It shouldn't be governed.

That's pretty much what I was getting at.

Reddit is all I need. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 04:14:38
That headline is very misleading. They didn't spend the half billion to build six homes. They collected a half billion and only built six permanent homes. Which it later suggests may have been because red tape and ownership disputes prevented more from being done.

I hate how much this sounds like a whacky conspiracy theory because it's probably quite close to the truth.

This is basically one line of code away from redirecting these transfers to a personal bitcoin address.

Yeah, I don't see how this compares in any way to bitcoin. It's more like paypal.
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:37:21
I honestly can't tell the difference between them and the United States anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:35:50
I'm surprised they have a database.

The network needs to be able to handle spam. This is a hack, not a fix. If there's a blacklist, it shouldn't be hard coded.

Yeah, I agree. I work in an embroidery shop and this has me thinking...

That's 550 cents! Or .0055 kilobucks.

Or create their own cryptocurrency. Sort of like they're attempting with mazacoin. But I agree, it's not going to happen as a 100% thing. You still need physical exchange.

I actually keep trying to get my mom to use bitcoin. She has repeatedly had all kinds of trouble accepting bank wire transfers from Japan on the order of $10,000 for her business. I've even offered to handle it for her.
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:15:31
No way, that's not... ok, well for a grand a week I'd do it.
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:15:03
I'm intrigued. Where did they find a $70 oscilloscope?
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:17:01
The QR code use isn't equivalent for credit cards. You can already swipe your card at a retailer (maybe even get your own card swiper for online purchases). But with bitcoin, you enter in the store's account, not the other way around. It makes a lot more sense for a store to give you their public account info and you send, than for you to give them your private account info and have them take.
@_date: 2016-10-12 14:38:15
I'd rather see a blockchain voting system. Everyone can see and verify the results and check to make sure their vote is in there. But it's still secret enough.

Which is not Ven.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:33:25
It's how government handles everything. Take something we like, remove everything we like about it, and put an official stamp on it.
@_date: 2016-10-28 13:50:41
Everyone's all about the technology. They just don't like bitcoin because they can't control it.
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:31:10
I didn't get that they were seriously looking into it at all.
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:09:46
Hmm. Maybe the board of elections has to generate and issue the keys after verifying identities in a process similar to how they do absentee ballots. Then they publish a list of public keys they've issued. (Maybe someone smarter than me has a better answer).

I think cheap is the point. You get to use everyone else's computing resources to make money.
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:39:28
Sounds good.
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:36:58

*Especially* if my government made it illegal.

I also don't want him in any office whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:42:25
All you have to do is get reasonably far away from the coinbase transaction. It shouldn't be difficult to make it look like you bought something with them and go from there.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:31:19
Just launder them better.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:37:30
So it mines.. but I have a hard time believing that thing provides a "steady stream" of bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:03:21
I, too, buy bitcoin with money I make at my job.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:18:53
Or a pencil and paper if you're really good and even more paranoid.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:15:40
That's good. If it's truly random, you should see some clumps of paired characters. If it "looks" random to you, it's probably less random. And choosing to use a more random looking roll makes it less secure because you're adding your own bias into the equation.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:17:36
Any way you want. Just don't tell anyone.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:57:55
So.... how can I be one of the artists?
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:54:53
I asked my tattoo shop about it and he said he looked at it a little bit and thought it was cool but didn't understand it enough to really get into it. I'll work on him some more. Maybe demonstrate next time.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:14:10
It's not going to be bitcoin. This is still just the very beginning.
@_date: 2013-06-04 14:56:17
It already has failed. But no, I don't want it to fail catastrophically either. A slow fading away would be much more desirable.
@_date: 2013-06-11 13:57:38
Even then, it would have historical value.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:27:17
You probably already have.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:50:10
50,000 BTC seems like a lot for one US Marshal. You can buy a US Senator for far less.

They've got money to burn. It's just another investment. Why be at the top of one thing when you can be at the top of everything?

With the rate of abandonment, you might be in that first 150 by now.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:07:54
I see it as a completely different topic. Bitcoin isn't inherently of any particular political (or anti-political) nature. Just like drug purchases and money laundering aren't a fault of the currency. It just happens to be useful in this arena because of the particulars of its implementation.
@_date: 2013-09-27 18:08:46
I did some work for them. It was about right for the work I did. No regrets. Well, maybe a little.
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:16:11
Whose government?
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:51:07
If everyone thinks that, then it is.
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:31:45
What's the difference?
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:28:20
Yes, it is used in money laundering and other illegal activities. Just like federal reserve notes.
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:17:36
Thanks. I didn't know about the Jody blogs. So they're still in the late 2012 orders.
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:03:59
I never claimed it was the best source ever. But it's about the only one I've got. Even BFL hasn't claimed how far along they are, which they were doing regularly for a while. Your personal story isn't technically any better than that list, but I'm glad you've added some info. Would you care to add about how long you've had them, or even your order number?
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:31:36
Or someone else figured it out too.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:50:47
@_date: 2013-09-27 17:45:50
Hey, don't feel bad. I sold around 750BTC back when they were $0.50. Had I just kept them, I *could have* paid off my house. But at least I can say I contributed to the success of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:51:07
Or somehow make people think it was Anonymous' currency.
@_date: 2013-06-04 14:59:26
Bitcoin is not so fragile that this even matters.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:18:32
Exactly. Why would the wealth distribution be any different in a different currency?
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:18:06
I'm going to post a sign that I accept bitcoin at my next yard sale. I doubt I'll have any takers, but it might spark a conversation. But while I'm at it, I'll offer trade cash for them or give them as change.
@_date: 2013-09-19 15:17:19
Sure. They'll just fund it with pre-orders of miners two generations out.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:02:05
It's a pretty big beast that happens to have already survived a lot bigger things. Doesn't mean it won't be changed though, and change isn't necessarily a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:15:50
I agree. It needs a wider base of acceptance. Right now it seems there's more investor/speculator types than those using it as actual currency. I would expect things to continue like this until minting slows to a trickle.
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:13:26
Your winnings, sir.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:41:13
Think of it the other way around. If it's taxed that way, then the government is acknowledging it as legitimate currency. That's big.
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:24:39
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:45:37
Holy shit. Bitcoin has finally made it.
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:37:16
So... about 2 weeks if everything goes right?
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:01:56
Not exactly mainstream, but:  
["Spending Bit Coins on ho's for they Photos  
with no Kimonos"](
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:12:03
And accepting them ought to be less tied to USD. Right now the BTC price of everything is based on the realtime market value in USD. No one is willing to say "I'll take X bitcoins for this." They all say, "I will take X USD worth of bitcoins for this."
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:20:40
Or just change the default options.
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:28:30
0 on my BFL ASICs.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:00:24
No. Not really.
@_date: 2013-08-24 16:24:56
For a while there, it at least seemed like there was evidence they were shipping. That halted at least a month ago.
[Unofficial BFL Pre-Order Information](
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:38:37
That too. I think it all contributes to an overall uncertainty that leads to the regular bubbling. All things considered, I think bitcoin is still doing remarkably well. And the details behind it have shown us to be sound. The failures are entirely human.
@_date: 2013-09-15 00:40:35
Backordered For Life
@_date: 2013-06-27 18:30:33
But if they call them 'credits' they will leave bitcoin in the dust.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:18:39
The coins themselves don't even really exist at all. Just a long math problem describing who has them.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:17:53
Maybe. But we're not starting over. People are just converting existing wealth to bitcoins. So it follows that the rich people would be the ones able to purchase the most bitcoins (or purchase enough mining power to mint the most bitcoins).
@_date: 2013-08-05 14:32:08
How else should someone differentiate between 1 BTC and a physical coin whereupon is written a private encryption key, allowing one to claim the ownership of a single, whole bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:33:52
Are other currencies "lucrative" ?
