the secret to avoiding this kind of shit is, don't talk about your investment with idiots at work - why bother even mentioning bitcoin to people like that?

My wife is the same, just ignores me and gets on with her own shit, in the bright side, she does not mind me spending money on it, and does enjoy discussing what to do when it hits 10 million. That's pretty much our, if I won the lottery id..... Equivalent.
My brother in law on the other hand gets pissed of when I talk about it, I tried to persuade him to start accepting crypto in his restaurant and he turned on me as if I'd suggested he start serving babies rather than fried chicken

I'm also confused by this, I know the shorts are betting that btc will drop, what I don't understand is who is taking that bet. I bought back in 2013 and have been holding since then. I bought some more a while ago thinking to start trying to trade on the small ups and downs, before deciding that I'm just not smart / well informed enough to make anything like that work without pure luck.
Unless you have a friend who is a whale, or some secret inside knowledge keep hodling.

Every time I buy something I ask, do you guys accept bitcoin?

I'll check them out, about how much do they inflate the price?
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:55:13
10% though? That seems a bit much

Sweet, thanks

How do you tip in reddit? I mean, how do you have a wallet connected to your reddit account? Sorry if its a stupid question...

I've been using coin corner, they are pretty easy to use and fast with transactions, but they rape you on the buy and sell prices, not a viable option for fast trading and playing the market for this reason

You have obviously never lived in a developing country, half of the houses I've lived in have decorative sockets, I don't know if the builders forget to wire them up, or if they are disconnected by landlords, or if they are just installed very poorly, but the experience of plugging something into a socket and getting no power is a very familiar one.
I guess the op is in the states though, where this kind of thing is pretty uncommon. Your average house breaker won't go round plugging his phone into every outlet , so it adds security in that way.
Edit: a word

This is getting ridiculous, I know, because I am Satoshi (for evidence check this comment)

Selling your chance at a mortgage free life to enter into years and years of debt. Seems like a good idea.
Bitcoin for a house is a great idea, bitcoin for a mortgage seems like a bad one

1Worth a great deal of money.
‘a valuable antique’
More example sentences
1.1 Extremely useful or important
‘my time is valuable’
 Oxford english dictionary
Edit to reply to your edit: Value in terms of money is commonly used, but items also have intrinsic value, which can go beyond just money, the intrinsic value of gold comes from its physical properties - malleability, inert nature and conductivity. In a world without money, gold would still be prized. Bitcoin, in a world without money may not be as useful, but in a world with commerce, its value comes from its ease of transfer, and its freedom from government / bank control. Its price is determined by the supply and demand, in the same way as any product, but it has value far beyond its simple dollar price.

The second definition isn'teffected by supply though, even if gold were as common as iron, it would still be extremely useful. and therefore the second definition would still apply (we would see gold used in many places where copper is used today.)
 BTC doesnt have the same thing going for it though, its value as a trade item would be effected by having a huge supply, because of the nature of trade, but it would still have value as a method of exchange, even if the bitcoins themselves were not worth a penny, the technology behind bitcoin is a hugely valuable technological advancement, the blockchain has uses in many different areas of life.

Actually I thought it would grab attention, and was short enough to give a basic idea, going to the moon isn't the key, but getting btc widely used is.... I probably could have done a better job of it though, glad at least one person agrees with me, it seems like we are in the minority.

With localbitcoins are you able to get paid in foreign currency? I don't want cash trapped in rmb
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:00:39
Thats true, but gold has uses beyond being a store of value, as does btc.
Edit: so both are valuable in the second sense of the definition, not just the first

What would be your recommended exchange for either a UK or US based trader? I'm in China where trading is pretty much banned, but would like a place to put my coin so I can do some trading. Its currently stored in an offline wallet which is nice and safe, but it's currently pretty much impossible for me to either sell or buy
Edit: I've got a UK bank account, and someone I trust with a US account, so id prefer the UK, but could just as easily doa us based exchange
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:25:24
it would still be valuable, but not expensive - its value comes from its usefulness, its expense comes from its rarity.

You get it, I was trying to express the difference between what I see as the actual value (its use for trading) and its perceived value - the bubble pricing that comes from trading purely for profit, rather than using the coin how it was intended - as money
