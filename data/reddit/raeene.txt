I'm smart enough to know it isn't stupid. The point is that in denying the fact that he is Satoshi, on the grounds that he couldn't possibly be Satoshi is ludicrous. 
The fact is it doesn't matter if he is Satoshi or not — and holding up Satoshi to some divine entity is rediculous. He doesn't need to be very special, simply a good programmer with a brilliant idea — who managed to pull it off. 
What I don't get is why it matters so much to people, when we should simply as a community decide to lock the assets which are presumed to be Satoshi's and let that be the end of it. 
If those bitcoins move it will cause a massive crash and destroy all of bitcoin, and the fact that an idiot like this could be Satoshi is enough to merit locking the use of Satoshi's assets for all eternity.

Do you mean 10^9 or 10^10 or 10^11?
I have a hard time thinking you meant 10^11 = 100 * 10^9

Well if not normality, if I were you I'd give up on conspiracy for a little peace of mind.

You failing to understand is something else in its entirety, you and I know very well I have answered your question, time and time again.
 "My goal is to spread truth not ridiculously engineered conspiracy theories!"
(Geez, talk about low forms of arguing)

Why is this good news for anyone?
If you are a libertarian aren't you in it for you own sake? I'd understand if half the coins belong to you, but other anarchist etc. - why happy?

But how do you know which wallet is mine?
@_date: 2013-05-10 10:07:55
If you're in it for the short run. Trading on news is the only thing that holds up for more than 24 hrs.

Because that requires alot of effort and will slow down transactions - so vendors will fight it - hard. Putting cash in a till that automatically registers the bills in it doesn't consume time at all.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:46:59
Difference is who is doing the tracking, and where it is happening. Noone can connect me to my wallet without going through my transactions, which is work. 
On the other hand, getting money from an ATM I am required to register as a customer of a bank, no full-name registration is enforced in bitcoin-wallets making it much harder to connect my wallet to me.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:52:18
Irrelevant, we're not talking GPS here, but tracking of transactions!
@_date: 2013-05-14 08:29:10
Well imagine bitcoin takes off and multiply the value of bitcoin by 10 or 100 and consider than in ten years time only energy-efficient ASIC miners will be mining - then what is the rate?
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:43:50
How is it not tracking if there is a chip in every bill? Do you honestly think it won't become mandatory for merchants to scan every bill, so that you can trace this person withdrew this bill at that ATM, and bought a loaf of bread w/e. 
Not seeing that tracking isn't the same thing as GPS-tracking is being an idiot.

My goal is to spread truth not ridiculously engineered conspiracy theories!
How is the process of which the substance is created an excuse!?
The fact that the government is subsidizing corn does not mean that it was the governments plan to spread the use of HFCS to increase diabetes, that is ridiculous conspiracy and nothing more!
**How is you getting upvotes and reddit gold in any way relevant to you credibility!? Isn't that for more telling that people want to believe you instead of considering the for them inconvenient truth that the government ins't intrinsically evil!**
I on the other hand am pursuing a degree in science (something I am very certain you don't have)
How the hell am I blaming decent people!? Decent what? Multinational conglomerates?

It is in essence the exact same thing, bitcoin trading **is** forex trading. 
Forex trading is also many many many times more risky using leverage. There are very few bitcoin-trading sites out there today with leverage - while noone trades forex without leverage because you'd have a very hard time making back what you pay in fees, and make rediculously little money.
In forex trading you can lose more than you invest, in bitcoin trading you can only lose what you invest - we're not even in the same ballpark of **"safety"**.
(Which is also emphasized on the page I linked.)
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:58:56
Corn might be, putting high-fructose corn-syrup in everything has nothing to do with the government, its just the cheapest, you can do the same thing with rice-starch or any other kind of starch.
@_date: 2013-05-25 15:13:27
Haha, but they do!
Supermarkets try to get you to buy crap that isn't good for you like high-fructose corn-syrup (which is corn starch broken down to sugars with acids - dead cheap) which is linked to many diseases such as obesity and diabetes:  .
Maybe the worst thing about high-fructose corn-syrup might also be that it doesn't make you feel satiated, so you eat and buy more: 
They know fructose makes you eat more! So they put it in everything!
Retailers also try to prod and analyze you for information to make their marketing more effective and lure you into buying more: 
If it weren't for the government agencies like the FDA regulating food it would be like in China, lead in everything, and poison in milk-formula: 
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:53:18
Th use of corn might be subsidized, using acid to make high-fructose syrup is not. If rice were cheaper you'd use rice starch = nothing to do with government subsidizing.
**The source is subsidized, the fenomenon isn't!**
Switching to high-fructose syrup was because starch was often seen as a by-product to otherwise be thrown away  - it was extremely cheap. 
Cause and effect is not the same thing - besides corn is only subsidized in the US, high-fructose syrup in food is a world wide fenomenon.

Bitcoin is more volatile when you're working without leverage. With leverage you can lose $100000000 in 10 minutes with a bad trade - pretty ridiculous saying bitcoin is more dangerous, because there is just no way to lose more than you put in. And as of today the biggest drop was roughly 60% which is loads, but not worse than you can find on forex markets. News is for the long run, chart analysis for the short, but bitcoin has so much problems in its trading you'd do better to go long, since a 80 sec delay on a sale could have you with leverage losing everything you own and more.
And that is just an introduction site..
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:35:31
Thats because the news wasn't very groundbreaking. If bitcoin does get traction in China then it really will impact the price. If you're new to trading i suggest  - you will learn any trades longer than a few hours are based upon news. Bitcoin trading is essentialy the same thing as other forex trading.

"(maybe write down a short note for the family, don't tell them about the purchase that could be dangerous)"
How paranoid is it possible to be?
You have guns, gold, etc etc. at home, and everyone knows about it, but you shouln't be telling you own family about you btc purchase?! ... lol
**Just get an offline wallet on a computer you don't connect to the internet unless you buy/sell bitcoin - have several wallets, and back them all up securely**
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:01:32
In case you missed the first sentence in my response:
**"My *goal* is to spread *truth* not ridiculously engineered conspiracy theories!"**
You are simply using political jargon about denialism and "reality" etc. to discredit real arguements.
Where is **your** so called "empirical evidence"? I see no sources in your text, despite the fact that I included them for my viewpoint. 
I can say there is empirical evidence that everyone thinks my shit tastes like hard candy, that doesn't mean anything without evidence to back it up!

This just makes me feel like we are headed towards 1984 faster than ever. How can anyone justify tracking every single transaction? 
Fraud protection?       Sure...
Seems like a lot of people are reading what I wrote as if I somehow equated chip = GPS tracking device - which of course is rediculous. We are talking about tracking transactions - read the article!

On the other hand I keep seeing him being called a hacker all around. This is Financial Times, not just any newspaper though.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:49:07
In all honesty, I'm not hailing bitcoin at all in this post. What I am doing is trying to highlight a very undesirable development where governments believe they should be tracking everything.
Which in total makes your argument void. If you'r only reason for slander is because this is posted in a forum discussion bitcoin it is quite pathetic of you. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:11:30
You consider my behavior to contradict to my motives, but I can say I have more going for me than you - **if you want credibility provide sources**.
