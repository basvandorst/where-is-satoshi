This is a wavecrest problem, not a Visa or MasterCard problem. If you took the time to do research then you would know wavecrest lost its right to use Visa and MasterCard for anything, not just crypto cards.

This seems like alot more confusion on the everyday user end than making things easier for arguably lower fees than competitors.

Wasn't lightening network supposed to be released like 2016? And then again by the end of 2017? But people are still easily finding bugs in the alpha testnet of something that was supposed to be released....

This has nothing to do with my comment. What I got from your comment though is "it doesn't have to be better or easier to use as long as it sounds cool and I trust that it works".

Someone needs to step back and look at the big picture. Core has turned it into a a half wanna be PayPal and a half wanna be gold.

Pure non-biased information my ass. You can literally go read the scaling plan by the creator on a Bitcoin forum. You can read what it was supposed to be, and then if you have two brain cells you'd realize that this is nothing like it. The potential for what it was supposed to be was and has always been there. Your "potential" is just a greed fueled delusion.

That logic doesn't really make much sense. An investment strategy is different than what investments you are willing to invest in.

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:12:21
So Bitcoin is a centralized fork coin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:43:22
Why would I use it in the first place? I got into Bitcoin for the trustless permission-less decentralized open ledger payment processing. 
LN turns Bitcoin into a useless gold standard that forces people into an off chain centralized hub network. 
If I wanted that I would stick with Fiat and continue to use PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:19:30
I don't suppose there was any thinking involved seeing as OP even admitted it was centralized to me. 
Core supporters seem to be mindless zombies that don't realize their brain is connected to their mouths and fingers and it is best used in conjunction with each other.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:55:22
Lol, it's not even competition. It's just another PayPal, which isn't any competition to the banks.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:42:17
What makes other forks centralized but not this one?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:28:03
I love how it doesn't take 5 minutes before you have to cry BCH conspiracies. For a crowd that loved to flaunt that it was going to drop it when it launched to make crash and die, you sure like to cry wolf.

U/Cryptocoinex, is that you?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:25:25
First off, one of your devs admitted it will be centralized. Open source or not, it requires off chain centralized hubs that have also admittedly been explained will mostly be corporations and big businesses(if people will actually use it as a payment device).
Second, you just admitted you think that both are centralized. So what's your point? That the altcoin will give more incentives for businesses who like centralization to use it because they have more skin in it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:44:59
I have, and this is nothing like Bitcoin was ever supposed to be.

You should find him. You two would have alot of fun talking out your butt together.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:39:27
PayPal, a centralized hub payment processor. Lightning network, a barely less centralized payment processor that uses one less middleman for processing payments between a business and an individual that relies more on the certain business who controls the off chain(which takes away from the point of BTC already) hub.
Even segwit takes away from the point of Bitcoin. Seeing as it takes away a very fundamental aspect of the reasoning behind it. 
Nothing that core or theymos, Gavin, or anyone supporting BTC is doing holds the original fundamentals of BTC. But than again, from the get go Gavin has shown that he only cares about incentives of it making money.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:05:06
Funny, you talking about the soul of Bitcoin while allowing, almost forcing it to change so drastically that there is almost no "Bitcoin soul". 
Reading through the whole history, especially yours, when did you get so off track? When did corporate centralization seem like the better plan? Was it greed? Or was it simply that you wanted to see Bitcoin survive no matter the cost? 
It's crazy, something that started so open, for the people, gets turned into "my way or the highway" as you so openly admitted before.
I don't know whether to feel sorry for you, or to hate you, as your motives are not completely clear. But I certainly don't support you and anyone that truly cares about the soul of Bitcoin shouldn't either.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:58
You're sure sounding like a marketer. Nice sales pitch ya got there, even equipped with the trying to personally relate scheme.
You can go read what Satoshi wrote. "Bitcoin core" was never the plan.

You called it a fork right here also, soft or hard, it's still a fork. Quit eating your words.

Didn't members of core try to sneak it through that they very well might not support 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:02:50
I asked my friends dad who used to do some accounting. He wasn't 100% sure but he didn't think so. He's going to ask some friends who are more versed in that sector. But he didn't think it would be since you haven't made any actual fiat gain yet. You essentially just traded one speculatory asset for another.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:38:15

@_date: 2017-08-18 16:02:31
Well, from what I understand  core originally agreed. But then redacted that and said there is no guarantee they will go full 2x.
Still though, the economic majority of the time agreed to 2x, which is why bitpay is following with it. So core seems to just be doing what cash did, slinging fud and crying wolf because they're not getting their way.

Sooo the price still didn't go to $1200 usd after the fork. Still have over a month to get to october. But as far as your prediction that it would already hit that price.....you were wrong.

Unless you can "know" imaginary people exist,  but how far are we willing to change the meaning of words.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:29:47
Saying an opinion on how something open source should have all options made available is in no way defaming anyone. Such a very defensive tactic....
Core is "amongst the firmest protectors of Bitcoin" because they act like they know everything and a few people drool over them. In actuality BCH is closer to the original btc. Even 2x. Core just has their idea of what btc should turn into, nothing more nothing less. They're not really protecting anything....
Edit: btw, you seem like some crazy cult person talking like that
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:39:19
Actually, it's because of imaginary people that the definition is that way. Because of people shoving their imaginary people's beliefs down others throats.

@_date: 2017-09-02 00:16:14
Lol, someone needs to get out more. Not everyone is trying to eat you, though your rolls do look delicious. Getting out of the dank basement would probably do you good. Go ahead and look through my history and tell me where you have the turds to call me a shill for anyone. I literally talk shit to r/btc. Here, I ask a question and get attacked. It's awesome though, r/btc are still nice when I talk shit.
Edit: so I guess that explains why I hope your shit show fails. There's not tweens in other projects that can't take a question like it's not the dick they were expecting.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:55:57
I'm guessing that what they think is that splitting btc with segwit would be an attack? Idk, I'm just trying to figure out what's actually going on. 
Edit:splitting btc into sw2x(which of course uses segwit). And they refers to r/btc Thought I should clarify that.

Apparently the whole point that by the time you can't run a node on your shit tech right now, there will be newer just as cheap shit tech that will run it went right over your head. But if you came to terms with that truth you wouldn't need your centralized core telling you how "it should be done".
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:24:49
There's your problem. You think meth is good
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:14:13

Have more sessions. It's good for you and other people.
That was your reply to telling you to lay off the meth. Which, to any sane person would mean that you're telling me to have more meth sessions because it's good for you.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:29:14
It seems you are following the centralized group based on ego. The nodes will not be too big for even an RPI anytime soon. When it does there will be much cheaper, better tech anyways. So your little cry fest about you running a node is way premature with very little to back it up. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:01:14

@_date: 2017-07-17 17:17:11
You stated that it will reach 10k in 5 years. But that would mean the price would have to climb at a rate that you are saying is not healthy or sustainable. Which one is it? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:52:42
Lol. This still has nothing to do with the discussion, as I never said any of that was not true. You're obviously just butthurt you were proved wrong. Take this like the huge loss you probably just took and are so pissy about as a learning experience and go learn more.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:40:42
1. It does rise. 
2. Your example doesn't say anything good for your cause.
3. Fiat can go bust also, which has happened to several.
4. How many cryptocoins have been made and have gone bust is not a good example. It is just as intangible as fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:13:55
What are you even trying to get at? I don't think you understand, btc has outperformed fiat as a longer term hold.  It doesn't matter what it goes down to short term. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:45:02
Here's some learning for ya.
What is 'Fiat Money'
Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of. Historically, most currencies were based on physical commodities such as gold or silver, but fiat money is based solely on the faith and credit of the economy. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:34:02
......this has nothing to do with holding btc.....you're obviously just releasing some pent up rant about bitcoin not having a use case as a currency (which I believe). Living off of btc has nothing to do with making money investing.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:12:59
What is going on whit the price at the moment. All markets are in deep red (XRP too) ?? Does any one have news about what is going on ?

@_date: 2017-07-16 23:09:36
I don't think you understand what you're talking about. It doesn't matter where you can spend it, btc has risen in value at a rate higher than fiat. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:50:08
Dude, you're going way off track. Like a puppy that has a blanket thrown over its head you're just flailing to try and find something to be right about and sound smart.
Remember,  you're original argument was that btc has no outperformed fiat because the value of fiat doesn't go up, only down, and since you cannot spend it everywhere. I proved you wrong. It doesn't matter how many fiats bust compared to crypto. It doesn't matter what faith backs each one. Fiat value does appreciate as well as depreciate, and btc has outperformed fiat pretty much since it's inception on a longish to long term hold.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:49:07
Shall we do some basic economics and learn more about how the value of fiat rises and lowers?
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:43:18
You're argument was, "btc has not outperformed fiat because fiats value doesn't change" I proved you wrong, they are the same and fluctuate based off of the same market principles, faith. And btc has been doing alot better. Now you are trying to argue what with me exactly?

Lol, you're just deflecting now. Go home, you're drunk. Come talk after you've done a little homework.

Did anyone tell you that fighting fire with fire doesn't help a thing and makes you look like you were dropped?

Don't argue with a fool. This guy believes that fiat outperforms btc (which would make btc a horrible buy at any price obviously), that fiats value doesn't change, and the reason why btc is going down is because they compare it to fiat(this one makes absolutely no sense to me, maybe you could help me understand his logic with that?). That's his arguments with me at least. So far he just keeps deflecting and trying to say something that makes him not look like an idiot after saying the value of fiat never changes.... I'm not even trying to argue with him about the price of btc going down, but that's what his argument has come to with me no matter how many times I point out what the discussion started as (him saying that fiats value never changes and outperforms btc, (which he now thinks that btc will hit 10k in 5 years making his second point moot)).

That's all speculation. And it's currently over 1000 euros....

Must we forget that a quite a few of his bankrupt businesses ended up with those on top getting some nice and hefty checks....Kinda like what happened during the 2008 financial collapse. 
While we're bringing up the past, how about we take a little stroll to the time when he scammed people into buying property by making it look like he was already building there.
The one thing he has gotten slightly better at with age, is not completely flaunting how fucked up he is. 
But anywhoo, enough of me talking about how fucked up most people are to stupid to realize he is. Denial is easier than admitting you're wrong.... oh yeah, that history stuff. Well, if history tends to repeat itself, it doesn't look to good for him.

Go home, you're drunk.

You're contradicting yourself again

1. None have outperformed btc.
2. I'm not saying btc is a great hedge, just that "$1=$1 so it's a safer bet" has no bearings.
3. Btc is debatably a currency which has relatively only been a speculative  store of value based on the technology and supply.

The banksters that trump flaunted last week? Good ol trump, draining the swamp so he can fill it with his own piss and vomit. 
Is that supposed to make me jealous? That's chump change. Not even enough to make trump bat his eyes at your existence.  And for the bullets ...lol what.....I have guns too dipshit.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:33:03
So you're saying the dollar will outperform btc consistently? $1 may equal $1 in the us but it's constantly changing compared to other currencies/assets/stocks etc which is the point of investing. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:02:13
What's coming? Is trump going to take over the world and cleanse the earth so that only the master oompah loompah race will be around?
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:47:55
I'm guessing the answer to my question is no. Which is why you deflected it. Idk about you, but everywhere I looked, including the financial market, you are taught that history tends to repeat itself because humans are predictable. Well, trump thinks wallstreet banksters are great. Great enough to hire them and talk them up even though a few months ago they were the devil and we needed them out. Trump is great for them, he would deflect the problem, probably to those damn illegals, help out his wallstreet bros, and love the kickbacks he got from them (probably more fake Time magazines talking about how great hw is to hang up at his places of businesses.). And he would do it all while the idiots that just got fucked over door over him....like they and he already is.
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:51:02
Meanwhile he's cut their taxes, probably bailed them out,  and than pays Mexico to build a wall..... all while getting waves of support
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:34:46
Because he has tendencies from both dictatorship styles. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:48:06
Are you just stuck on stupid? The amount of Muslims who are that are that hard core is so small it's laughable. Idiots like you acting like that only makes things worse. It has been proven that the way Muslims have been treated does help induce radicalization. And it's nothing different than what the christians did, done, and are doing. And what are you complaining about anyways, 9/11 helped your boy trump cash out even though his building wasn't touched. He was probably out there celebrating with those Muslims ��
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:25:07
To the stupidity that makes you blind? No, I'm not oblivious, I feel sorry for you, so sorry I hope trumps friends from mother russia nuke you so you don't look any dumber.
Edit:really just so the rest of us don't look as dumb because we come from the same idiocracy we call a country. So maybe I don't really feel sorry....
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:06:34
I also need to say, this whole "trump is more powerful than any other president" is complete and utter cult of personality bullshit. He has no more or less power than any other wannabe dictator thay ran before him. He's just the only one that makes you do Nazi hand gestures while swearing an oath to him.
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:06:56
You still have yet to give a legitimate rebuttal to anything I have said. I give examples, you deflect and rely on cult of personality.
And I am not in crypto just to invest, I'm not a useless selfish piece of shit like that. But what do you really know about the big picture?
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:06:36
So even though he already lied about being tough on wallstreet, you think he would act differently in the future? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:48:49
Are we talking about th e same guy here? The guy who was going to "drain the swamp" and get rid of wall street because we don't need them. Then has the crowd go wild last week as he introduces his new friends....Wallstreet banksters?
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:32:43
Lol what. You are a complete piece of shit huh. You should climb back up to whatever mountain you came from. Yaknow, some of us are actually trying to make america great, not revive the USSR.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:17:04
There's nothing to come at.

And do you not realize that people that actually support the terrorists, trump gives arms deals and financial aid to right? Even after he claimed one is a a hotbed for terrorism, he gives them an arms deal.....
