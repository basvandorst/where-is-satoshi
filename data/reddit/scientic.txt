Didn't you know? All Google CEOs start their sentences with a word in Google's colors. Somehow this is the case even when it's not written down.

Just pay your taxes, folks.

Or 4. A law-abiding citizen.

For that matter, why compare a group of vastly different currencies and platforms to only one company?

Those glasses... Who woulda thought Satoshi's Vision was actually real bad?

Don't be silly, Canada's not a real place.

Can you not

Yes, studies show that wealthier individuals are much less likely to have children.

Japan's yen makes sense when you consider they don't have cents. If the US denoted everything by cents instead of dollars you'd get a similar result.

Yeah, I suppose it would. Now to find a coffee shop willing to front the channel setup fee...

But I thought that's how we're supposed to use BTC? Not the Veriblock thing, but as an actual currency, I mean. Nobody got mad at the pizza guy, right?

Well shit. Now I need to figure out how to live until 2140 to beat Thanos.

Trick question: I wouldn't have a fund manager. Picking a good fund manager takes as much knowledge of the market as actually investing yourself. Far better to stick to a dividend paying index like VTSAX, which contains every US business on the stock market.

Because the current narrative is that BTC has moved away from what makes it Bitcoin - peer to peer digital cash - to a store of value, whereas BCH is supposedly pursuing the former.

USD. Obviously it's fair to be taxed on what you earn, where you live, what you buy, what you drive, etc... while the government print more money to lower the value of what you've got left.

The biggest problem with Bitcoin as a currency is that it's deflationary. People are more inclined to hold it than spend it, which will ultimately collapse the economy if allowed to continue for too long.
Store of value? Fine. 
Money? I don't think so, not if the cap stays in place.

I don't believe that's the point redog was trying to make. MySpace may have been the first, but it didn't react to the changing demand of its users or potential user base, and so ultimately failed. It's not always the case that the first to enter a new space is a failure; the current state of Bitcoin's flailing community, its inability to adapt to the requirements of the current cryptocurrency climate, simply suggest that it has a future similar to that of MySpace, Nokia, Internet Explorer, etc. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:02:03
Was it the folks over at OKCoin that warned Bitcoin ran the risk of becoming the IE or Nokia of the cryptocurrency world? If Bitcoin continues - to be blunt - faffing about, I don't see why redog's statement is inaccurate.
