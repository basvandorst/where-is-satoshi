I'm not going to tolerate slut shaming from a pleb. I sentence you to twenty hugging kittens. Don't come back until you have hugged twenty kittens and are ready to accept that tactile stimulation is fun for all consenting adults over the age of 18 or 21 depending on location. Reproduce responsibly.

There's an upper limit to how large of a penis a female person is going to want to ride. No one wants a ruined vagina. Having a huge dick is similar to having a micro dick. A huge dick is a curse. A dude too large can't even get a proper blowjob. This is more depressing the more I think about the correlation of ego to dick size and the biological limits of the penis... it isn't like you can starve it or take it to the gym.

first, you put the lotion on your skin 
next, you put the lotion back in the basket 
otherwise, you get the hose
