You have a Bitcointalk account?

I'm long on Bitcoin. A true HODLer :) Even when it eventually crashes the market, it will still rebound later on just like it did after Mt Gox.

How will they fit? 1 Bitcoin is pretty big and the Ledger/Trezor are quite small? /s

That IS the reason. I have friends that don't know what crypto currencies are, and they've started to get "Bitcoin code" spam as well over the last month or so.

I have a coinbase account, and did not receive this email. Leak doesn't come from coinbase.

I'm not convinced it's a scam either, but I think it's odd they don't come out with a conclusive audit that proves they are solvent.
Even Charlie is urging them to prove their legitimacy. For the sake of the whole cryptomarket I hope they disprove the doubters.

Then you give the accountant your private key and he moves away and buys his own island.

The post, the tweets or the bloomberg article has nothing to do with Bcash lol. Get your head out your ass.

But to counter: There is no proof they in fact are backed.
It would be in Bitfinex' best interest to prove once and for all they are - so why haven't they? Should be easy enough.

He earns his money with his financial service provider Bitcoin Suisse AG. I'm sure he's paid in regular fiat. He's said in interviews that he has a diversified portfolio (even gold!) :)

Hey have you heard of Tether? ^^^/s
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:15:40


So it's like fiat.

It's being done by Jihan Wu (Bitmain/AntPool). They spam tiny transactions and mine them. This leaves the mempool congested as fuck with insane fees we see today like $30.
So not only are they raking in $$$ mining those high fees, they are also promoting Bcash by being able to say Bitcoin is slow, congested and has insane fees. It's very shady and very lucrative.

Okay, here you go:

Conclusive proof? As says that's hard, but check out  interesting read.
