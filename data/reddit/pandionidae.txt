BTC = status-quo threat. The blockchain that BTC operates on must remain uncorrupted. However, every fork increases risk. The ledger rules. Forks increase the potential for damage. Tortis vs Hare. Simply move the money without losing it. The volatility is low enough to succeed at this. BTC has its ups and downs but moves at a tolerable G-force. Is there a limit on the velocity of the BTC exchange where it becomes unstable and crashes its core blockchain? I don't know.  I'm not a mathematician. BTC still works, it still exists, it still does everything it always has.  The intrinsic value of BTC has not changed, simply the popular perception of it.  The longer it lives, the stronger it becomes. The blockchain is the soul of BTC.  It is not fluctuating, it is simply breathing: inhaling, exhaling. BTC is the Mother Brand of the blockchain. Please don't poison it.

BTC is a conduit. The blockchain is a plumbing system. The street value of BTC merely is the pressure within the channel. Yes, rats are swimming around as with any sizeable such system.

BTC IS NOT A STOCK: if you mean it increases and decreases in value then that's similar. it is a nebulous product designed to be a currency. it operates using block chain. because it is digital it can be transmitted electronically and maybe anonymously. it's value is determined by a series of random numbers and the general public's faith in it's operational effiency. the more it is adopted the greater the odds it will be staying around. people have previously used rocks as fiat. animal skins have been used as trade. paper money is easy to carry you in your pocket, however when the government falls your pocket is empty. this is the digital age and people are now exchanging digital data like Fiat without the need of a middleman. to sum everything up: when the value of Bitcoin crashes it is a reaction of humans taking profit, maybe listening to bad press, but the coin remains healthy, has not been hacked, and is well maintained (for profit).

Exchanges have been hacked Bitcoin has not been hacked. , not necessary to buy 1.0 Bitcoin buy 0.5 BTC or only 0.25 (or less). 0.25 could value at $4,000 in 3 months. It could also drop. Just hold it, like a baby.  Bitcoin is the gold standard for cryptocurency.   BTC is still in it's infancy.

GOLD is what China is buying. Sure BTC is popular. However, China has solid Gold in very large amounts (possibly more than the US). BTC allows a fast flow for large amounts of cash. I, personally, suspect this is their main interest.  Moving money from and to other countries they wish to financially influence, anonymously. China invests heavily in foreign countries.

I suspect they have already purchased massive amounts of GOLD. BTC is a conduit to move money quietly. They use BTC like everyone else does. Moving cash silently, with anonymity.

BTC is not the stock market. BTC is a long term investment, until it is hacked or legally banned.  To my knowledge, neither has happened (yet).  Your thinking like the stock market.
