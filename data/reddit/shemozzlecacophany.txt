The gdax charts are fluctuating all over the place. Just jumped from $13500 to $14500 in space of seconds and vice verse. What’s going on?

Bitcoin has ZERO value. It’s only value it what others are prepared to pay for it.

If what you say is true then doesn’t that make it more obvious that a big sell might be imminent so it would go against their strategy as others would sell lowering the price? And if it’s still happening does it not suggest there’s someone out there with the intention of seeking a lot more? Unless of course they are bluffing but I don’t see how that could work in their favour because it should, in theory, cause others to panic and sell.

Facebook and Instagram are sophisticated  technology platforms that advertisers are willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for every quarter to reach the masses. Bitcoin just “is”.

I’ve noticed chunks of around 50 bitcoins just jumping on and off the order book on coinbase for a few days now. Have never noticed it before and seems to have coincided with the big sell off recently. Still happening too. Seems to me like a seller is testing the waters to sell a big chunk without lowering the price. Anyone else noticed this? It’s not a normal thing you’d see right? 
Edit: jumping on and off the order book at the current market price. That’s why it’s been so noticeable.

Australia’s national radio station ABC added Bitcoin to their hourly finance updates about 4 months ago.
