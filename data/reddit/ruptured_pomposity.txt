Is cracking the passwords currently viable?  If so, why aren't the big value addresses attacked and emptied.

What is the theoretical basis for this inquiry?  Does NJ think that this code might be used to have web site visitors mine for the site owner without their knowledge?

What?  Why would you want to remove the motivation of the world's workers to work hard and try to better themselves?  No one wants a world of freeloaders.  That would be Communist.

From the article, it was available to download from their website at one point.  Someone involved with the hackathon probably has the code, so it didn't seem to be a huge secret.  Seeing as it is no where to be found now, maybe it has become such.

Only pull if you are planning to put down an attacker.  If you are not in danger of being killed or maimed, don't pull.

That is one philosophical argument: it is mine I'll use it how I want. Another argument is collectively we should be investing in the next generation to the greatest extent possible.  And the efficient optimum for society is probably some place in between. However rich you are, you did not acquire that wealth without the other people that form the society around you, assisting you earn it.  You probably depended on their services provided to you in the process.  You could also stiff your waiter on their tip next you go to a restaurant; it would be economically rational to do so.  But you won't because it is socially unacceptable to do so, and you want the good service to continue.  Well, the rest of us service providers are fed up of getting stiffed.  If you want the services that allowed you to get rich to continue, the social expectation should prescribe an equitable share of the pie.

While your statement is not Karma-palatable, there is some truth to it.  The oldest people do use the most health care resources; some of which would be better spent on preventative care for younger people.  Moreover, spending in the last year of someone's life is a sizable chunk of the total spent.


That was in 1996 - 1997.  
Granted no one can predict the last year of life, but we can get a pretty good estimate.  At some point, you have to stop throwing money at the dead, and keep the live ones living better.

Recognizing that our current system of remuneration is unbalanced for long term stability is a rational conclusion.  An emotion reaction to this conclusion would be outrage.  A predictive conclusion of mass outrage is rioting.

We are (or were) talking about health care management.  Unless you have no insurance, and pay for everything out of pocket, you participate in a managed health care plan that needs to determine the most efficient way to provide care to its participants.  Incentives such as co-pays encourage or discourage your use of health care services.  Thus, collectively there is a choice of front loading costs toward prevention and younger people, or back loading costs toward emergency treatment of developed ailments and older people.  Your own choice is of who is managing your plan, how much you are going to contribute to get the service level you desire, or your employer if they are providing the benefit.  Even if you pay for all your health care out of pocket, the price charged to you has more to do with rates negotiated by managed care providers, than the actual costs associated with the service provided to you.
You, sir, are not an island... not even a narrow peninsula.
