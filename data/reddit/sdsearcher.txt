Wow, what an interesting and illuminating read.
I, too, liked Jordan Kelly's remark that he has been "pretty honorable over this process".
Actually, being "honorable" would be paying back some amount each month - out of his own pocket if necessary. 
One hundred dollars per month would have been a monumental good faith effort compared to the continual stream of BS he served up to Adam O'Brien over 18 months.

I run Armory and I start it up each day to keep up with downloading the blockchain. The other day, I started up bitcoin-qt just to see how many connections I had and it said it was ten weeks behind. I believe Armory, bitcoind and bitcoin-qt all use my same local blockchain, so why wasn't qt up-to-date?

I was told that without a strong PC that's always up and good bandwidth I wouldn't be doing much good as a full node.
I suppose I could try it.
All I need is to forward port 8333 ?
Isn't there a program name I need to specify as well ?

I would think a mathematician would absolutely love bitcoin from the mathematics aspect alone. 
I'm no math guy, but bitcoin's math is fascinating and beautiful to me (at least the little I understand of it).
Ask him what he thought about a global money system based on and secured entirely by mathematics.

I know I'm not running a full node (no ports forwarded) but am I helping people downloading the blockchain via Bit torrent if I leave Armory running?
I was told that without a strong PC that's always up and good bandwidth I wouldn't be doing much good as a full node. I suppose I could try it. Is all I need to do is to forward port 8333? Isn't there a program name and ip address I need to specify as well?

Yes, I'm running BitDefender's firewall. I do have rules for bitcoin-qt.exe and armoryqt.exe that say Allow, any network, any protocol. 
I thought that seeing &gt;8 connections meant I had gotten through my router and firewall successfully, and was running a full node. Is that incorrect?
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:42:10
I think I've finally got a full node set up - I forwarded port 8333 and when running bitcoin-qt, it shows I have 13 connections. The problem is that when I go to  it still says my ipaddress:8333 is unreachable. Am I running a full node or not?

I'll try to briefly address your questions.
Q. How long does it take for a Bitcoin purchase to become confirmed?
A. Theoretically 10 minutes but it can stretch waaay out if you paid too low a fee or the network is sluggish.
Don't worry too much about tossing your cash in the toilet. There are, metaphorically, a hell  of a lot of other people lined up at the same urinal! Just don't put in more money than you can afford to lose and you'll be fine.
Bitcoin is complex and there are many ways to lose your coins if you are careless. Just be sensible and do as much research as you can handle. Youtube is a great resource, as is Reddit.
A confirmation means a transaction has been batched with others and built into a block and stored on the blockchain. The blockchain is the heart of bitcoin, it's basically a list of every bitcoin transaction ever made. Once your transaction gets added to a block in the blockchain, it stays there, practically unchangeable, until the end of time (or the end of Bitcoin). As additional blocks are added (AKA  confirmations), it makes it even harder for anyone to make any changes. There's a lot more to learn, so read up.
As far as anyone stealing your coins, you can be sure there are many thieves out here trying to steal it, but as long as you keep your private key private, NO ONE can steal it. Of course, in actuality, it can be hard to keep a secret on a computer hooked to the Internet, but that's what makes it interesting!

Right. 
I've heard other people say to enter it more than once, but I didn't even need to do that.

You can try this transaction accelerator: 
It's free and seems to work. It helped me last night.
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:22:04
Every bitcoin transaction has an ID, just a large number that is unique for that transaction. You can find it easily if you know the address you sent the bitcoin to. If you know the address, go to  and find the Search box down a little on the right  side of the page. Plug in your address and hit enter. This should take you to a "Bitcoin Address" page. Down a little ways on the left you'll see "Transactions (Oldest First)". The next line will have a big ass number, just copy/paste it into the accelerator page and you should be all set. It won't be immediate, for me my tran got into the second block found after I did the accelerator thing. Hope this helps, the thing saved my ass last night!

[That transaction]( was successfully completed on Feb. 23 and has been confirmed 1131 time (more confirmations are better, anything more than six is considered to be carved in stoned, can not be reversed).
So the good news is, that bitcoin was safely sent to address 1Jy8UPz1JpknLLcpjvUCCvSzr1zPJUPHdV. If that is the address you intended to receive the coin, you are golden.
We need to know how you determined that the transaction had not been confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:13:00
I plugged yours trans into [this accelerator]( I got a "Acceleration succeeded " message, so hopefully within the next few blocks mined by ViaBTC your trans will be confirmed. Good luck!

I had a similar problem and I was told to do a rebuild &amp; rescan by goatpig. It worked for me but if this doesn't help you, I would contact goatpig on

Ah, really? I didn't know that but I'm very glad to hear it. Thanks for the info!

When encrypting a message you specify who it will be encrypted for, right? You must *also* specify yourself as a recipient if you want to be able to decrypt the message.

Is the torrent bootstrap still available and helpful? 
It really sped things up the last time I did a full download/rebuild.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:33:19
This is very good information that I didn't know. Thank you much.

Found it! Many thanks!

Banks are like record companies, newspapers and typewriter companies, and Bitcoin is like the Internet. Their world may not collapse but it will be changed. It's the old vs the new.

If I understand your dilemma correctly, you want to clear the unconfirmed transaction, right? Armory (in Expert Mode) offers a "Clear All Unconfirmed" option under Help. I used this last week when the fee I used was apparently too small and the transaction remained unconfirmed.  Hope this helps, it worked for me.

I know Armory wallets can be restored using only the "root key" consisting of 18 four character words. Is Armory the only wallet that can handle this type of restore?
I had an experience recently where I could not run Bitcoin Core, but needed to spend some coin. I used the 51 private keys exported by my cold storage Armory as input to Electrum, but not all my coins showed up there. It was explained to me that the cold storage Armory was not aware of private keys created by my online Armory. This confused me because I didn't think the online Armory contained any private keys - that is the role of cold storage, right?
Can anyone help clear up my confusion? Is it possible to restore Armory wallets using any other wallet, as I had attempted? Is it a waste of time to create digital backups of my cold storage Armory's private keys? To restore an Armory wallet, must I use Armory and the 18-word root key?

You may want to go [here]( for official Armory support. [This post]( may be of use.

Try sending an email to support+reddit
It has worked for me before. The increased visibility seems to help.

That's the way I do it:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Armory\ArmoryQt.exe" --satoshi-datadir="n:\bitcoin\Bitcoin" --datadir="n:\bitcoin\Armory"

Go to  sign up and investigate the "cash deposit" method of buying bitcoin. The last time I was there it seemed like the process wasn't too invasive.

On Armory's downloads page they describe the offline bundles like this: 
"[Offline Bundle] for Ubuntu 12.04 exact (64bit)"
I took that to mean you can run this bundle on ubuntu 12.04 only. not on 14.10
