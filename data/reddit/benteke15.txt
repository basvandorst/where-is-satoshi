They stated employees with investments already in crypto wont have to sell them.

Been over 24hours since sent my btc from exchange to another, still no confirmations, how long do I need to wait?
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:43:15
Maybe look into something like Cryptocapital

"You can't lose long term if you HOLD." 
lol wut?

What transfer delay you mean? having both usdt and btc on exchanges already and then make the trade takes only few seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:03:04
no but im looking into it now
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:27:42
Yeah pretty smart. You ever gotten any trouble with withdrawing fiat from exchange into bank account? Those can get stuck for pretty long time as well.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:27:04
probably getting the money back to the cheaper exchange as well
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:02:18
do you withdraw the money to that persons bank account after every cycle or how you do it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:58
Sent btc 12 hours ago from exchange to another and still no confirmations. Is this normal?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:16:29
Been sort of doing the same thing, but havent heard of cryptocapital. Is the point that you withdraw fiat from exchange into CC and they deposit back to another exchange, making arb process faster?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:05:27
time between the transfer may and will change the btc price. Also it takes many days to transfer the money from latter exchange into the first one. During this time btc price could easily rise 10%, meaning if you'd just kept your money on btc you would made more profit
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:23
Do you see any apparent downsides to this? obviously would need lot of capital to make this profitable with fees and such, but overall this is good arbitrage style?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:42:37
Yeah maybe need to research it little more but in theory would be great to take bank wire out of the arbitrage equation and make it a lot faster

What about keeping 1btc on one exchange which is higher and 16k(or whatever btc is worth) on other exchange that is constantly lower and selling the 1btc and right away buy the same amount from the different exchange. Then just swap usdt and btc to the previous exchanges and do it again. withdrawal time wouldnt affect this way

Usually how long it takes for mempool to clear?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:20
what about bitcoin/usdt? and keep them in both exchanges and just swap back after every trade
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:15:58
210sat/byte, estimated time for btc transaction 3 days :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:38:26
anyone else have problems withdrawing usdt?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:07:14
How do you get the usd back to the original exchange and do it again? You have to transfer it to a bank and from there to the exchange again. This takes many days. What if during these days btc goes up 20%? You just end up making a loss compared to holding.

Anyone know how long btc transfer from exchange to another takes atm? network clogged?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:15:56
It's a good way to make money indeed if you are not worried about btc price rallying during the time your arbitrage cash is transferring to the bank and back to the exchange.

some are set orders

2 weeks ago 25mil$ market order was sold and it crashed BTC market cap 10%. 35k BTC can absolutely do devastating effect
