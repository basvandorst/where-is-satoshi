I can't log on to anything. Also, it seems that my verification for Coinbase was wiped out and that I need to reload everything...

This makes me ask the question, if I sell everything on January 1st do I have to worry about it being on my up coming taxes or would it be the following tax year?

If you want to send some my way I would be totally grateful. I just started looking into it.

Who is considered a whale? I don't own that much, less than 0.01 but I could still make money if I were to day trade. I don't plan on it, but more curious as to who is a whale.

Sir, you are so rich, please spare me a 0.00001

I think you need to change this to at least 50 dollars. Though I believe 100 should be your minimum. If you don't want to risk that much then don't invest. It's never too late to invest. So save up for a couple months, understand the concept and then buy into it.

This may be a long shot, but figured I would ask anyway. I am looking at starting my own health clinic to help patients in my area. I am currently working as an associate, but would love to own my own office at some point in my life. I love helping people and want to be there to help people become healthy or even stay healthy. 
Otherwise, I would love to see a donation to an ADHD or Autism foundation.

Thank you good sir, I appreciate the help

My question is this, if others are quicker couldn't that be the downfall of BTC? While yes, it has so much value, but if people start to see the difference in price and speed they may switch their money to something that is better suited before BTC can figure it out.

I've been seeing higher fees on CC but bank acccounts seem to be fine. I also trade Litecoin which seems to be the same with CC and bank. 
Edit: Mistakes were made, I was thinking he meant transfer to bank as if they were selling.

How else can you trade Crypto? GDAX is part of Coinbase and seems to be the easiest place.

Good to know, as for my job I'm an Independent Contractor so no taxes. so I'm not 100% sure on my taxes. Started in July and paid every other week. Typically I take about 15% from it and store it in a bank for this up coming year. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:09
If I'm being honest, I have no idea where to start. That's why I've been saving some side cash for when taxes come. I figured this was my best option with no real surprise. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:20:48
Haha, nice
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:41:24
Cool, thanks for the response. 20-50 is such an absurd amount of money now, but I can see how throwing them around with a few drops during the day could be worth your wild. 
One day I will own 0.5 BTC and feel good. But I don't think I will ever be able to get to 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:40
Awesome stuff!
I'm shooting for a business and paying off my debt from school. I currently have a job in my field so I can pay for my living and debt, but I throwing extra cash into BTC and a savings account. I figured I'm young enough to make the gamble.

What does TFTC stand for? Would love to check out this podcast

Thanks. Just downloaded the episode

Most people don't have a lump sum sitting around to buy bitcoin. Therefore this isn't really logical for most people. If you have extra money around, it will get spent one way or another. Things tend to pop up.

Haha, I'm in the same category with my fantasy crew. I keep talking about it and they keep sarcastically saying how stupid it is and waste of money and do on.  Though two of them are part of an investment company and I'm pretty sure they just cant see why anyone would go to crypto instead of mutual funds etc.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:38:36
Glad I made the switch before this took off.
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:27:01
Dropping 1 bitcoin into an account as well. Damn.
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:16:37
What?  
I would bet 1 bitcoin that more than 5% of Americans watch the Premier League. A lot of people watch it right into the NFL games.
