The war is just different now. Now it is the rich 10% vs. the poor 50%, and it doesn't look good. Because the rich buy politicians, and politics will never serve the poor. The poor are uneducated and barely capable to understand what is going on.
Before WWI, everyone in Europe wanted war, because everyone was confident to win. WW2 was, probably more than anything, revenge for WW1 and the poor voting for dictatorship to crush banks and elitist capitalism.
And here we are today, again, fighting banks and elitist capitalism. History is already repeating itself, and people feel the rich don't give a damn about their suffering. Slums on wheels, trailerparks in the US, youth unemployment 50% in some countries of the EU. So watch gonna do? Maybe people will just die out peacefully this time. Robotics can soon replace cheap labor force, maybe the rich don't need the poor any longer. Gated communities will solve the rest.
Big government and big states are never a solution to anything. Democracy doesn't work on a massive scale, it works only in smaller scales.
A big state only leads to mass surveillance and total poverty. Socialism is always unfair, big government is always burning money. The EU is out of control, all they do is throwing tax payers money at things they don't understand. It's another example of failed bureaucracy, slowly turning into filth and corruption.

Negative IR keeps failed businesses alive.
Instead of being economically successful and generating profits, failed companies go deeper into debt.
In the end, this is a problem because of multiple reasons.
1. As soon as IRs raise there will be a mass exodus of these failed companies -&gt; Unemployment shock
2. It's bad for innovation, because cheap money replaces the race for economical success
3. When lending money alone creates profits, even the workforce becomes superfluous -&gt; Bad for jobs

Use a mining pool for this. Pool miners get a fair share (minus pool fees, usually \~1%).

However, you cannot mine Bitcoin using your PC. It is done on special hardware. Google: Antminer.

No secret that I'm a IOTA hater. But I gladly explain once more why all these "high performance" """blockchains""" are in the end inferior to Bitcoin.
A cryptocurrency needs a fundamental trustworthy base layer - and it's very important for this base layer to be peer-2-peer. If you look at the 2000 current cryptocurrencies only a very few can actually keep that promise. Bitcoin does, Monero does, maybe some more - dunno, most of the rest, hardly (Ethereum) or not at all. What means P2P? Everyone can join the network and become a equal member of the community (although for mining you need an ASIC, that's a downside). Why is this important? Because everything else is just like what we already have: Centralized solutions that are controlled by few. Maybe people are more willing to trust new fancy companies (with lots of X's in their name to sound fancy) instead of oldfashioned banks, but in the end it's really just the same: A few people that you cannot ultimately trust. And you should not trust them either.
Why is now Bitcoin the best approach?
Because first the base layer needs to be established with this fundamental peer-2-peer property. If that's not achieved, everything is already broken.
Now, the second layer must solve scalability. It is a must and there is no other way. See, why should I as a European care when some dude in China buys a cup of coffee? I don't. I don't want the blockchain spammed with such information.
Even if other coins tell they want to have all this traffic on the blockchain, they will just fail, because it will never work: Because, even if you can manage transaction amounts in the range of cups of coffee on the blockchain, some fintech company will start to migrate their stock microtransaction trading bots onto the blockchain. And then we have algorithmic trading bots on the blockchain, spamming the network like crazy, unimaginable, multimillions of transactions per second.
You really think any blockchain could handle this? Maybe 1 TB of new data created per minute? Completely irrelevant, uninteresting information for 99,9999% of the community? For zero fees?
Who cares if your base layer is a Tangle, or a hashgraph or some other DAG scam. It just doesn't work, forget it. Those scammers claim to be able to handle this amount of data, but it's impossible. In the end, there has to be disk storage space and bandwith and this is the barrier.
In the end, it can only work if there is some kind of off-chain transactions and maybe pruning. It is the only way.
Lightning nodes should indeed be seen as "banks". Banks that back their funds with fundamental Bitcoin value and allow for "Lightning-Bitcoin-transactions". That is the payment system of the future and nothing else. There is ZERO chance for any other approaches to succeed.
Actually, I had to continue, why also coins like NANO will probably fail in the end. Because of economic reasons only PoW coins will survive. But to explain that, I needed another, like, 20 pages.
Buy Bitcoin, and maybe sell some old garbage on ebay to buy some GRIN and Monero, and you're fine.

You may be right, still you can't get em coins cheaper now. Some say this is the "everything" bubble: Stocks, real estate, ... and soon: crypto. So yeah, of course stock markets are rising, of course rent and housing prices are rising. It's because of inflation, a.k.a., massive money printing. Gold probably not before the very end, because they are so afraid that everyone will be ultimately panicking when the gold price explodes. So they do everything to keep it cheap.
Current BTC price seems fair to me. I'd not be surprised if we'd stay at this level for a few more months.

The stats at  [ sorted by "%down from ATH" are actually pretty crazy. As of today, out of 2000 coins...
1. only the top 25 are down less than 80% (funfact: Binance currently being at ATH)
2. only the top 50 are down less than 90%
This means all other coins are still down more than 90%! Actually insane. For most shitcoins the "alt season" that brought gains like +100-150% was just a recovery from down 98% to down 95%. For example, Cardano.
It's common for average people joining the crypto space and buying shitcoins. I was no different. Offcourse you want to outsmart all the other stupid people that advise to "buy Bitcoin only". But in the end, you are the dumb fuck, not the others. It's better to learn that lesson quick.

@_date: 2019-05-29 18:28:10
I thought about fees a lot.
Ultimately there has to be a equilibrium between the costs running and securing the network and the fees, so the incentives equation looks like this:
(1) incentive to secure the network (own balance) + (2) incentive to earn transaction fees - (3) block reward + (4) electricity costs + (5) hardware costs = (6) transaction fee \* (7) number of transactions
This has some implications. If miners are miners only and have no own interest to HODL but rather to sell (like it is today, unfortunately), (1) is actually zero if private HODLers stay away from mining. (1) can only rise, if ASICs become mainstream and regular people start to buy them. The more BTC someone owns, the higher his (1).
(3) will go to zero because of halvings. Is a negative term, so when it falls, fees rise.
To be honest, I'm not able to come up with a prediction how this equation will find equilibrium.
It is clear that wealthy countries will have a higher (1): When you're rich and want to secure your Bitcoin, it's probably better doable to buy a consumer grade ASCI that requires a little electricity, but countries with strong uprising economy have better (4): Electricity costs in China are very cheap, I heard around $0.02 kw/h.
However, I don't think fees will rise in terms of USD/tx. This means, I expect that fees in terms of sat/tx will actually fall. Why? Because real world value of Bitcoin will increase and it is ultimately real world value that determines the fees. So higher BTC value will result in lower sat-fees. Higher transaction demand and higher BTC price will cancel out and fees in USD will probably stay the same.
TL;DR: I don't think fees per block will stay at 1 to 2 BTC in transaction fees. It will rather go down to 0.1 to 0.5 BTC which will at that time however be equal to the current fees in USD.
Since ordinary people of the future want to open and close a Lightning channel from time to time, a transaction should never be more expensive than maybe $2 to-$4. I have a feeling that this is the limit that the Bitcoin network must offer, or it might be a problem. However, a big problem could be that wealthy countries could literally push poorer countries out of the mempool. I can currently not come up with a ethical solution to that problem.
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:42:07
Still people that buy Bitcoin don't receive some kind of contract for profit.
So it's pure speculation. That's not a ponzi scheme.
Why did the BTC price collapse? Because of psychology. Noobvestors buy the peak and sell the dip. Ever have, ever will. It's just stupidity in action, but not fraud.
Next BTC bubble is probably  so I will as sure as hell sell  It's damn easy.

When Bitcoin evolved a little more, people could not only use multig sig wallets for this, but also smart contracts. I'm not sure if it works like this, but I highly suspect you can do the following (soon?):
* Use MAST/Taproot to encode multiple smart contracts into one transaction
   * Smart contract 1: Transfer wallet balance to address X in 20 years (or based on blockchain height)
   * Smart contract 2: Transfer wallet balance immediately to address Y
X could be son/daughter and Y could be another personal wallet address to effectively cancel the first smart contract.
If wallet owner dies, funds are safu (transfered to children in "a few years"), if children die, funds can be reclaimed.

It's even better:
When you make a loss from some shitcoin and cash out (within 1 year), the loss is also a taxable event (Verlust aus *privaten Veräußerungsgeschäften*).

In principle, yes, "storing a wallet as seed words" is actually a Bitcoin standard (BIP: 39) and if two different wallets implement the standard, the wallet software is interchangeable.

I disagree. A peer-2-peer ledger has to have the ability to handle transactions off-chain. Because there is simply use cases for it. Lots of, actually.
I studied Bitcoin now for 3 months, and my conclusion is: It's an experiment. No one knows if peer-2-peer cash can ultimately work.
Even if Lightning is a success in the end, quantum computers will ruin it and it's unclear if it can be fixed.
People should keep that in mind before investing ridiculous amounts of money in Bitcoin.

The question is, what do you mean by "bruteforcing"?
You can randomly generate a wallet. Perfectly doable. But then what? Scan the blockchain for this wallet?
If you wanna "bruteforce the blockchain", you should first assemble a PC that can hold the whole Bitcoin blockchain in memory (\~600 GB), so you need a machine that exceeds the current consumer hardware dimension (that is maybe at most 32 GB currently?).
Then, for every random wallet, you need to scan the whole blockchain. I have no idea how long it takes for a PC that can hold the blockchain in memory. Maybe a few minutes? Even for a very, very powerful computer, this is probably very hard. However, if it takes "a few minutes" scanning a random wallet, it is a rediculously void approach to expect any success as there are incredibly many wallets.
I think for this reason most criminals are only scanning the most recent block, trying to bruteforce it immediately. This is also the reason why people that use a weak brain wallet will see their balance vanish immediately after coins were sent to the wallet.
Actually thermodynamics are against a bruteforce approach: It is more energy efficient to mine Bitcoin as to bruteforce wallets. Even if mining reward goes to zero ultimately, a typical valid block can still be worth up to 1 BTC in transaction fees.

Not true. QC cannot break symmetric crypto (double key length) nor QC-resistant crypto, e.g. "new hope" algo.

Most people generate paper wallets on scam websites so the moment they upload Bitcoin to a paper wallet it is lost either way.
Paper wallets are expert stuff, not for the average Bitcoinista.

Sometimes I believe that Satoshi will return one last time in a few years and give away his coins to the poor.
Or maybe he won't. It's just an idea that I like.

No, that's not what I meant.
You are right, when the broker cannot fulful your stop limit, this can also happen and makes things even worse.

Possible. Currently it looks like coin mixers will be forbidden because of AML laws.
So the likely outcome is transparency for Bitcoin, forever and all transactions. Doesn't need to be a problem. Although, not optimal.
Will just be hard for people that want to spend BTC on porn, sex and so on. Have to be careful, at least a little.

Nice little tricks, but BTC will never achieve privacy or fungibility on-chain.
Taproot and Graftroot are cute little inventions, but not a solution to any privacy issues in terms of "BTC as a currency". They might be able to "overload" a transaction and hide information that is ultimately unneccessary for the transaction settlement. But that will hardly introduce real privacy.
 But maybe I did not fully get what you plan to do with it.

If you're a computer scientist, you can try "coin picking". If you're not a computer scientist, then you should be very careful and probably invest in Bitcoin only.
To me, after careful investigation, it looks like out of 2000 available crypto coins, there are like 5 legit projects. You might be able to have short term gains with any coin, of course, because markets are also driven by emotion and irrationality. But if you want to HODL, you have to be very careful. The probability that you will lose your complete investment is super high.

Yes, but demand depends on the mechanisms I explained. When hashrate goes down because miners quit, Bitcoin and Bitcoin transactions become less secure. This can lead to decreasing transaction demand.

What makes you think it is Huobi?
When I google the address, most pages say it is a "mysterious trader", certainly not Huobi.
Why did you send Bitcoin to an unknown address? Why would you do that? Sorry, bro, I don't get it.
It looks more like an investor wallet, not like an exchange wallet. Maybe Bakkt, maybe a central bank, maybe a rich person from Saudi Arabia, ....?
Also, you still have another 1 BTC, so you're still rich, bro. Just 1 less Lambo.

Since Bitcoin Cash and SV raised the blocksize this has become a non-topic vor BTC.
Don't expect it to rise before 2025 or 2030, if at all.

No, I did not yet review the theoretical foundations of IOTA. Everytime I tried to, people gave me papers that I found to be not useful.
Can you explain it to me? When I have such a large data structure as the tangle that is hardly ~~ordered~~ \[edit:\] balanced, how can you navigate through it? How can a wallet know where updates happen or how to stay in sync?
Data structures are all about search time and insert, remove/invalidate actions.
When the tangle grows to an enormous size, it becomes practically unusable. I know IOTA claims the opposite, but there is no evidence it could ever work.
That's why databases and other datastructures are always based on balanced trees or something like that. You cannot simply leave it away because \*crypto magic\*. That's just a scam.
Sorry, I'm just thinking in terms of regular computer science. Which still applies to everything that is meant to run on a computer.
In my eyes, IOTA is nothing more than a broken distributed database that stores cryptographical tokens. Might work for a few years, but becomes unusable ultimately.
When I compare IOTA to Nano, Nano looks a lot better and it's scientific foundations are fine.

You know, this is reposted endlessly, in endless variations.
**Still it is wrong. Very wrong.**
If we had scaled the internet like we plan to scale bitcoin, everyone was still using a 56k modem, and we'd now request a website not from a server, but from someone in the near - in the hope that he's online and has a faster connection and a copy of the website.
Scaling Lightning is very difficult, way more difficult than anything we have ever tried to scale before.

I like it, good job!
Except, of course, for the notes about fungibility. Bitcoin has very weak fungibility. Bitcoin is like a perfectly traceable gold coin with full history of transactions. Is that fungible? Hardly.
