It is more constructive to focus on real ways to gradually bring about common use than it is to fantasize about pie in the sky pipe dreams. Bitcoin will not be used for in person transactions and replace cash. That is not the right use case anyway.

It is amazing that this discussion goes on. If this use case became common then every email sent to coin base/etc... would be scrutinized like nothing else on the planet. It would become neigh impossible to move anything into our out of btc from USD. Pray to whatever deity you look to that this does not come to be.

Did you even read what I wrote? I think our positions on this issue are probably identical.

This is not the norm.

You are negative now?

In the normal course of business it is true that one would have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Similarly, if the firm had bitten the bullet and taken the loss this would be true as well.
In the event where that firm is forcing a third party to take a loss they lose that expectation.
Gemini and the firm in question can either absorb any losses themselves or push the losses to bitcoin traders here. Just because they are smaller does NOT mean individual or smaller traders have fewer rights.

The precise error is
error: {u'message': u'Missing inputs', u'code': -25}
@_date: 2015-11-14 23:11:16
I would prefer that be true however if the exchange has language in their ToS which substantiates their ability to reverse trades as a result of error by a third party then they have at least a layer of protection however if they are attributing the reason to error by another trader than that trader is liable by definition. Someone is definitely liable either way and in suit I would name Gemini and the unknown trading firm (paired with a subpoena to Gemini for the identity of that firm) to ensure all bases were covered.

Yes I remember seeing notifications that one was available and it would *work better* but I figured if it ain't broke don't fix it
...so I guess they decided to make it broke

They have 60 minutes to do this on NYSE. Did they act within that timeframe here? This is absurd. Don't give them a bye on this.

Institutional investor here:
When placing orders with brokerages if something is being executed over the phone/verbally the broker is to execute as instructed (all lines are recorded and tapes are reviewed in disputes).
When placing orders electronically, orders are to be input as instructed to the exchange.
Any customer who messed up their intended order and claims to be institutional is not. Their operational risk controls failed. Operational risks include my execution team - we pay ivy league grads to do input work because it reduces the risk of error. Operational risks inherent to my operations are my responsibility.
Would love to know who did this- if actually an institutional operation their investors really need to know that they are making these mistakes.

I'm on 2.5.4 (was on 2.5.0 this morning)

Thank you now please let the rest of us get back to work.

No this is a horrible precedent. This implies a lack of following order and discretion by the exchange.

Judgement call. Will never happen.
