Why not. If you're just going to give up, why even get up in the morning. Privacy is or very shortly will be extinct. Then encryption won't secure you from the moth on your bedroom window that looks just like one but isn't. And I'm not so sure that a single digital currency isn't exactly what government wants. 
But why? I guess because I'm selfish, it interests me. The possibility of democratizing the control of money and wresting control from a global coterie of ignorants and sociopaths interests me.

The article says it's a fixed dollar value until redeemed for BTC. Why would that cause the company to lose anything with redemption on a dip? When you redeem on a dip you get fewer BTC.

Addressing enforcement, I think there would be a shift away from personal income taxation to sales taxes/VATs, transfer taxes, and use taxes.

Why use this instead of a cash-back credit card that I pay off every month? Not only would I not get cash back but wouldn't they charge fees on the BTC to local currency conversion, like 1% maybe? For me that would be a net 2% loss per purchase (paying 101% instead of 99%). 
Although, I suppose, unlike most all (probably all US-issued) debit cards, there could be ways to obtain a card fairly anonymously.

"You've got to ask yourself a question: 'do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?" 
Because, as a hodler, you will either lose nearly every cent you put into it or make a lot of money. I don't see an in between. 
In the mean time, you could save a few percent here and there transacting with merchants or services who offer a discount and easily transfer money without regard to geographic borders, if that's important to you. And you can potentially create a taxable event subject to IRS reporting every time you transact in it.

The first thing you should do is to stop deluding yourself that it is an investment as you put it. It is not. It is a speculation. Which is fine. If the nontrivial prospect of losing the funds is of no consequence to you.

I don't think what Satoshi does or doesn't do is relevant to the issue. If life were worth living, why would anyone ever jump from a bridge? People have their own odd reasons for doing things.
Holding funds that I can't afford to lose in dollars for a few years would not cause me lost sleep. I can't say the same for Bitcoin. Until I can, I think it's an ingenious curiosity with potential for great success and great failure.

A different anonymous vault company in Las Vegas went bankrupt recently. A year or two after being robbed. It's not pretty when that happens. Identifying what belongs to whom, I mean. Lots of people choose not to come forward.
I question whether any of this is truly anonymous. They undoubtedly have security cameras. Assuming they don't record over their recordings in short order, with a subpoena for the video and facial recognition capabilities, who is anonymous? Although, I guess you could wear a mask and maybe still do the iris scan. But once iris scans are required for driver licenses or government ID, you could subpoena their iris database and cross-check it for a match. I suppose they could encrypt their iris database, but undoubtedly the government could force surrender of the key. If there is vault anonymity somewhere, I don't think it's in a business advertising anonymity. Or advertising at all.

I don't like this truth but it is the truth. Unless the system is torn down and rebuilt, you will not beat money. Money has the power and the time and the motivation to crush all who oppose it. It wouldn't even take a billionaire to sell this relatively thin, illiquid market so low that &gt; 90% of hodlers pissed blood, sold to money, and swore never to get near crypto again. Until the sour taste fades and they buy back from money in 10 years at a &gt; 10000% markup. The few will rig it so that the few will win. And so it goes.

So governments are thieves. So what. They were here before us and will outlast us and will continue to be thieves. They would probably end up having to do more with less because compliance would be an issue. I think as between the possible taxes, transfer taxes would be the least likely/lowest rate/yield the least revenue. 
Again, to answer your question, I don't know. Bitcoin is not country specific, I would think there would be a rule to allocate the tax as between the sender or recipient without regard to geography. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 01:25:52
I don't know how you'd tell the difference, but I would think any transfer tax would be at a miniscule rate and perhaps, subject to penalty for misrepresentation, you could designate a transfer to yourself as exempt.

In my opinion, at present there is insufficient reason for enough people to use and hold bitcoin for it to increase substantially in value. I contend that both widespread using and holding are required for substantial increase in value. 
If people just hold, it has no utility and is a tulip. If people use but don't hold, converting to other currencies or items of value at the earliest opportunity, it would be like a single CD that millions of people could all copy. No one would ever need more than the one CD, for an instant, and the artist would go broke. 
I hold bitcoin but have only ever used it to purchase VPN service and litecoin. I would consider using it to save money on web sites like amazon by getting a discount on gift cards to use there. And I think it has great utility for moving funds across borders. But to my little world it doesn't yet have a lot of utility, which I would welcome as I find it fun to use.
edit: I just saw coinbase's [new program]( for merchants to pass discounts along to customers. That's the sort of thing that has utility to me and is the same reason I always use a cash back credit card.

In some ways. But I'm not sure I'd call living in the modern surveillance state freedom. I would say freedom is an arc, not a straight line, and I believe it began descending over the past few decades. Most people are now surveilled debt serfs in a sort of panopticon of neo-feudalism.

It is a crazy idea, because there's no point. Bitcoin will succeed or fail irrespective of what happens to these 30,000 coins and the DPR coins to come. With respect to price movement the auction is insignificant over all but the shortest time frame. Its importance is as a gauge for present institutional/big money demand, indication that even the government views Bitcoin as lawful property of value, and as a generator of media attention.

If you were bidding a premium, why would you admit bidding a premium? You would thereby encourage other bidders, who may not have been so inclined, to bid a premium, and yourself need to bid a bigger premium. I think you would say just this, that you are not bidding a premium.

The best way would probably be to spend them through a merchant who gives you a discount to use them, like some do through Coinbase, or to buy discounted gift cards. The easiest way would be to just convert to fiat and spend the fiat.
