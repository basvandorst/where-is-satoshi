You can compensate for that in software.

I think you missed the part of my comment where I stated that the Huracán Performante **is** the third fasted production road legal car around the Nürburgring, and how if you exclude a car that's not road legal in most countries, it's actually second fastest. 


Really? The MSRP of the Performante is US$274,390. The only two cars faster were the SR8 LM which isn't road legal in most places (but is cheaper), and the GT2 RS which has an MSRP of US$293,200.


Wow, well you're a judgmental asshole. What happened to the whole "it's fine if you like the looks" thing just three sentences earlier?

Probably why a lot of people don't want one.

They're not slow cars, if you look at the fastest production, street legal cars around the Nürburgring, the Huracán Performante is the third fastest, behind the 911 GT2 RS and the Radical SR8 LM (which shouldn't count TBH, since it's a purpose built track car, and is only street legal in some countries, germany not included). The Aventador Superveloce is in 6th after the Radical SR8 (which again, shouldn't even be on the list), and the 918 Spyder.
