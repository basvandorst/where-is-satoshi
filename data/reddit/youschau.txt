Read an article in a computer magazine around 2012/13. It was a 2 pager on the last pages. But it sounded super interesting, so I decided to read the Whitepaper. Sadly I was a poor student back than studying the wrong subject. So I focused on other open source projects in my area (mech engineering). In 2015 I came back and purchased my first bitcoin to buy some stuff online. Smart thing was, that I bought way more than I needed because of my previous knowledge.

On which basis? No one can force them to implement segwit

It's android, and the I only have small amounts on my mobile wallets I just try to test new wallets from time to time

And the best way of supporting an economy. If the poor get 10 % more they will spend it on basic necessities, because they need it to survive.
  If you give that money to the rich, far less is going into the local economy.
  Also an argument for raising minimum wages. But that's a different topic...

There is a podcast with the developer.

Instead of the mining pool collecting and bundling transactions, on their own node and giving the data to the miners. The miners run the better hash algo and let their own node do the transaction handling, while still participating in the pool for payouts.

Even better because it is instant. No tension of waiting if your tx makes it in the next block. And the instant gratification is just amazing

What are you talking about? The stock market does not pay dividends. Stocks do, and I don't know any that pays much more than 6%annually.
Stock market gains are around 12%/y longterm. So also far off your 5 quarterly..

Can someone explain to me why this mistake is so common among native English speakers? It makes no sense to me...
  I know it sounds similar. But the grammar is just fucked up. Don't you have a feeling what sounds/looks right in your native language?

1st: difference is that nothing of those 0.3 %gets eaten up by inflation (if you set the 21m coins as a basis).   
  2. Running a node really only costs pennies (runs on a Raspberry pi) but I shouldnt calculate the hours I put in..  
 
  3. It is still in its infancy. When tx count increases, roí will also increase.  
  4. If you want to control your own money. Running a full node is by far the best and safest way. There aren't many other options to participate in the lighting network. 
  5. Running a lightning node is definitly NOT an investment vehicle  
  6. Where do you get 5%quarterly? That seems way to high. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 14:54:50
I can't find the tweet right now, but I remember that it was 0.3% annualized. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:36:40
Well. It is one of the only ways to earn interest on your bitcoin, besides lending it out on centralized exchanges like bitfinex.
I also can't back up that data. Just checked my node and it seems like I am making ~0.02% annualized. But my node is probably not as well connected and doesn't have as much bitcoin locked up as Alex bosworth node. And I do not have a lot of outgoing capacity yet... 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:13:23
Maybe download an old version of multibit and try with that? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:30:11
:D I am having the same problem since July and there is no help or anything from coinbase. The support is amazingly bad and slow and I am getting crazy getting automated answers. So in the end I just gave up. But maybe there is still hope..

Just read bluewallets blog post. They manage the hub. You send money to them and they control the transactions from their node, so it can be always online...  
  This is how it works: the user sends his bitcoins to a dedicated top-up address, and this balance is added to his account on LndHub. Then, the user can use this balance to pay Lightning invoices. But under the hood, it’s actually LndHub who pays the invoice, deducting the user’s account balance. It works the same way when the user wants to receive a Lightning payment — it’s LndHub who creates Lightning invoice and actually receives coins on one of its channels.

Theoretically yes. But practically it is not worth running a node to earn fees. Letting your computer run 24/7 will be more expensive than what you are currently gonna earn.  
Fee pressure right now is also crazy. With standard settings you aren't gonna route anything (my experience) so you have to reduce the fees massively. And there are some nodes with 100+channels, that you won't compete against.
  Maybe with really smart route selection (definitly not autopilot) it is possible to earn a few cents with o ly a few channels...

Have you tried betting on microbet.fun? I am still looking for some takers for my bets
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:52:39
After setting it up, please consider spending a few sats an microbet.fun. I am still looking for some takers for the bets I have open. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:32:30
Connect to the yalls.org node. For a small fee they will open a return channel with you, so you can get incoming capacity and it is quite well connected. Don't use the service with clightning though. They don't allow 2 channels between the same nodes. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:16:59
Blue wallet does not allow receiving yet. (at least I can only send on Android) 
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:21:46
Source, that it is only temporary?  
  And btw, in my opinion, bitcoin is not to fight against payment providers. It is to facilitate choice. Everyone can choose how he accepts money. Some might prefer to use a service like open node and pay them for their service. Others are willing to run their own system (which is economical infeasible for a lot of people, especially securing your money...).

It is changeable if you use cli or some mobile wallet and there is an issue open in the zap Github and they want to change that with the next version. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:18:10
  If you regularly run to the same coffee shop, you'd have a direct channel with them. So currently you could spend around 500usd with such a channel.  
    If the size of your office is bigger. Just pay onchain. Currently it is cheap (20 Cents).  
  Maybe if the price increases again, well be able to pay for the whole office with lightning.  
 
  In the future multi path payments will come. So your big payment gets split up into a lot of small payments that take different routes. So it will be easier to send bigger payments.

In another comment you complaint about opennode being an intermediary, but so is  bluewallet.... Hypocrite... 
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:02:28
What's the easiest way to migrate? Just send all the Bitcoins to another wallet or can I import the wallet file into another wallet?

Thx for the tip. Will use it responsibly for gambling on microbet.fun.

What? Call me an altcoiner all you want.... (I like to try all kinds of new technologies and maybe I was blinded by all their great marketing) but I have never written anything positive about bcash.... 
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:42:45
Currently the channel size is capped at 0.16btc (AFAIK). But routing this will be impossible. Average channel size is something about 50 usd. So realistically routing up to 25 usd should not be a problem. Above that route finding will get difficult because only max capacities of channels are published and the node iterates from the cheapest theoretical route to the more expensive ones. But it does not know the channel state, so qiutw a lot will fail if the money is on the wrong side of the channel

Hey troll, I'll stop answering you. I hate when people deliberately misinterpret stuff, don't have sources for stuff they say and do not care about facts just to push their agenda...

After you set it up, please consider spending a few Satoshis on microbet.fun. I have a few bets open and looking for takers. Super easy to use.

Node counts are also increasing. So most likely new users. Check the stats at 1ml.com
