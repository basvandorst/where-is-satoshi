Both currencies have their advantages. However:
-gold is technically divisible to up to one atom, which is way smaller than 0.0000001 bitcoin
-it's true that FDR attempted to confiscate gold in 1933, but a lesser known fact is that most individuals did not surrender their gold. FDR was aware that taking people's gold would be tricky and his real goal was to outlaw gold as legal tender rather than confiscating. 
-BTC can be outlawed as well, and they are easier to trace than physical bullion by the way
-as mentioned above, BTC are only good if you have access to the internet, and you'd have to be an idiot to delete your wallet and memorize it instead

I don't think that bitcoin is useful for iranians. 
First the country has low free internet access and technical literacy. 
Also, the point of bitcoin would be to have access to a 'hard' currency, but you still need other hard currencies to buy them, which creats a chicken-and-egg problem. If you had access to hard currencies, why do you need bitcoin, and if you don't have access to hard currencies, how can you get bitcoin?

I am talking about the cost of storing the blockchain here.
To verify that the transaction is legitimate, you must have the balances on all addresses. That's kind of obvious since you cannot validate a cash flow from address X to address Y is legit if you do not know how many coins are stored in X.
To have the balances on all addresses, you must store the whole chain, which will eventually become a big cost. 
By emptying very old address, you effectively nullify older blocks and remove the need to store them. Hence, the blockchain becomes cheaper to store.
IMO, moving your coins every 10 years for the good of the community is hardly a hassle.

That's not the only problem. Old addresses with very low balances must be stored forever. They are a dead weight on the system through higher mining costs, so they are a hidden tax on the whole community.
In the real world, you pay to pay to store your cash safely. You pay people to store your gold safely. You should pay to store your bitcoins safely as well.
Chances are that very old addresses are lost forever. So there's no harm done in mining them.

@_date: 2012-12-17 16:11:43
Ultimately it would be better to have zero-balances on old addresses. 
If Bitcoin becomes successful the blockchain will eventually reach hundreds of terabytes. You need data centers to store this kind of data and only large miners will remain in business. THIS WILL MAKE BITCOINS MORE CENTRALIZED. 
Here's where I am getting at: if the old section of the blockchain has no coins attached to it, then the miners have no need to store it. By emptying old blocks, you will effectively truncate the blockchain and make it easier for smaller miners to remain in business. THIS WILL MAKE BITCOINS MORE DECENTRALIZED. 
The best way to implement this would be let the miners mine old addresses. You would set strict limit on how old the bitcoins must be before they can be mined, and how many bitcoins can be mined this way for each new block (to smooth the returns).
If coins have not moved for 20 or 30 years, chances are that they are lost forever. I mean, how hard is it to move coins once every few  decades? Let the miners get those coins backs. The total number of coins will remain constant (no inflation) and the miners won't have to live off transaction fees. LOWER TRANSACTION FEES WILL BITCOIN MORE ATTRACTIVE AS A CURRENCY SYTEM.

If a major retailer were to adopt it (think walmart) it would raise awareness but I don't see this happening anytime soon.
IMO the community should focus on improving the current payment infrastructure. 
In theory retailers should be interested by BTC because it would allow them to circumvent credit card networks (and the fees that come with them). However this advantage is useless because it currently takes many minutes to settle a transaction. Can you imagine waiting 5 minutes at the register each time you buy milk? 
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:41:41

The delay is is why the blockchain is not suited for micro-transactions. I believe that more and more transactions will take place off-chain and that the Bitcoin network will act as a settlement mechanism between payment processors.
It takes days to clear an international transaction when using the current settlement system (through the central banks or the bank of international settlements). As an international settlement system Bitcoin is way faster than what we currently have.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:10:38
I disagree with Keiser. The problem was not the lack of market-making, the problem was gox's trading engine (=their code is amateurish and cannot handle a lot of transactions).

You just need to store the addresses containing bitcoins. This has not been implemented yet but it will considerable reduce the amount of space that is needed.
Also the bitcoin database is very efficient at reading balances so i/o performances will not be a problem, but I can see the storage size becoming a problem for amateur miners on the long-term.

I am not a lawyer so that's just my opinion, but I would assume that how / where  you displayed your password is important. If it was in private and you had reasonable expectation of privacy you may have a case. If you flashed your key on a billboard in Times Square, less so.

Hypothetically speaking: what if the hacker publishes the key online, and I come accross it first and I use it (lucky me). Would I be liable ?
 If your husband /wife uses a weak email password and you guess it by luck then you're still not entitled to use it. Even if you didn't steal it (you just guessed, remember?).  If you do use it then you fraudulently accessed a computing network and this is illegal. And bitcoin is, at its core, a computing network.

There are ways to mitigate a 51% attack. 
One possibility is to tell the client to change the rule for selecting the best chain. For example, chose the chain that is certified by trusted parties instead of the longest one.
Basically the community could set up a circle of trusted people ( gavin, known miners or members of the community) and recognize blocks certified by this trusted circle. This process could be automated through cryptographic keys but it would result in less decentralization though.
@_date: 2013-04-06 11:39:14

@_date: 2013-04-26 16:49:53
**Harder to exchange** is the same as saying that they are **less liquid**.
All things kept equal, a more liquid asset will always command a higher value. Illiquid asset are **riskier** to hold because you cannot convert it to cash should the need arise. **Riskier** implies that the market price will put a lower price tag on it, it's a basic law of economics.
We need more and better exchanges. Maybe the MtGox guys were good enough when it came to trading magic **pokemon** cards, but they are not good enough to run a billion dollar market. It's not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of facts: both 2011 &amp; 2013 crashes originated in MtGox.
tl; dr; Liquid assets always trade at a premium. Illiquid assets trade at a discount. MtGox are kids.

This is a very theoretical case, as most thefts will involve fraudulent access to a computer system.   
I am not a lawyer but I always assumed that any valuable that is not illegal (i.e. drugs) are protected by law. I know for a fact that you cannot sue somebody for stealing your cocaine ( I read a case about this), although both you and the thief may end up in jail for possession.
 On the other hand I agree that we're in a gray legal area . Technically the key is not 'stolen' as you still have your own copy of it. The 'thief' just copied it and since it is not copyrighted it would not necessarily be illegal.

It's a great idea. If properly implemented, it would allow the vote to remain private but verifiable.
Let's say that each machine contains 1 BTC on a known public address. When you vote for A the machine sends 0.0001BTC to address A. When you vote for B the machine sends 0.0001BTC to address B. 
To compute the vote, you just have to check the balances on addresses A &amp; B coming from the known public address of the voting machine.
You can avoid ballot stuffing by checking that the amount of money remaining on the machine should be the equal to : 1BTC - number of voter * 0.0001. All this information is public in any fair election, so it would be easily verifiable.
Note:since the bitcoin network does not support, the best thing would be to have an alt-chain based on bitcoin technology for each election.
BTW, not even a 51% attack can modify the vote here.
