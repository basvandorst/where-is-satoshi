That's what I hate about the bitcoin market. Altcoins base themselves off of BTC instead of seeing it tanking as a way to gain value. If something bad happens in news to BTC that should not impact LTC, EETH or other currencies at all.

No, other languages do not translate directly to English in the way we use it.
There is no Korean word for upvote, but that's what you get.

Bruh, it was a 5% drop, we haven't seen it since yesterday.

Always be weary, but pulling out contributes to the drop.

Just keep your eyes on the futures data on the exchange.
Price of the coin in Canada shot up $500 upon data of an increase on that page. That's a part of the extreme volatility of bitcoin, up and down, up and down. It takes very little to make the price go for a ride by market standards.

Basically it means that stock market cronies are trying to tank the price of the coin without understanding what it really is and how it works. There was a launch a week ago that also cause a good dip in price but we kept going to reach new highs.
What this means is a validation for BTC in the market and the price is going to the moon.

I come from lower class. If I alluvasudn had money like that I'd be enjoying myself all the way to the moon and back.

They're trying to predict the course of the coin and when people predict it to drop in mass, it does. However, the volatility of the coin brings back up the price and breaks their prediction while emboldening the people who predict an increase in price which further moons the value.

People who have 100BTC or more have it in multiple wallets.

Since it is a futures launch, it is directly related to the last week with the smaller futures launch. Since this is a larger exchange, it is more difficult to say what's going to exactly happen, but I'm sure it'll be more of the same.

The launch of bitcoin futures at the world's largest futures exchange, CME.
