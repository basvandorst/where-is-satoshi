I want to do the same myself, but only thing I could find was this twit here  however it does not say when it opens.

I would calculate it this way: Consider that your laptop dies after 14 days of continuously working, find the amount in Bitcoin that is corresponding to that price (the price of your laptop), and tell your customer that amount in BTC for your GB. If your laptop dies in less than 14 days, bad luck for you.
First of all, try to find out how many GB makes your laptop in 24 h
If not, you're lucky = you can buy a new one and let the old laptop work until it dies (maybe in 1 month, maybe in 6 months, who knows).
I give you this advice because as an entrepreneur, you must invest in your tools in order to be able to produce anything.
Besides, you as a student need a working laptop (not the one working with vanitygen).
One last advice: if you make fancy addresses for yourself, one by one, don't ever create txt files using them. Better copy carefully on a paper the private keys directly from the console window, load the keys into an external wallet (on your phone, etc) then simply close the console so that to make much difficult for anyone else to steal your private keys.

I have read somewhere in reddit (not recall now where exactly) about a person asking how could he store 1million bitcoin addresses in his wallet. This makes me thinking about megacrooks trying to see in every instant if someone creates an account with a private key that is already stored in their wallet (so they steal right away any bitcoins deposited there). That of course would mean the end of bitcoin as we know it now. Even having 200 active addresses in such wallet (and stealing their unspent balance) would crash the price of BTC towards mostly several cents. That means for everyone here making the BTC protocol useless, because of being impossible to protect / control the amount stored in the addresses.
I say it again, don't look only what service you offer to the other person, but consider also what damage could bring this intensive work to your laptop. It's your laptop, not his one.
I was sure he does not work with a single computer in order to accomplish that task. If he's really involved in this absurd "kill them all" type of activity, tell him that this war leaves no survivors. Think of a Nagasaki event scale, compared to what did MtGox or Silk Road crash to the exchange rate of bitcoins. Better pray that none in the world to succeed ever in such a craziness.
Well, if he'd just try to solve the private keys of whales accounts (the 60000 ones with larger holdings), I see some point there if distributing their content worldwide in billions of future transactions. But even then, that would be as the global warming effect, and destroying the Antarctica ice shelf, to the worldwide climate....
P.S. That guy, Snowden, leaked that NSA tries to build a quantum computer able to crack any code worldwide, as hardened as it'd be. Funny thing, it seems that your laptop competes in helping them overtake the world and destroying its cryptocurrencies as well. :)

It's even worst. It's "give us your money, so we can enjoy our summer holidays, then we will see what's next. Maybe we pay some stupid of you, some poorer, to make our job, and we're the bosses".... Right ? Basically, it boils down to the character of the people, because not the talent is of essence. I sometimes prefer a fair person to a talented one.

Go figure that even the direction where they fly isn't correct either. Read my long post above so you make an opinion about all this story.
And it isn't true that anyone traveling to join Bitcoin conferences just to fill the conference rooms has anything solid to offer to the community. If that wouldn't be true, then we'd already see thousands of useful coins, let alone the numbers of wallets or other byproducts they'd create since 2009. While, actually, the genuine best Bitcoin developers can be counted on the fingers from a single hand ...

If two engineers want to start a company and produce ASICs cheaper, probably they might sell their idea to some already established company -- and receive shares in that company (becoming partners, not employees). An already existing company, which can reward them accordingly to the real profit that they can bring to the table. Look at how slow start these companies if they start anything entirely new (if you read for example the news on the blackarrowsoftware website you can understand how difficult was for them to launch and deliver a ready product to the customers - I consider myself lucky for knowing one of their programmers, but how many electrical engineers wanting to produce ASICs are so lucky to have access to a man programming mining devices ?....) 
Obviously, 2 people cannot start to produce an ASIC -- **2 people is a too small number to start a factory** :) . Even if a miracle happens and they both are already experienced in producing ASICs :), hardly they might have a chance. 
Previous experience is a must for receiving funds. Because the previous experience will make them able to create a business master plan enough convincing for the investors around to attract the funds. Two simple engineers asking funds to start manufacturing anything seems like two kids asking funds to build an airplane. It simply doesn't work this way.
What can answer those 2 engineers at the question "tell us where are you going to outsource the production for the parts that you definitely will not be able to produce by yourselves?" What ? No answer ? It means that you did not do your own homework, or maybe you want the investor to give the funds and also to work instead of you ? Not possible. If you don't know everything about the market in which you want to compete, you're already an outsider with no place to enter. This was in regard of the business model that you mentioned.
I told above about blackarrow because for them it started with creating diagrams. They already followed this path, making clear for everyone that planing isn't everything. What is on the diagram could result in a device that burns when it's eventually built, or not mine at all. Two smart engineers must have a breaktrough idea or working concept, because a "me, too" startup can be a difficult task. **My advice is to start in an area where you could create, not compete with others**, so that your success is almost guaranteed.
I truly don't understand the idea of chosing debt over equity and ownership. Why even would want the software engineers to have any investors looking daily over their shoulder and asking them what's next stage and deadline, instead of becoming rich by themselves by distributing their software to the customers and receiving millions from doing that ? It's like one is either too lazy or too unable to start anything by himself. Why should I wait a friend with his car to pick me up from my home to the airport, instead of driving my own car in any direction I want to? F... the friend's car ! I drive my own car, isn't that good enough ? (If you are a smart person, avoid the investors and write software by yourself). It is not so good to depend on anyone else, because every debt or investments come with strings attached ...


I share the same opinion as you.
Also, I tend to think that good engineers tend also to create startups :)


The average price is lowered only if 10-20 people refuse to pay extra money for a single product/service, not just you. When we speak about market, we speak about volumes. Always. A single person is never too important as he might think of himself. It is the others who will validate him and confirm his worth.
Nobody should bother to think what happens to the landlord too, if his apartment is bad or overpriced. Let him alone to take care by himself. But also don't forget that during that month when nobody stays in it, there is no wear and tear for the apartment, and no cost for maintaining it in a good shape. Having no income for a month is not any real loss. Lastly, he can keep asking that extra $100 from the next tenant, because this new one does not know who you are or the amount that you paid for the apartment, isn't it ? That works for the benefit of the landlord, actually.

1a. Well, the real problem is that selling something could be compared by others with selling tickets for a trip to Saturn. Why do I see that there is a problem? The real problem starts when people understand that maybe there is absolutely nothing to Saturn, or maybe that this entertaining thing of buying tickets for Saturn has nothing to do with the fact that there is a frozen atmosphere able to kill in an instant every living being who reaches there.
1b. If the presale had as a purpose to just de-freeze several accounts of BTC of whom the owners decided too early to keep them untouched until the 2050, well, that was a nice outcome. They were lured into believing that there is something more into Ethereum then into Bitcoin.
1c. The entire presale process seems as the old trick "the taste is in the pie" (so every Ethereum buyer will see later if his pie is tasteful or not - after the next blockchain is released and put to create blocks).
2. Nobody can say that it is a scam, while on the other hand it was never understood how producing blocks could realize private contracts among the people. Especially if the people are dummies and not smart developers able to put a nested transaction or two in several lines of codes. I can't remember anyone of your team having a legal background or at least having experience in international contracts execution or performance (which, by the way, are the most risky, because they move huge values and also because are performed among people absolutely not known before and coming from entirely different cultural backgrounds).
All that was seen to happen in the road map development paper was almost how to create V.2 then V.3 over V.1, and so on, instead of giving people the confidence that indeed the contracts are wonderful avenue to pursue (I cannot continue to elaborate here, as I am involved in a real project of such nature).
Problem is that in such delicate matters (and I don't speak here about hiring developers - because being a developer is already some kind of repetitive task, a "me, too" endeavour -, so hiring developers to replicate another blockchain is easy, and the money could be useful for such purpose), but in the delicate issues, as I said, you either have or not have what is needed to perform. Either you have the mind, or don't have it (as a brain couldn't be bought).
Anyway, it is deceiving that you started to gather funds in order to "host and run" the processes for which you need "fuel", instead of creating an idea, right here and right now, which to be a revolutionary solution which is indeed needed.
It's like telling people that you want to build for them a rocket, and then later asking them to subsidize the purchase of axes in order to cut, somewhere late in this winter, a huge forest that you suddenly seen next to the city where was initially meant to be build the launchpad of the rocket. And, sadly, far in the future, after becoming very tired of carrying bulks of wood chips to their homes, people would start asking you "are you just a woodcutter, right ? and not a rocket scientist, right ? so do you have any idea how is even to create a rocket engine, or not ?" That might sound ridiculous at first sight, however it's just an opinion.
4. Ethereum has started as a child of Bitcoin technology (as all the altcoins in existence, too), despite of any opposite conceptions still existing out there. And because of that, what happens in its realm send waves in the Bitcoin world as well. It is of none importance that somewhere in the world are maintainers for "protecting the fire from the rain in the jungle", using their servers, and hosting the blockchain, if the very technology can't be made useful in an essential way to the people.
Sadly, the people not only contributed to the funding of Ethereum, but now you even ask them, as developers, to also work in order to develop it.
Where was ever heard that a worker not only to spend his wage in the factory, but also to stay full time there and also work for the factory ?? If your team gathered the funds, now this team might do the entire work, because this is for what you were paid.
Now you understand why people are rightfully comparing this project with a huge scam ?
Truth to be said, even Satoshi Nakamoto was not in need of 5000 BTC as expenses in order to realize the blockchain. He simply DID IT WITHOUT ANY MONEY, and it simply works. A person, a genius, not a cooperative farm where people are asked to invent something brilliant, in order for your team to say "well, we told you that it was going to become magic" !
So why this thread to get downvoted ?
Any evidences already would be too late, people started to buy because of an emotional decision, not a rational one, because the masses could not understand if Ethereum is going to become either a huge success or a poor failure, nobody can foresee that, mostly because 99% of buyers were noobs (idiots with money, as we see always around us :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:12:23
The fact that you use the money of other people to buy anything looks like a money transmitter activity, indeed.
However, my suggestion would be to start from the root, which is the basic question: can you afford the situation of having zero customers ? After all, anybody can simply search by internet and find kraken, or coinbase, or any other exchange and go there to buy without paying you any extra fees.
More, if you buy these bitcoins, are you going to disclose to your customers the private key of your bitcoin address, or just transfer the coins to the customers' wallet ? Because, either way, they might have some kind of wallet, in order to use the coins after the purchase. First situation seems like scamming them, if you still have control over their coins. It's like saying "give me your money to buy you an icecream, but let me hold your icecream in my hand, too" -- which shouldn't be too nice, btw:)
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:22:43
I wonder if you can help me with a script for a website using bitcoins, too. Or are you involved only in interface level aspects ? Thank you. I have something interesting on my mind :)
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:33:25
a real gamble would be to invest something (like an "angel") in a bitcoin-related startup or similar. Or do as I do, find a good team of computer geeks in order to build something nice - and accept bitcoins, too :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:58:19
It's up to you what amount do you charge, 14 days was just an example. 
Make it 30 days, or 60, or something else. I just thought that less than $10 per day wouldn't be worth to have your laptop working for somebody 24/7. But why does he not use his own computer or laptop, why don't you ask him such question ?
Anyway, be fair and tell him that your laptop cannot produce more than xyz GB per week, and if you keep pushing it, soon it becomes endangered species :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:58:47
There is a small misunderstanding in what you say.
First of all, someone creates a start-up in order to become rich **himself**, and not *the others*. For this reason, nobody owes him a cent, if they don't receive anything in return.
Second point is that it is not acceptable to say to someone "you must pay me if YOU want me to create this start-up", instead of saying "please, if you want to support me becoming rich and you later maybe benefiting from the services that I *might* offer to you from the startup that **I want to create** -- not *you want me* to create". Creating a startup isn't like receiving a promotion for your old job, it is instead a jump into the ocean from a very high altitude. You own the risks, the burden and the rewards, too.
Because it is each person's problem the fact that he gives up an insurance package or a nice full time job -- after all, it is the actual boss/employer, whatever/ of the developer the one that makes profit out of his efforts (so that he owes him to have him in that position), and not the investor from whom the dev is pretending to give him that 500k .
C'mon, did that investor who's supporting the project growing for the sake of developers' startup ever benefited even a cent from his past glorious efforts, or not actually ?
If it's so easy to just use Java to create something, why aren't you profitable from the day one? Why you need to pay other employees and thus spill the funds of your investor? A simple but brilliant idea definitely will pay you back in spades, so that you won't even need any support from behind (see Harvest case, for example). The best investors of any company are their own customers -- if they really benefit anything from you, of course. Are they gonna pay you just to move from company A to company B (created by you) ? He he he, I doubt that.
I am sticking to a simple opinion: there where you delivered, there you can have any claims at all. To people donating to your cause you cannot impose them cap numbers. It is their decision how much want they to support your endeavour. Think of it as a loan, where the indebted person cannot raise his voice against the lender of money or pretend anything. It is you trying to sell him an idea and begging for his hard earned money, nor does he need anything from you.
Even easier, if one developer is so profesionally endowed, he could start small, self fund his own startup and in exchange keep 100% shares for himself alone. Don't you think this is even a better option, for the long run ?
I have seen so many "startups" asking money for doing "something", as if they would need these money to buy a bulk stock of tangible products from the market and fill a warehouse with them, and not that the startup was about their own creative work in front of their computers.
Think of people saying like "I see a forest in the jungle far away, so if you buy me a horse *and a Ferrari for my home* I could carry you until there, maybe there aren't lions there to eat us, or maybe we find a huge pile of gold in the forest, who knows, but anyway, start by giving me the money for the Ferrari NOW..." :) Can anyone see my point ? Are the investors that stupid ?
Many angel investors are already tired of twitter-alike projects (or name yourself another one who might take a huge 7-10 years until turning to have their first dollar revenue from the public). If it's profitable NOW, they're in, if not, forget it about the 500k or just keep dreaming :)
P.S. This probably asked you why some people maybe ask amounts as just 50k, because they owe to the others to use the own brains, and not the received money. This is what are they paid for, in the first place. It's a sweet extra 4k per month for a developer actually, right ? Btw, I did not see that website yet (havelock), but I can imagine what you are talking about. As per investing in huge and expensive mining equipments, those are not startups but personal dreams of going big. For such business concepts I doubt there is a single *smart* investor here that to even need you to buy for *him* with *his money* the mining ASICs and to ask you to put **your name** on top of **his** business actually. Where there are big money, you can be at most an underpaid employee (maybe the tech or maintenance staff guy, if any, but not his partner). I worked closely with people trying to invest in real companies, believe me, I know how they think ( "The one who has the gold always makes the rules" ... )
Edit: I changed my post because it was too sharp earlier, however keeping the "you", "us", "them" kind of wording inside it, but only for avoiding confusions in text (saying *you and him* is easily to understood and follow than using the third person for both parties described, respectively *him and another*). Thank you.
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:50:21
You're right, I was a bit too harsh, while I was certainly not about you, maybe because of the discontent for the bias that I see existing these days in this business area (the startups) - so I will edit that phrase, to be as intended.
In games theory you are right, both parties can leave the table without any prejudice whatsoever. In business, the right price makes a transaction possible, and the hardest point is to define that right price.


Nope. He absolutely does have that power. He accepts that you leave (because he owns the house) and one day later he invites another tenant increasing the price by $100. (Or do you think that he'll wait untill all houses in that town will increase their prices with $100 so he is the last one doing this raise?)
Truth to be said, there is the risk factor for both of you, which means that he might not find a tenant in the next day -- and you also could not find a cheap house in the other part of the town as suggested (well, not only the price matters, so you could end up with a bad house even if the price is the same as before). So until a transaction is concluded both parties can still lose/risk something.
However in business the parties don't look at it as a "game", they take it very seriously because business handles real life and property, so people don't gamble when negotiating. It is either from 100k to make 200k or 500k (or worst, to still have that $100k from the start), it's not that anybody is OK with ending with $25k from his $100k. And you achieve that by investing $5k instead of $100k, then see where this road takes you. Ever heard of gradual investments ? They are everywhere :) If the startup does not grow, well, it's not like "you're fired", but the capital flow stops. It is not any game, it is the rule "invest, measure, improve, invest again, and so on". Metrics matter, not the bargaining power of anyone. The facts and results alone, nothing else.


LOL ... Well, if to obtain a 500k would be that easy -- just by asking for it -- everyone out there would drive a Lamborghini or a Bugatti Veyron ... :D  Then what need is for universities to still teach economics and sales techniques and business tactics and so on ? We all could pick up the phone and ask a raise, because, isn't it, we not only deserve it, but the other person can afford to *lose it* ... Or worst, the other guy could answer to us "dear friend, from next month your paycheck is in half and no more benefits, because of course you can afford to lose that, and after all, it's just a game not the real life", like in a cartoon movie :)
Point is that creating that new company means taking a road, while nobody knows what exist at its end, maybe the nothing (as in Neverending story), or the rainbow with that huge pot of gold. So where is the promise of "taking a cut" ?
Even more, things aren't so simple as above, because in business there is an entirely different logic. Any real business is about exchanging of units of value with equal content (for example 100 dollars against 100 bricks, or similar). The bargain appears where one party wants to receive either a dollar more (or a brick, as is the case). A bargain isn't about receiving just 50 bricks -- when you pay 100 dollars -- nor 200 either... Such would be a scam, not a bargain deal.
Last, but not least, any serious business starts with
* intent
* proof of capabilty
* commitment
* execution (delivery)
from both parties.
How then the investor to be asked to make all 4 steps above (to express an intent, to prove he is able to perform beyond any doubt, to commit himself by signing a contract of funding a startup, then finally to execute the money transfer), as time as the smart developer is not even able to make even 2 steps out of 4 ???? That is ridiculous. 500k for just thin air ? What bargaining power does such a person have, if at all ? Well, this is not a game, and real people know these things -- these are which made them have so much money in the first place.
Rule of thumb is that in order to develop a product, you first must have it. To have a prototype, or something. Later in the future, you can improve it, and develop it even further. But without a product, proved as useful, there is no game at all. 
In the whole picture it's just the product / service offered / what matters, not the developer. The developer is the initial packaging where resides the product :)


A huge business is the natural evolutionary stage of a small but successful business, they are not opposite. This is the reason for investing small, seeing the potential, then seizing the opportunity and growing with the money of the customers not of the investor. The purpose of each business must be to grow, to become huge. But not with money from a single person. With money from millions of people happily buying what is offered to them. That is a real startup becoming a 500k business. And of course, a big business is more stable than a small one. I would prefer 5% share in the bigger business. Well, that $1.5m/yr could easily grow at $20 then $100m/yr, with the right managing team on top of it.

**The bitcoin address that you mentioned has an interesting aspect**. I am not sure if it is related to the main topic however I consider that is worth knowing that, too.
(I apologize for not being too fluent in explaining some core technical stuff -- because that is the main expertise of a really special group of people -- however I hope whoever reads below knows about what I'm talking.)
* It was depleted by the same entity (let's call it **ENnzep** that controls the address 
also met in the automated sweeping of Satoshi's first brainwallet :/ )
* For people not knowing yet about this thing, I make reference to the first Bitcoin genesis block (first ever mined block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, called block 0) where inside it Satoshi left us the message:
*The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks* - see more tech details at this web page  , at *5.3. Message from Satoshi, Bitcoin’s creator*.
* That message, used as a passphrase for creating a brainwallet, takes us to the bitcoin address (already compromised, though)
(Until today, many people played with that message above, out of curiosity, and created the public and secret key of that bitcoin address.)
* Among other interesting facts, researching further, becomes obvious that *ENnzep* not only swept that Satoshi code derived brainwallet (emptying that Satoshi addresss in less than a second, by an automated bot -- everyone sending there a test microtransaction can confirm that, too), but also did benefit by **first and last transfer of coins** shown (at least now !) by Blochchain for **3M1S3tZVkEJw7zVBtn1Mq8McVyfnNMAuoX**.
* While it is perfectly understandable that someone takes the coins sent into a compromised address (which isn't anymore a private thing, being already a common place among the bitcoin researchers), maybe this entity **ENnzep** could also help the community of bitcoiners (and Andreas, here ) to understand for example the type of wallet used for **3M1S3tZ** and if there are even more malformed transactions visible for him while using that address.
* I suspect either a strange maleable transaction which occured when that address was used to move a batch of unspent outputs (because the address might have "stored" different sets of coins -- old mined coins and new mined coins, together -- of which existence any further research can confirm us if that's true, which under present conditions we could estimate as being &gt;98% correct), and when "moving" these different coins somehow a parcel of them, at a node, was affected (applied to them a different timestamp?) and its confirmation was segregated of that of the other existing parcel, being invalidated by being registered into a block later invalidated and rejected by the main chain. Its visible effects are that any coins sent to that account are lost like in a black hole, and what we see as variable negative balance for **3M1S3tZ** is only what is reported as a difference between what is seen as output from any (account) transmitter toward **3M1S3tZ** and what catches the **ENnzep** address (and seen as input of such following transaction) if automating a sweep of such address by any method.
(The "parcels" occur when you send consecutively toward a single address two or more different payments  )
* Practicaly a certain split of coins (such an output) is effectively lost for every input construed by mixed age' coins so because of impossibility of being confirmed (who knows, does *ENnzep* directed these transactions to his personal solo mining machine or belongs to a pool employing tricky tactics? just a simple remark) or we simply see a proof of a parcel of coins sent sometimes in the past with zero fee, which remained in a forever pending state because of being forwarded by miners which automatically did not accepted to make the work for free, and despite of that, their senders still included them in a tx and broadcasted the respective transaction, which remained as an un-executed contract ??
* Another 1% as probability I would see it as a power outage (or failure) in the RAM of the miner / or computer wallet / in the instant when the whole batch was hashed for creating the transaction hash for the full amount. The next validated block recorded the standing unhased transaction as being broadcasted -- with the sole difference that a final address **was never actually allocated** as partial output (into "change") for these lost coins, but their input was later propagated to the following blocks in same state as not having yet a recipient (which is unheard of). It is like these coins are "stored" in a parallel chain, which never confirm them - because its not connected by main chain (fact that would be impossible after all, because only one single block-chain "survives" and is included in the main chain), but even worst, if large amount of coins are sent toward that address and their outputs are not visible by the blockchain, they practically disappear from the bitcoin global balance -- so everyone can see happening that when the full mineable BTC amount closes to its total / end *they are going to be again mined (duplicated) in order to be found again in existence when final checking is made by algorithm that stops the blocks creation*. 
* But ........ Who knows, if **Mr. Satoshi drops an entire 100,000 BTC into this account**, will these 10,000,000,000,000 satoshi be seen again in the blockchain, or they will practically disappear from the "living" existence?? We speak here about dropping the Himalaya mountains into the  ... If that assumption proves true (and **Satoshi accept such a frozen water challenge**) we might see the mining difficulty decreasing drastically, until the moment when the lost coins of Mr Satoshi (thrown into that dreadful and unholy abyss) are resurrected again by myriads of happy miners around the world...
* I don't have the resources to execute some full test nor the skills required in order to monitor the outcome of a large scale modelling, conceptual analysis, and coding a patch to the existing issue, however I believe my theoretical approach can be employed as a useful tool of those able to at least stop dissemination of the problem in order to not become a **Butterfly effect** in the future, for this glitch might prove either the worst nightmare of bitcoin realm, or the nicest dream of the bitcoin users at the same time...
And, people, stop discussing around the bug, solve it or understand it !
