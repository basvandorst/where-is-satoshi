Why are people buying crypto on credit to begin with?
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:26:18
Look at trust wallet, amazing mobile wallet. I find it secure enough to store my coins.
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:52:37
Bitcoin network is decentralized enough and secure enough that 1 confirmation is more than plenty.
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:13:14
Trust wallet
@_date: 2019-07-20 12:57:46
Go for trust wallet. One of the most secure mobile wallet available, multi-coin wallet and you can purchase crypto from the wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:43:28
Bitcoin has never gone down. Wtf are you talking about?! The debit machines didn't stop working because there was no electricity, it stopped working because their service center for interact is down.
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:31:33
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:19:47
Even more truth being spoken here lol
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:32:20
No policy change. Interact terminals are down Canada wide, regardless of where you shop.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:27:47
But how much money you expect to make off 40$?!
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:24:45
I use honey badger BTM in Canada and I have made a deposit at night before and only received it in the morning, 8 hours later. From my understanding certain companies only release funds once or twice a day to your wallet. Thus the reason I always take my receipt with me in case it never gets sent. That has yet to happen though, I have always received my money within a 12 hour time frame I would say.
There is also instatcoin BTMs in Montreal that will send you the BTC instantly to your wallet but their exchange rate is a bit higher than the honey badger company.
If you kept your receipt their should be a service number or an email to contact. I would contact them with my transaction number and see what they have in their database. It could be a simple mistake of not putting a high enough transaction fee on your BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:36:46
It makes me feel free, independent, and most of all, not cheated. 
Owning Bitcoin for me is more than making money. Owning Bitcoin is owning a piece of the future. My future, my kids future and most of all my grandkids future. I will be ensuring them a spot in the citadel with my fellow Bitcoin peers!!
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:23:01
Been here for two years, and honestly my emotions are all over the place. Sometimes I feel like it's hope, others it feels like complete disbelief. All I know is that I haven't sold, I don't plan on selling, so I guess I don't know why I care so much about the price. 
Anyways this market is definitely not for weak hands. Will we ever see another moon rise again?, I dunno, but I can tell you one thing... I'll definitely be there to see it happen cause I'm not going no where. Crypto for life!!
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:09:11
I hope it goes back to 3 k
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:05:35
I was just there an hour or so ago.
@_date: 2019-07-24 20:22:54
I wonder if their will be red carpets everywhere I walk?!
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:04:26
Lol this is a good one. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:32:41
I am exactly the same. Even though my portfolio is down 70% even with buys on the dips, I am happy to be in the crypto community. I don't even stress, I know this will be ten folds within a few years. HODL or spend it, I never trade or sale back to garbage fiat.
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:34:46
He's just mad because his coin is turning into a worthless pile of shit.
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:58:11
Ur an idiot
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:06:16
Lollll 
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:57:58
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:29:19
You couldn't of said it any better.
@_date: 2018-08-05 12:14:12
LOL just buy her some at the current price and send it to her that's all.
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:30:06
Lol I love it
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:03:53
Bro honestly if you don't try you will never find out. If I were you, I would exhaust every option before giving up on my money.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:51:07
Don't stress. One time it took 5 hours for me to receive it. My transfer didn't even show up on the blockchain till a few hours after I deposited it. The ATMs use extremely low miner fees to sent the BTC and sometimes it takes hours for it to get confirmed.
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:02:39
Ya at a rip off rate of what 11%, I went to use one of your ATMs yesterday and I instead drove to a coinstogo ATM because your rates are crazy. It was asking for 10124 CAD to buy when coinstogo only charged me 9880 CAD per BTC
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:04:52
It already is a threat to the American dollar.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:21:48
Sounds like a cool idea, I would definitely be interested once it's fully developed.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:41:53
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:45:58
Lol your probably right
@_date: 2019-11-01 15:23:50
2020 is gonna be HUGE!!!
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:41:55
Brd very good wallet.

Couldn't of said it any better.
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:03:19
Not a scam at all guys, I got a good feeling about this one. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:42:36
Real evidence too not just words
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:41:51
I want sources in alphabetical order too, like you did back in school. This is no joke.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:13:36
Your an idiot
@_date: 2019-11-05 12:37:06
Search Luke magnota time traveller on Google it will pop up with his edited version of the original post. The original post is still written below his update. 
The post makes it clear he is no time traveller and it was all written just for fun. I was honestly mad that he edited it and doesn't leave any room for the possibility that it may have been a real time traveller. 
Anyways I still believe in the citadel that's for sure!!!
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:10:22
Stock markets about to take a huge hit, watch BTC go threw the roof, just be patient.
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:45:21
You sound very misinformed.
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:02:51
Oh wow!!! It's only like the 2000th time Elon gives away BTC. Must be a rich guy. Wowwww
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:42:19
Show them to us
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:45:45
That's insane how you guessed it on the dot.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:05:19
I have.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:08:45
Lol I'm being sarcastic
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:07:51
Lol purchase Bitcoin elsewhere?
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:29:59
Lol love it
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:29:34
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:16:17
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:25:00
Your obviously misinformed. State your sources in alphabetical order please and only the real sources not misinformed ones.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:45:42
Or could make you 4000%? I don't know I feel like making some money, you?
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:33:43
Wow, did you come up with this idea on your own? Or did someone tell you this. 
Brilliant, never heard of this idea called scarcity.
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:42:05
Ya I do. You think people are just gonna take out their money and put it where? Under their beds? Or into an asset that has historically done great during stock market problems.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:14:56
Fuck I missed that face lol
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:10:08
No u
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:06:03
Definitely citadel what are you talking about?!? My wife thinks I'm crazy but I can't wait.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:14:03
Makes no sense what your saying
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:11:36
What's the importance of banks getting into crypto?! 
Mass adoption?!
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:06:48
I'm going to go live in a citadel in Switzerland I think. Live somewhere nice in the mountains.
@_date: 2018-06-19 11:43:28
Lol my portfolio is down 57% and I'm still not stressing. Keep buying to simply lower your cost average.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:07:04
Kraken might be the only place you could purchase USD in Canada. If you convert it to CAD, shakepay is probably your safest bet with e transfer.
No Canadian bank sells BTC sorry.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:40:19
Shakepay is the way to go
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:51:45
Thank you, your BTC has been accepted at your Citadel of a choosing 10 years from today. Please do not forget your private key given to you.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:28:40
This I like!!
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:31:44
Plus the Swiss already have underground bunkers incase of nuclear fallout.
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:13:40
I wish this happens fuck will I ever buy up a bunch.
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:37:09
I think you can buy stocks with BTC
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:54:02
Said for the hundredth time this year.
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:41:39
Ya your just a few weeks late on this news. Thanks for your efforts though.
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:49:39
Don't bother wasting your time trying to understand this idiot. People have been saying BTC is dying since it's inception and will continue to happen. I have learned to just block these idiots out.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:27:22
Agreed on safe guard your funds. Top priority.
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:35:08
I never claimed to know what I'm talking about I'm simply asking for feedback. So your telling me CIBC online banking is run through a cloud service and not servers owned by CIBC.
I don't know shit about cloud service but Im almost certain that CIBC runs their own servers, or any major banking institutions for that matter of fact.
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:23:14
Good information for newer people entering the crypto space!!
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:53:45
This is what the world has always been boiling down too. Like someone else said, corruption, climate change, government debt, inflation, and dwindling of natural resources is going to leave a very desperate world for our kids and future grandkids. That is why you should prepare yourself and get ready for what is coming. That time traveller might of sounded scary his interpretation of the future, but honestly it's probably not too far from the truth.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:14:22
Lol that's exactly the mentality the want you to take right before the steal your cheap BTC and pump the market right back up leaving you in the dust waiting for the next dip. Becareful my friend you are playing a very dangerous game.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:18:01
Lol but you gotta be stupid to fall for this
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:26:14
Exactly how I feel about this situation!
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:05:23
98% of the time it's a good time to buy Bitcoin. Buy everyday and that was you can't lose.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:32:07
I did the same thing buddy just in smaller monetary amounts, back in the green too!!! After experiencing the bull and bear market I don't think I will ever sale my position in BTC. Altcoins I'll eventually unload when I feel the time is right.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:56:13
Trust wallet !!
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:37:30
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:34:15
I definitely think it's a move in the right direction though. Banks are getting on board it's only gonna be a few years until mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:53:09
Yes supports xrp
@_date: 2019-10-20 11:56:03
No thanks

@_date: 2019-06-22 13:44:28
Much easier to crash something with 100 billion dollars then something that may have 2-3 trillion dollars. Eventually Bitcoin market cap will grow so large that crashing it will be much harder.
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:22:47
I plan on doing just that. Can't trust the Canadian pension plan to retire that's for sure.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:45:32
And what if there is no dip, from 20k we go straight to 50k then Dip back down to 30k? You miss out on everything because you tried to beat the market.
HODL and you always beat the market!
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:58:34
Trust wallet !! Check it out much nicer interface and security top notch. Can also be used for dexchanges.

HODL with you I will my friend!! Battle we must!!!
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:43:40
Aww you mad cause we know your full of shit? It's ok you will quickly learn that noone gives a shit about how you feel here on Reddit. Have a good day and good luck with your three weeks of crypto experience. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:35:01
Lol ok there big boiiiiiii send some cash around then show us your not full of shit
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:22:37
I'm with you brother. HODLERS unite!!! 
I'm setting up bear traps all over in order to catch these bears. We shall win this war!!
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:21:14
The war between the bears and hodlers has begun. We will stand strong and fight off the bears as much as we can until our bull brothers come back with a vengeance of fury!! 
Stand strong we shall because I will never sale. Who else stands with me?! 
HODLERS stand together!!
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:23:32
Love it
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:38:18
Agreed. Purchase only when you can and average it out. But if your hodling long-term, no stress.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:33:15
LOL wow. If you wanna gamble just day trade, at least you will lose money at your own hands and not some computer generated program that just takes money away from you.
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:22:21
Lol thank you so much for your valuable insight!! It's funny though cause I also heard this when we hit 8000, 6500, 5000, 4500 and now you. Can't wait to see it hit 4000 and hear that the bottom has finally been found.
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:57:17
Thanks for reposting this for the 10th time. Very educational and informative.
@_date: 2018-11-08 12:36:51
Thanks for being on Reddit for 3 weeks. Very helpful.
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:52:29
I'd rather be fucked by bitcoin then a bunch of rich fucking bankers. Fuck banks!! Go Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:53:11
I keep telling everyone, cryptos the future, the days of paying 5$ ATM fees to withdraw 20$ of your own money are quickly coming to an end!!
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:34:53
If you understand it will never happen, why bother even writing about it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:09:31
 I tried using Hassbot for a week or so, and honestly I found that it was more complicated then anything else to set up. Once I actually got the bots set up and trading, it just seemed like it was either making me no money, or nearly almost no money. Sometimes my bots would even trade at a loss, because I had put on the wrong insurance or securities on the bot.
Overall what in trying to say is that you must be an advanced trader, with in-depth knowledge of trading patterns, reading candle charts, and understanding what securities and insurances are in order to make any kind of profit while trading and using bots. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:48:49
Or invest to make money? Not just sit around and watch other people make money?
Just an idea buddy
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:50:46
HODL I'm with you brother. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 02:19:40
The IRS? I'm Canadian, and I don't day trade I'm a hodler or spender. I simply stated that at least with day trading it's a bit smarter than gambling it all away on some Bitcoin scam casino.

LOL sometimes I can't believe the stupidity people do on here. It's fucking money and people just sending it to any random place with no idea what they are doing.
Honestly, you deserve to lose that cash. Good lesson learned for you.
Don't be an idiot and do your research before investing money.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:35:47

Ouch buddy I think you may have got scammed.
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:15:53
I see a world where 1 Satoshi is worth more than a US dollar.
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:50:02
Lol I was thinking the same thing.

Time traveller from year 2030?
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:14:18
Wow thank god they are finally going to change their stance on cryptocurrency. But honestly the entire tax code needs to be re written from top to bottom to simplify everything.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:34:59
Couldn't agree with you more. I give this bubble 15 years before we see its full effect in motion.
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:12:26
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:42:11
Exactly. You hold no stress you gonna make the gains. If you trade, you can't make any gains on your BTC!!
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:29:38
Cost averaging is the only real way to invest in a highly volatile market. Timing an entry point is almost impossible, cost averaging especially during a bear market is the best way to get prepared for a bullrun. During a bullrun on the other hand though cost averaging can work a little to your disadvantage simply because the price is continuously rising. My best advice for you buddy, purchase only when you see the market in red on a weekly basis. When it is green, I know that FOMO kicks in, but trust me, it's the worst time to buy and the market will usually have a minor correction within a few days
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:52:53
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:09:31
Another idiot with his stupid bottom.
