Check the batteries in your sarcasm detector.

I want to see this chart

Yes, he seems completely unmoved by the events of bitfloor and expresses no emotion in regards to what is essentially a really big deal.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:10:47
Does it not make sense to:
A. Verify peoples ACH details, even if you dont return the money via ACH
B. Respond to user emails or at least send a mass message to your users?
Also, What does "waiting to hear back from the bank"? Mean? Why are you waiting? Go down to the bank in person and speak to the branch manager. If this was your money we were talking about, wouldn't you be a bit more motivated to make something happen?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:24:51
Maybe that was a separate account than the one that P2P deposites were sent to.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:22:43
While your point is valid, and there are always exceptions to a rule, here we are referring to a certified letter or registered mail. These priority documents are delivered quite fast.

Thank you for sharing your experiences thus far. The more of us that come out the better it will be to paint an accurate picture of the situation.
I understand how stressful it can be to have lots of money tied up, so I am hoping we can get some resolve here.
Where are you seeing tweets about developer meetups?
The last tweet from bitfloor was on the 26th: [
Do you, or anyone know what happened when bitfloor was hacked? I was not aware of this until after the close, and if I had known then I would not have put any money into their system.
Information is our greatest asset at the moment, so if we can at least inform others of the issue then maybe developers at these meetups may think twice about engaging with him.

Nice. You got very lucky.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:24:37
I am not sure about that, since using the CapitalOne P2P payment to bitfloor we were instructed to send money to an outside bank account. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:30:10
Very well put. Thank you for chiming in. Communication is  a key ingredient to the success of anything and it is vital that he becomes aware of this.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:38:12
It would have been nice if the ACH docs were being approved during all this down time.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:37:55
There are a few important things that should be happening during this waiting period.
1. Communicating with users. Even if this is a mass email. 
2. Validating people's identity for ACH when that option becomes available.
It is very telling that no emails are being responded to and no email was sent at the time of the close. Only an update was made on the website.
He has everyone's email address, why not send an update?
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:57:12
This is very relevant information. I had no idea bitfloor was ever hacked, if I did, I would not have given them any of my money.
Its important to share this information, including the current situation, so that other people can avoid similar interactions with him in the future.
@_date: 2013-05-06 03:50:30
The currency we are discussing is USD.
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:30:27
No, we all got our money returned with interest. You didn't get a check sent to you?
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:05:55
Is it [@_date: 2013-05-06 17:57:13
What was the obvious point that bitfloor was about to die?
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:59:12
He is more than alive. He is carrying on with life as if nothing has happened:
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:15:13
To *an* email, while pretending to be his own spokesperson. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:28:31
I don't think he needs to set up a new account specifically for ACH. He could simply mail people a check for the balance owed.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:30:12
This might be true, but if everyone remains apathetic then there might not be much will on our side to pursue this.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:32:57
There is always more than one way to skin a cat. You seem very confident in your approach. It might not be the path I would take, but at least it isn't one of apathy that many others are expressing.

In all reality, there are no two points in the USA that take 10 days to send mail to. This includes New York to Hawaii. With the exception of media mail, all mail is delivered within 5 days.

Just as a point of reference, this is an easy way to keep track of things regarding [bitfloor on reddit](

Thanks for the twitter link.
I think there was a previous incident of bitfloor being hacked. I only recently learned of it.
A quick google shows that it happened in September of 2012. 25,000 bitcoin went missing.
Edit: Looking at his personal twitter feed there isn't even the slightest concern or remorse for the situation he has put many people in.
