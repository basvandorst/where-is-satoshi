A magic bitcoin generator.

meh... not worth my time...
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:51:41
Share the wealth my man
@_date: 2011-06-09 22:21:34
Then they could just say "From Jacker224"

Even though I'm in I really only started getting into it last night.  I know about mklinks (symbolic links), but not enough about the wallet.dat and bitcoin application to know the answer to that.  I would imagine only the wallet.dat, as that's where the coins are actually stored.

I'll take them off your hands if you'll let me give you $20.

Sleep in a different room?

I think he was saying, "Bitcoins are only as secure as the owner of the coins is," rather than "Bitcoins are as secure as the author of that article"
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:07:34
I fit perfectly in that "universally trusted third party" position.  Send 'em on over.
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:14:51
I started mining on my computer earlier.  Sorry 'bout that, move along.
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:31:18
Yes, I was in the OPs place yesterday afternoon.  Now I'm sitting on top of the world with 0.05 BTC.  :)
@_date: 2011-07-05 04:18:39
Book is not a mass noun.
@_date: 2011-06-20 19:02:51
*oh god...*
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:31:20
I've been using slush's, at api.bitcoin.cz.  It's going pretty slowly, at maybe 0.05 BTC a day or so.  But I think that's normal for a GTX275 that's outputting 57 Mh/s.  However, last night, it was down, so I switched to Solo for the night.  You never know when you might wake up with 50 btc sitting there in your account.
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:39:52
Oh, but I bought low!  And now it's rising pretty nicely!  methinks I made a good decision :)
@_date: 2011-06-20 19:12:59
In that case, I'll take them off your hands for .50 each.
@_date: 2011-06-18 15:06:18
That's what rich means to me, too.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:12:17
Run it so you're secure!!!  Yeah... like that's going to work with bitcoin people...
@_date: 2011-06-09 05:34:18
Tacky sleep or pretty lights.
@_date: 2011-06-21 17:19:43
I've definitely exchanged some currency there, bro.  Imaginary numbers aren't imaginary when you transfer them into your bank and withdraw the cash.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:05:51
I was doing the same thing he was doing, just didn't think to do it at .0101.  Fucking genius.  Next time, I'll be hitting it up at .0102.  Suck it, toasty.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:02:04
Damn straight.  I was mashing my keyboard trying to buy 1,000 at $.01, but I was too fucking late.  Good thing it didn't go through or else I'd be "involved with the hackers" too...
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:07:51
I want to see another flash crash.  I missed my opportunity this morning to get in big!
@_date: 2011-07-24 01:50:27
Okay, bitcoin community doesn't understand the concept of a joke, lesson learned.
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:36:04
Nope, that's not how it works in pools.  You will find tons of hashes before a block is complete, at a pretty significant rate.  Like powercow said, about every two minutes is average for a modern GPU.  When you are mining solo, it will tell you that you've solved a block, just like it tells you when you find accepted hashes.
@_date: 2011-06-20 19:11:41
... tell me this isn't going to be a new thing.  I've never seen a comment in my life that made me want to donate BTC to the commenter...
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:01:08
Yeah, there's no stopping me now.  All that needs to happen is for 0.08 BTC to be worth a million dollars, and then guess what happens?  Yep, I'm rich.
@_date: 2011-06-21 17:46:16
Let me make this extremely simple.  Leave your pre-conceived ideas about currencies and politics and stocks behind, and let's go through this easily:
I put **ONE** dollar in the bank.  Then I transferred that dollar to a third party, say Dwolla.
Now I have **ONE** dollar in Dwolla.
Then I traded that **ONE** dollar for **TWELVE (12)** bitcoins.
Now I have **TWELVE (12)** bitcoins.
Then, I traded **TWELVE (12)** bitcoins for **ONE HUNDRED SIXY FOUR (164)** dollars.
Then, I transferred **164** dollars back into my primary bank.
Then, I withdrew **164** dollars in cash.
Now how much cash do I have, and how much of that is imaginary?
How am I supposed to know which money is "imagined" and which money is for real?  I don't want to spend any of my hard-imagined money where I should be spending my hard-earned money.

@_date: 2011-07-05 20:12:30
So buy now, but sell pretty quickly?
@_date: 2011-06-18 15:09:58
Um... not sure if you were aware of this, but the price per bitcoin used to be a few cents.  Lately it's been as high as $32 per bitcoin.  Buy low, sell high at those prices and fucking forget about it.  You are rich, just like many others have done before you.
@_date: 2011-06-20 19:21:09
Tell me this is a well-hidden joke... I know too many people that would have done that exact thing...
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:40:45
So I forgot to mention I WAITED for a while as the price per bitcoin went up.  Sorry about that, I'm sure it was confusing.  By the way, the numbers were made up.  The amount that I've profited from bitcoins is much higher than that, I assure you.  I'm not an ignorant kid that doesn't know what he's doing.
@_date: 2011-06-14 21:16:10
just for the record, in cmd, it's mklink /J "source" "destination"
