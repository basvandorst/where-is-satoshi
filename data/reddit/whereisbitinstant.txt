Hi! I am wondering if you would be able to take a look at my order. My money has been hanging in limbo for a few days, and I'm hoping you could help me. Thanks!

Hi could you guys take a look at my order? I have 500 hanging somewhere in the bitinstant aether and I haven't heard from you in nearly a week. My order I'd is in my previous post under this account. I would post it here but I'm on mobile.

I can't speak for blackprapor, but here is my order ID which has $500 outstanding.

They kept your money? Do you have a record of this?

I love their off-the-wall concept icons. What's with the 3 eyed glasses? Are they using their chakra  for security? And the russian dolls for experience? What does that even mean? Then there's the 3 piece pencil, which I imagine is for the 3 eyed security staffer.

Thanks for the heads up about the bitcointalk thing. I'll need to sign up, and then post my issue there.
