They will always pay, you just might have to wait a few minutes while they print more.

And then it would be welcome to the market. But I do agree with you in principal. I'm not all hung ho on BTC myself, I'm coin agnostic. Nobody stays on top forever. Everyone on top gets replaced at some point. 
For the sake of everyone who invests heavily in BTC, I wish them the best in the future but the greater fool theory has taken over and someone will get stuck holding the bag at the top. I just know it won't be me.

Good for you guys, but I'm doing the drywall at the new McDonald's.

Now that was funny

It's excellent. Watched it on Netflix a few months ago.

I'd have to agree, GDAX is probably the easiest I've seen. I use it myself.

Now you see my issue with them. I just don't personally care for them. I don't have to like who they are or how they run their business but I can choose not to give them my money. 
So although I am a GPU miner, the thought of giving up the motherboards, the frikin risers, and the spaghetti mess of cables inherent to a GPU rig is attractive.

Now that's some funny shit
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:21:42
No, I mine ZEC. Was saying I never got into ASIC's (and stuck to GPU mining) because I don't want to support Bitmain. That may all change if there is going to be competition in this space.

I may get down voted for this but I'll actually answer your question. 
Is it possible for that to happen? Short answer is yes. 
Anyone who disagrees was asleep two weeks ago when this exact type of scenario unfolded. All that really happens is BTC difficulty goes up due to the scheduled upward adjustment. The hash power then leaves for BCH. At that point it takes a while for a BTC block to be mined due to the new difficulty and the new found lack of hash power. Again, this is the exact scenario that unfolded a couple weeks ago. 
Now the real question is, "will" it happen. Nobody knows. Anyone who tells you they know is completely full of shit. Nobody knows what's gonna happen two hours, two days, or two months from now. 
I'm coin agnostic so I'm not for or against this scenario. I just know it is possible.

Look at whattomine.com and click on the ASIC's tab. Are they profitable? Today yes. But tomorrow? Who knows.

I'm all for competition. I'm a GPU miner but always wanted to try some ASIC's. I just couldn't bring myself to support Bitmain. Maybe this will change my buying strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:09:09
On whattomine, BTC is listed under the ASIC section. For GPU mining, NH is fine for the casual miner. The best resource I can point you to is a channel on YouTube called: Bits Be Trippin'. Search them out and look through their videos and I'm 99% confident you can find out anything and everything you've ever wanted to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:18:39
Of course. That ETH is worth $1.84 right now!! 
TBH, I've thought many times about ASIC's, but never wanted to support Bitmain. With a new player coming in, that might change things but with everything always being pre orders for months from now, alot can change in that amount of time. Look at all the poor peeps who still have D3's coming at $1,400/EA. They are selling new in unopened boxes on eBay for $800 which is still way over priced. I might pick one up when they hit $400. Anything above that and your just throwing money away.

I know there are other ones but I can't for the life of me remember the names of them.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:29:50
Just an example:
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:03:23
Love your outlook :) Everything will be fine.. unless it's not.. in which case were screwed.. haha
I'm with ya. I've been trading BTC all frikin day on little $100 movements trying to get some of my losses back. Now that we're closing in on the BCH difficulty reset, I'm 100% back in BTC and along for the ride tonight. 
I'm going to make popcorn shortly!!
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:43:13
For their USD yes, not Their BTC.

This is the only thing most politicians understand: more tax.

While it could go either way all they really need to do to calm the storm is show proof. This has come up many times over the last 6 months and the result has always been the same: They have yet to be willing to do that. So the question is why..
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:51:03
Before someone comes in and starts down voting you, just wanted to let you know CL announced this and incorporated it many many months ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:18:10
I've seen multiple people posting this the past couple of days and I thought your a couple months late to the show.

How can it be flat when it's hollow and full of aliens?
