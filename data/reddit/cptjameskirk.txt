Right. I don't even think they are *that* hot.

Happy cake day.
I don't know what the rules are on CB but couldn't performers just put a QR code in their bio and accept tips that way?

This is a great talk. It covers a lot.
I especially like the big picture ideas he mentions like global lotteries, elections, and even traffic transactions.

A lot of good questions in this and Andreas does a great job answering them. It really ends up being a fluid conversation between Patrick and Andreas about Bitcoin/technology.

He was just on the Coinsider This! podcast and said he was only going to be in LA for a few days.
There's also 2 other talks that are getting put up on that feed. One from the Inside Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas and a meetup that was just held in LA.

Plan B is also (here in America, at least) the name of a birth control product that's sold OTC.

They did it back in [late August with the Coinsider This! Podcast]( 
I'm glad they are still spreading awareness of Bitcoin talk. 
I enjoy Coinsider This! It's run by and he sometimes mentions a thing from the subreddit. He also recorded some great Q&amp;A's from the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas.

I wanted to know what Geldeintreiber said so I Google translated it.




Geldeintreiber as one full word means Debt collector
and as Geldein treiber it means Cash receipts driver.
Danke Geldeintreiber, aber ich weiß nicht, die Antwort. (Thank you but I don't know the answer)

I know about the meaning, it just seems weird to see it used a lot. 
Kind of like if more company's used the Nike "Do it." or McDonalds "I'm Loving It" taglines.
