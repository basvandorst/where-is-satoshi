Hold on, wouldn't an S&amp;P 500 index fund have given you a 21% return for the last year?  Wouldn't you have to screw up REALLY bad to only get a 6% return for the last 12 months?

I can see it being referenced soon in more tech-oriented shows/games.  Like hearing it referenced on Silicon Valley wouldn't surprise me.  It's already been a plot point of a Big Bang Theory episode.
Mr. Robot has a fictional *centralized* cryptocurrency (E-Coin).  Sort of their version of Ripple I suppose.
I think it'll be a few years before you see it referenced much in network TV crime procedurals and that sort of thing.

Expressions like “I could care less” are idioms.  Idioms are expressions with an agreed upon meeting that can’t be determined from the words (and logic) alone.  Think of them kind of like slang.
There’s nothing wrong with idioms, since everyone knows what they mean.  In a way “I could care less” is more correct in the sense that “that’s the idiom.” (sort of like “that’s the joke”)

FYI, world population is estimated at 7.6 billion atm.  Was curious, so I Googled it.  So yeah, the term “early adopter” still applies for sure.

Totally agree - that terminology seems to really confuse people (understandably).

It’s mostly just because Bitcoin has done so many 10x jumps in value compared to USD in the past and people love round numbers. The hope is that demand will continue to rise and that it’s still got at least one more 10x in it.
The pro-BTC narrative in 2019 is that institutional investors and real BTC-backed futures could drive demand up. When the price spikes, that news could hit the average person, who may feel they need to jump in to not miss out (Fear Of Missing Out).
And it is a fact that we will get halvenings every four years, which reduces the incoming new supply some. It could be that the psychological impact will be even greater than the real supply or demand numbers would indicate. We can be an irrational species.
On the flip side, many of us realize that what we hope will happen may not pan out and the whole thing could collapse into nothing at any time.
100k sounds kind of outrageous, but so did 10k not long ago at all.

Well obviously “money” of any kind is an abstraction.  The show can be pretty funny, but the comedians on there are just regular comedians that don’t know everything and sometimes do go for cheap laughs.

Does he have kind of a good point about market manipulation?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:48:39
I’m not following.  The suggestion to not invest more than you can afford is to make sure if your bitcoin value goes to zero it doesn’t affect your life in a significant way.  Worrying about what you’d do with mad gainz doesn’t have much to do with that concept.
HODL mostly just means “don’t try to day trade.”

It’s mainly for 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, material editing, animation, and 3D rendering, yeah.  It also happens to have a bunch of other stuff, like video editing, 3D printing tools, a real-time game engine, a physics engine, and a bunch of stuff.  But calling it a video editing tool is like calling a car a cup holder.  Not really its main feature. :)

I’ve read that $200 trillion represents the current cash, stocks, bonds, and gold globally.  If you divide that by 21 million coins, that’s $9.5 million per coin.
Realistically I’d think bitcoin will work side-by-side with local currencies, altcoins of all flavors, and even gold.  5% of that number may be possible eventually (so, 400k or so).
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:05:07
It’d be nice to see WAY more alt support soon.

My prediction (this is silly, I admit):
It'll bounce between 71,100 and 17,499 for 24 hours, then finally break through to 17,500 tomorrow.  Then it'll bounce between 17,100 and 17,999 for like three days, before eventually breaking into 18.  18.1k by Monday, rinse and repeat in roughly 2% increases per day, with hard walls at each 1k interval.  I'm thinking 20k will be a pretty big wall for a bit near the end of the month, but it's not hard to imagine 24k by the 31st.
Or not.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:47:17
Looks like it’s still “bouncing” off of the 18k wall like a rev limiter.  17.8 atm.  Soon though, soon..,

It does feel like a lot of folks are settling for table scraps now compared to the potential of this thing in a few years.

Downvoted.  Not a thoughtful post in any way.

Wow, was expecting a bit more resistance at 18k.
EDIT: And there it is.

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

It comes from stock market terminology.  A bear attacks downward with his claws, so it’s a cute way of referring to things trending downward.
A bull attacks upward with his horns, so “bull” refers to things trending upward.

It’s not an acronym. It’s just from a forum post where somebody typo’d the word HOLD.

I disagree, but that’s cool. Yeah, I’m familiar with the “backcronym” concept and personally think it’s lame af, no matter how many ppl will tell me that. As Anakin would say, “From my point of view, they are dense!”

That is based on asking 2000 members of a particular website.  I’m going to guess that isn’t statistically valid.

With ads, one hour broadcast shows have about 40-43 minutes of content and the bitcoin segment was one of three topics covered.

I think there are two potential problems with that analysis:
1. Scarcity without demand is meaningless. How do you predict how may people will care and how many will buy into bitcoin?
2. While I see a lot of appeal in bitcoin in terms of its name recognition and history of being solid, we don't know if bitcoin is the MySpace to some future Facebook. Or it could quite possibly live along side many other successful scarce digital assets, making bitcoin less unique over time.
The thing is, it doesn't even matter which crypto is or isn't the best, it's all about perception. People are fickle and emotional and change their minds all of the time. They're hard to predict.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:41:06
Yes and yes.
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:44:10
Fair enough. I mean, it's clear that the 20-somethings with $500 to their name aren't going to push this thing to the moon, haha.
Though ultra-high-net-worth individuals are still humans who can sour on the entire concept just as quickly as anyone else. It still boils down to groups of individuals making these calls. That seems even harder to predict.
I wonder if a more interesting metric is trying to break down how much of the demand is coming from true believers who understand bitcoin as a store of value and that type of speculative noise we saw in late 2017. The speculative side of it seems pretty fragile.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:37:35
Literally the last line of the linked page is:  
"The model predicts a bitcoin market value of $1trn after next halving in May 2020, which translates in a bitcoin price of $55,000."
To me that implies that 6-18 months after May 2020 the price will be $55k. What am I missing?  
My prediction is more of a hope that enough normies will see the same value in bitcoin that we do, and that will drive mass adoption, which in turn will make it significantly more valuable. What that translates into timelines or USD exchange rate is beyond me.
My faith in the mainstream may be misplaced though. I guess that's all my point really is.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:17:39
1. Right, but bitcoin may well not be as unique as gold down the road. Scarce things often don’t find demand. Watch Antique Roadshow some time.
2. I agree, but yeah, new things of course can arrive on the scene.
I mean, I agree with the general idea that bitcoin could very well be the most successful crypto. It just seems really problematic to put specific values and timelines on something with so many wildly fluctuating variables.
