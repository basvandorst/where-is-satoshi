I am not getting any money for this. I'm an investor, though, which I disclosed in the headline.

I'd love to but it's my publisher that controls that one. However, notice the ["Donate bitcoins" link on the right rail of my book's website?](
That's because some fine folks who downloaded my book wanted to, erm, pay me for it, if you catch my drift. So I've added it there and get a steady little flow of btc, which is nice.

Just a little?

Thank you for writing this, Ryan.

It's my gaming handle throughout highschool + college. [Short for my fave Metallica song at the time, King Nothing. Here's an interview I did on KCRW about it](

Heh. I signed this. TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!

I got to play with it last week -- it's super polished.
Launch is coming soon. I'll be curious to see what the community thinks.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:13:38
Oh hai.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:18:00
Nonsense. The world needs to hear that bitcoin proponents are taking this seriously -- especially after Mt Gox. [I'm in line with all the industry leaders.](

We're basically just doing it because it's hilari-awful. And it gets everyone's attention. [But my crew and I have 200 of these gigs on the tour so we need these little things to keep us sane ;)](
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:18:38
Yep. They haven't launched yet, but you should ping 'em [ with any questions.

Still technically an alum!

Is it bad that I'm coming up with all kinds of random + crazy data sets online to try and correlate with the price of bitcoin?

Because the intent of the rule is to prohibit people from posting a link with a referral code they'd gain from in some material way.
edit: ultimately, it's up to the mods. so it goes.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:20:48
True story.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:48:10
Haha, fair enough. It's been a hell of a tour. 200 events was probably too many.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:23:43
What do ya mean?
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:29:52
I was really, really hoping you had just discovered a motherlode of Bitcoin. Sorry it didn't turn out. It's not as valuable, but here's some gold.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:44:21
This is a big win in the war for mainstream adoption for bitcoin. And I do like CK, too -- great shoe selection.
@_date: 2013-08-21 23:37:21
That really is a magical soundbyte.

I won't sign bought kittens, but I'd sign an adopted one. Help them find forever homes, people!

It's true. I'm an investor in a couple bitcoin startups ([coinbase]( &amp; [buttercoin]( so I'm obviously optimistic about the currency. This subreddit has to be one of the best forums for bitcoin discussion online, which is nice to see from a platform I cofounded.
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:37:49
Also, guys, I'm not Irish ;) I'm Armenian.
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:37:40
True. I'm also an investor in Coinbase (both are YC companies and that's all rather public, but I wish I'd made that even more explicit).
@_date: 2013-10-10 03:57:47
Awesome! [Thanks - I've been quite pleased with the response so far.]( Lemme know what you think.
@_date: 2013-10-10 03:59:17
Yes indeedy!
@_date: 2013-10-09 21:37:07
Woo! Sure thing!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:48:38
Genius. Grouper should absolutely have those included in the mix.

Why would you choose a stat exam over a life-changing talk?
[OK, but here's a video from that talk!](
