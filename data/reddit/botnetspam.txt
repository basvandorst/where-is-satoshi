But is it a commodity or medium of exchange?

I've seen this exact same kind of hyperbolic article swirling around the internet for the last decade or so. What we are witnessing here is a person educating themselves about monetary policy and the US financial system and slowly learning the differences between currency users and currency issuers. This is not an easy lesson to pick up, and its even more difficult when their resources are primarily Libertarian leaning websites and endangered gold standard neanderthals that still hold some valuable stone age knowledge about 'new tools'. 
They are essentially live blogging their learning process, because they think they 'got it all figured out'. Its interesting, but only informative in the context of understanding the current landscape of self-education in economics. And its worth noting that there is a massive amount of misleading narratives and absurd stories about monetary policy that flood the mainstream during election years (ie, national debt is the same as household debt), so its good to see people working on trying to understand it better.
As you said, the author is either mostly ignorant about the topics they are discussing, or are playing ignorant for the purposes of spreading disinformation.

Well, it can, and of course it does. Its just a common 'logical conclusion' discussion that is had around all fiat currencies, and its useful when considering how we use them and the systems that spiral out from them.

I may be being generous, and you may also be being a bit uncharitable. It really all depends on the sincerity of the author. 
And I, like you, know better than to go playing teacher after my first lesson ... but not everyone is aware of this bias (including many very smart people). The Dunning–Kruger effect is a real thing, and I'm more willing to attribute this kind of nonsense to ignorance than to malice. I'm also more inclined to try and find ways to help those interested in understanding economics than to scare them away by making them all too aware of the massive gaps in their knowledge.

But if the goal is decentralization of currency, then isn't it more like "be divided and ... " ?

Ehhh, thats certainly one take on it. 
I hear this being stated very 'matter of factly' by alot young designers (who are most certainly parroting their predecessors); acting like there is some ultimate order to these two emergent forces. But in reality they are constantly in flux, dancing like mad in the mind of the creator -- informing and reshaping each other. I obviously appreciate Louis Sullivan's take on it, but it is not sacred, and it is not wholly accurate. It is *one* principled approach on the issue, and was said primarily to help architects pull away from 'making pretty things' that are ultimately inefficient.
Design is a delicate balance between art and engineering, and form &amp; function should complement and feed off each other. Its much less about "this *then* that" than it is about "this *and* that."
There is no hardcoded wiring model for form &amp; function, as it is much more akin to say, melody &amp; lyrics in music, or story &amp; staging in theatre. The goal is to maximize the potential of both ... together.

Well, I just bought 6 solars, 2 internets, and a technology for good measure. So, I got that going for me.
