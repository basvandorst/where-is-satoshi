Could anyone link to genuinely useful resources on technical analysis/learning trading?  
There does seem to be plenty of information which is less than useful!

Thanks, have bookmarked and will look at in depth.  A large amount of information there.

How does the current government of Venezuela compare to that of Hugo Chavez?  
From your tone I'm guessing you would also be against Chavez as he was a socialist.  However, how come Chavez's government didn't result in the current hyperinflation and disaster which is currently happening in your country, what is different about the current government which has caused the crisis?

OK thanks.    
I do have another question which I can't see has been asked yet.  
What is your view on the petro cryptocurrency?  I've read the Wikipedia article which is fairly brief.  
Does it stand any chance of helping Venezuela out of the current situation or is it just a sideshow and possibly/probably a fraud?  
Why would anyone trust a cryptocurrency from a government which is in such a dire financial crisis?

I would be concerned to the extent I'd find a different exchange.  Just my £0.02.

Money laundering concerns are the reasons for your accounts being closed?  Possibly not using localbitcoins and using another exchange might be the best option?
I've  been using Bank of Scotland (Halifax) for transfers to Coinbase for over a year now without any issues.

I'm not too concerned whether it's a partnership or not (you could argue that any business relationship is technically a partnership).
However, it is good news for UK people as it will significantly reduce the costs and complexity of depositing and to a lesser extent withdrawing from Coinbase.  Faster payments are free from what I understand = good news.

Recently I've been finding SEPA payments a lot quicker although I will be pleased to do without the expense and the initial hassle/complexity of IBAN, BIC etc which SEPA payments entail.

I love how John McAfee revised his target as he said the bull market arrived late.  
From memory he now claims $15k by end of August.
