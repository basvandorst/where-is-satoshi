It's great, but it needs to be updated for the changed block reward.

Lol. I always end up following obscure projects like Bitcoin; another example is the OpenPandora handheld.
First fully-paid preorders were something like two and a half years before the shipment of the first unit. All along, we were no further away than **Two Months^TM** from our promised devices. Lots of refund requests, lots of selling of queue spots just like BFL.
Also just as with BFL, there were lots of folks holding them accountable for lots of legitimate reasons (lack of organisation, zero business sense) and lots of illegitimate ones, too (*it's a scam! vapourware! get out if you can, whilst you can!*), but eventually they delivered products about 89% as impressive as they were expected to be. It's so funny to watch the exact same thing happen all over again with different parameters.

Hah. Yes, actually. I followed that too. A damn shame.

OP is talking about Gyft, an app which allows exchanging Bitcoins for gift cards. What OP is saying is that it went into a restaurant without purchasing the gift card first. OP then ate an entire meal before casually picking up its phone and using Gyft to purchase a gift card code which it then used for its purchase on the spot.

That really sucks. They didn't even give you the option of waiting for the unit?
OpenPandora GMBH/Ltd. are not scammers... they were victims of scams themselves (or at least extremely bad business). At every turn they were being screwed over. If it makes you feel better, none of them have made any money from this venture. They all view it as a mistake now... but I love mine.
In a couple years, if they're still making them, you should explain your situation and ask if you could get the difference from your original amount credited to a purchase. They really are wonderful machines. It really is like they opened Pandora's Box though. That project was definitely cursed.
