To clarify, it's not miners that verify. Verification is made by nodes. 
Essentially, people wishing to make a transaction broadcasts said transaction to the network. Miners then pick some transactions (at will) and put them into a block. The mining part is then guessing random values (nonce) that when hashed together with the chosen block (which also includes the hash of the previous block, thus chaining the blocks) generates a hash string with enough zeroes in the beginning. 
The amount of zeroes you need to have in a succesful hash is defined by the current difficulty level, which changes dynamically such that the average time for adding a new block is kept at 10 minutes. 
When the miner makes a succesful hash, he broadcasts it to nodes that verify it, and then it is part of the blockchain. Verification is easy, since you only need to check that hashing the chosen block with the guessed nonce actually produces the stated hash string.

This will probably be removed within a few seconds, but the mods in this sub are fucking hillarious. Why can't we have honest discussions about bitcoin in a sub called ? 
I am probably shadowbanned already anyway so no one will see this.

This is simply not true in a general sense. The difference to old currencies, gold, etc is that the safety is up to you, not to a bank. If someone hacks your wallet, no one will help you get your money back.

Haha nah I was kinda expecting it to be some sort of censorship of differing opinions, but I just wanted to make sure

Hm... can I trust you about that?

You seem to be knowledgeable on this topic, so you might be able to help me out. I have been looking at [these]( do you think they are good enough for making predictions, or do you have some other personal favourite (not too costly I hope)?

Np! Sorry if I sounded douchy, I just think it is important to make the distinction between broadcasted (mempool) and confirmed (blockchain) transactions, to avoid confusion.
It is an interesting topic though, and a very important one to solve if mass adoption is gonna happen. I.e. either make purchases valid even if they haven't yet been confirmed, e.g. with 0conf (like many bch proponents seem to like), or by traditional identification methods (not a good solution imo). Or the imo better solutions with 2nd layers such as LN, where you don't need the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain initially.

Not to be that guy, but how can the transaction be in the blockchain instantly, when the average time for creating a new block, per design, is 10 minutes? 
It will be in the mempool instantly, but until it is mined into a block it will not be in the blockchain.

An economy completely based on a deflationary currency is not a perfect solution either.
