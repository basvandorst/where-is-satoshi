Do you have a link to where one can download RaspiBlitz v1.3 by any chance? Can't seem to find it on Github.

Arrived at the same conclusion myself in the end. Fingers crossed the release version lands soon!

My findings to save others a bit of time:
(Non friendly: Revolut, Starling, Monese, Monzo, Barclays, RBS, HSBC - likely many more that I have not engaged)
Wirex - Appears ‘crypto’ friendly but have over a month waiting time for business accounts. They also have quite a poor rating by customers, with many reporting sudden seizure/closure of accounts and very poor communication following this. I would also question their integrity, given their eagerness to engage in an apparently scammy ICO of their own WIREX token which they seem to incessantly shill on Twitter. 
Red flags for me - if any of you do engage, I’d be very interested to hear about your experience.
Enumis - very high fees for transactions, monthly costs and setup fees. To the point where it seems barely worth doing business with them - most of the profit would end up their way.
Harvex - very very high setup fees (quoted for £2500 alone for setup)
Bunq - quite high fees. 10c per incoming/outgoing transaction and €10/month fee. Loads of hidden other fees. But seems bitcoin friendly indeed.
Fidor - Very long application procedure. I’ve been waiting for over 6 weeks. Will update on the result

They are not friendly for bitcoin businesses at all. 
Their in-app crypto support is deceptive. In reality they want nothing to do with crypto and don't even all deposits/withdrawals of crypto in the account.

Has anyone decided to splurge out on The Block’s subscription? I’ve spent days hunting for the best bitcoin friendly banks in Europe and the UK, so I’m unsure of whether this list will add to my list at all, hence reluctant to subscribe to a publication which I feel has an otherwise questionable quality of journalism.
Unfortunately throughout my search, I am yet to find a business bank account which appears friendly, affordable and legitimate.
