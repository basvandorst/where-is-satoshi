R.I.P. BITCOIN
@_date: 2015-05-09 01:53:07
People don't like change.  They want to invest but are  more comfortable doing it through this avenue.  They know bitcoin will appreciate, but it's too much to learn to safely get into it for a lot of people.
It's comical considering one of bitcoin's most appealing factors is anyone can invest any amount of money in it without being approved or regulated.

You do realize that ended the bubble of 2013 and produced a 2 year bear market that ultimately lead to a 80% loss in value rite?

I guess it depends on how you look at it.  The price sat at $220-250 for a year after that, my sweet summer child.

Wait what is the point of this block of text?  That you agree it's currently over valued and in a speculative bubble currently?  
Also that site is not good for charts.  If you want to look at historical charts I recommend

Go ahead and google Quantitative Easing and read the god damn definition. 
Quantitative easing is an unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases government securities or other securities from the market in order to lower interest rates and **increase the money supply.**

You do realize that is 3 years of inflation and a sustain of price?  Oh wait, no you didn't.

Stopped reading there.  Are you high on chromosomes?  
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:06:06
it's likely due to the on going malleability attacks that can change the transaction ID.  Their system tracks deposits by transaction ID, which if you look the two you've listed are different.  You should explain that is likely what happened and point them in the right direction, because they are apparently oblivious.

I think your head is way up , your ass that is.  You need to look at the dollar index and compare the correlation to bitcon price, "blockchainman" .  Face it, when the feds raise rates in December it isn't going to help your gamble.  And no, your friend likely bought his tulips today because he saw a price rise of 100% in 30 days, at the top no less. :)

Thank you for that useless interjection.  Wat?  Your points 1 and 2 are well understood by everyone in this discussion so I'm not sure why you felt the need to clarify.  
and point number 3 is irrelevant as QE1 2 and 3 were approved by congress.  So i'm a little confused as to why you felt the need to comment.
The debt clock link was to provide insight that the monetary base has increased significantly through these programs, not remained the same and balanced.  As you seem to not read and just come to conclusions based of skimming, maybe you'll take another look at the site and notice the money creation section.  You might need to wipe the shit off of your neckbeard and glasses to see it though, since your head has been so far up your ass.
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:10:36
Have you not heard of QE1?  QE2?  What about QE3? 
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:40:53
It's completely related.  If cheap shekels are still flowing into the market, especially if we get another QE, you will see BTC rise to new highs.   BUT If they raise rates, USD valuation will go up even further causing people to sell commodities.

Yeah what a shitty exchange to change your limits without reason or notice, only to fix the issue when publicly called out.  I remember when they launched they had auto play MUSIC on their home page.  That was enough for me to know to stay away, how amateur.
