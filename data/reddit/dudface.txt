What's this e-cash you're talking about, if you dont mind me asking? You've helped me a great deal and if my questions ever get to much, just say and ill stop :)
But i've never heard of the e-cash before, and this 51% mining attack i'm guessing is the part where you use at least 51% of the worlds combined mining power to create a second line of blocks in the block chain at the same time another block has already passed through, basically shutting off the second block... Unsure if i described that correctly or not

More like, im asking for help, because this is the most concentrated source of bitcoin knowing people that i've found, it isn't the only way im getting info, but it is one of them.

Wow, thanks!
So basically, both the advantages and the disadvantages to bitcoin is the fact that the government simply can't put their nose into it and muck about as they wish?
I've yet to read this whitepaper, but does he explain how bitcoin should try to fight the inflation?

And just how are these blocks being created? is it simply just running a program on your computer or is it a style of actually yourself solving the mathematical equations, as if you were in math class in school? I've been unable (for economic and not-having-a-computer-strong-enough reasons) to get the bitcoin mining program and test it out myself

Thanks for the help, it's an interesting point that about how very few actually controll their currencies
I'm having trouble understanding the entire block-chain and how it works, any tip for a place where i can read up more about it?

Thanks, that was all i was asking for, some info or places to start. And i apologise for using the "the", its just i posted on this subreddit about doing my graduation work back in february, was hoping to be remembered, but i'm sorry for making such an supposition

I know that i'm late to the party, but making a essay about bitcoin, does anyone have a permalink to said over picture that i can use as reference, sadly a imgur link wont work :/
i need a block chain link
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:51:08
Well thats... some hard math then, any tips for some place where i can find more information on the entire block creating section? this work is **quite** large, we are talking 15 pages of text
