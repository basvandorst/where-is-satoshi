i miss it too, but I can indirectly credit iRacing for getting me into Bitcoin.  I got passed up in the 2016 Mazda Road to 24 selection process (I was passed up for a driver with *zero* chance of racing professionally because iRacing likes to pretend that the drivers that they have sponsored in real racing never drove real race cars, which is absolutely false) and decided that instead of trying to suck up to a sponsor to race professionally, I'd figure out how earn the money on my own, hence investing in crypto.

why is trading for losers?  Yeah it is riskier and probably won't pay off, but done successfully, it *will* beat holding.  If you have one BTC and don't trade it, you will always have one BTC, and the entire value of your investment depends on hoping that someone else will pay more for it than you did when it comes time to cash out or spend.  At least if you trade and are able to acquire more BTC, it offsets any loss in value of the price per coin.  Again, easier said than done, but for some people, it is worth the risk.

hah.  I don't think I've ever been wrecked by a real driver, but I've had some good battles with a few of them.  I have a screenshot saved somewhere from a race where I lost to Will Power by something like 0.017 at Lime Rock in the MX-5 Cup cars.  He bobbled coming onto the front stretch and I was able to get a run, just not enough of one to get by.

IIRC, when I was looking up the back story on the guy who started the whole Doge/Josh Wise campaign, it appears that he was active in iRacing.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:48:17
we should get him started in it.  I'd be willing to throw in some BTC and/or DOGE.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:53:58
view count isn't the same as the number of people actually watching.  I quit iRacing a little over a year ago, but IIRC, the NASCAR and F1 pro series races only had view counts in the hundreds for their live broadcasts.

I don't get why people take what Warren Buffett says as gospel.  He doesn't want you to become wealthy or invest like he does.  He basically says to just buy SPY and leave it alone.  If Warren Buffett did that himself, he would not be a billionaire.

haha.  What I really wish is that I would have made the effort to stream on Twitch.  There was one guy (Matt Malone) that I used to always run against who had hundreds of viewers at any given time, and I was floored by how much money people were donating to him for their entertainment, almost enough to make a modest living.  This was back in 2015/2016.  Looking back though, I now vaguely remember people donating in Bitcoin and DOGE too, but I had no idea what that was.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:09:01
the view count probably means how many people saw the link on their news feed.  Again, not trying to rain on your parade, but a quick check of the PEAK Antifreeze Series on Youtube shows view counts are only around 8-16k per race.  There's not 100,000 people who were interested in watching some random league series.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:04:19
I have to think that the worst part of not being in a position to invest, let alone be familiar with Bitcoin until about a year ago, is knowing that all those years I had a gaming PC with two GPUs that probably could have been used to mine instead of sim race.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:02:26
to get an idea, look at the historical prices for JNUG/JDST, UGAZ/DGAZ, UWTI/DWTI, etc.  They undergo constant reverse splits because when the price of one of these ETFs goes down, it goes down *HARD*.  That being said, if you play them right, 3X ETFs can be extremely profitable, but as someone else said above, you do not want to hold these in your stock portfolio for long periods of time.  I'd probably be uncomfortable holding overnight even.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:46:44
cool car, but 100,000 people aren't watching iRacing broadcasts.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:50:57
I don't normally watch videos on YouTube about crypto, but I like Doug's.  They are informative and well presented.
To add to what he said, my biggest concern about bcash is that the people who back it are actively trying to destroy Bitcoin, which you can't really say about any other crypto.  Imagine for a minute if Roger Ver was actually able to be successful in convincing the masses that bcash is the real Bitcoin, and the end result is that Bitcoin tanks while bcash explodes in value.  Think about how many people who bought in after the fork that would end up being screwed because they weren't actively investing and didn't swap BTC for BCH in time.  What would that do to consumer confidence in cryptos?  Why would you ever invest in a coin again?  "Oh, that Bitcoin you had isn't the real Bitcoin, and now is worth nothing.  Sorry about that.  You want to buy this *other* Bitcoin now."  Yeah, screw that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:19:51
TIL: a random iRacing league gets 10x as many people watching as the top level actual pro series of iRacing, 2x as many people as there are actual subscribers to iRacing, and about 50% as many people watching as the real world Camping World Truck Series gets on TV.

@_date: 2019-11-25 12:54:05
no, it's not.  Anyone who is "excited" over their local coffee shop or whatever accepting Bitcoin is just hoping to no longer be holding their coins at a loss.  If you treat it like regular cash, then it should only be worth as much as regular cash.  If you want Bitcoin adoption to go up, use it for something harmless that your government doesn't approve of, like hookers or drugs or margin trading or something else along those lines.
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:36:10
this.  Shame about all the downvotes.  DCA limits your profits in exchange for limiting losses, and hodling still exposes you to frequent 80-90% drawdowns.  Trading will either amplify your gains, or amplify your losses -- it all depends on how skilled and disciplined you are at it.

the holdings of the Winklevoss twins might be OK, but it probably isn't good for business if a significant number of their customers get wrecked by the changing of the guard from BTC to BCH.  Especially those who got in after the fork.

if you want to buy less than $75 worth of Bitcoin, that's what Coinbase is for, not GDAX.
The tiny transaction amounts we see in trade history aren't a result of bots.  My guess is that it is that perhaps multiple people had the same bid or ask, and when a small portion of it filled, it split amongst those people, but really, I have no idea.

Calvin Ayre's Wikipedia entry reads like an advertisement.  When was the last time anyone heard the name Bodog anyway?
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:49:11
I was aware of it (a friend of mine worked for one of the US online casinos detecting cheaters), but the only time I ever see ads for online gambling anymore are when I see billboards for them when I watch F1 on TV.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:57:56
maybe I missed something, but the Wiki entry for him seemed to indicate that Bodog is no longer in the online poker business.
@_date: 2019-12-07 01:08:03
Wikipedia taking Bitcoin won't make the bags you probably bought in December 2017 any lighter.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:56:15
reading it again, it sounds like the name was licensed out to other gambling entities, then outright sold to someone in China, who renamed it.  I can't say that I've heard the Bodog name in like, a decade, but I also don't have cable and am fairly isolated from pop culture.

People express regret because they missed the signs that a coin/stock/whatever was on the rise, which is understandable, because spotting those rises is difficult.  You don't know if you're buying the top of a small rally, or the bottom of a large one.  Meanwhile, if the price begins to dip, chances are it is only the beginning of a downtrend due to human nature.  If you bought at the start of the dip like everyone seems to suggest, you're down like 15-20% right now.

hit mine too.  Of course, since I set my bot up incorrectly, it immediately bought back in, so the end result is a 0.50% (maybe 0.25%, forgot to check if the buy was a maker order) loss in fees.

the tough thing about using TA that I've found so far is that you can
find good exit points to avoid 10/20/percent drops using moving averages or RSI or whatever, but those same crossovers or formulas will end up putting your re-entry point at a higher price than you exited at.

my biggest concern:  if Bitcoin (or any crypto) were to take off and see mass adoption, it would result in a significant transfer of wealth to the early adopters, who happen to (at least in the US) be primarily white, male, and somewhat libertarian leaning, and I don't see society allowing that to happen.

sorry, I'll try to even it out with more of this:
"when should I buy Bitcoin?"
"at any price.  It doesn't matter if it dropped 80% in one day, or surged 50% in an hour.  Every price is perfect."
"when should I sell Bitcoin?"
"Never.  Only retards who use TA try to sell for a profit and then buy back at a lower price."
"why should I buy Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:42:47
get one of those cards with the 18 month 0% balance transfer offers and move what you owe over there.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:10:23
while I wouldn't say that Bitcoin only goes in one direction (remember, it did drop 40% last month), I've never understood using the term volatile to describe the price of something when it seemingly only moves up or down.  If a coin or stock goes down 80% in two months, that's not volatile, it's just a piece of shit.  When I hear volatility, I think frequent price swings.  I dunno, maybe that's just me.
