This is a good reason but the major reason this isn’t allowed is money remittance from India. India has a lot of regulation over money moving “out of india” 
For example, all western union locations in India can only receive money and not send it even in india. Banks need a lot of proof and you can only send money to either relatives or documented business partners if you plan on sending money outside India. 
This is the reason bitcoins go for 14%-20% premium in India and even then arbitrage is more hassle than its worth.

Don’t buy crypto with a credit card irresponsibly. I buy exclusively with credit card now. Credit card fees are about 4% and I don’t have to wait for a week for my coins to show up. By the time my coins show up I would have already made more than 4% lost in fees. That being said, I pay off my card with my bank account right away as to not carry a balance. 
This isn’t a sound advise when the market isn’t as volatile and when you are just a monkey with a keyboard with no clue as to what you are doing.

Yes I should have mentioned I day trade mostly. Invest profits in relatively new coins I believe in and HODL. 
Agreed GDAX 500 dollar buys are a boon, hate the exchange but it has its pros.

Correct me if I am wrong because I do have an active account in Zebpay and all the other 3 “exchanges” but Zebpay and Unocoin I would say they are rather brokers than exchanges. A simple test is to look at their buy price and sell price and the massive $2000-$4000 difference between each. On an exchange, I feel like the difference would be negligible.

17.3 fucking already and it has been less than a minute. Jesus this is INSANE!!

Not necessarily I used my other email to sign up from my real IP address and in less than a minute I had signed up and bought $250 worth of bitcoins. Eventually sent it to my bitcoin wallet but at least I had a proof of concept that in reality it shouldn't be flagged every time.
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:07:16
Indeed. I think based on the model they are going after it would take them anywhere from 2-5 years to be fully functional or a really good business developer to make it mainstream. But so far after almost 2 years I haven't seen much happening to it and it seemed like a great concept.

They have been or had been beta testing in USA as I mentioned in the post. They were testing in Nebraska over a year ago theres a few reddit posts about it.

I do not have an issue with providing my details but they had 2 months to request it from me. I would have taken my business elsewhere if I knew. And now in the time of desperate need they decided to lock me out?

Does anybody know how long does manual verification take?

Alright then I gotta put my research hat on and as soon as I have the money back I will move it to somewhere else and send nasty letters to Xapo and move on. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:26:45
Lesson learned. Screw Xapo. Thank you so much for taking time to explain everything. What are the secure way to receive bitcoin that you would recommend?
@_date: 2016-06-18 03:17:23
I have tried localbitcoins. I want to trade in bitcoins. I get investors just like regular stock market investors and I invest their money in bitcoin whenever I feel the market would go up. I cannot keep the money in bitcoin because its so volatile. 
Alright, so with localbitcoins - I lose over 8-9% and the worst is that now a stranger with no security would hold my personal information. I am not looking to turn 100-200 into btc whenever I invest I am looking for close to 10-20K a day at the very least. 
I live in a small town doubt anybody has heard about bitcoin here. 
No on ether too. 
How does mining solve my problem? Wouldn't mining take forever to make the same amount of money if I just invested and waited for a few hours doing nothing? 
@_date: 2016-06-18 03:21:34
Not entirely true. Wallofcoins does not ask for ID information. If they have the means to do it then why do I have to provide my ID to libertyx. Are you saying the government has different rules for them? Its only because these companies do not wanna put in efforts to find a safe alternative and to find ways to comply. 
Edit: I am talking strictly cash deposit. In fact I haven't seen any other company than wallofcoins to come close to being semi private.

How is it laundering money? I am buying a product with legitimate money. I am selling that product for profit.
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:50:10
The funny thing is I was logging in as I was about to move my coins to another wallet. By the time I could finish the transaction I was locked out. It was like Xapo just wanted to keep the money. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:40:49
Thank You Jessie for a fast response. I really do appreciate it. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:48:03
My biggest problem stems from the fact that these sites exist that dont require your ID. THE ONLY REASON I would want to buy bitcoins for cash from somebody else's account would be if I wanted privacy with bitcoin. I cannot think of any other legitimate reason for those brokers to exist. If I didn't really care about the privacy I could go to circle or thousands of others myself and buy it. Why would I pay a premium price of 8-10%? Even after that at the end I still have to provide one or another form of identification and that is absurd.

What? $1000 worth of bitcoin not 1000bitcoins. I wish I could get 1000 BTC. That would be pretty dope. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:37:36
As I said lesson learned. Its not really silly because I would never commit any crime or whatever to give banks a reason to freeze my funds. For majority of population that's as good as reason to believe it is my money. Moreover, I am not originally from US so it took me a while but now I understand "why Ron Swanson would never use banks" 
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:33:58
I always thought that was the case!! 
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:27:29
Correction: I meant more privacy and security. I called Circle and said I would like to use VPN for my account and they said they dont support it and my data is secure. Now I don't know much about this but I am always working out of coffee shops and I would feel much much much safer with a VPN than without it. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:49:04
So you are saying if I deposited money in my bank account that belongs to the bank now? I am new to the bitcoin in general but I seriously cannot understand how that is even legal. Now, I got the money in xapo's wallet. How do I get it back? 
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:51:23
What wallets are not as ridiculous as this one? 
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:31:17
Ahh that's a shame. Bitcoin community can definitely use a startup like that. Coupled with a few great collaboration an idea like this can turn buying bitcoin a piece of cake while keeping your privacy at core.

Allow me to explain. If you deal in cash with the currency that stopped being legal tender a week ago not only would that be illegal but will have to be explained at the bank as to how you acquired such sum of money. 
However, even on official indian trading platforms such as Unocoin which only use electronic form of payment so no hassle about old cash the bitcoin has been trading for over $900. I plan to buy a few from my US bank account and make a bank. Its reserved only for Indian nationals at the moment but if anybody is interested shoot me a pm and we will see if we can arrange something. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:44:12
Basic principle of supply and demand. At the moment the demand for more miners is just a little elevated than usual so the supply although would increase by a bit and we would see more miners popping up in upcoming weeks. When a surge like this happens the market would automatically correct itself over time but if it seems like even with higher mining fees the transaction wouldn't happen faster, another solution would soon come to exist to either increase the capacity (in fact they are in works) or an alternative. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:07:38
Bad idea. Its highly regulated and pretty much illegal, unless you trade on indian platforms after KYC then you wont get the premium prices.
