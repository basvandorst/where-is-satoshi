I spent almost a year learning, here and there, before I jumped in. Just had to feel secure, and on how to do so. If I cut out my bank, like you said, it's all on me now.

Live in AZ too. It's fine, just stay inside 4 months of the year, avoid the right wingers, mean mug the old men mean muggin you, and eat at taco trucks.
Other than that, you can pretty much do whatever you want out here.

I didn't expect this to humor me so much. Awesome.

This is probably the truest, most organic thing. I got consumed just like this. Created a passion for this tech and currency. Favorite part was investing knowledge unto myself.

Oh look, my Facebook feed is in Reddit now. Neat.
