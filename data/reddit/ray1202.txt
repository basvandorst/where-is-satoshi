How will tax work for business accept Bitcoin?

A day to confirm? Then how will this work? Do you show them you send the money and walk away? Or you need to stay and wait till it is confirmed?

Just cut and paste the address to my friend. He is using bitcoin, and I let him talked me into trying it, but this seems a lot more trouble than I originally thought
