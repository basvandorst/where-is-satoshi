here's what i put as aditional comments; 
the value of USD and other fiats compared to bitcoin are approaching zero at a rate of logarithmic expansion. 
Why? 
Because the whole system of fiat money and the banking system drags along with it all of the things that are horrid in this world. 
Returning the transfer of money, which is a form of inter-humanitary energy, to a peer to peer system, there exists a network of people and their industry. .As production efficiency per labor hour increases, one person will be able to produce as much as a factory.
The end result of decentralizing monetary transactions? The end of the monarchy of capital. What state can tax an anonymous currency if it has no way to know who owns what?
What bank can print money out of thin air in a crypto-currency?
What police-state can seize assets of whistleblowers?
Etcetera. Money as it is , leads to bondage. Money between people, like bitcoin, can lead to liberation. 
If we refuse the temptation to spend it all on sportscars as it climbs to the moon. Here's looking at you, Fontas.
The desert temple from Alladin comes to mind. We're here for the lamp, Abu!

Money is so relative :)

yeah bird in the hand aint bad at all. You own your own house! That's something not everyone can say. Congratulations

Thank you. It seems blockchain.info staff is vouching for this service, advertising them as 'the official' recovery service. So I'll try with them. It's not cheap but it's cheaper than casting the BTC's to the wind.

This is the core of why most of our mainstream charity organizations don't work for the communities in which they operate. 
Thank you for taking this approach. 
Inspiring work. I love the smiles on all the photo's. I bet it's rewarding work knowing you're making a difference halfway round the world.
The internet brings us all closer sec getting dust in my eye

has a mod that regularly tips people in bitcoin. Pick your subreddits! Off-beat places like maybe and Tpping in is like feeding the trolls. Preach to the choir.

I just checked that wiki and came up with an idea
How about, in addition to cloudsourcing everything, we fungibilize everything! 
Fungible cars, bikes, clothes, computers make sense

Luckily there's a bunch of altcoin available. We can switch to Namecoin, for instance.

share the shit out of this. Can you set it up as a kickstarter / universal project? Find a supplier that takes BTC directly? 
Also, please add litecoin / easy way to get altcoins in, and local clients for shops that want to just do business in BTC rather than relying on centralised btc-&gt;usd conversion systems like bitpay.com
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:17:07


Right around there. That's not what the man said. 
Also, 


You own guns. I own bitcoin. Both, we have them out of our love for freedom. We just express this differently, which means across the whole world , we have our bases covered. Freedom will win out. 
Terrorism, as a word, is a weapon. Be careful where you point that thing. If you associate Bitcoin with terrorism, and someone responds by saying 'guns are terrorism' , where will that lead us?
Government like an overprotective mother hen will come and take them from us and say 'those toys make you boys fight. I'll hold on to them for now. You can ask your father if you want to borrow them. 
Here, the dad is bureaucracy 
play nice. Bitcoin has a legitimate point, same as your guns. I hope nobody uses guns, not just not the terrorist. There's no 'good guys' from where i'm standing when it comes to using guns. I can't to see the military as 'the good guys' anymore. That's just pillaging what we're doing in those countries, nothing to do with bringing freedom. 
Neither does fiat money have anything to do with a free market. 
I wanna see the return of the free market, so it's Crypto all the way for me.  Not necessarily bitcoin, but crypto yeah, for sure. We'll all be better for it.

Nice :) Post it back on pics if you get it for extra karma. Or gold, if you're lucky
BTW; is there a 'bitcoin ebay'  yet? Would be nice. not too tough to make and you could embed eschrow.

nice straw man, then again, with such a handle. Major selling point of bitcoin:
I can give you money. Noone has to know. Noone needs to know. My chikun for your cow. Peer to peer transaction.
