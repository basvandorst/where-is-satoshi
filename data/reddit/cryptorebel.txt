 Even on the other bitcoin sub they have warning when you link to the same sub without a np, because many subs will ban for it.  A lot here complained about brigading, so you would think they would have integrity to maintain their position, but it seems they twist their definitions to suit their agenda when needed.

Roger is a huge free market capitalist.  He is involved and even donated $1 million to the [Foundation for Economic Education.](  He is very astute when it comes to Austrian Free market economics.  I don't believe in climate change at all because I know that academia is corrupted by big energy interest like GE who benefit from the man-made global warming hoax.  They can use it as excuse to pass regulations which give them a monopoly.  Seems you are a victim of not being able to think for yourself.  But its ok, it takes all types of people to run the world.  But the true pioneers like Satoshi Nakamoto were able to think for themselves and not be a slave to others criticisms and limitations.

Satoshi emailed Adam Back in early days about Bitcoin and Adam wrote it off, basically he shitted on Bitcoin and thought it would never work.  Adam didn't get involved until after the first price bubble to over $1000.  That is how much he lacked vision and understanding of what Bitcoin was.  He is into tiny details and cryptography, not peer-to-peer incentive driven social systems.  That is a totally different field.  Satoshi left the project in the hands of Gavin Andresen who was his right hand man.  Gavin is for a blocksize increase and has been trying to get it done for years, but got ousted by hostile Core devs.  The guy has been trashed and his name dragged through the mud when he has probably done more for Bitcoin than Satoshi himself.  Just look at his [recent comment here](  The guy is responsible for a lot of the robustness and success of the Core team, yet gets no credit and instead defamed and attacked.  Its sickening.  Greg Maxwell and others hate Satoshi so much they won't even say Satoshi's name any more and only refer to him as "Bitcoin's Creator" because they fear Satoshi and his vision so much.  That tells you all you need to know.

@_date: 2017-03-26 04:26:55
Well its good that Roger can admit his weaknesses and also knows his strengths.  He seems stronger in economics, while it would be nice for the Core devs to admit that they are not very good economists.  Core devs are very good at coding and the tiny details, but not very good at the big picture.  They don't really understand all of the incentives and checks and balances of Bitcoin, so that is why they get overly worried about small detailed problems in the system, while ironically ignoring the big giant blocksize problem in front of their nose.  [They can't see the forest because they're down in the trees]( as Gavin Andresen said.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:10:24
Most non-HD wallets don't re-use addresses either, like Bitcoin Core.  Or you can actually reuse addresses with HD wallets like Electrum if you want.  Its a silly thing to say that using HD provides fungibility or protects against blockchain analysis.  If anything HD is actually much less private and is risky because some wallets might expose your Master Public Key which would link the addresses in your entire wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:53:56
Awesome, glad to hear that, we could really use more tools for hardware wallets.  
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:02:34
So does Bitcoin Core, which is a non-HD wallet.  Generating a unique address everytime is common practice whether HD or not.  HD has nothing to do with privacy and fungibility. Actually if your Master Public Key is leaked or given out from your HD wallet, it will compromise the privacy of your entire wallet and link EVERY single address in your HD wallet to each other and link it to you. It shows you have a general misunderstanding of all aspects Bitcoin, and you are opposing Satoshi's vision of bigger blocks. Yet people somehow give you credibility just because you were a moderator?? Its silly.  Also why don't you try your test today on Monday which is the busiest Bitcoin transaction day and not on Sunday which is the least busiest?

So don't pretend I am the only one, just because you have only been exposed to censored academia and cannot think for yourself or look into things for yourself.  You must be told by "experts".  Just look at the e-mails leaked in the climate gate scandal.  Even members of the US house of Representatives including U.S. Rep.

People once thought Bitcoin was bananas too.  They thought Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity was bananas.  But the true pioneers don't care what naysayers think.  The market will decide if the idea is truly bananas or not.  And so far its catching on big time, which shows that the idea is not as nuts as you say it is.  What seems more nuts, is keeping a 1MB limit with huge fees and unreliable transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:32:16
BU code is not shit, what is shit is Core code which doesn't do anything to increase the blocksize which is desperately needed.  What economy is going to exist when fees go up to $1, $5, even $100 as Luke jr suggests?  The core devs have said they want Bitcoin to be a settlement network, and then you know blockstream will profit off second tier solutions.  But Satoshi said Bitcoin is electronic peer-to-peer cash in the white paper.  These people obviously are attacking Bitcoin's original vision.  But that's ok, we are forking...BU FTW.

Here is an [example of Roger Ver having a problem]( I have had a lot of problems recently as well especially during peak times.  A couple times I waited over 20 hours for a confirmation.  I was only saved by viabitcoin's transaction accelerator when some wallets and services did not use a good enough fee.  I use bitcoin many times per day. 
I noticed a lot of people who don't use Bitcoin are against Satoshi's vision of bigger blocks.  Here [Roger Ver mentions it in debate with Johnny from Blocksstream](  Also [Tone Vays admitted he rarely ever uses Bitcoin and almost never does bitcoin transactions, doesn't hold much bitcoin, and doesn't consider himself a real bitcoin user]( while Roger uses it many times a day like me and invested his life into it like me. You jratcliff have also [sold half your bitcoin recently]( Its funny you had to do tests to find out, because you probably don't use it very often for real life things like real Bitcoiners do.

Why is anybody listening to Tone Vays.  The guy admits he never uses Bitcoin, doesn't hold much Bitcoin at all, and doesn't even consider himself a Bitcoin user.  Source: 
Devs will work on the most common and popular implementation as to get their code used and included.  Over time developers will always migrate to the most common implementation.  But its good to have competition between different implementations now that Bitcoin is a very large network.  In the early days this was not so and Satoshi's quotes would be against alternative implementations because it would make his job harder.  But that was very early times and things have changed and grown a lot to where now competing implementations is very healthy for decentralization.

My post from other sub:




@_date: 2015-08-31 04:54:45
Well actually mining pools have already had the ability to influence the system for a while now through voting.  This is how many soft forks have occured already.  This is no different really except it has become controversial for whatever reason.  It was Satoshi's original vision to raise the block cap.  Gavin wanted to just raise it, but there was a lot of resistance.  So that was when BIP100 and BIP101 were created as a compromise.  
We can't just sit around and do nothing forever.  At some point a less than perfect solution must be made.  Anyone can find flaws in it, and use that as an excuse to hold Bitcoin back.  My point was Bitcoin is not perfect and never will be.  If you want to wait for perfection, then Bitcoin will never grow and become mainstream.  We have to push ahead even though its messy and imperfect.  Social interactions are imperfect unlike mathematics.
As for communism, I am really worried about the communism in America.  I am for freedom.  I don't like central banks.  I like capitalism.  One thing that breeds corruption is a lack of freedom, a lack of capitalism, a lack of choice, and competition.  Corrupt people get into government and take things over with regulatory capture, and create monopolies.  There could be a monopoly in Bitcoin development, and XT could be setting the precedent that Bitcoin is truly decentralized in that we can choose different forks to follow based on the community's wishes.  So if Bitcoin Core makes bad choices, or if they are not making enough choices, or if they are not following Satoshi's vision, then we can choose to opt-out and opt-in to XT or something else. I believe that is a very important precedent to set, to show Bitcoin cannot be easily usurped. If this change to Bitcoin causes any problems, we can always change it again.  Lets not stagnate over the fear of imperfection.

You will want to look into cold storage.  Its best to create your wallet on a cold device not connected to the internet.  [Here]( is a good tutorial on how to do it with electrum on ubuntu bootable operating system.

Actually your address is not actually your public key.  You have a different public key for each public address but its kind of hidden by the software.  Each address is correlated with one specific public key.  You can encrypt and decrypt messages using that public key instead of the derived address.  In fact this is how [bitmessage]( works.  So what you are asking already exists.

When I see the Bitcoin network I see humans interacting.  I see them putting checks and balances on each other.  I see a clever incentive system that keeps everyone honest.  Technology only plays a role as the skeleton of that human social network.
Other people only see a mathematical crypto system, they ignore the human element of Bitcoin.  Or they are just so engrossed in the math and crypto they don't take a step back to realize its a human network.  Mike Hearn touched on this in one of his videos.  He was saying how everyone is trying so hard for a perfect solution because most of the developers are also mathematicians.  Mathematicians often try to find perfect answers for everything.  Lets face it, Bitcoin is not perfect.  Its clunky, its weird, it isn't supposed to work, yet it somehow does.  The reason Bitcoin does not fail is because of the human social element of it.  Even if bugs are found or code breaks, it doesn't seem to matter much, it can be fixed.  Even in the 2010 fork, consensus was reached easily once a big problem happened.  Its the human element of Bitcoin that keeps it alive.  That is what I think. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 05:44:08
Mike Hearn said he wanted a simple change and upgrade done by Gavin, probably similar to what you are for.  But the community has fought against it, resulting in this compromise. I tend to agree it would be better to avoid the mining vote.   
However one point I would make is its not just the mining pool operators voting.  Its individual miners.  They decide which pool to join.  If they don't like the way their pool is voting, they move to a new one or create a new one.  So I don't think its fair to say it comes down to a dozen operators.  Also its not so bad that the miners are voting.  They vote on lots of other things in past soft forks, which arguably are less important and less risky than this one.  But miners do secure the network, and they are incentivized to keep the network healthy, so at least keep that in mind.

Yeah that is a big box.  I bet that has around 100K in it.  The bigger issue though is how do you even get that much money and in 100 dollar bills. Barclays is only allowing £1,100 withdrawals. Also even carrying around a few thousand is enough for police to seize it without a crime accused or a warrant needed.  Transferring or moving that much money violates all kinds of money laundering laws I am sure, or gives the IRS an excuse to seize it.  Probably you need to fill out lot of forms and banks have limits on how much cash you can deposit into a box, as we have seen sometimes that limit is 0.
Also I think that safety deposit boxes also are [not insured](  So if the bank burns down or is robbed you are possibly screwed.  Also there are rumors that DHS is now able to seize safety deposit boxes under the Patriot Act without a warrant.  They have always been able to seize it with a warrant.  So those are things to think of.

Well Gavin actually agrees with you.  He also said that if he was a VC he would be excited about LN on a recent podcast with Adam Back and Trace Mayer.

Maybe they can process 56,000 per second at peak times.  But could they sustain that level of transaction constantly every second for weeks or months on end?  That is still unclear.
So I think the Bitcoin math may want to break it down by that logic as well.  There is figuring out how many Bitcoin transactions could take place on average over time, and then there are peak times to think about when the transaction amount may be much greater for short periods due to different reasons, like possibly a spam attack, etc..

We have to look at Satoshi's quotes to learn the original vision of Bitcoin.  Most Bitcoiners bought into Bitcoin thinking the community would want to follow Satoshi's original vision.  Now some people are trying to change that vision.  Sure maybe Satoshi's vision was wrong.  So that is why people have the ability to fork the open source code and make an alt-coin to compete against Bitcoin in the free market.  If their vision is truly better it will win in the free market.  They can make their own coin with their own vision, but don't usurp Bitcoin and Satoshi's vision. It seems like cheating to try to take over Bitcoin's original vision rather than compete in the market.

I don't think its quite the same a dictatorship by one person.  You see, decentralization exists in many shades of grey.  At some point in a decentralized network you have nodes.  These nodes are centralized when you at them close up.  But take a step back and see them existing in a decentralized network.  Its these nodes that could have a dictator running them, but they must compete with other nodes, which have dictators, or ones which have a consensus process instead like Gavin's.  By forking the project we now have 2 nodes competing instead of solely Core.  Actually we have more.  Because some people are running their own versions, such as Core+BIP101, or other patched versions.  I think its healthy to have competition.  Yes some of those nodes may be run by a dictator, but the users can always switch to other nodes in the decentralized network.

The scalability solution is to raise the blocksize limit.  I don't see why we have to be so scared and then come up with a bunch of what if hypothetical situations.  Having a Bitcoin network that does not scale with 1MB blocks is something I don't want Bitcoin to become.  So it seems we have differing opinions on what we want for Bitcoin.  Yet my opinion seems to coincide with Satoshi's quotes on the issue:
The problem is you seem to be going against the original intentions of Bitcoin as created by its inventor.  I personally think Bitcoin should not diverge from Satoshi's original plan.  Satoshi entrusted Gavin when he left the community, and Gavin also agrees we should follow Satoshi's plan.  So I think its not fair for you to come say you don't want to follow his plan and we have to adhere to what you want, instead of what Gavin, Satoshi, and many members of the community want.  We want the common sense approach of following Satoshi's vision.

Oh which issues? Like the Lightning Network that changed everything? Ok you are wrong since Satoshi was working on the [precursor to LN]( and still wanted to increase blocks.  Hope you realize Gavin can still revoke everyone's commit priveleges in Core and raise the limit without your permission.  He was being a nice guy and trying to reach consensus first.  Satoshi left the project in Gavin's hands, he knew what he was doing.

If we make a mistake when raising the limit, it can always be fixed.  At the end of the day all Bitcoin is, is a public ledger.  We use technology and a human incentive network to secure that ledger. During the 2010 fork, it didn't take long to get consensus and fix the problem. If it breaks it can be fixed.  Also there are other factors keeping the blocksize down like miners for example.  Gavin even says that in his heart of hearts, he thinks that having [unlimited block size]( would even be ok.  I think its good to be a little conservative, which is why Gavin is not for completely eliminating the limit at this time.  But I think its really likely that we are being too conservative, and holding Bitcoin back.
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:11:46
I think theymos was maybe confused about your post.  I think he is just saying you can export the keys without having to download the chain.  Just go to the debug window and type dumpprivkey followed by the address that holds your coins.  But I am pretty sure you can't send the coins from Core without downloading the whole chain.  Not sure the reason why you have to wait since you should be able to still sign the transaction, but this is just how Core works. Possibly to defend against bad transactions or something.

Actually its nowhere near 60% that are against a blocksize increase.  Its maybe 1 oe 2% that want 1MB stagnation.  Its a complete strawman argument.  Even the blockstream and LN people have been forced to admit that blocksize increase is needed.
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:38:32
Its a non-issue.  Your whole premise hinges on a bunch of theoretical hypothetical situations where governments take over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:45:44
No, this is a strawman.  I am fine with the software forking, and the community deciding and coming to consensus on the rules for securing the Bitcoin public ledger.  Its much different than a blockchain fork.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:33:48
Yeah I understand that.  But it seems like a very small issue, almost a non-issue.
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:42:44
You wish.
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:38:46
Yeah that is true because in person there is a real different vibe.  A lot of communication occurs through voice inflections and body language.  Sometimes its easy to say things in person and your tone and body language convey respect to the person you talk to.  Where if you said the same thing in text format, then it is very easy for it to be misconstrued.  Its easy for people to feel disrespected even if that is not the case, then they retaliate and things spin out of control.
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:42:52
Actually BIP100 is a vote for bigger blocks, which shows the majority want bigger blocks and not this 1MB stagnation.  Nobody lied about BIP101, stop with your straw mans.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:02:54
Of course Fidelity interested in using Bitcoin is an argument for blocksize.  Bitcoin is a political thing.  Sure the code and cryptography is important, but you know what is even more important to Bitcoin?  The human element.  The complex incentive system of humans interacting is what makes Bitcoin.  Trying to find a perfect computer science answer to this issue will never happen.  Bitcoin is not perfect and never will be.  Its because human social interactions are not perfect and never will be, and at its heart Bitcoin is a social network of humans more than it is a math and crypto system.  Even though Bitcoin is not perfect it works, because of the human element.

@_date: 2015-09-26 14:31:16
I tend to agree.  The more competing forks we have, the more decentralized and robust Bitcoin should be in the long term.
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:04:15
Well I agree that 1 minute may be a bit fast and cause too many orphans.  But I think the ideal block interval is probably a bit lower than 10 minutes.

Yet its really tiring to have to keep refuting all of this BS.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:44:45
You are wrong.  Of course there is compensation for the use of the blockchain.  They will be paying millions of dollars in fees to miners.  Also they will be buying large amounts of Bitcoin, which increases the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-21 06:27:45
How are light wallets as insecure as a web wallet? You can even use hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger with light wallets, so comparing it to a web wallet doesn't seem right at all.
@_date: 2015-09-21 06:35:49
Yeah that is true, it could be considered depending on how you want to classify it. But I think Luke was more referring to insecure web wallets that don't use hardware wallet integrations.

Twitter is down, is there any video link?
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:18:44
That is silly.  Because they put a competing software out there against Core?  Because they suggested a change that was in lign with Satoshi's stated vision for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:09:03
Blockchain.info should be safe.  But if its a large amount of Bitcoin coming from cold storage, I would probably choose a different method to import the key, like Electrum on an offline computer, or a bootable OS like Tails or Ubuntu/Mint.  This would be safer than using a hot web wallet like blockchain.info.  I would try to sign the message in an offline environment and then broadcast the signed message to the network, keeping the keys cold.  But if its just a small amount, blockchain.info sounds like a good choice.  You won't have to keep coins there long either before transferring to an exchange.
 
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:39:38
No you are the joke.  It has not failed at all, you just live in delusion.  We now have a release valve that can allow for bigger blocks as the stagnation of Core becomes a more serious problem.  This thread got a lot of upvotes, that speaks for itself, regardless of what delusion fairytale land you want to live in.
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:44:51
I would argue that Gavin and Mike were just trying to follow Satoshi's vision of increasing the blocksize.  I think the ones who are not allowing an increase are the ones with the hostile takeover.  To increase the blocksize in a one-time increase would be a lot simpler than BIP101.  You would not need much peer review of the code for that.  It comes down to politics not code at the end of the day.
By forking the code, it allows the users to have more power to decide.  Now we essentially have a release valve.  As more pressure is put on blocks, more and more people will see the need to switch.  Now there is an option to increase the blocksize, which is a great thing.  If Core stagnates or gets corrupt we can also switch.  Its not disgusting, its decentralization.  Its good to have competition.  Some people are running Core+BIP101, some people are running Unlimited, and other custom implementations.  That is what Bitcoin is all about, having the freedom to choose.
@_date: 2015-09-26 03:31:29
I don't know, you make a lot of assumptions like they "let him step down".  I don't think he has a big ego at all, seems like a pretty humble guy to me.  I wish that Wladimir J. van der Laan would be more active in the community and communicate to us about his philosophy on the blocksize and other issues.
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:34:58
That doesn't make sense.  If he had such a huge ego, he would probably try to maintain as much power as possible over Bitcoin, which would mean he never would have stepped down as lead developer.  Although some on the other side of the debate seem to have pretty big egos, like the ones censoring certain community forums.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:46:21
Lets discuss ideas.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:23:59
Wow, you just repeated the same thing over again when you were faced with the true reality of the situation.  The delusion is really great in these ones.
@_date: 2015-09-13 02:44:52
Yeah but money only comes in 100 dollar bills also.  Its not too practical to store 100K or more in safe deposit boxes.  I don't know how many boxes you would need for that.  Also as inflation goes up cash becomes more and more cumbersome to the point that soon it won't exist.
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:27:07
Sure there are limitations, and Gavin and Mike Hearn are working on improving on those limitations.  Mike says there is no reason Bitcoin cannot handle 1000s of transactions a second.  He also says that Satoshi was working on something that could be considered the precursor of the Lightning Network for High Frequency transactions.  I think both will be needed to help Bitcoin scale.  Video here talking about it at 41min mark: 
Edit: Also to scale to Visa size we only need 133 transactions per second according to this chart: 
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:49:03
Actually BIP101 does not go through without consensus.  He never abandoned consensus.
@_date: 2015-09-26 00:32:31
I agree, I think confidential transactions looks promising for the short term.  That combined with coinjoin can give pretty good privacy.  Maybe down the line there will be something even better, like complete cryptographic anonymity using SNARKS or something similar.  I worry however that there will be a lot of resistance in Core to adding these features, same as there is resistance to the blocksize increase.  Possibly there will be further forks from Core where people will include these privacy features, and users will have to decide to leave Core and go for something else.  It could be a healthy thing to have competition.
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:26:25
Yeah sure.  When setting up a Trezor you get a 24 word mnemonic list.  You write this down on a piece of paper as your backup.  Your words are secret and even the most powerful computer can never guess your word list.  Keep it safe as it backs up all of your coins.  If your Trezor breaks you can recover it using different wallet softwares that are compatible, and just plugging in your word list for recovery.  I believe Electrum is compatible with the Trezor word list, so you can always restore your coins.  Even if the Trezor company disappears your Trezor should still work fine as well, but there just may not be any more firmware upgrades.  Others could put out their own firmware, except when putting it on your Trezor it will just give a warning of unofficial firmware.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:44:21
They did not reject BIP101 yet.  Gavin said the plan was to get consensus from the economic majority and then the last part was to lobby the miners.  Gavin says it in this podcast: 
Mike hearn says the same thing in this video: 
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:41:36
It was a pretty big strawman to attack him for that comment.  To me it seemed like an honest and bit of a light hearted comment by Gavin.  Sure the questioner was looking for a different type of answer.  I think Gavin was just being honest.  It does feel good to use Bitcoin, on a fundamental level, and that is all that Gavin was saying.  Of course its deeper than that, and I am sure Gavin will be the first to say so.  To accuse people of personality worship when I am just defending and respecting a pioneer in the community is pretty insulting.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:34:54
Obviously it has to do with other Core devs as well, but Wladimir holds an important position, and its a position that should be in communication with the community.  Mike Hearn comments on Wladimir's unwillingness to budge on the issue: 
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:48:58
Very interesting ideas, especially the second one.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:07:31
Bitcoin has many leaders.  Wladimir is the guy blocking a blocksize increase in Core, and we deserve to hear from him.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:13:53
Mike said he was a little skeptical Lightning Network will be the winner, but seems he supports the general idea of having high frequency transactions on top of the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2015-09-16 04:32:06
You don't have to worry about Trezor going down, even if the company disappears you can recover your bitcoins from your key.  One thing you may consider is that if the cryptography is ever broken then HD wallets could be prone to some attacks where hackers could brute force your keys by examining some of your signed transactions. Since its an HD wallet its similar to using the same address twice, especially if your master public key is exposed.  So perhaps for your savings get a dedicated Trezor and put coins there and never spend from that wallet.  Then get another Trezor for your spending wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-15 03:21:53
I think sometimes prepaid credit cards are hard to change into Bitcoin.  Personally I would prefer coinbase.com or circle.com to link your bank account and buy and sell Bitcoin directly.  
You may also check out [purse.io]( I never used it but I guess you can buy things for people on Amazon, and then you get Bitcoin in return for it.  Also [paxful]( is another peer-to-peer trading site where people trade gift cards and things for Bitcoin.

Satoshi wanted to increase the blocksize, but was also working on something similar to LN for high frequency transactions: 
Satoshi wanted both.

Fidelity Investments wants to experiment with the Bitcoin blockchain, but if they flip the switch on their beta program, it will instantly fill Bitcoin's capacity.  This is what they said to Jeff Garzik, according to this video:  
That is just one institution or company that we know of.  I am sure there are many others that are not even going to bother experimenting with Bitcoin, since Bitcoin can't accomadate them with 1MB blocks.

Here is Satoshi Nakamoto's quote on the issue of burdening nodes:


@_date: 2015-09-15 18:01:10
Bitcoin may not be that system yet, but I think its possible to achieve it some day, especially with things like LN and sidechains.
@_date: 2015-09-21 09:45:46
Of course Bitcoin is open source.  This means others can take it and fork the code and design it their own way if they like it.  That is how open source works.  Its not supposed to work by people usurping control of Bitcoin's original vision.  The new users who want to ruin Bitcoin's original vision should not buy into a project they do not believe in.  They should fork it and make their own.  There is no Messianic tone, its just acknowledging what Bitcoin was designed for from the beginning.  Many people have no clue and have never read Satoshi's original quotes to understand what Bitcoin's original vision was.  Now people want to change that vision, and I and many others are upset about it.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:42:04
Good point.
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:04:09
WRONG!!!! It works because of the human element.  When the network hardforked before it took no time to fix it.  The code broke, but the humans fixed it.  Bitcoin is a human network, and the crypto and math is only the skeleton.  Satoshi knew this.  Many mathematicians and cryptographers and developers can't understand this because they are too focused on math and perfect solutions, that is why we have this problem of holding Bitcoin back, and stagnating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:36:34
Well I bought into Bitcoin thinking it would get larger block size, and be able to scale for mainstream adoption.  Now people want to say Satoshi's vision does not matter.  Of course its an emotional issue.  I have put my heart, soul, time, energy, money into Bitcoin.  I believed in Satoshi's vision.  Now people are saying that vision didn't matter, and I did not invest myself into Bitcoin, but instead some 1MBcoin.  That is not what I signed up for, and I have a right to be angry about it.  Many others are angry too, yet most of them got banned and censored from this sub.  So don't pretend like this is a fair debate on a censored sub.

Its always good to have smart leaders in any community. There should be many leaders.  I am a leader, you are a leader too, just by posting here.  I think that since Wladimir seems to have a lot of power over what changes are made to Bitcoin Core, I think we as a community deserve to hear more from him.  I wouldn't even know what the guy looks like, and I have never seen him posting on reddit.  Who is this guy?  Don't we deserve to know?
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:41:33
Actually the consensus comes from the community and economic consensus.  Then last the plan was to lobby miners to get 75% consensus to move forward.  Gavin discusses it in this podcast: 
@_date: 2015-09-21 06:22:59
Already it is holding back innovation and VC investment in infrastructure.  Big institutions are looking at experimenting with Bitcoin, but they can't because the blocksize is so small. See the [Fidelity problem](

Nah but its just the general trend of our society towards more government, and women are playing a significant role in it, partly because of biological tendencies.  Its more part of women's DNA to submit, and adapt to current circumstances.  Men are more likely to resist government or authority, and that is just the way men and women are designed for the most part.  Also historical evidence supports this.

My motivation is justice.  I like to respect and appreciate those that deserve respect, and defend those that have been attacked unjustly.

@_date: 2015-09-26 14:36:47
Its good for them to be compatible.  Sometimes nodes will be incompatible when different nodes are in competition with each other.  The compatibility should be resolved by the community and miners choosing which software they want to run.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:50:35

@_date: 2015-09-21 04:04:09
Its not about authority.  Its about Bitcoin's orignal vision.  How dare I look at Satoshi's own words and then take a look at what Bitcoin is supposed to be all about.  When I invested my hard earned money in Bitcoin it was the Bitcoin of Satoshi's vision.  Now since a bunch of new people want to come change the vision, I am supposed to go along with it?  I am supposed to ignore the inventor of Bitcoin's own words as to what Bitcoin is and its direction for the future?  If you do not like Satoshi's vision then go make an alt-coin and compete in the free market.  Stop wrecking Bitcoin that I put my hard earned money and time into.  
@_date: 2015-09-21 03:36:52
Yeah well its not always so black and white.  Take a step back and view the entire reality instead of living in fantasy land.
@_date: 2015-09-20 03:42:09
Obviously SPV has security issues that full nodes do not, as we saw with the BIP66 fork.  But that is why Satoshi had vision that the stagnaters do not have.  Satoshi knew that Bitcoin was never perfect and never going to be perfect.  But he knew it was good enough, and he knew that the social interaction and incentive system was the glue that held Bitcoin together, not the code.  This is why Satoshi said in his Bitcointalk forum posts after the white paper that SPV was inevitable and nodes would be held in datacenters, and the block limit would need to be raised.  While Satoshi was also working on the precursor to Lightning Network at the time for "high frequency" transactions.  You should read his posts on Bitcointalk instead of spouting your misleading words, probably as a result of a censored forum that kept you in the dark about reality.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:30:04
Ok, well you are mad that this thread is educating people about reality.  So you need to try to insult and use ad hominem attacks, and strawmans.  Pretty lame, but par for the course on this censored sub.

@_date: 2015-09-20 18:17:25
[Satoshi Nakamoto]( disagrees with you.  He says that the eventual solution is not to care how big the blockchain gets and have nodes held in data centers.  Also Lightning Network did not change this no-brainer decision because [Satoshi was working on something similar]( for high frequency transaction, so don't use that fake rebuttal argument either.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:54:14
Probably no real downsides, which is why a lot of people are frustrated that we can't get this simple change completed as Satoshi had intended.  Some will say the downside of bigger blocks will possibly be less decentralization of nodes, which is true in the long run.  But if we want Bitcoin to scale like Satoshi wanted, then we have to sacrafice a bit on decentralization of nodes, to onboard more users.  Also keep in mind, that as more users come on board, it probably has an effect of decentralizing the entire network in other ways.  In some ways Bitcoin will become less decentralized and in other ways it will be more decentralized. 
As you can see from [Satoshi's quotes]( this is how he intended Bitcoin to scale:




Edit: Kept the last part of Satoshi's quote, because I sympathize with his frustration, and lack of time to explain.
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:11:20
There is a phenomenon where some people think everyone else must be corrupted and greedy.  Studies show that people who are corrupt and greedy themselves are actually more likely to be suspicious of others.  I consider myself a pretty honest and honorable guy, and perhaps that is why I can see that Gavin is the same way.  We share the same mindset, and his actions have shown that to me.  You can disagree, but this is what I know and have seen to be true.
@_date: 2015-09-26 03:36:29
You do not think its urgent to lift the blocksize limit, even in light of things like the [Fidelity Problem]( where Fidelity Investments wants to flip the switch on their beta program but can't because 1MB is too small?  Don't you think its a possible risk that if we delay it too long it could hurt Bitcoin's success, or even allow a competing currency to replace Bitcoin?

Great job Roger keep up the good work. Already the forum looks way better than bitcointalk.  These new features are great for spreading the word about Bitcoin on social media.  I am very glad to see the innovative efforts.  
The thing I like most about the Bitcoin.com forum is that we are free to discuss and debate all topics uncensored unlike this sub and the bitcointalk forums.  Glad to see someone competent and honorable at the helm of an important community forum and discussion space.  It will take time to overcome the network effect of the other censored forums, but we are gaining steam already. Most humans want freedom at the end of the day, and they despise censorship of their voice.
In America the founding fathers knew the importance of free speech that is why its cited in the very first amendment of the United States constitution and Bill of Rights.  If we want Bitcoin to thrive, and remain free and decentralized we need forums that allow free speech.  Thanks Roger for your efforts, we need more people like you in the Bitcoin space.

If you look at the market data you will see that China is leading the price spike with huge volume and also a huge premium for BTC on all Chinese exchanges.  Possibly it could have something to do with increasing capital controls there, which are designed to stop money from leaving the country.  Bitcoin is a good way to circumvent these controls.  Also the government made it illegal to trade stocks a while back in an attempt to prevent the markets from crashing.  They made it illegal to sell, so that the markets would not crash any more.  This is the kind of stuff that makes Bitcoin appealing because Bitcoin is permissionless and provides freedom.
