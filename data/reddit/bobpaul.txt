No, but there was more fraud in the early days. I stopped selling on ebay around 2003, partly due to the hassles. PayPal made things better for buyers, but not really for small sellers.

Miners aren't the only people using BTC.
So as the difficulty increases, miners *might* hoard more, but that doesn't affect all the BTC not held by the miners. Also note that miners need to pay their electric bills, and this is often done by selling BTC on an exchange to pay the bill with cash... so... they might not.
But even if they do hoard, the BTC economy is orders of magnitude larger than miners. They can hoard all they want, it won't have much affect on the price of BTC at the exchanges.

Here's how I see it working:
Sellers are still required to have a bank account connected to PayPal. eBay still requires PayPal as a payment method and buyers only get protection if the purchase is done through PayPal. (All of this is status quo).
PayPal acts somewhat as a BTC exchange. Sellers can accept BTC to their PayPal wallet address and have it either sent to their own wallet or immediately converted to local fiat. Transactions are all normalized to the local fiat of the seller (just like PayPal and bitpay). So if you want to sell something, you won't list it for 1BTC, you'll list it for $120 and the buyer pays based on the current BTC-USD exchange rate. If the buyer disputes, $120 is taken from the seller's fiat bank account.
I'd expect that Buyers wouldn't be able to maintain their own BTC wallet. I just don't feel like PayPal wants to be Coinbase. Right now they'll facilitate currency exchange from USD to EUR if I'm buying something from Germany, but they don't let me maintain a EUR wallet, so this is just an extension of that. That also means a buyer won't be able to fund their account and then send to random BTC wallet addresses... so no using PayPal to buy BTC so you can pay a bitpay enabled site like gyft.com.
I see PayPal more participating in the global BTC exchanges (mtgox, bitstamp, etc) as a means of facilitating their existing exchange system. That is, other than PayPal sellers being able to accept BTC, PayPal would use it internally when I use local fiat to pay for something in foreign fiat.
*Note this is all my own speculation; I claim no insider information.*

You're saying when you log into blockchain.info on a computer it shows a different balance than it does on your mobile app? I can think of one scenario that would cause this
When you opened your blockchain.info wallet, did you import private keys from another wallet? If so, it might have presented a warning that the private key you were importing was "short form" (or something like that) and the android wallet can't work with it. The warning tells you to "sweep" the keys (transfer all the BTC to your blockchain generated keys). You can do this manually by using the website and sending coins from the non-android compatible address to one of your other addresses.

But to do arbitrage between two exchanges you either need to keep a cash balance in both exchanges or move cash between the exchanges (and necessarily through a bank account). Bitcoin moves instantly, but cash doesn't, and arbitrage requires both.

Skype was an instant hit. It was released in Aug 2003 and was wildly popular by the time it was sold to eBay. You could already get "cordless phones" that were just handsets with number pads which could do connect to WiFi and do Skype.

Problem with coinbase.com is that you don't control your coins. Coinbase holds all the private keys, so you could lose them all if they go out of business, get hacked, etc.
The benefit of coinbase is that they are paired with your USD bank account, so it's easy to exchange money in and out.

Sure you can. You sell it. While you're waiting for it to sell, find a nice apt or townhome to rent. If it takes too long to sell, you find a reputable property manager and lease out your home. This isn't much different than signing a 24mo lease on a rental property right before getting that big job offer. If you can't afford to pay rent on an apartment AND pay your lease, then you purchased a house that's too expensive; plain and simple. You're already "house poor."


This doesn't track at all. Let's say you're renting. SO gets a better job, leaves to go start. You're still not going out there till you've sublet your existing place (if you still have a term lease) and found a new job where your SO is, right? I mean, you're not going to run out there jobless, are you?
The big difference when you own a home is that when your SO leaves to start the new job, you have to get the house ready to sell (which might include finishing half-completed remodeling) while you're looking for a job in the same community. This might be a more work than cleaning up a rental property.

For a fixed rate exchange like coinbase, maybe. But at most exchanges (bitstamp, btc-e, mtgox, campbx) you don't sell BTC to the exchange, you sell to a buyer that's using the exhange. The exchange just acts as limited escrow and facilitates the transaction.
So in order for someone to sell $1000 worth of BTC on mtgox, a person has to have $1000 in their mtgox account. Price increase does NOT cause a liquidity problem at a proper exchanges. There's only a liquidity problem if the exchange is fractional*. All the BTC exchanges claim they are not fractional.
\* (or in a situation like gox, where they're really slow at processing withdrawls, but that's a different type of liquidity problem)

With Coinbase now waiving the transaction fees for merchants on the first $1 million USD *and* doing instant transfers with daily bank deposits (no exchange rate fluctuation risk), I'd say the barriers have just dropped a bit.

The longest block-chain wins, and the blocks are added by the miners. This is what ensures coins aren't double spent. You can feel free to operate a node that accepts your fraudulent (double spending) transactions, but nobody is going to listen to your node since its block-chain will be much shorter. The only way to make your chain the longest is to mine significantly faster than everyone else... ([Bruteforce attack]( Good luck with that.
tl;dr - If we didn't have miners, you could double spend your coins and BTC would be worthless.

Indeed. But I guess my point is your bitcoin wallet will continue to work as it does now. If you owe your friend some money, neither of you needs an SSL cert or use this new spec to request a payment address. You can still manually type or scan a QR code showing his address.

However, section 3.8 Disputes says you buyers can't dispute P2P payments, Virtual Card, or Virtual Onetime Card.
I've generally been told to create a bank account specific for trading. So I suppose create a second Google account, too, and associate it with that bank account only. then maybe they won't cancel both your wallet accounts in the event your bitcoin wallet account is canceled.
Also, since you need to give out your gmail email address to receive funding from the google wallet, this also prevents people from knowing your normal email address and signing you up for spam.

Umm... it's [against the PayPal TOS to sell virtual currencies]( and people have certainly had their accounts frozen after doing so. Also, PayPal sides with the customer in all disputes where there's no shipment tracking number, so anyone buying BTC through PayPal can report fraud to PayPal and get their money back... as well as the BTC they bought!
**Edit** Yeah, no change to the [Acceptable Usage Policy]( They still forbid "transactions that ... (h) involve currency exchanges or check cashing businesses". And since ebay requires you allow paypal in your auctions, selling BTC on ebay seems like it would be pretty risky.

This is the big one. With just wallet addresses, if Walmart asks for payment they show an address. After the fact when Walmart  doesn't ship the product and claims you never paid, all you can do is prove (via the blockchain) that you paid *an* address. But you can't prove that you paid an address that's theirs.
Sure merchants could do this manually, signing with wallet keys or GPG keys or unsigned SSL keys, but they can still deny the signature is theirs after the fact. With a signed SSL key, we can show a court or an arbitrator, "Hey, look. Not only do I have a signed receipt, but this CA says it was Walmart's key at the time the transaction took place."

Do you have any experience with ASIC design? With microcode? How about compiler optimizations?
The CPU doesn't see the source code. It sees the assembler that results. A C source code file can result in very different assembler depending on the compiler and compiler settings that were used.
Microcode is limited in ability and complexity. Using a heuristic to try and determine what function CPU instructions are accompolishing ("this is the RNG function... let's subvert it") would require gobs of memory and die space. Memory and die space are expensive and could be better used elsewhere; ie where they might improve performance.
I wouldn't trust Huffington Post writers on accuracy in political news, and I certainly wouldn't trust them on cryptography or anything engineering related. If there's a backdoor in microcode, it's going to be an elevation attack allowing execution of code on ring-0; something easy, not something incredibly complex.

Not really. We're comparing trading volume in a time period (rate of trading). Higher fees slow down the rate of trading.

That's not my point. There's some 11 million bitcoins in circulation. The creation of coins is a roughly constant exponential decrease, and controlled by the difficulty. The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140 and with be the 21 millionth coin. Over the course of the next 6mo, less than 500,000 bitcoins will be mined. If all things stay the same but those 500k coins are hoarded, the price will go up, but not by much. There are millions of coins in the market that are also being hoarded, waiting for price increase. Some of those coins will start selling even if the miners don't sell their coins.
I said "economy" I should have said "circulation". We're not going to see a huge price spike because of the increase in difficulty encouraging the miners to hoard. If there's a price spike, it'll be because of increased outside demand for BTC (eg: from the new users you mentioned). The increase in difficulty is normal and expected to ensure the creation of coins continues to slow at a regular rate. Changes in difficulty hardly even qualify as news.

Big increase in technology is followed by a big increase in difficulty. Difficulty can be adjusted both up and down. We won't miss the 21 million date by much, and only then because by that point we'll be doing so few coins/year that the random nature of mining will be more prevalent.

My advice: unless you're actively speculating, don't have BTC in an exchange. What's the point?
Keep what you want to speculate with in an exchange. Keep your long-term savings in paper wallets in a bank vault or fire-proof safe, and keep your spending money on your phone and/or a program like multibit on your PC.

You can generate an SSL cert yourself, it's just unsigned. This is exactly the same as a PGP key you generate yourself.
The difference is that PGP operates on a web-of-trust. You get your friends and other people to validate your PGP public key, sign it, and re-submit it to the key servers for distribution. If other people trust your friends, then they'll also trust your key.
With SSL you give your public key to a CA. Everyone knows who the CAs are and trusts them; as a result they charge for their services.
But not all of them do. You can get personal SSL certs for free (2 year expiration) from startssl.

36k BTC would drop the mtgox price to 139USD. Or it would drop the bitstamp price to 21USD and then still not complete... there's only 25k BTC for sale on bitstamp.
But probably the correct thing to do would be to space out the sales over a number of weeks/months so as not to have such a huge affect on the prices.

Ebay bought PayPal in 2002, long before they made it a requirement that all auctions accept PayPal as a payment method. Are their really different enough to look at them as separate companies?

That's a good question. I suppose because the value of BTC can differ dramatically across different exchanges, whereas the value of CNY to USD may fluctuate from day to day, but not significantly from exchange to exchange.
I suppose I should have quoted both, or maybe fiat for the bid depth and BTC for the ask depth.

No, you still missed his point. He's saying the amount of BTC you owe might be 5BTC in July, 4.25BTC in august, 5.2123BTC in September, etc.
It's very unlikely that you'll find someone willing to give you a lease for XBTC every month. They want X USD every month and let you pay in BTC.
Now, his point is trivial... plenty of places (coinbase, bitpay) make it easy to setup a webpage for payment in BTC at current exchange rates.

You should read about [difficulty]( on the bitcoin wiki, as well as the article about [the target.]( 
Important things to note are 
1. Network hashrate is not affected by difficulty. Hashrate is a factor of the sum total of CPU power in the network. Current network hashrate is about 1.2PH/s (peta-hashes/s).
2. Difficulty is adjusted ever 2016 blocks. The goal is 1block mined every 10 minutes. If the hashrate remained constant, this would be every 2 weeks. Difficulty is adjusted by changing the target.
3. Target can never change by more than a factor of 4. You can see the [current target]( expressed as hexadecimal integer. 
4. Expressing difficulty change as a percentage is a little weird. If the target is currently 8, the most we can change it either way is a factor of 4. 4 * 8 = 32... a 300% increase! If the next change was the maximum decrease we have 32 / 4 = 8, a 75% decrease. In reality, you see they were both a factor of 4... the exact same decrease as the increase.
So, now, your question...
If 40% of the bitcoin network's compute power was destroyed (nuclear strike, year-2000 bug in the ASIC hardware, whatever) we would next adjust our difficulty in 19.6 days instead of the expected 14. A new block would be found on average every 14 minutes instead of 10 minutes. This would likely spark the maximum change in target (divide-by-4), but unfortunately I'm not sure how to do determine the approximate block time from that. We'd see news reports of a 75% drop in difficulty, however. If no change in computer power happened, we'd keep adjusting until blocks were every 10 minutes again and we'd be back on our 2-week course. If multiple re-targets are required to bring the block rate back to 10 minutes, the next retarget would be somewhere between 14 and 19.6 days.
If a new super advanced mining technology went only today and increased the network compute power by 40%, we'd mine blocks every 6 minutes instead of every 10. We would next adjust our difficulty in 8.4 days instead of 14 and news reports would probably say "300% increase in difficulty" (as I'm sure that would trigger the maximum re-target). If multiple retargets are required to bring the blockrate back up to 10 minutes, the next retarget would occur somewhere between 8.4 and 14 days.
So yes, I suppose you could say it takes longer for the network to decrease difficulty. While it will take the same number of re-target cycles, those cycles are longer when difficulty is too high and shorter when difficulty is too low.
This doesn't really pose any threat to the network, however. Miners might be a bit upset, but the maximum block size is currently hard coded at 1MB (and this can be changed in the future). A lot of transactions can fit in 1MB. You can see the the average number of transactions per block is between [100 - 450]( for the past year. The average blocksize is between [50KB and 225KB]( for the past year. If block rate slowed dramatically, we'd just mine bigger blocks until we were back on track... we've plenty of room till the 1MB limit.


Alt currencies have different ways of dealing with difficulty changes, but most are based on the bitcoin source code and so probably do the same 2016-block adjustment. I suppose someone could find a low hash currency, dominate for a few weeks (and mining most of the new-coins) then leave for a month or two, repeat. What would he be accomplishing? If he doesn't spend any of his new coins, he's merely lowering inflation, but people can still transact. How is this different than if he just had most of the network hashing power and hoarded his coins? If he spends his coins, then he's just part of the economy.

The public key is always known. Outputs from every transaction are always to a public key. When fresh coins are mined, miners define the public key that the coins go to. If you look at the blockchain, you can know the public key for every single bitcoin that exists.
Knowledge of the public key should never reveal anything about the associated private key. If some flaw in the algorithm is discovered that allows attacks based on the public key alone, then bitcoin is fucked and nobody's coins would be safe.
