I got shafted on CoinTerra’s scam. They were two months late and got them “Used” as well as dropped the price by 50% by the time I had them in my hands.  The hardware game is simple. They take money on preorders, develop the miners, hash the shit out of them while people asked for refunds while they rake in the coins. Notice KnC has 7% of the network now… hum go figure…   You will get your refunds! After they cash in the coin they generate. Win for the mining company (Free hardware and Coin Profits); loss for the customer (No hardware &amp; no interest on their money) Preorders are 100% bull shit…

@_date: 2014-06-28 02:37:50

@_date: 2014-08-26 23:09:32
I’ll stick with paper and fire proof safe to store my BTC until it’s been proven. When I need it, load it up. I just feel so many things can go wrong with it! 
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:27:00

@_date: 2014-10-11 12:39:46

@_date: 2014-08-25 14:41:10
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:44:21
