I understand your hesitation but don't let that stop you. Everyone has to starts somewhere and it's a tremendous learning opportunity for you! I learned a ton from thoughtful developers through open sourcing a project of mine. If you wait until the code base looks 'clean' enough for you, it could be too late.

Agreed, the payroll API is overkill for the moment. I guess the Coinbase fees for converting from $ to BTC are a factor, especially when his invoice is large. Looks really easy though

That would be a nice perk. Of course it is risky but BTC has been hovering around 800 for a long time now (in Bitcoin time anyway).

I finally told him that we'd keep his current hourly rate in USD, and if he splits the conversion fees with me, I'll do it. He did not hesistate to accept. That is fine with me, I want to help spread crypto too plus he is a kick-ass postgres DBA (not easy to find). Thanks all

I need to ask him if he wants to bid jobs in BTC or $. If he gives me estimates in BTC and the price goes way up or down, that is cause for concern as well.  Seems safer for us that he quotes everything in $ and we convert it at payment time.
