No other of the 195 nations globally contributes to global peace, huh?  Those 7.3 billion other people only stay peaceful because of an omnipotent US Government?  Lets be real; the reason for relative global stability is Nuclear deterrence.


The US government is already a distributed solution to the N-Generals problem via the House, the Senate, the Executive, the Courts, and theoretically in practice now the Military since we have a standing Army.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is a hybrid public-private partnership which acts in the interests of the people with investment from the banking sector, and under the ultimate control of the civilian government.
The federal reserve is run by large bank owners who have absolute power over the pocketbook.  There is no real partnership.  They are all former bankers with ties to large spending contracts(See Governor Powell and the Carlyle group)  They have not received an Audit, actively lobbying against the efforts in the earlier 2010's for that exact action.


Savings can be anything a person believes will retain its value.  Savings, and money in general, is all simply perception, and agreed upon use and value.


You're just talking about some of the many regulated asset classes whose values have risen for a number of reasons, one of which is inflation (the others are a shit ton more people with longer life expectancies and fewer wars, meaning greater demand for every physical asset and things like art become more valuable over time — rare masterpieces weren't rare in their time).
I know.  I definitely fear my government.  I was in the army for 6 years, so I know that if Uncle Sam wants something, there's very little you can do to stop him.  


Yeah, but its infinitely divisible, so if there were only a few coins left, we'd just deal with smaller and smaller donominations, ad infinitum.


Pretty much every government up to modern history?  Repression of the rights of the people by way of force is a government tradition since governments first came into being.  They have exclusive rights to the use of force, and they use it to promote the perceived virtues and social customs of the time.  Problem is, if I'm gay, or a pacifist, or like sex before marriage or in some percieved deviant fashion, or speak critically of the current regime, those are all threats to those customs and are subject to that government force.


I'm just short of a pacifist, so everything I do, I try to do to promote peace.  To me, this is following my moral compass.  I believe wanton destruction and killing at the expense of other nations is immoral.  I see our use of resources as a serious imbalance with our global neighbors, and if we want true stability and peace in the world, then we need to lead by example and not by force.  We use so much global resource because we offer high quality goods and services as a means of exchange.  The rest of the world can do this as well, though IMO, the reason many of them struggle is because most have not been able to maintain a free, representative governments, whether through internal issues(much of Africa), or outsider influence(much of South America).


The US government can blacklist any transactions being made to the blockchain, shut down the servers, and freeze all real world assets of any users they can identify.
This will also lead to a white-list-only internet, meaning no encryption without knowing who a transmission is occurring between and what the nature of that signal is.
Again, I know.  But there would need to be worldwide consensus on the banning of all crypto and a concerted effort to destroy it as a means of transfer amongst criminals, and I just don't believe that will happen.  Why is this Anti-American?  I still puchase all my goods in America.  Work my job in America.  I simply choose not to use the US dollar as a store of value.  Why is that un-American?  And as for a white-list only internet, no encryption future....  I think you're looking to an Orwellian future.  I don't believe it, but I can't convince you otherwise.


Distribution has to start somewhere.
All in all, I think we simply have fundamentally different worldviews. I'm glad you made some money on bitcoin, and we'll still be here if you ever want to come back.  And if not, there are hundreds of other cryptos to choose from at this point, or other safer, more traditional investments that you can choose to be part of.

@_date: 2018-01-09 00:37:21
I don't think anyone here is arguing the principle.  We all like what bitcoin stands for, and the finite valuation of bitcoin is it's strongest asset.  But without a fuctional, scalable tx solution it will continue to lose out to more promising projects until someone proves their scaling concept.    I'm a longtime bull on bitcoin, but at current levels I feel we are sitting close to it's true current valuation as usefulness.  Money will flow where it moves safest and most discreetly.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:07:44
I have issue with the statement.  Govenments only give things value in what they(the government) can provide.  The currency itself is meaningless, and in fact dangerous when left in the sole hands of governments(the aggressors in war).  They can spend infinite amounts of money with no regard to whether that expenditure is beneficial or not(see war profiteering), literally inflating away the savings of the people at the expense of human lives.  This is why people have chosen throughout history to store their value outside of governments(see gold, land, art, precious stones, etc).  Governments always abuse their powers of monopoly.  In my entire adult life I have never been able to vote for someone who will actually promote peace, so now I'm doing it with my pocketbook.  Fuck fiat, crypto is for the people, crypto is for peace.

How is a currency that gains in value not helpful to the people holding that currency?  It means they can buy more stuff with it.  I don't buy the argument that people stop buying things because their money is worth more.  When the price mooned a few years ago, I was buying tons of shit with it.  Ever since it's stopped increasing in value, I've stopped spending it entirely unless I immediately replaced the coin.  Anecdotal evidence, I know, but I spend money when it's worth more.  Period.
EDIT: Anecdotal not Empirical :p

Why was the idea of an elastic block limit gotten rid of, where the size is dependant on the last 260 blocks or some such?  Did that never gain traction?

I'm a Coloradan and a libertarian and I can say this about Polis;  motherfuckers a badass.  I know he's a democrat, but he's been sensible with his support of initiatives, he's worked very closely with his libertarian freshman counterparts including Thomas Massey, and Justin Amash.  We may not see eye to eye on every issue, but he works hard to protect a free and open internet, and is at forefront of every battle over privacy and civil liberty encroachments.  So take that for what it's worth.

Honestly, I disagree with the "to the moon" sentiments.  Rather, I feel like the Chinese may need to draw on their bitcoin savings as their economy tanks, leaving the rest of the world to buy up their coins.  They clearly cannot spend it as a currency, so they will be forced to turn it in for usable renminbi to pay their bills.  All in all it could lead to lower overall prices, unless I'm way off base.

I appreciate the sentiment, really I do, but it's disingenuous to say there are no fees.  There are only no fees if you are using Bitcoin to Bitcoin transactions, but for the rest of us, it's 1% to convert to BTC, then 1% to convert back, at best.  I'm sitting in Peru right now, and while there is enough internet here to allow for bitcoins use, it's certainly not accepted anywhere(though I have met another kid from Australia in a hostel I stayed at in Ecuador who claimed he owned some BTC).  Fiat cash backed by the local government still reigns supreme. I love Bitcoin so so much, but we really need to start accounting for some of the basic Bitcoin barriers, especially if we're talking about wiring money.
Of course,with Western Union, I assume the party on the other side is receiving their money in US dollars, which must then be charged another ~5% to convert to the local currency.  Not certain about that with Western Union though.

Still unfortunate with Cydia and the jailbreak community, though.

I have protested.  I've protested with a handful of others at federal reserve buildings, in the streets against breaches against privacy, in support of third party candidates.  It's hard out there.  Nobody believes in the system.  Everybody still votes, but rarely are people motivated to expressive, agitated political action.  Plain and simple, it's cause most people have to go to work, and take care of their families, and it leaves very little extra time to go out and protest.  They're also a very thankful people, happy to even have good on the table and the gadgets we enjoy.  As a child I was constantly reminded to finish the food on my plate because "there are starving kids in Africa."  "Why protest?"my father will say to me, incessantly reminding me of all the reasons I should be thankful.  
In short, America is too thankful for its blessings, too comfortable with its state of being to rise up and retake the political situation.  I will continue fighting the good fight regardless, but it will take an emotionally traumatizing event to wake them up to retake it.

I think you bring up an excellent point in this thread, but here I have to disagree with you.  Once the price eventually stabilizes, merchants won't need to re-price everything into fiat.  At that point, an ATM could dispense cash in whatever denomination seems most appropriate(mBTC, uBTC etc).  The only thing I haven't figured out is how you could then give back change to someone who handed you a 100uBTC physical note for a drink that cost 95uBTC.

Oh I've seen a bunch of businesses use those before, and they are pretty nifty.  I'm not a business though, so it seems odd.  Certainly makes a good point though.  
I guess my only retort then becomes privacy.  Is this person I know trying to actually steal my credit card?  I feel more secure sending money to a wallet via bitcoin than giving someone my CC.  I'm a risk taker though, and many do not share my views.  Many folks would certainly trust credit cards more than bitcoin right now.  Crypto currencies are dangerous, scary, easily stolen, perceived to be hackable, uninsured.  It's the Wild West of money :).  Until bitcoin or any other crypto currency can make a serious dent in adoption though, it has to have an infrastructure as safe as the ones we use that access our fiat money.  Hopefully we can build it.

Wow these guys are remarkably uninformed about bitcoin and medical marijuana.  I appreciate that this is getting airtime, but they joke about how they don't believe medical Marijuana is legit, and how they think bitcoin is "hogwash."  Only the young guy reporting to them on the story seems to have a tenuous grasp on either issue.  Blind leading blind....

So where can I buy my clothes then?  I need clothes but every store I walk into buys from those places(well maybe not the head shops haha).  I suppose I could look online for some locally made items, but my options are very slim.   Do you have any recommendations of a better place to shop that doesn't support that type of labor?  I don't need jewelry for warmth, or utility, or protection, so why support a luxury item with such a horrible history.  Buy a watch made in Switzerland or Native American jewelry from southern Arizona.  Maybe my options are just much more varied when it comes to luxury items, so it's easier to be picky.

I've been thinking about this for awhile, and I completely agree!  I wish there was a way that, if my friend owed me 50 bucks or something, he could have an app to whatever the company is(we'll call it bt2me just for kicks), me too, he could put in his bank number or CC or whatever, send me the money through bt2me, bt2me automatically does the conversion, and I get BTC on the other side!  Seems easy enough to me, especially for smaller transactions, and I would loooooooove a service like this.

Sorry to hear man, its hard to convince people that we're not crazy.  So far my SO hasn't given me any I told you so's, but I think that's because she understands the gravity of the technology we are dealing with.  If you don't have any tolerance for risk, you will never find the big rewards.  And even if everything goes to shit and I'm down to 10$ coins....  I'm still gonna go buy me some bed sheets at overstock with em :).  Cause fuck it man, its a currency not controlled by anybody!  And that's why I'll always love it, whether it be to da moon or to da ground.

I'd still rather buy stuff from a factory that has poor working conditions but the workers can freely leave as opposed to slave laborers who are forced to work at gunpoint.  Though your point is entirely valid; I have no idea what the working conditions are for the lucky jeans I'm wearing or for the concert t-shirt I bought.  I know I can't find shoes in any store that aren't made in china; and I need shoes, and pants, and my computer a lot more than shiny rocks.  I'm not trying to claim some imaginary moral high ground.  All I'm saying is fuck blood diamonds, the best way I can not support them is by not buying the stupid things and reminding people about the consequences of their purchase.

Moral of this story for me: Don't buy clothes from Bangladesh.  Damn, I hope those factory owners are rotting in jail.  Looks like the supervisors are at least in jail, I hope the justice system there is capable of dealing with the situation appropriately.
On top of that, how do I find a better way to buy my clothes?  What companies refuse to buy from these people?

Yeah doesn't help when I need to give my buddy 20 bucks in my living room and I don't have cash on me.  Or if I'm out at a restaurant or bar or something that's cash only with a "convenient" ATM that charges an outrageous ATM fee.  Not saying debit withdrawals are a bad idea, they're just not convenient.

Thanks!  Just picked up Brothers on there a minute ago, and it was cheaper than steam directly!  I was a little worried at first that it might be a scam, but everything worked great.  Very happy I could change the denominations easily too, and of course I got to pay with bitcoin!  Just curious, do you keep any percentage of profits in coin, or do you cash it all back out for fiat?

Not totally true, if you're diligent about where you spend you can find companies that hold their BTC.  Don't just blindly spend your coins anywhere, do your research and support only bitcoin supportive businesses.

Trump would be authoritarian to bitcoin.  Of all the candidates, he strikes me as one who would try an outright ban on it.  As much as it pains me to say it (cause both candidates would be terrible for bitcoin) Hill-douche would likely be better for bitcoin.

I know the deals this year aren't as good as in the past, but I still found quite a few that were on my watch list that had decent discounts.
Picked up; L.A. Noire, Space Hulk+expansions, South Park SOT, Witcher 2 (already had 1+3), Stardew Valley, Dynasty Warriors, and finally the Detail complete 1st season.  
So happy to be able to buy with bitcoin using actual Steam rather than some knock off site run by someone else like steamforbtc or something similar (those guys are still awesome for providing that service pre-steam though!)

No, not really buying stuff with it anymore.  Steam games were my last purchased as well, specifically a $100 credit.  I've pretty much switched back to credit card purchases though, which sucks.  Does steam take any other crypto's aside from BTC?  I have some ether and haven't gotten rid of my BitCash, I guess I could try out litecoin finally if they were accepted.  I dunno.  The crypto world sucks right now. :/
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:20:40

I'm pretty sure there are quite a few who have abandoned ship in favor of the bch big blockers.  People are starting to bandwagon bch at the expense of btc, it will be interesting to see how high their rally will go.  I've said it before and I'll say it again; having both of these chains as viable, long term chains is good for everyone who was holding pre-fork(like me).  What if we had 2 bitcoins at 6k each?  Is that good or bad?  It's way too early to tell who the ultimate winner in this battle will be, just hold both your coins until somebody actually finds a decent path to scalability(both have none right now).

I did but on the day of the fork I moved them back to my coinbase wallet too soon after bcash initiated (block 478626) so it doesn't show in my hot wallet.  I reeeeally hope coinbase has my keys and they're not lost in limbo somewhere.  What block was the first block they actually mined(not just signalled), anyone know?

Have you ever bought anything with bitcoin?  You should try it sometime, buy like 20 bucks worth and buy something.  It's the easiest thing ever.  The onpy real downside right now is high transaction costs, which is what the whole fork debate is about.

So then you need your landlord to accept bitcoin instead of western union, yes?  I think your landlord would be a lot easier to convince on accepting bitcoin too.  It's up to us to convince merchants to accept it.  Only if they see value in it will they then change their minds.  Good luck.

I think this may be what I'll do.  I'll throw in like 500 bucks or something and then, as I need stuff on a day to day basis, I'll see if places accept bitcoin and just "get the feel for it."  I appreciate all the help!
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:36:30
This might be a dumb question, but how safe is the app if I use it on a jail broken phone?  Is it more susceptible to attack than just using the site itself?
