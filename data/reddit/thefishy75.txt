You either misunderstand or are misrepresenting your point about inflation. I own bitcoin as well as a few other cryptos, i simply disagree with your premise. Also, inflation isnt necessarily a bad thing.

The dollar has not “lost” 78% of its value. I dont believe you have a firm understanding of economics or currencies.

Please go into any financial institution on the planet and share your brilliance. Make sure you film it so i can watch the entire office laugh at you. Idk what FUD means, you keep using that word as if i know or care. Im no genius, but you are certainly a great example of the Dunning Kruger effect. Best of luck to you.

Totally agree with you on inflation, but the way the op presented it is oversimplified. Its a slanted argument. 1usd worth less but now you make more usd per paycheck. A better argument would have been currencies that have experienced hyper inflation like venezuela. Its just not as simple as he presented it to be.

Lol “usd has lost 78% of its value” then “wtf dude im not talking about inflation”. I wish you luck with your gambling, theres not a chance you understand what youre trying to talk about. 
Oh no, the dollar has lost 78% of its value over my lifetime, but now i have 78% more dollars! The horror!

Honestly it would take a full length essay to thoroughly debunk each fallacy in this guys post. The premise itself is laughably ridiculous. 
If you can’t see the issue with what he’s saying, make sure you are very cautious about gambling with cryptos. That would be my best advice.

This is by far one of the most misinformed things I have ever read. My goodness.

Your “example” is a massive oversimplification of a topic that you do not understand at all. 
It’s misinforming others who read your comment without the proper knowledge to know that the OP is ill informed.

TA = charting, which is looking at visible patterns to predict future patterns. You’re talking about quantitative analysis when you reference moving averages. 
Do i think hedge funds make a lot of money in crypto by manipulating the relatively small market sizes? You bet your ass that the best ones do. 
Edit: also, you realize that funds know the most common QA tools right? Like ema and sma. If you know what everyone uses to trade you can very easily manipulate the people using them if you have enough weight to throw around (example being a large hedge fund).
Tl;dr... you truly are out of your depth. You dont even have the basics correct in your posts.

“Whales” are using much more sophisticated strategies than simple moving averages... lmao do you really think hedge funds are using the same basic strats you see on reddit? 
“Technical analysis” aka charting is nonsense. Quantitative analysis is a different game.
