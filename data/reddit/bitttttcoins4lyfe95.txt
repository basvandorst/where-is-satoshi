No, I like being able to pay my mortgage and not being sued by the FCC/SEC.

The leadership doesn't like them, but some of us in the software division have printed them off and find them quite funny.

The higher ups need someone to sit in on the meetings to comment on the technological viability of their suggestions and to give time/cost estimates

There have been some discussions, and the conclusions generally seem to be:
A) Bitcoin is not useful for remittances to third world countries, as there is no way to convert Bitcoin to pesos/rand/whatever in the third world country. So the family back at home can't buy food with Bitcoin, so there's not much point
B) If someone can obtain Bitcoin without linking their Bitcoin wallet to their physical identity, then Bitcoin is good for sending anonymous money to someone in a developed country, but then it's questionable as to whether the person on the other end can get it out anonymously. This is better than WU. WU can't compete here without being shut down for all kinds of illegal money practices.

Yes, but it's not exactly guaranteed to function every time. The pull of WU is that if you go to building X, you will get $Y. Reliability and ease of accessibility is something that people are willing to pay for.

I haven't seen this before. This is slightly worrying.
