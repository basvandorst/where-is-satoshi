You're in denial, you think they'll go back up because thats what you want! Take my advice, bite the bullet and cut your losses, they are still incredibly overpriced right now.

Just the way it is :)

You didn't sell your bitcoins did you... Your greed is making you blind to the obvious

Yeh, [this thread]( made me pretty mad - I was like this kid is telling people to buy, but clearly has not even worked out whats going on himself.

I agree, they are so hard to buy, especially with GBP - You have to sign up, and verify with multiple documents, to a chain of different sites to be able to even deposit money into Mt.Gox. 
To be successful, they need to accept payment from paypal or direct debit.
The reason they can't is because bitcoins are non refundable - once a transaction is made, it can not be returned. This is in contrast to the policy of the aforementioned payment methods which allow you to request a refund.
There needs to be a policy to protect the bitcoin sellers, which gives them protection from people taking the bitcoin, then requesting the money back.

I don't want to scare people, I want to show them the other possibility - open their eyes. 
Predicting stock values is a little hobby for me, and I like to show (off) that I'm right.

I like your dedication the the system, and I'd like bitcoins to integrate into society too. But take a step back, you're losing YOUR money.
If you sell half of them, you can always buy more of them back at a later time - save yourself some money.
