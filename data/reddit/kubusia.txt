Is there a set value for it? Endless supply? Centralised?

I guess you did not hodl any crypto in 2015, or you had some bad investment. Looking at the prices now, you didn't hodl enough ;)

It's the energy in the blood that is being pumped, the energy by bringing the blood in motion, that is enough to go to the moon and back. It's just theoretical

Did you know your heart generates enough energy in your life time to reach the moon and back? Meaning you love someone for your whole life (as long as your blood flows).

I'm using two pretty big banks in Europe, ABN and Rabobank. So I don't see a better option. All the banks here blocked crypto some time, according to google

Well arguing is the way of finding out new opinions. I'd like to have a good talk.

For example, where I live, all transactions made during 9-17 are processed the same day most of the times. When making transactions within the same bank, it's always instant. But when transferring to another bank it starts processing when it's 9am the next day, don't get me started about international transfers!
Last time when I was buying ethereum, my bank blocked my 3rd transaction, I captured the bug, called my bank and they said it was "impossible". Those examples should be reasons why even the majority of a population should switch to bitcoin, and not stay at their current bank, because it works just fine.

So you suggest even tho I'm from a totally different country, I would use another bank in another country to buy bitcoin. Well wouldn't that be suspicious? Let's be fair, there are a lot of banks, but I don't think I can just open an account in another country and use that to buy bitcoin, without raising any attention. The thing is, the banks did not make an excellent call, the money used for purchase has an origin back to my birth, which my grandparents created, and then my parents. There is no way of laundering since the money has always been locked up. Banks know this and told me this when handed the account. It's never touched except deposits  from a verified address.
Sadly sometimes banks don't give a @ about you wanting to buy crypto, and sadly in my country, The Netherlands, this was a huge problem a few years ago, and it's still here for some.
