I have 2 cars right now and I don’t even drive my other one so I just thought selling would be a good idea 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:55:52
Okay thanks for the reassurance. I’ve wanted to do it but my dad says I never listen to him and if I lost my money he would have been had it over my head and saying I told you so. But with this in mind I’ll def pull my money out and sell off one of my cars to get this going. Thanks for the advice btw

I’m probably just going to pull out the money he’s not a part of my decision making anymore only initially and he tried convincing me out of it saying China banned it blah blah blah. But thanks for the info I’ll start investing in btc opposed to wasting my
Money in a mutual fund.

Exactly lmao

I want to put in more then 2k but I guess I’ll drop some money in and see how it goes. I’ve been wanting to dive in since summer and chose the wrong path which was no listing to my gut

Ok thanks for the advice my strategy since I initially wanted to go is was hold regardless of the situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:24
I would if I could fuck it dood I only need 1 right? And I have 2 cars btw I should have made it more clear I don’t use my other one at all.

I’ve done my research and know about the technology.  I’ve been wanting to invest since this summer but have been held back because I didn’t listen to my gut.

I’ve been on the fence about buying should I wait for the dip? I want to invest around 4K and see what happens. I wanted to buy when China banned btc but didn’t not have the funds then. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:08:50
I’m 20 and for me 4K is a lot considering I work/school but with that being said I saved up some money and my dad said he would match it which is how I ended up with 4K but he said I would only get that money if I put it in a mutual fund and the account is under both our names. He had around 200k to invest around the beginning of the summer and I told him he should have went into BTC and he didn’t listen to me and went into some mutual fund where it barley makes him that much money. If we both would have invested he would have easily had 1,500,000 right now and I followed suit. I talked to people at fedility as well and they told me investing in btc was a bad idea and I should give my money to them. But the only thing I can do now is learn from my mistakes.
