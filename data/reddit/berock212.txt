If it's a bubble then a lot of people need to rethink this whole hodl strategy. Sure Bitcoin could be like Amazon and shoot up after the bubble bursts, but it could just drop and never shoot up again. Or it could shoot up eventually but after you need to sell for some reason.

It's one thing to buy something using crypto because you want to spend your gains and are too lazy to convert it to fiat. It's another thing to spend crypto and then immediately buy it back with fiat when you could have just used fiat in the first place. That's what I was getting at.

This is why this idea that somehow Bitcoin is going to become the defacto currency for the globe makes no sense.

Or you could just not use a blockchain and instead use NFC or have your door knob act as a server where you would send an signed open command to.

How exactly would smart contracts solve that problem? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:57:00
I'm saying that people won't accept it if the majority of the worlds currency is owned by a very small group of people who in a lot of cases did almost nothing to acquire it. Not only would Bitcoin most likely lead to more income inequality than already exists, but it would be impossible to convince both rich and poor to make a bunch of nerds who bought some obscure asset in 2013 into oligarchs. I realize I didn't answer your questions but they still don't really make sense to me.

So basically everyone who's skeptical of LN or Bitcoin is a shill now? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:04:04
Or you could just add the postmans key to your list of accepted keys and then just remove it after he's done. I'm sure you could easily create door technology that accepts one time use signed messages. NFC exploits aren't something you have to worry about if you're talking about a residential door where they could just break a window knock the door off it's frame. The reason why I'm against using Ethereum for everything is because if we use Ethereum for everything then if we discover a flaw in Ethereum it would be a catastrophe. And it's not like Ethereum hasn't shown itself to be insecure in the past. Not to mention Ethereum gives us a much larger attack surface than just using pgp to sign open commands. Also I'm against using Ethereum for everything because I'm not convinced LN will solve scaling problems completely. And I don't really see an advantage to using Ethereum over NFC or a signed messages, it would be simpler just to implement NFC or signed messages.

Yeah there's still valid reasons why people don't get paid daily. Even with direct deposits a lot of places still don't have payments entirely automated, usually there's work involved with figuring out how much people get paid and that work shouldn't take place every day. Even if it's entirely automated a perfectly valid reason for paying people bi-weekly is that's how the system's set up and they don't want to bother changing it.

Blockchain might be more secure than NFC, but it requires internet access to work. On the other hand just sending the doorknob a signed open command would be as secure as blockchain and would be much much more reliable since you don't have to worry about the network being congested. Either way NFC is secure enough considering you can just bust the door down if you really wanted to.

You can charge fees for LN transactions right? 


Yeah but why would you? What's the advantage to opening a bunch of channels? If you open a channel to a large central node then all your transaction should be able to be routed though that channel, so why would open more channels? 


You should look over that article again, it's saying that the more hops their are the less likely there will be a route available to your destination and the greater the chance the channel will be unresponsive. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:47:02
Bitcoin started out as a fiat alternative and ended up as a speculative bubble because of it's inability to scale. Gold is actually stable unlike Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:44:25
LN is absolutely going to be centralized, it's crazy to think it won't. First of all the reason you give for why LN won't be centralized is absurd. Not only do plenty of banks have over 1 trillion dollars the 1 trillion amount makes no sense cause that's larger than Bitcoin's total market cap and a billion people using Bitcoin is a pipe dream. Not to mention we can have centralization without literally everyone connected to one node. 
As for why it will be centralized people are only going to want to open one channel, because of fees and because you have to put all the bitcoin you want to spend in the channel. So if people are going to tend to put their money into one channel, then they're obviously going to pick a large centralized channel. That large channel is going to have the capital to make sure the transaction goes through, it's going to have more people connected to it so you'll have to go through less nodes to get the transaction to go through, and it's going to be less likely to pull shit. There's a great article on why LN will be decentralized but the mods deleted it before when I posted it so just google Lightning network centralized and look for "Mathematical Proof That the Lightning Network Cannot Be a Decentralized Bitcoin Scaling Solution"

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:54


I'm not talking about a risk of a MiTM, but if they don't pass it down then you have to close the channel and the transaction won't go through. The odds of this happening go up exponentially the more hops you have. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:55:05

I'm not relying on Raiblocks being improved upon, 7k is more than enough for the near future if not forever. We don't know how popular crypto will become, it may never need more than 7k tps. Meanwhile you're relying on LN swooping in and solving all of Bitcoins scaling issues.

@_date: 2017-12-20 06:15:25


Yeah you're right, 2-3x isn't going to help much long term. But the important thing is Ethereum is somewhat keeping up with current demand while bitcoin is failing miserably. And keeping up with current demand is what matters, if LN magically solves the scaling issue then that's great, Ethereum along with countless other coins will adopt it and everyone will scale well. Bitcoin doesn't have the exclusive rights to LN, other cryptos can adopt it if LN magically solves scaling issues. The difference is other cryptos like Ethereum are keeping up with demand right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:42

Can we stop relying on LN coming around eventually and sweeping away all the fees? Even if LN is really successful it's a while off from catching on and we need a solution to these fees right away. Not to mention LN will be slowed down by the huge fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:53:49
Why not? Sure that's limited in it's scaling ability but since crypto taking over is probably never going to happen but if it does it's a long time off then there will be a lot of time to upgrade hardware before we need 7k transactions.

I'm not saying success always comes easy, it's often very difficult. But being successful doesn't just require hard work it almost always requires luck and skill. Which is why tons of people aren't successful, they don't have the luck or skill. Which is why the whole "You can do anything if you work hard enough" is so naive, it ignores the fact that the vast majority of people don't have the luck and skill to be successful even if they had the hard work ethic. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:50:47
One problem is you have to put all the money you intend to use into a channel, another problem is if you want to use someone as an intermediary they have to have as much money as you do, another problem is if you make a lot of hops to send a payment to someone and one person in that channel refuses to comply then the transaction won't go through. With these problems it's possible that it won't really be viable to have this massive network where everyone's connected and instead it'll just be used for micropayments between two parties. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:49

I see you completely ignored everything else I had to say, good job. I don't expect a company to put 1 trillion into LN because you pulled that 1 trillion number out of nowhere, all the bitcoin in existence isn't even worth 1 trillion. Also I don't expect there to be a single centralized hub, but instead a couple centralized hubs. Also if one company was essentially the only hub, LN wouldn't be low returns. 
Now can you address some of my other important points? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:21:41

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:28
Yeah they weren't enough proof to charge him, that doesn't mean he didn't order those hits. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:16:02


No of course it wasn't. How much did you pay in fees and how long did it take the transaction to go through? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:05


Yes but you can still charge fees as long as they're competitive, giving a reason for why someone would create a large node. 


Fair point


I think I worded that badly. What I'm saying is that with a decentralized network, you would need more hops to get to your destination. But the more hops you need the more likely it is that it will be impossible to find a routing. 


You wouldn't usually open a channel just to send coins to one place. You might not know ahead of time when you open a channel where exactly you want to send your coins. 


So the lightning network will know if people are cooperative or not and if they aren't it will route around them?

Why do they need to character assassinate him? He's serving life in jail. Also just because he wasn't convicted doesn't mean he didn't do it. We have the chat logs of him ordering the hits, that's good enough evidence for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:18:25
There's a big difference between assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty and outright saying a crime didn't happen. If you want to make the claim that he never murdered anyone you have to prove that. As for my proof you can just look at his chat logs, which were found on his laptop. 
Edit: I realize what the law says. That being said saying that he didn't do something because there is no evidence is obviously fallacious.

World wide adoption is a pipe dream. Ignore the fact that bitcoin can barely scale right now and LN probably won't be a magic bullet to entirely solve the scaling issue, the real reason why Bitcoin will never become the defacto currency is because no one wants a system where you could work your whole life to become a millionaire or spend a bit of time running a program on your laptop in 2013. No one wants a financial system where some mysterious unknown guy might have hundreds of billions of dollars but probably lost it all. Or a financial system where there's billions of dollars lying around on random hard drives. The absurdity of a financial system where bitcoin is the defacto currency is just ridiculous.

@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:05


I don't see how your previous comment shows that, Bitcoin right now is worth way less than 1 trillion so you could easily have a couple hubs to fulfil all the LN network needs. 


When do they plan on increasing the blocksize? Also sure LN will drop the fees, but not immediately. Which means that when LN starts rolling out it should tend to centralize. Also another reason why people will probably tend to put all their money in one channel is because of convenience. If I want to send all my bitcoin to some exchange then it's going to be more connivent and cheaper to do so by sending one transaction with my one channel open then having to do a transaction for each of my channels. 
As far as the article can you show why a large number of hops isn't going to be a dealbreaker? If everything is decentralized you're going to need a lot of hops to get to your destination.

Yes and I accept that responsibility. But if you are to claim that the crime didn't happen, instead of claiming he should be presumed innocent then the burden of proof is on you. Saying that he didn't do it because there's no proof is obviously fallacious. I realize what the law says, it says that someone is presumed innocent until proven guilty. But to say that because he wasn't charged then it didn't happen is fallacious.

Not as bad as Bitcoin. It doesn't take a rocket scientists to figure out that the Bitcoin fees would be lower if the block size was larger. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:45:04
Why? It's not like the price of Bitcoin is really influenced by the high fees at all so I don't see why the price would go up after LN. And lets be real here, price is the only thing most people care about. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:02:44


If that was bitcoins goal it's doing a bad job at it. The top 4 mining pools control over 51% of the hashrate and it seems like all the mining is being done in one country. Meanwhile Ethereum doesn't have this problem because it using an ASIC resistant hashing algorithm so you get a lot of smaller entities mining.

Yes it is, you claimed the crime didn't take place instead of saying that there is no evidence so he should be presumed innocent. The burden of proof is on you to prove that the crime didn't take place.

If I'm right that LN tends to be centralized, it'll be hard for smaller nodes to compete with larger nodes, meaning not everyone will be able to compete to drive down the price.


No what I'm saying that if with a decentralized LN the average number of hops increases then the odds of finding a path goes down. 


I'm not talking about a HUB being unavailable due to insufficient funds. I'm talking about you sending money to a intermediary hub and it just not sending money to the next person in the line. I know that LN disincentivizes that but it'll still probably happen, and the odds of this happening goes up exponentially the more hops you have. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:44:48

You have yet to prove the fact that Visa handles 20k tps. Everywhere I've seen has said it's around 2k. Also have you heard the phrase "Perfect is the enemy of good". 7k transactions might be able to handle a large portion of the worlds transaction, and at the very least keep up with the demand for crypto for long enough until they can figure out how to scale raiblocks or something similar to reach global demand. 


Not only are you being a dick for no reason but that doesn't make sense. I didn't design raiblocks and 7k tps is more than paypal so if I could design something that could scale to 7k tps then I'd be in the right business. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:09:30


There's more ways to solve scaling than just LN and larger blocks. I hate to admit it but IOTA might be able to solve the scaling issue, or at least something based off the tangle. There's some other coins I have to look into like raiblocks that might solve the scaling issue.

Vs Bitcoin which is backed by nothing
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:04:30
Because so many of the terms for an escrow service can't be verified. Let's say I buy an car off you and you send me a toy car, how would an algorithm figure out it's a toy car and decide the money should go back to the buyer?

No one besides a small group of crypto nerds actually uses bitcoin for anything more than a speculative investment.

God damn this sub is fucking stupid. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:40:10
They say no one uses it as a currency, clearly people use crypto as a speculative investment tool. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:24:32
Because the crypto market doesn't actually care about the technology. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:35:53
I usually come here because it's amusing how dumb this subreddit is and then end up arguing that crypto sucks cause I believe that and I like to argue with people online

@_date: 2018-06-22 23:54:20


Oh look no one cares. Also they didn't imply that Visa or Mastercard were currencies so being snarky about it is moronic. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:43:05

No I do, most people buy bitcoin as a speculative investment

@_date: 2017-11-23 22:18:34


That's a very real possibility. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:28:42
Yeah you're right, I think I've been too pessimistic about bitcoin lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:24:20
Okay then how about I pay you in any number of [failed cryptocurrencies]( It's so dishonest to compare the worst example of a fiat currency to the best example of a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:20:33
Yeah that's true. It's too bad Bitcoin Cash hasn't had the demand to test itself like coins like Ethereum has. I'm very impressed with how many transactions Ethereum manages while still having very low transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:39:24
Okay but that doesn't really answer my question of whether or not the price of Bitcoin is going up because the price of Bitcoin is going up. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:10:12
No of course not, that's just extremely unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:34:28


Yeah banks also do a lot more than bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:35:19


So yeah you're wasting your money. Instead of directly buying with fiat, you instead convert your fiat to bitcoin and probably incur some fees there, then spend that bitcoin which uses even more fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:55:20
Probably a whole lot less electricity, I'd be extremely surprised if some swift servers and databases in banks use more electricity than Ireland. Do you really think 0.13% of the worlds electricity is used on banks swift servers and databases? This is a ridiculous excuse for the absurd amount of electricity bitcoin uses. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:32:23
Yeah that's what I thought. So if the number of transactions stayed the same but the price doubled then the transaction fees in terms of USD per transaction likely wouldn't go up much right?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:39:22
I thought that's what you might have meant by that. I mean yeah bitcoin is going to be improved upon, but right now it makes no sense to use it because the transaction fees and times are ridiculous, just like how you would never expect someone to buy a car that needs crank started now. Also people using it for day to day purchases isn't going to help the transaction fees, it'll just make it worse. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:39:57
Yeah I suppose that's the one niche bitcoin is good for, although the problem with sending someone bitcoin instead of a wire transfer is that once you send them the money they have to figure out how to convert it back into dollars cause like I said Bitcoin is the shittiest currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:42:25


The current average transaction fee is $6, about a week ago it was at a whopping $19 US
And I'm not trying to troll, only massive bitcoin nerds actually regularly make small purchases with Bitcoin because it's clearly inferior to other payment methods. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:45:26
I'm glad to see someone else in this sub hold this opinion. Personally I bought a small amount of Bitcoin because I was interested in the technology, but the transaction fees have been really disappointing me. So for me I'm really interested in coins that show great ability to scale.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:32:05
Yes but golds a bit different because it's not really volatile. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:06:38
Yeah and I'd take inflation over my currency fluctuating by 10s of percentage points in weeks. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:05:29
The amount of bitching you guys do over the slightest thing involving Bcash is unbelievable. Bcash doesn't seem to be dropping the value of bitcoin so I don't see why you guys give a fuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:26:41
Doesn't the price of the transaction fees depend on the demand for quick transactions and the supply of miners to verify them? So not dependant on the price of the coin
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:50:43
That amuses me a lot
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:32:30
Not just sitting on it

@_date: 2017-11-23 05:46:59
If you get more efficient miners wouldn't that just increase the difficulty and end up having little effect? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:34:50


No but you and the other 2 massive bitcoin nerds who piss away money just to support bitcoin aren't going to make bitcoin viable for merchants. Bitcoin is a joke for anything but sending large amount of money, you aren't going to change that by wasting money on transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:39:39
Does it really matter? If you have to pull out your phone everytime you make a transaction to make sure the fees aren't ridiculously high then people aren't going to use it for day to day transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:24:18
I've seen no one getting spooked by the drop and only a ton of people talking about getting spooked by the drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:53:23

@_date: 2017-11-22 22:26:57
Only 11,000 banks? You really think that the servers that run 11,000 banks is a significant number compared to the hundreds of millions of homes, the billions of lightbulbs, millions of businesses and factories? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:42:50
Oh okay cool. Yeah I don't think core increasing the blocksize will be a long term solution although I'm not really that against it like a lot of people. I'm hoping lightning network will take a large load of the blockchain but I'm not sure yet how much of an impact it'll have. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:26:25
There's no math that can show what price bitcoin will reach, or any other commodity
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:21:27
Imagine how ridiculous actual investors would look if every time they lost money they talked about how their stock was on sale. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:54:34
Let's be honest he probably would have forgot about them anyways. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:01:41
Not really, no sane person is going to use Bitcoin day to day, it's just a terrible currency unless you want to send a large amount of money. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:36:24
Yes and that's always going to remain the case. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:29:47
3% fee is preferable to paying a $14 transaction fee for everything under $400. So yeah that's why people don't use it for day to day transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:31:53
I don't know the most about bitcoin but I'll give it a shot. The current network hash rate is roughly [7854193.15]( TH/s. The antminer s9 can do 14TH/s and draws 1350 watts. 7854193.15/14=561,013 which is the number of antminers needed to maintain the network hash rate. 561,013*1350=757,367,550 which is the number of watts the network would use. The average home uses 10k kwh a year which is equal to an average of 1200 watts. 757,367,550/1200=631,139 homes worth of electricity. So yeah I don't know how they got 2 million american homes but either way bitcoin uses a ton of electricity. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:58:44
The point of bitcoin is to make money off of it. People don't use it as a currency cause it's a shit currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:22:19
It really depends where you mine, in Quebec they have a hydro rate of 7cents/kwh, which would cost a little over $5cdn per transaction in power. I'm assuming that in China they have a lower power rate in places where you see a lot of miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:47:23
If people are buying bitcoin just because the price is going up, doesn't that kinda make it a bubble? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:10:20
It's a nice alternative to @_date: 2017-11-05 18:15:03
The masses aren't going to adopt bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:29:48
Wow I didn't realize the transaction fees were that high. That's really embarrassing, just goes to show that Bitcoin is essentially just an investment, cause with $15 transaction fee it's the shittiest currency I've ever heard of. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:21:47
If you think Bitcoin has a chance of reaching a larger market cap than gold I have a bridge to sell you. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:20:33
Slowly, very slowly
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:01:03
Here's the thing though, right now the fees are as high as they are and people are barely using bitcoin. Almost no one who owns bitcoin is using it everyday, and bitcoin is really struggling under the current load. If we want bitcoin to be used as a day to day currency we need handle orders of magnitude more transactions at the fraction of the cost. And I don't see any proposed solution that can scale bitcoin to that level, I don't think lightning network is a magic solution to this problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:55:14
Only the most hardcore Bitcoin nerds are actually going to buy things with it. Why would anyone spend $5-20 in transaction fees just to send a transaction? Trying to get people to use bitcoin is a losing battle unless the transaction fees and confirmation times can go down. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:35:48


It doesn't
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:15
Why would the people be crying, their average transaction fee is still less than a quarter, even with segwit it will still probably be much lower than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:40:29
Yeah I thought that's what he meant by that but I didn't want to go poking holes into his analogy until I was sure that's what he meant. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:43:37
Still I was clearly talking about preferring the dollar to a volatile price, since this post was about inflation with the dollar. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:38:25
I don't get this, why mention that things are hard? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:23:55
Absolutely. I don't think it will become popular but if it did that would be fantastic. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:20:04
Unless you're using a ASIC you're basically doing nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:10:07
Yeah it's not hard to have a massive surge in value when you're worth practically nothing. Thinking that because bitcoin made it big that it's going to overtake gold is like thinking that the penny stock that went up 10,000% is going to overtake Apple. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:26:41
So not only does PoW waste an insane amount of power but it also isn't that secure? Great
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:45:03
Yeah me too, I bought bitcoin cause I liked the technology and cause I wanted to use it for small donations. I didn't do enough research though and didn't realize that it was so expensive to do transactions. I'm hoping lightning network alleviates those problems. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:20:49
Golds actually stable though, Bitcoin and gold aren't really comparable in terms of investments. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:14:36
Do you know investors? And if you do can you find me a wall street equivalent of a HODL meme? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:42:48
Sounds like you're just finding a new way to define mass adoption because bitcoin failed to become a P2P system. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:30:52
Thanks, I think the electricity usage from Bitcoin is a big problem for the environment and I'm glad to see people acknowledge the problem. That being said do you think that a proof of stake model could work? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:01:19
See that's why what Linkamus said didn't make much sense to me, to me he made it seem like the price of the coin directly correlated to the transaction fee in some way, although that probably wasn't his intention. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:43:40
I'm saying that the global demand for energy is so massive that the bank servers wouldn't come close to 0.13% of it. 
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:52:18
Lol many towns and even the entire country of China are considering banning Bitcoin mining because of how much of a burden it is on the electrical grid but yeah whatever you have to tell yourself to justify wasting this much electricity to gamble on a speculative investment
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:03:26
Oh my bad I was misunderstanding you. That's a fair point
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:44:41
It's not really accurate. He's using the efficiency for the S9 and applying it to the entire history of Bitcoin even though miners used to be a lot less efficient. And comparing electricity usage to oil is kinda weird, the comparison with bank energy usage is better.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:25:01
I don't get what you mean by this. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:19:41
Or you know the price of Bitcoin will go down in 4 years and 1 BTC will mean nothing
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:03:41
It's consumed more than that, you're applying S9 miners to the entire history of Bitcoin even though S9 miners weren't always around. Also it seems weird to compare electricity usage to oil usage, like comparing joule to joule doesn't seem that meaningful. But even if that was a fair comparison cars are extremely useful, society wouldn't function without them, but problem with Bitcoin is almost no one is using it and it's consuming a ton of power
@_date: 2019-04-17 01:55:34
Remind me the last time gold lost 2/3 of it's value over the course of a couple months
@_date: 2019-04-17 19:46:07
I can't find any gold price charts saying that at all. Where are you getting this from?
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:07:25
Okay so? If you bought it near the peak you've lost at least 2/3 of your value, that's unacceptable for something to be a good store of value like gold
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:01:59
McAfee was specifically talking about the crypto market, so not crypto as an end product.

Don't worry I've realized I'm a loser way before Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:17:04
Usually when people talk about the value of an asset they talk about how much it can be sold for not how many different locations you can spend it at. So if you judge the value of bitcoin based on how much it sells for, then yes it is a zero sum game. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:56:29
What point are you getting at? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:03:59
The fact this is getting upvoted shows that not only do Bitcoiners not have financial knowledge they don't have common sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:46:11
How did you write all this and not see how unecessarily nitpicky you are being? This is the living embodiment of the ackktually meme
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:03:06
Lol imagine taking this post seriously
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:53:31
It actually is. Real investor sometimes use what's called a stop loss. They don't just hold onto an asset as it continues to lose money because of hodl memes
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:15:19
So clearly I predicted that Bitcoin was a bubble when it was going through it's huge bull run, now you could just say it's hindsight bias and I could have been wrong, but so many people were predicting that this was a bubble because of how speculative and overvalued Bitcoin was it's unfair to paint it as just hindsight bias. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:39:37
There's really no reason to spend bitcoin besides buying drugs and buying something with bitcoin as a novelty. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:31:02
A lot of it was just pure luck, but it helped that I was able to see the extremely obvious signs this was a bubble waiting to burst.

Can confirm, am buttcoiner
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:39:02
The price of Bitcoin shot up really high really quickly and it seemed entirely driven by FOMO, not to mention it got to the point where it felt like I couldn't lose money on crypto even if I tried during the bull run and that's obviously not sustainable. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:14:32
You don't need some magical truly stable asset to see that Bitcoin is incredibly unstable. Inflation is 2% a year, Bitcoin has lost half it's value in a week before, inflation isn't going to make a difference. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:02:05
What does this have to do with anything lol
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:38:46
You could say that about anything with less than 35.9 million of it in existence. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:18:30
There's a huge difference between going away and replacing all other currencies. I shouldn't have had to explain this to you. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:08:52


Bitcoin doesn't have that, Ethereum is sending way more transactions and still has a much cheaper transaction fee. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:51:52
You do realize Google makes almost all of it's money from ads right? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:07:04

Bitcoin's problem isn't that people aren't using it, it's that they're all using it as a speculative investment and not a currency. I still don't know how people think this speculative investment is going to turn into a usable currency.

Orrr maybe it's the fact that Bitcoin kinda looks like a scam. You have people making absurd amount of money not through legitimate investing but through convincing people to be bag holders. Gee can't imagine why they might think that's a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:35:36


The thing is Bitcoin just isn't like other currencies, most currencies tend to slowly lose value and they tend to be quite stable. Bitcoin on the other hand has rapidly increased in value and tends to be very unstable. So I don't think it makes sense to view bitcoin as a currency, not yet at least. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:33:22
Call me a fool then cause I don't see any real world applications. The only time Bitcoin was useful for anything besides speculation was when the pirate bay was around and it was great for buying drugs. Now Monero is more useful for that.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:05:23
Yes. Besides a few crypto nerds doing it to prove a point virtually no one actually buys things with Bitcoin.

Yeah for blue chip stocks or for when you have a diversified portfolio, not when you're investing in a single volatile stock. 
Edit: Holding onto bitcoin longterm isn't a bad strategy, but if it crashes hard (like 2013 not like it is now) for god sakes at least think about selling it. That's what I was trying to get at
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:30:47
Yes that's the inherent risk of anything, and since bitcoin has that inherent risk I think that people should treat bitcoin like they would any other investment. People don't treat other investments like treats bitcoin.

Yes. DNM drove significant usage for it as a currency, then the silk road collapsed and then monero came along and stole more of the dark net usage. So now very few people use it as a currency, especially compared to the people using it as a speculative investment. I really don't have any problem with Bitcoin during the silk road days, then Bitcoin served a purpose and served it well.

Not only is bitcoin always bouncing back not a sure thing but it's impossible. Saying bitcoin will always bounce back is saying that the future highest value of bitcoin will always be equal to or greater than the current value of bitcoin. So either bitcoin always manages to reach the same value over and over again till the end of time, which would never happen, or the price of bitcoin goes up infinitely, which would also never happen.

Yes but it hasn't been a safe strategy for countless other assets and stocks that have dipped and never returned.

Yes but other cryptos manage to waste a lot less electricity to secure their network. The proof of stake model or tangle model wastes a lot less electricity. If we really want bitcoin to scale we need to figure out a way to verify transactions without requiring a ton of electricity/miners

We would have to change bitcoin in some pretty fundamental ways in order to prepare it for being the defacto cryptocurrency and I don't think politics would allow that. For example the proof of work model bitcoin runs on is an incredible waste of electricity and hardware, so to be the de facto coin we would have to move away from that, and I doubt the miners would allow that. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:20:54
The only one of those that is at all comparable to bitcoin is shuttling cash. Bitcoin is a currency, not a bank. Who cares if Bitcoin won't match the banks energy waste when it's never going to and does not attempt to replace banks. Bitcoin would be more comparable to mastercard, and I'm quite confident that mastercard doesn't waste as much resources as bitcoin while still doing many many more transactions. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:17:11
Can you elaborate on how scaling and proof of work aren't related?

The thing is Bitcoin just isn't like other currencies, most currencies tend to slowly lose value and they tend to be quite stable. Bitcoin on the other hand has rapidly increased in value and tends to be very unstable. So I don't think it makes sense to view bitcoin as a currency, not yet at least.

@_date: 2018-03-01 17:49:11
Calling Bitcoin a store of value is almost as nonsensical as calling it's currency. To be a store of value you need to be somewhat stable, no one wants to store their money in something that can lose 2/3 of it's value in a short period of time. Bitcoin is also a pretty terrible medium of exchange, for all legal purchases it's just cheaper and easier to use debit or PayPal and for all illegal purchases just use monero or cash. 
Also I got into Bitcoin fairly early around 3800 cad and made decent gains off crypto, I don't argue with people because I thought I missed out but because I like arguing with people. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:23:34

Maybe I've been looking at bitcoin the wrong way. I don't really care about it as an investment much, but I bought it because I find the technology cool and it seems like a convenient way to send small amounts of money. But now that I have some bitcoin it seems like just something to invest in. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:59:34
Damn I was hoping to use bitcoin for that. I'll probably buy some ethereum and just use the rest of my bitcoin as an investment.

Can we stop acting like Bitcoin is money right now? Until the transaction fees and​ wait time become somewhat reason then Bitcoin is just an investment, it's a horrible currency

Really dude? Are you really comparing confirmation times to settlement times? That's pretty weak considering when I tap my credit card it takes 0.5 seconds to confirm the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:16:55
Or instead of fucking around with all that nonsense you could just use debit or credit or cash, it will get confirmed instantly and you will even pay less in transaction fees. That's why people aren't selling stuff with bitcoin. It lags behind most other cryptocurrencies in terms of being a usable currency let alone being better than debit. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:17:16
I used one sentence to clearly convey my point. You should try that sometime

I never said bitcoin has no value, far from it. That being said when I bought bitcoin I wasn't aware of how terrible a currency it was. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:50:46
Thanks for actually discussing bitcoin like it's an actual investment instead of internet magic that will increase in value forever. I'm getting so sick of these HODL memes.
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:26:59
I original subbed because I was really interested in bitcoin and was trying to buy some. Then I finally bought some and I was all excited about actually using bitcoin like a currency. And then I learned it's a shit currency and people only but it as an investment, so now I'm just following the segwit stuff to see what happens.

Still companies can't rely on unconfirmed transactions. Meaning you can actually buy things with credit cards without waiting 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:54:00
I mean there's always the chance it will never go a cent over $3000 ever again. I don't believe that but I like to remind people on this sub that bitcoin is an investment like any other, not some internet magic that grows in value infinitely. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:32:01
Why would they? Bitcoin is such a shitty currency that not many people care if they implement it. Even lots of the most dedicated bitcoin fans don't use it to buy things because they just see it as an investment. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:38:53
There's no way you could possibly know that bitcoin will go to 18k, you're talking out your ass.

At this point hearing "Buy Bitcoin" sounds desperate.
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:25:09
I don't see what the point in this is, why would someone pay for their food with bitcoin when they could pay with cash or debit? Bitcoin is terrible for transferring small amounts of money, why would someone spend 3 Euros on transaction fees for a 9 Euro transaction when they could just pay in cash or debit? Not to mention the time it will take for the transaction to go through while cash/debit is instant. Bitcoin is a shitty currency, at this point it seems like it's just an investment to hold onto. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:56:50
You're right, I thought you were implying that. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:58:31
eBay doesn't deal with people's safety, Uber and Lyft do. The thing that decentralized systems like you are talking about lack is for the ability for an admin to look at a particular case and make a decision based on that. Also what happens if someone uses a fake id or photo? What if someone starts paying people for good reviews? It's easier to cheat the system is there aren't strong admins who can heavily punish you if you fuck up. And if there are strong admins what's the point of it being decentralized? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:26:01

So basically since it's been going up for a while it's going to keep going up until it reaches 100k. Also other altcoins have been rapidly gaining on bitcoin and have been outdoing bitcoin in terms of scaling and features. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:00:15
What exactly do you mean when you say bitcoin scales better? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:12:05

Man I hate these "Bitcoin is going to a kajillion dollars" posts. No one knows how high Bitcoin will go, acting like you know that Bitcoin will go to 100k makes you look like you don't know what you're talking about.

Ethereum is a altcoin based on blockchain that is scaling better than Bitcoin. It doesn't matter that it's centralized and mutable, it's still scaling better better than Bitcoin, making what I said true. Saying it's like comparing Bitcoin and visa is just dumb. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:29:00
Nice response. I'm definitely going with the you don't know what you're talking about theory. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:56:48
No one has any idea which cryptocurrency will scale to such a crazy level. It probably won't be bitcoin or ethereum that scales to such a huge level. I don't get why you will think bitcoin will scale to such a huge level before ethereum when bitcoin can't even do 15 tps. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:15:54
"this is good for Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:48:47
So basically you give me some guy claiming that ethereum has 10x worse scaling and his only real defense of that is that Bitcoin is so much bigger than ethereum, which ignores the fact that ethereum is doing more transactions that Bitcoin and that ethereums market cap is 3/4 of bitcoins. I'm not even remotely convinced by that
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:03:06
Visa's a propriety payment system not based on a decentralized blockchain. Bitcoin and ethereum are both cryptocurrencies based on a decentralized blockchain. Do I really have to explain to you how bitcoin and ethereum are similar?
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:11:51
How do the customers make that decision? The customers are just going to look at the ratings and that's it. They aren't going to make moderator decisions. Also you never answered my question about people buying reviews, or drivers figuring out how to review themselves. And after you figure out all these problems what do you accomplish? What's the big benefit of being decentralized? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:20:57
Yeah it will. We're at an interesting point right now where other coins are getting quite popular. I hear a lot about ethereum which I never used to. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:28:02
Personally I'm not a huge fan of smart contracts or ethereum. But that being said ethereum is the only cryptocurrency that surpasses bitcoin in transactions, so I just used it to show that there are altcoins that scale better than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:12:26
Yeah you have a good time of day too
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:43:18
Yes but most people don't, and I really doubt that the blockchain version of uber would be as good as uber. In fact it would probably be significantly worse.

@_date: 2017-06-29 19:29:09
Ethereum has more tps and each transaction is cheaper. That's what I'd call scaling better. Could you elaborate on how the ethereum network stopped? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:29:54
Ethereum is starting to surpass bitcoin in terms of the number of transactions while still offering much lower transaction fees and on top of that offering more features like smart contracts. It appears you are the one who doesn't know what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:27:22
Having it decentralized would just slow down the development model significantly, not to mention a block-chain is essentially the worlds slowest database. Also it would be competing against an already stable and developed product. I just don't see any way a decentralized Uber would be better than Uber. Also there wouldn't be any customer support if something goes wrong. Decentralization seems to be the new buzzword going around, and this just seems like a poor use of it. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:25:02
I find bitcoin interesting which is why I bought and follow bitcoin. Also bitcoin has it's purpose, it's useful for buying things off the black market or as an investment. I don't see what decentralized Ubers purpose is. I really hate this whole "decentralize everything" stuff a lot of startups seem to be doing. Decentralization can be an extremely powerful tool or a hindrance, you should only use it where applicable.

@_date: 2017-06-27 03:25:17
Current transaction fees are around $3.50 USD which is about 3 Euros.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:57:36
Yeah you're right, there's definitely more companies right now that support bitcoin than anything else. That being said if I'm right and bitcoin is going to continue to lag behind other crypto-currencies in terms of important feature it's worth giving up on the first mover advantage and trying to push another cryptocurrency for vendors to use. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:04:00
If we really want a cryptocurrency that helps you avoid centralized banks, be anonymous and be a all around decent currency then bitcoin is not the answer. There's already cryptocurrencies out there that allow instant transactions, that scale better than bitcoin, that are more anonymous and are still decentralized. Even if we get segwit other cryptocurrencies are still going to be better currencies than bitcoin, and the pace at which bitcoin is improving is so slow it'll take forever to catch up to what's out there right now. The future of cryptocurrencies isn't in bitcoin, we should accept that it's just going to be an investment. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:44:17
Do you have any evidence at all that bitcoin is going to go to $100,000? You know besides that shitty chart you invented

That seems like a bad idea. When it comes to people's safety I'd much rather have strong and centralized admins who can heavily punish people who do bad things and can make decisions on a case by case basis. I don't see how you could do that with a decentralized system. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:17:19
So basically argument from authority? This guy says ethereum scales bad so it does. That's pretty weak, it's just one guy not a consensus among cryptocurrency experts. Also I never said ethereum scaled that well but that it scaled better than bitcoin. Sure the fees are rising but not by as much as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:47:29
