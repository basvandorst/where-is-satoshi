People wont pay usd 0.06 miner fee to buy an in-game-super-power for they phone game so Litecoin will enable micropayments in ways that we can not even imagine, So... "Are you waiting for christmas?"

Think about the consequences of that, why a rational miner would do that?

you are not getting the point, there is no risk to run an XT node, the risk is to run  an old core node, the fork only occurs with &gt;75% of hashing power if XT do not reach 75% both nodes will produce blocks for the same blockchain

Forget about 2 chains "IF" and only if the fork occurs &gt;75% of hashing power will be with the new chain, old chain will be left with 1/4 (or less) of hashing power and blocks every 40 minutes or more. So everybody will move to the new chain.

we need a real solution not nirvana thinking about what if would could

increasing the block size limit does not means that every block will be 8mb or 20mb it means that blocks growth as needed. We do not have all 1mb blocks today

Bitcoin will continue to be bitcoin, Just because there is an altcoin that took 1st place for a few minutes, hours, days, weeks or months it is not a reasen to call Bitcoin a failed experiment.

As long as there are agnostinc miners left fungibility is ok, no matter if there are miners who gives priority to "premiun transactions", that is part of the game and have always been. Thaose transactions will eventually reach the blockchain
