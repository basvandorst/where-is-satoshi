The Great Depression was caused by bank runs....we almost saw those again during the last financial crisis.....the advent of crypto currencies complicates things for banks because they don’t actually have your money....check out the big short movie...let that sink in...they don’t have your money...if people start asking banks for their money the only reply will have to be they don’t have it...that would cause mass panic and a further spiral down....

With the advent of TENX etc type tech, does it even matter anymore?  If you can move seamlessly in and out of crypto in the blink of any eye, then does merchant adoption even matter?

Ok fine...I'll whine- I read an article in 2012 about it and said this is cool as s...ugar....I went on line to try to buy right after reading and the Japanese exchange wanted passport etc and I thought for sure identity theft....got busy with work and kids....didn't look again until last year and almost threw my computer out the window...now in with crypto big time...not going to make that mistake again...

Banks are a wooden plank across the river - temporary solution for people to dump their fiat easily (cross the river).  For the majority of us it's still hard to buy crypto-when there is a crypto savings account it makes transfer between accounts very easy.

right lets all keep believing that large institutions are stupid, don't care about their money and will totally just pull up with a dump truck and pour money in at current prices....they would never seek to use the new ability to apply massive sustained shorts through cme to build a cheaper entry point for themselves....also cme has said it will tame bitcoin (price increases limited to 20 percent) so no more parabolic increases.

I sent emails to friends about bitcoin in 2013, signed up as a business accepting bitcoin (although no one paid me with it), read countless articles on it, and started to set up an account with mt gox, but was worried about sending them my Id so never did anything....it was hard to buy then...but remember in 2 years (or maybe 2 months the way things are exploding) someone may well say "you bought back then, wow"....it is still early I think.

We need to ask coinmarketcap to list one satoshi in there as well, or somehow show the lowest denomination....many people don't understand the divisibility or what they can buy

Government can tax anything they can find....Bitcoin is on blockchain.....block chain is a permanent and public ledger - follow the money, way easier to find and tax than cash in some safety deposit box.
