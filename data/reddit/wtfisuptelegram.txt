I mean I'm pretty certain but that's why I opened this thread, I want other to check and tell me, maybe I'm just stupid and did sign up (I don't have my old emails available to check if I did or did not, just out of my memory)

My email and password, I'm certain I never signed up to mtgox
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:57:34
I checked [weleakinfo.com]( I am in btc-e but not in [mtgox.com](
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:42:38
0 balance which is what I had on btc-e so I'm not really a good indicator, still really weird

I'm sorry it pissed a lot of people off.. I was just saying that the situation is dire and doesn't seem to change any time soon.. in my opinion ever..

hmm 70% in only 3 months.. 
and still CRASHING hard man.. 
sell now before you lose 100%!

HUGE manipulation seen on Bitcoin charts
7800 to 8200 and then back to 7800.. obviously someone here is doing illegal washing and the SEC notices..
I don't see it ending well
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:12:38
7870 already! we're going down FAST now!
good place to sell before an even BIGGER crash in my opinion, thoughts?

Why should I help a drug dealer / someone who ordered a hit on someone else. pfttt
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:28:30
smart thing to do now is sell sell sell imo

you can remove the "Maybe" by hosting a survey, this is just wishful thinking
\&gt;maybe bitcoin will reach 40k according to these 3 "experts" read here to know why!
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:51:56
when its a bullish prediction you accept that they are experts
when its a bearish prediction you say they know nothing and all these "experts" are stupid
this subreddit is pure cancer hahaha enjoy your bags
