And that's okay and a very respectable way of thinking, but it's only an opinion. They don't have the right of stealing other people's money just because they think like that. What about the people who think the opposite? 
If I pay no taxes I can be locked up, no matter if I use public services or not. And by the way, those are not *your* infrastructure and services, you can't decide about how they're managed, you're just forcefully funding them. 
Not to mention the unfair competition of having businesses funded by taxes.

Theories try to explain things. You can prove them wrong anytime, if you can. If a theory happens to be true, why not to be devotee of it?
It's only natural for libertarians to feel love for Bitcoin, since it has a very strong component of libertarianism in it and that's undeniable. It's all about taking the currency away from the state's hands. It's all about zero inflation policy. It's all about making the currency valuable again. It's all about decentralization. Bitcoin is rat poison for governments, and I think leftists crypto enthusiasts don't really understand what they're supporting. It's pretty hard to see a leftist supporting gold as a currency, isn't it? They can't understand it. Same for Bitcoin.

But that's simply not true and you should not generalize or oversimplifying things. Some small companies can cope and some others do not. Some big companies can cope and some others do not. It depends on some more factors rather than just if they're small or big. 
It never ceases to amaze me how people that have never managed a business nor owned large amounts of money... know exactly how someone can become rich! For them becoming a millionaire is easy, and make even more millions is super easy too. They could even write a book named *"HOW TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE IN 7 DAYS... P.S. although I don't have a cent"*

Taxation is theft and that's undeniable, it doesn't matter where that stolen money is going to. I could steal your savings and give that money to the poor, but it would still be theft.

Michael Moore is a communist, he defends economic systems that are complete failures, like Cuba or Venezuela and he would likely call you a criminal for owning Bitcoin.

So you think it's okay to create a system to force the people to spend artificially? Sounds like mass manipulation. 
You don't need inflation for the people to purchase goods and services, and an excellent evidence is the tech sector, which is affected by deflation and still it's a very successful market.

Yes of course, stop being a fetishist of physics and go jump off a window and see if you can fly. It's not my fault that you can't understand what money is and its importance. When money stops being money what you have is Venezuela. 


Yes, it's being violent. What do you think it would happen to me if I refuse to pay my taxes? uniformed and armed people from the government would come to my house to kidnap me and throw me in jail. Maybe you think this is necessary, but you can't deny that this is violence.


Yes. They're pointing guns at me as I explained before. And I wonder how can you know how cute libertarianism can be and how utopian it is if you have never read an actual libertarian. An utopia is like the horizon, you can go in that direction but you never get there. Even if a complete libertarian society were impossible to achieve, we have to try to go in that direction: Less government, more free market. 
Don't forget that we're living in brand new welfare states where we have redistribution of wealth mechanisms up and running... in exchange of having the highest public debt in history and the highest taxes in history, generally speaking. Is this sustainable long term? time will tell, but it certainly doesn't look good. Your venerated welfare state might send us all to the middle ages at any time.


You're very naive. If Bitcoin and other cryptos (especially the anonymous ones) succeed and become mainstream, governments will try to stop it. Governments don't like counter powers or boundaries as they tend to expand its power indefinitely. If you put at risk the capacity of the state to effectively gather taxes you will see a fierce response from the government to defend their business, even if they have to put Bitcoin users in jail.
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:50:03
Okay. Good luck trying to set up any kind of redistribution-of-wealth-system based on violence in a cryptocurrencified society. Watch out, Bitcoin is deflationary and Monero's out there... in the shadows. \[*evil laugh\]*

Get your own conclusions and don't always believe others conclusions (they have bias too). You can't say you know what austrian school is if you never read actual austrians, although this is extensible to anything really.
I have lots of counter-arguments but I'm not going to start a discussion about economics because I don't feel like it and english is not my native language, I struggle a lot in this kind of discussions. Besides, Mises or Hayek would explain it to you much better than I can.

It's not that easy. When the economy crash it's not like you can buy anything and make money no matter what. You're actually contradicting yourself because you also say that companies close, right? so there's a chance you might buy cheap something that will fail anyway. Believe it or not, "The Riches" and "The Big Banks" can make bad investments too, and they can lose money too, just like you and me. Goldman Sachs stocks went from $220 to $60 after the 2008 crash.
On the other hand, isn't it the same we're doing with cryptocurrencies? Crypto market crashes, most people go broke, most people lose their life savings, crypto companies may fail too... but we take advantage of these low prices to fill our bags and sell later for 10x or 50x more at least :)

The whole "be your own bank" idea is stupid. If you want to be, it's okay, and if you don't want to, it's okay too.
Most people, the average Joe, don't have the time nor the strength to learn about crypto. They just want to use the money. Its like when you need a car. You don't build the car, you buy it already built. If you have a problem with your car you don't (usually) repair it by yourself, there's someone who does it for you. 
It's like Linux in the 90s, never got to be mainstream because those linux geeks wanted the average Joe to learn computers at a high level, which is crazy and unrealistic.

Yes, private banks have influence like any other lobby. But in the end, without the power of the government they can't really do anything. In the end, it's the government who issue those privileges to the private banking.

The Euro works perfectly for any productive country. The Problem is, until the Euro was created the southern europe countries were accostumed to devaluate their currency every now and then to become more competitive, refusing to increase their productivity. That's something they can't do now.


Not only Germany, failing countries also benefit from a cheaper Euro. All European countries use the Euro. Probably what Germany didn't count on was having to save every failing country of the south. 
Bitcoin can be the Euro of the world, but without the printer machine and completely decentralized.

It's only a matter of time. Until now there was no alternative to the fiat currency your government impose on you to use. If said currency sinks for any reason, your purchasing power sinks with the currency and you get poorer and poorer.

And I agree with you in your last line. 
Private banks want to make money like a bakery, a supermarket, a cinema or whatever. Private banks play the game with the rules that government and their central bank sets.
There are several differences between private banks and central banks. 
Private banks are managed by people like you and me, we don't make laws and don't have political power. Just manage their business.
On the other hand, central banks can print money (and this is a government issued monopoly), NO ONE else can print money. As you said they set the rules of the entire economy. They're hand in hand with the government because basically they're the same. Governments usually distort the economy setting lower or higher interest rates through their central bank.

Have in mind that most of the policies that governments do nowadays can be performed because they have total control of the money supply, inflation and debt, that's the reason that every government in the world got rid of the gold standard a few decades ago. 
A bitcoinized society would have the same effects as the old gold standard and governments would have to make MASSIVE cut spendings or go default, as they could not print more Bitcoin to finance themselves. Currently it is very difficult for a government to go bankrupt because they **own** the currency, so they don't need to do big cut spending, not to mention that cut spendings are highly unpopular.

I don't know how to explain it in english, since it's not my mother tongue, but i'll give it a try. Decentralization as the name says, is not having a centralized authority. That means it's not limited to the boundaries of any country, state, region or whatever, because Bitcoin doesn't have a single point of control. Bitcoin is literally **everywhere**. Just like the Internet, you can't shut down the internet at night like if it was a regular supermarket. It doesn't have any sense to say "what time does the internet/bitcoin open?"

A government can't adopt Bitcoin voluntarily the same way you would not eat rat poison voluntarily. Adopting Bitcoin would be like having a gold standard: Fixed supply.

Banning things is expensive. The government has to enforce that prohibition and that costs money. If the masses don't want Bitcoin and Bitcoin is not being used to a certain degree, it's unlikely they will ban it.


During the prohibition gold didn't disappear from the world. Maybe the price dropped but so what? the prohibition was bound to end. The rest of the world still used gold. Besides, even during the prohibition it was legal to have small amounts of gold (up to a few thousands worth). Definitely we can't say that the prohibition destroyed the gold market.

You're wrong, Zimbabwe had to legalize foreign currency because the people and the companies were using it anyway although it was illegal.

The whole economy that currently works under the table can shift to Bitcoin or other more anonymous cryptocurrencies to avoid giving tribute to the government.


Social spending has grown so much that it is impossible to maintain without inflating the economy. Actually, social spending never ceases to increase because that's the very nature of politics. Most of that social spending is financed with debt. At least in my country it works like that, numbers speak for themselves. So, if the government finds itself unable to inflate the economy the welfare state will collapse like a house of cards. I can't think of any country that can sustain its social spending with a low, reasonable public debt. Nope, today they're all suffering from the same chronic disease with public debts above 100% (japan 230%, italy 150%, spain over 100%, US over 100%...). We're near the peak of the biggest bubble in history.

We're just speculating because that hasn't happened. By the time the US government decides to apply a total prohibition, Bitcoin would be mainstream enough in the world and probably crossed the critical point of no return. As I said before, they can put you in jail for tax evasion, but they can't torture you into giving up your Bitcoin. You don't lose rights when you break the law, you have the right to have a fair trial, they can't make up new laws just for you. Besides, Bitcoin is much more easier to carry, use and hide than gold.

So, because he attacked bitcoin once he can't now think that cryptos will become a safe haven? do you see how irrational and absurd your reasoning is? it has nothing to do with life experience.
You're lucky, I'm going to educate you now:
**Ad hominem** is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby **genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character**, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, **rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.**
This is what you're doing. And this is what evil politicians do, using fallacies to divert attention from the actual point of the discussion attacking the person and not their arguments. Pure toxic reasoning.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:20:28
And what does that have to do with thinking that cryptos will become a safe haven? I don't see the connection, what I see is a ad-hominem fallacy.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:34:41


Not only crypto has gained value against USD, but also against EUR and every other currency in the world. Actually, even crypto/GOLD. And nobody is printing gold. 
What you said is true, but it's not the most important factor in the current price. If crypto is so expensive is mostly because today crypto is seen by the people as something much more valuable than it was a few years ago. Just look at the volume.

Just a bit of my personal experience in crypto. I made the biggest gains doing the opposite of what the people told me or advised me to do. I learnt to really not care about what people say or think. I like to read them but I really don't care. At the end of the day the vast majority of them either lose money or stay the same whereas only a few people make fortunes.

You seem to overlook the fact that today cryptocurrencies are perceived much more valuable by the people. Inflation alone (around 2%/year) can't explain the enormous increase in value that cryptocurrencies have experienced all these years.

Precisely, discussing ideas and providing arguments are also parts of a research. So tell me, how exactly printing dollars (therefore inflation) helped Bitcoin to go from a cent to $6,500 in 8 years? (65,000,000% increment). If you don't know how to explain what you've claimed, at least can you provide a link to some article?

Bcash what? look man at this point of the conversation I'm starting to doubt that you're able to read at a basic level or understand simple phrases. I said original Bitcoin. The very first Bitcoin that was created in 2009.
I have complete faith in Bitcoin and at the same time I strongly support Erik Voorhees or anyone to talk freely about their ideas and to change their mind on a particular subject.

Yes. They will try to ban Bitcoin because they can't control it. Remember that the government itself and their public services are financed with debt, and they can use debt because they own the currency.
If you remember a few years ago when the 2008 crisis started, most socialist politicians in the countries of southern Europe proposed to exit the Euro and return to the old currencies, why? because they **need and crave** to have total control over the currency, that's what gives the governments almost infinite power.
@_date: 2018-06-15 04:37:08

You don't get it. According to Austrian economics intrinsic value doesn't exist. And if you think about it, makes sense. Value is something we humans perceive from something.

Even with big money participating, Apple stocks (or any other, generally speaking) don't go parabolic year in year out, there must be something else guiding the price. OP clearly doesn't understand very much about theory of value so he thinks it's just "big money" what moves the price upwards, but not necessarily. It might as well be just normal people perceiving more value from Bitcoin and willing to pay a higher price for it. Can be several things, or even several things combined.

Well, now people need a $100k or $200k bitcoin to call it moon, then the people who would buy at $100,000 will need it to be $1,000,000 to call it moon, and those people would need a $20,000,000 Bitcoin to call it moon and so on.

Have you ever heard about how the Federal Reserve manipulates the interest rates? Do you know what the Federal Reserve is? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:00:45
In a free market nobody determines the price, nobody has the power to do that, the price is determined based on the people who sell and the people who buy. Basically that's it. 
Since wer're all part of the market we all have some degree of influence in Bitcoin price. I mean, if Bitcoin is at $3800 and you consider that that's expensive because Bitcoin is not that valuable, you sell. On the other hand, someone who consider that $3800 is cheap because Bitcoin is much more valuable in reality, he will buy your Bitcoin. But if everyone were buying and selling at the same price the price won't ever change. Then what has to change to modify the price? The answer is: how the people perceive Bitcoin. If a majority of people get to think Bitcoin is not that great (pessimism) they will be less disposed to buy Bitcoin at $3800, and sellers would have to sell it at a lower price (hence: price goes down), and the opposite, if there are good news everywhere and people get to think that Bitcoin is (or has the potential to be) something big, they will be disposed to buy it at that price and sellers will only sell their holdings at a higher price (hence: price goes up).
So that's the magic of a free market, the price is determined by buyers and sellers. In the short term the market can be very emotional (hence bubbles), but in the long term the market is pretty effective pinpointing the real value of things.

But have in mind that this is just your personal opinion and you base your opinion on prejudice because you hate "banksters" (as if central banking was the same as a regular bank, but anyway). You can't show proof of anything you say, it's just a mantra someone told you to repeat.
It's not a "false idea to pretend the gov is in charge" nor anything like that, the government have always had control over the money supply and now delegates this task on central banks, central banks are approved and protected by the government. The government has control over the army and can take over their central bank any time. A clear proof of that is, do you think in Cuba, Venezuela or China the central bank has the government under their control? No, because the central bank is governed by the government itself.


I think you're confusing central banks with regular commercial banks. It's not the same. The government don't pay a bailout to the central bank. A central bank has the monopoly on the supply of money so it's basically self-funded.


Here you admit that the central bank is dependant on the government, that makes me think you don't really know the difference between central banking and commercial banking. Actually it is the central bank who rescues private banks and covers their holes when they're in trouble, because one of the task that central banks do is acting as a lender of last resort. 
A Bitcoinized economy would probably kill central banks, indeed, also would kill their fiat currency too ending up dragging governments into oblivion. That would force the government to cut spendings drastically and put the welfare state to an end. I don't see you as the libertarian kind of guy so I don't think you really want that. Ironically your nickname is BTC forever which it's kind of funny.

The market works as a collective mind. Even if everyone poured their life savings in btc it could crash anyway. How? Because value is not something that can be matematically calculated, value is something that we perceive from something. If the market perceive that the value of Bitcoin is far from $20k automaticly the market corrects itself to a more realistic current value. The money doesn't transfer from ones to the others, all that wealth gets burned instead.

There are central banks allegedly independent from the government, others are not and the government has strong influence in them. The first ones don't even have real independence from the government as they hold a monopoly protected by the government. There's no competence because what central banking is in reality is a delegation from the government and a extremely regulated business. Central banking is an artificial system that can't exist in a free market, it's a product of the government intervention, thus socialism.

Gold can be used as money, but you can't use gold as money. Try to find a supermarket or a gas station that allows you to pay with gold.
Due to the governments interference in the economy nowadays Gold is only useful as a store of value, and only educated people do this. Whereas Bitcoin can be used as store of value AND to make payments, so it reaches a more wider range of users. And because of its virtual nature Bitcoin can bypass the government monopolistic control over the currency, if you create a physical currency based on gold you will face up to 5000 years in prison.

Inflation inflates the prices of everything including basic goods. Uneducated people who have to work for a minimum wage have the constant pressure on their daily lives to keep up with constantly rising prices. This might go unnoticed in the short term, but in a decade or two their loss of purchasing power becomes very noticeable and harmful.
Go and ask those people who can only earn a low, minimum wage if they live better today than 15 or 20 years ago. They will tell you they can buy fewer things today than before. Therefore they're poorer now thanks to your "adjusted inflation".

 &gt; Its how much you have to work to be able to pay for this and that.
It is the number and quality or value of goods and services that can be purchased with a unit of currency. (purchasing power definition from wikipedia)


That's just your opinion, not a fact. Plus, the value of every dollar would increase with time, not immediatly. I don't know how can you imply that high salaries won't exist.


Haven't you said before that is not the "number" of the pricetag what matters? now you're going back on your words again!
Indeed, it's purchasing power what matters, not the "number". You could have a bigger number in your paycheck and be poorer than before. 


I live in a southern europe country (not the richest country in the world but definitely not a "corrupted third world country") and the cost of life has increased considerably in the last decade or two, more than salaries. Actually I'm sure this happens in your country too. You just have to ask.

Well, the same can be said of your town or city. For what reason is the nation more important than your town or your state? People living in Texas have more in common with mexicans than with the people of Michigan, they're the same nation though. 
And what is a nation? weren't the US a part of the nation of Spain? can Spain claim the western half of the US? because it is legitimately theirs. The other half of US is from England. What is the United States then? a bunch of englishmen that declared war to everyone, killed thousands of people and said "Hey, now we've decided not to be England, now we are United States"? Nothing to be proud of IMO, though this is highly subjective and I respect it. But the fact is that the US is an invented country and this can be said to the 99% of the countries out there, almost always unified their land by wars and slaughter.


This leads to a paradox. Because if the US declared their independence from England, why Florida wouldn't do the same and declare their independence from the US? and what if the Monroe county declares their independence from Florida? I'll tell you what would happen, the federal gov sending the army to Florida... but wasn't it all about liberty and self-determination? 
Nations are something too vague and hazy to be taken seriously. So yes, the concept of nation-state is dangerously close to any other religion, where "God" is replaced by the nation-state itself, prayers are now a national anthem and the holy cross is now a coloured flashy flag.

@_date: 2018-04-09 22:24:33
Gold has no inherent value because nothing has inherent value per se. Value is a human appreciation. And we humans appreciate gold and bitcoin much more than a sheet of paper. We don't appreciate papers, we appreciate gold or bitcoin. So if your papers aren't backed by something valuable (i.e gold) then they're just papers, with 0 value. 
Indeed, it's preferable to carry papers than tons of gold. That's the reason why dollars were convertible to gold at a fixed exchange rate. You carry some dollars in your pocket but in reality, you could say you're carrying gold. That's not how it works anymore.

Do you act in the best interest of the people? Think about it. Do you think the bakery near your house is there to serve you? No. It's there to make a living for the owner, and doing so it also serves you. That's the magic of the market economy: you can't make money if you don't offer something valuable to the people.


You assumed it would be bad because you probably live in a capitalist country with an easy life where everything is at hand and is always easy to criticize everything.

Bitcoin doesn't have a fixed value. Bitcoin is being traded in a free market thus it is valued according to the people's perception. Just like everything else. A free market is the most accurate way of valuing something. 


Bitcoin it's been better than any other crypto so far and that has been reflected in its price by the market. 


Nobody can tell the future, but has been an amazing investment until today. Even you regret not having bought in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

I know what buying the dip means, and it's nonsense. And it's a nonsense that has made many people lose lots of money. When the price goes down there's no way you can't tell if it's a dip or a crash or the end of bitcoin. A dip can only be detected looking back at the charts, when it has already gone up again, and obviously that's already late to "buy the dip".

I'm not saying nope to basic economic principles, I'm saying that you don't understand those basic economic principles.


Perceived value is directly related to the price you're willing to pay for something. If you think Bitcoin at $8000 is expensive, is because you see that its value is lower than its price: you won't buy. If you think Bitcoin at $8000 is cheap is because you see that its value is higher than its price, then you will buy. 


What does this have to do with anything? I want to buy a Gibson Les Paul but I'm not going to pay $2000 because I value my $2000 more than a guitar. That's why I prefer an Epiphone, same style much cheaper.
**Wanting to buy something doesn't mean that you're willing to pay any price for it.** Doesn't work like that.


Again. This is not true. You're leaving out of the equation the most important thing, perceived value. Actually, there were more people selling when Bitcoin went to $20,000 than when Bitcoin crashed to $3000. Besides, 10 years ago there were just a very tiny fraction of the current sellers, and the price was less than a cent.
Is not about how many sellers there are, it's all a relation between sellers and buyers. What if there are just a few sellers... but there are ZERO buyers? price goes down.

It's not a matter of extremes. Socialism is not "people agreeing", this seems to be a common misconception. Socialism is a planned economy where the ruling Party (one single party) tells you what to do and how.

We can't know because the market can't experiment, nor compete, nor evolve... there's a monopoly stablished. 
You know, in the USSR or North Korea the government provides food to the people and they used the same argument you do: "What if the government stop providing us universal food and universal clothes for the citizens? we will be naked and everyone will die from starvation!!". Well, who buys the food you eat every day and the clothes you wear? Think about that.

Well, "free schools" doesn't exist. It's a rhetoric, political trap as you may already know. I'd say the fantasy is believing that those things are really free...
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:01:58
Can you show us other words you've marked before that turned out to be true? Please show us so we can trust what you say otherwise this just seems another ridiculous attempt from a desperate guy to keep Bitcoin high.
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:50:41
Same situation here. I don't update my ledger because I'm afraid of messing up something.
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:27:46
You seem to fail to understand that what I said has been said many times since the great peak in December 17... and it happened, many times. You speak as if Bitcoin never faced huge corrections and bull traps, because you're blinded. That's what amazes me, how blinded you are even knowing that bull traps and corrections have been occurring since always. It's wishful thinking nonsense.
You seem to forget that we don't have means to know if 6k is low or high at this moment and, silly as it might sound, let me remind you that you don't have the ability to see the future, so no, you don't know where this thing is headed. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:33:45
And that's the point when I buy again to reap all your buythedip losses. Thanks for your cheap bags.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:23:00
Okay, the famous "that's not socialism" argument. Look let's do something, first you're going to read Karl Marx so you can learn what socialism is and then you come back so we can have a conversation about socialism.
Hint: it is not what you think it is.
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:54:08


I respectfully disagree.
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:19:48
I don't think the "antibanksters" leftists kiddos know what Cato institute is.
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:23:50
It's just angry people. Their portfolio is probably fucked up and they're just whinning. They're like "im not rich yet, therefore there's a conspiracy against crypto". Pretty sad...
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:13:46
Therefore positive sentiment is bearish for you? Or you're bullish no matter what sentiment there is.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:33:33
Most of us are not against the banks. Don't speak on my behalf.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:07:31
Indeed, Bitcoin is the worst nightmare of socialism and other planned economies. If they can't control the currency, they're dead for good.
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:23:54
I lost too many bitcoin by doing that. Not anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-02 04:30:06
Socialism always ends up ruining the economy because its lack of comprehension of how it works. That's the reason Bitcoin exists.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:06:24
I wouldn't trust this rally, we're far from the halving yet. Bull trap 99%.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:56:36
But regardless of the main ideology of reddit, seeing leftists defending bitcoin is ridiculous. They don't know what bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:53:50
What discount? Open your eyes, bitcoin was $3000 two weeks ago, you're buying now at a very expensive premium. Crypto is doing terrible things in people's minds...
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:25:01
So you want to fuck his life up because you missed the bitcoin train? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:25:11
I wonder how people can fall for this scam, it's pretty dumb...
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:29:15
Yeah sounds like everybody is able to do it beforehand... wait to see how Bitcoin goes from $50k to $15k in two days.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:43:25


Well that's your opinion and it's completely irrelevant to this discussion. If you want to know what real socialism is just read his work, but I have to warn you, if you think socialism is "people agreeing" then you won't like what you'll see.


We certainly live in a market economy, but you don't have to believe anyone, you can always start a business and see by yourself how free you really are, and what things you can do and what things you're not allowed to do.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:34:14
Don't gamble your money based on what total strangers from the internet tell you. Bitcoin is not dead, what is dead is the bank account of those who gambled their money in an all time high. If you think Bitcoin is dead now... how was Bitcoin when it was worth $100? It's bad logic, it doesn't work like that.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:56:53
Why giving money to an entity capable of creating money out of thin air? Are we that dumb?
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:41:20
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:23:17
Considering that Bitcoin has been around for a decade under $1000, yours is a VERY expensive average...
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:42:43
Of course. I'll work hard to give you my money so you don't have to wake up from bed and keep on jerking the whole day. Charity, they said...
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:55:33
He's not fighting against Bitcoin, he just doesn't understand it. Just like he didn't understand the internet.
Why you guys always have to see things as if it was a war between two factions?
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:51:01
The sheep always buy during or right after a double digit increase. Then comes the correction and they start to cry like babies blaming whales, banks and manipulation.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:52:01
People being happy when Bitcoin crashes is the most idiotic thing I've seen in a long time. And save that "buy the dip" stuff please, btc was $3000 barely two weeks ago and you're happy to buy now and not back then? Terrible

You shouldn't trust your goverment neither.

Someone who believes that he can foretold the future is fucking nuts and should keep away from investing anything or he will lose everything. And what is worse, he might lure other naive stupids into losing their money too. Maybe they deserve it anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:14:10
Yep, but they exist. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:57:04
No. There has been way many best times to buy bitcoin. It started being worth less than a cent. You can't tell if it's s good time to buy today because it's not possible to see what's going to happen. Everything else is wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:02:51
What Bitcoin proposes is very attractive from a libertarian point of view, so it shouldn't be a surprise that most cryptocurrency enthusiasts sympathize with libertarian ideas.
Anti-taxation people are not criminals and not worse people than you might be. Some people believe that taxes are necessary for blablabla... and some people believe that taxes (or most of them) are not only unnecessary but also harmful for the economy. Different and legitimate positions that can be discussed.
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:54:31
Crypto subreddits have also the ability to publish pure shhiitt. This place is the most emotionally manipulative trash I've seen. They play with your fears, with your greed, with your euphoria, with your sadness... all for their own interest. Your post is proof of that.
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:52:19
It's not even a prediction. I don't predict. I give my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:43:29
That's not how it works, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:47:12
That would fuel a bitcoin economy too. A black one.
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:15:43
You can't stop it and that's good. With time you will learn why.

Maybe they're profound statements for you, but it's common sense for most people.
