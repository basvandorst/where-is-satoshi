o man i would have sent you 2 ZEC for that amount even if you would have sent me that transaction with 50 sat fees as long as i see it in mempool I am happy! i know it may take upto week but its always gets cleared :)

Dude ! fees would have been half if you had segwit address

well I use Ledger S nano (segwit chain address) , I sent 160$ with 7 inputs from my genesis mining payouts. it showed me 85$ in fees low option also was like 72$. I wanted to send it to an Indian exchange to cashout but this price was no good. so i checked  61-70 sat fees was like 10 to inf blocks. 
I decided to send it at 65 sat. 4th option in wallet " custom " and add manually. To my surprise with in 3hrs it was confirmed.
I had previously set at 55 sat for similar transaction when fees were like 550+ for next block and it was confirmed in 4th block.
if you have segwit address use custom fees. ;)
