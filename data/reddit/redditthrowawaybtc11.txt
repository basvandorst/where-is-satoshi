yeah, at the end I'll pray bitcoin stays stable for this year, so I can put in a good amount, and then everyone to the moon

This is what I'm doing since january, that's how I got my 0.5 btc so far, but the main problem is, there is a voice inside my head telling me that in the next 2 months something big will happen, so I would prefer having 4BTC when it happens than 1BTC

hey! I dont know why you said I deleted my post!! Did it get deleted by the mods? I got a notification that it's a "financial advice" but I still see the post, so I don't think its deleted!   
Anyway I'm following with great attention the discussion between you two! And I have to agree with  , I feel like my way of thinking is so close to what he s saying.  
If it matters, I also come from a poker background, and I always took a good reflection on what are my "odds" for everything, and sometime a calculated risk, is not even a risk.  
I would have never thought of something like this if I knew 100% that losing every cent of my investment would ruin me.   
I ran my numbers, I showed them to you, so you could really give me advice knowing in detail my situation.  
Worst case scenario:  
-after 2 weeks I invest bitcoin fails, I don't sell in time, my coins are now worth 0. I got a 30k debt.  
-Now the day after bitcoin death I lose my job, so I'll only get 3 more paychecks (by law only 3months in advance you can fire someone) . 
-After my last 3 months at work, my unemployment  kicks in, giving me 80% of my salary until I find a new job or for a maximum of 18 months. 
- 80% of 3k is 2.4k, meaning after I lose everything in bitcoins, It would take me a total of 12 months to repay my debt in full with 1year of interests, instead of 10months if nothing bad happened.  
- wanna be more pessimistic? let's say the day after I lose my job, my parents kick me out, that's quite an unfortunate series of events right? no problem, take 1k out of my extra money for a new place and expenses (electricity and so on), and pretend I don't have any friends whatsover, so I need a new place, that puts me at 1.4k extra money each month, meaning it would take me 21 months and I would be debt free again.  
So even if in a span of a week I would lose my btc, my job, my family, I would still live comfortably as from my extra money math I deducted "fun money", eating out, drinking out, doing and buying fun stuff, and at the end I would be debt free in less than 2 years, or better, before my unemployment insurance runs out.    
And I repeat, this is the WORST case scenario, I think I have more % to win the lottery than this series of events happen.
If this is not a calculated risk, I don't have a clue what is, I know i'm still young, but I'm not that reckless, never been, not even in poker when on tilt, just love making sometimes some calculated risks when there is a potential gain behind.  
And finally, don't know if you missed my update post, but I decided to not take the loan, but to cut a bit on my "fun money" and put everything I can save each month into BTC, hoping the situation with BTC doesn't change too much for at least 4months, but it stays stable, then I would be really happy for not taking the loan!  
Anyway I wanna thank you for the effort in your answers, I read them all with great interests, the whole reason for this post was this, seeing what are other's people opinion on my situation, and you gave me plenty to think about!

to be honest I'm trying to see if I'm missing something!! 
I never ever invest money or took a loan, so maybe there is stuff I'm not accounting for!  
So far in my head all the cons seems so small compared to the pro's.  
So it s probabily good to hear other's people views

damn son, you make some good points :)    
  


  
This is what I felt while this idea was coming together in my head.  
I won't lie, compared to 99% of the people of my age in this world, I'm lucky as fuck, mostly just by being born in one of the best countries in the world, with a great social and sanitary system, and then I have no worries, got a great job, no rent to pay as long as I want, so I always felt inside me that I could sometimes go against the conventional wisdom, and in case it goes wrong, I'm still lucky to being able to fall on my feet..  And yes, if I don't take this risk now, I for sure won't in the future, a girl will come eventually, a family, a house and probably a car as well, so I'll be much more rational with my finances.  
But again, I decided that if I had less extra money each month, maybe just 1k, something like this would make more sense, at least for 30k, but as being lucky enough to have at least 3k extra each month after paying everything, and if one month I wanna be cheap, not eating out at work and buying less games that I don't have the time to play, I could even put more, so I think that I'll just put everything I can each month after paying absolutely everything else, and in less than 8-9 months I will have put the same amount I would have borrowed now.  
Let's just hope at least for the next 4 months it stays stable =D . 
Thank you again for your input, it really struck me, so much similar to my thoughts!

I wouldn't sell probably, meaning that if the dips are because of the usual FUD and stuff like that, I'm strong on HODLING, but ofc if something major happens (I dont know, first 51% attack or tether happens to be a scam or big stuff that completly destroys btc) then yeah I would try to sell but I think everyone would so I don't think our orders would go through

Happy HODLING to you, let's hope to see each other on the moon!!!!!!!
