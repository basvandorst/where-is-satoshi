Gemini also let's you send BTC for free to other wallets. It's way better, just takes forever to get verified.

Took me a month to get verified. Sent 2 emails, not sure if it helped. I got the same reply "we're working on it"

More volume is  good no matter how dumb people are. More volume = less volatility. Robinhood is making lots of money by encouraging people to day trade. They make money off the spread, by taking the opposite position since 90% of the nubs get rekt, and by collecting interest on your money.

Im us citizen living in OZ as well. You have to use your US bank account for Coinbase. It's way better anyway because most of the banks in OZ are blocking people from crypto. Because nanny state, bro. Wire from your oz bank to US and deposit into coinbase. Btw I recommend Gemini, because you won't need to wait 10 days to have your bitties.

Who cares. Bitcoin is here to take Visa and banks out of the picture anyway.

He said he knows it will crash and that he's willing buy a 5 year put, but then he says he knows nothing about it. Old man's going senile.

I think we're in the first sell off in the institutional investor section. Then we will moon when LN is released and merchants adopt en masse in 2018, then we'll take the plunge.

Seems like kidnapping people who hodl crypto is a lot more profitable and less risky. You are effectively your own bank, I expect to hear about more kidnappings in the future.

I bought some 3 months ago around $4k, along with top 5 altcoins (not btrash). My life has changed because now I obsessively check prices, Reddit, twitter every hour or so. Financially nothing changed because I'm about that HODL life.

In Australia we can pay all bills using Bitcoin as well through livingroomofsatoshi.com

Lol at the chart of merchant adoption, where is this data from? What about all of the ones in Japan and South Korea? Also BTC just got mainstream a couple of month ago, I'm sure 2018 will bring tons of merchants accepting crypto as well as a lot of p2p sales like property, it just makes so much sense.
Amazon's highest amount of orders in a day was 26million, they pay .30 cents per order in merchant fees, not to mention all the charge backs and bs they have to deal with, if this was through crypto they could easily save 8million per day. Same for other companies that do a ton of merchant processing, like Uber.

I remember FUD articles about Google, calling it a fad, etc. back in the early 2000's when it was going parabolic. It's lolzy that people compare btc to Facebook and Myspace, they should be comparing it to the internet, it's decentralized, not a company that will fold one day or sell out.

I tried to get my GF on ConBase and their Id verification was down, so she couldn't deposit, so we switched to Gemini, and still waiting 6 days to get verified lol. I guess they use the same shitty verification app that can't scale.

Lol what a shit article. Bullshit: gold is highly liquid and borderless. Try transporting $15,000 in gold, not only will you have to pay for transportation and handling, but you will be stopped and taxed at each border, also take that $15k bar and try to buy a car, they may accept it but it will be at a big loss to you because the person will have to physically take the bar to a place to convert it to fiat, which is not only a huge hassle, but he will have to pay fees and take the risk of carrying this big hunk of shiny metal. Also have fun trying to buy something for $100 using your gold bar, wtf you gonna do shave some gold off into a bag and weigh it? Yea, it's not liquid at all.
Bullshit: gold is secure because you can claim insurance if you get robbed unlike crypto which can be hacked. So now you're paying insurance yearly to cover your gold, this will greatly cut into your profits, if any. For crypto, your insurance is buying a hard ware wallet or paper wallet... Simple. 
Gold's intrinsic value is coming mostly from the jewelry industry, which has no value at all aside from idiots thinking shiny things are worth some arbitrary amount and is definitely a bubble. Saying that gold will always maintain it's value is bullshit.

Everytime I watch a gangster or heist movie, and I see all the cash they have to launder I always think, lol noobs should go on localbitcoins and convert all that cash. Also makes me wonder how much of that is going on already.
