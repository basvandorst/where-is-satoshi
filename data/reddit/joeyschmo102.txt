Then you don't understand it or let your ego get in the way of your investing. Either way, have fun with your traditional stock and bond investing

Just use whatever price is on the exchange your buying from, as long as it's a reputable exchange.

A. So you have nothing better to do with your time than to troll Bitcoin Reddit? Seriously? That's kinda sad
B. Bitcoin is meant predominantly as a store of value, and secondarily a median of exchange. I think it's been a store of value quite well. Google bitcoin log chart; I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about. 
It is one of the fastest appreciating assets ever. Wouldn't you want to have, even slight exposure to that, just based on that fact? If not, what about the network. Granted, the amount of merchants accepting bitcoin is quite low. But you have never ever seen a organic currency grow. No one has. For the past couple hundreds of years, and correct me if I'm wrong, currency has always been issued. You have to keep that in mind, that it cannot be accepted by everyone over night like traditional Fiat, it has to organically grow it's base. 
What about having the power to transact across the globe with pretty much anyone, without explicitly trusting a 3rd party. 10 minutes price can't fluctuate that much, you could transact quicker, with less surveillance watching than the traditional banking system. 
Or what about the 1 billion dollars moved for just $700. Approximately a hundredth of bezos wealth moved in 10 minutes for under 1000 is pretty crazy, without any paper work or regulation. 
Phones about to die. But really curious as to what you say about all that. Also that it's fungible, and can't be counterfeit like gold. Or has lost 99% of it's value like the dollar, causing people to speculate in order to pay for retirement instead of exercising prudent investing.

Actually, I'm a Math major and Econ minor, but please, do tell me how I don't know any economics. As for a store of value/ too volatile argument, I would again refer you to the log BTC chart, as it's easy to see that volatility has been decreasing. Look at nearly any volatility indicator you want, and compare from 2014 to now, and the frequency at which you had large volatility. You'll see BTC, as any asset, volatility decreases as it grows, as you have more people buying and selling, and each person's reasons and the price at which they place their bids is different, ironing out the volatility. Crazy how many people I have to explain such a simple concept to. Something who's price range is, lets take a penny stock, is almost always going to be more volatile than a large blue Chip stock. It simply takes less $ to move, but as you grow, this becomes less and less of a issue. 
You state it's about 'rate', but never specify rate of what? Your argument being that since inflation, targeted, is 2% which is a small rate, that that's fine? Have you any idea the long term consequences this has, especially in fueling bubbles? Think logically. The fed says they will for now, and presumably forever, target 2% to stimulate spending, and therefore growth. Losing 2% a year, would you keep any savings? No, you would be forced to go out and speculate. This is literally part, I said part, of why they cut rates after the system starts to shutter a little. Not only do you introduce new money which has to find some place to sit, but also you devalue the existing, causing a compounding problem. 
I should have specified golf currency. Heres what I found after 2 seconds of googling. 
Or just Google "counterfeit gold bullion" or any derivation there of. It's a real problem, with people placing lead inside bars to achieve the same weight. You cant forge BTC, you literally can't. Also, gold only has a degree of fungibility. The quality, nuesmatic value, markings, etc, make it inferior to Bitcoin as bitcoin is completely fungible. 1 bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin. 
I'm a maximalist, or at least a large part. Yes, most alt coins are crap. But bitcoin has real value because it's out of government hands. It's outside the system. It's not going to completely replace fiat, and I think your foolish if you believe that. Of course governments won't let it, but it can and will take gold's spot as a hedge, only it will be better. 
I don't think you understand block chain as well as you think you do, because if you would, you'd quickly realize that it's largely inefficient, and a private server can do it's job but a million times quicker, cheaper, with less hassle, and easier maintenance.

Somebody got rekt lol

Funnily, I have a metric that shows extreme volatility in late 2020/ 2021. Now the only guess is up or down. Also, the halvening is near that time too.

I don't think you get how arbitrage works...

Google supply and demand. Should be pretty intuitive...
