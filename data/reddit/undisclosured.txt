Yes, but the point still stands that everything is built on debt. All fiat currency is based on debt. JFK was the last president (if I remember correctly) to attempt issuing [some] non-debt based currency.

Of course, if it was proportionally distributed, there would be no reason for them to print more money in the first place. They print money because it gives them the power to redistribute wealth/resources as they want. 
This is why everything is not “inflation adjusted”. The moment inflation happens, prices rise, but wages often stay the same. Therefore workers, in general, are getting ripped off. Only the smart workers that demand a pay increase at the same rate inflation are not getting screwed.

Totally agree. Have worked on Wall Street as in intern...100% of those suits could give two shits about anything but money. They’re just salespeople that add zero value to anyone but themselves. 
This entire industry has tried to monopolize the concept of investing. Truly want to invest? Invest in yourself, your skills or your own property. Don’t give your money to someone else.

Agreed. If people had the courage to do that then programmers/diy'rs wouldn't need to invest all their time in these alternatives. But...they don't. The elite have made the machine too strong. They make it about democrat vs republican, men vs women, etc...while they dominate the world and steal all of the wealth. Same story, different year.

This is pretty cool. I'm happy to take my spare change and convert it to $10-20 in Bitcoin occasionally...that money was only going to be lost in my car/couch cushions anyway XD

Fiat is actually the solution if the goal is to stop other people from hoarding. Because the government can just inflate and hoarders instantly lose a percentage of their saved money.
It sounds like you want both of the best sides...to prevent people from hoarding but also to stop the government from having control. You can't do both without two different instruments. Hence...bitcoin, gold, fiat, etc. People will always hoard. The goal of BitCoin isn't to stop others from hoarding, the goal is to give people an alternative.

I think libertarians generally point to charitable organizations as the solution instead of public services. Charity = optional, inflation = forced. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:29:48
To add onto this...nobody really knows how much anyone owns in terms of BTC. Banks, governments and courts cannot force any individual with BTC to do anything with it because there's no solid way to prove current possession/ownership in the first place, without complete/honest cooperation of the potential owner.
A true analysis of ownership would take many many hours of expert analysis of transactions, a persons activity (like web browsing history + video footage) and even then, that does not offer a substantial conclusion, because BTC is lost/stolen often and can be moved quickly/easily. 
It's very difficult to prove when/how someone bought it, when/how someone sold it and who was involved in those transactions. Sure, there's the blockchain, but that just shows when and how much was moved. Says nothing about...from whom, to whom, what was exchanged for it (if anything), how much was exchanged, and the reasoning for the movement. If anonymity is desired, it can be achieved with less effort than opening a new bank account at a local bank.
With USD...good luck accomplishing that. Unpaid debts? Garnished. Unpaid taxes? Taken. Divorce? Split. Lawsuits? Frozen. 
I'm not saying BTC should be the solution to these things. In other words, don't be an asshole. I'm saying it's a solution that adds privacy to money in a way that hasn't existed before. Money that cannot be taken from someone is a fairly incredible idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:51:29
In the short term yes, in the long term, no. The largest beneficiaries of inflation are the financial industry and governments.

I don't know how you can think that. People can essentially handle all of their lifes tasks from a mobile phone now. 20 years ago people relied on landlines and "apps" were what you bought in a restaurant. There are massive amounts of developers building incredible new things daily, including tools to improve development within itself. So...10k years? This could be accomplished inside of 12 months if one company devoted some reasonable resources to it.

You're talking about risk as being impractical. But Bitcoin is easy to use with a high level of anonymity (somewhat effortlessly if someone understands how it works). Plus Bitcoin and taxes are completely separable things and using Bitcoin without consideration of taxes makes it rather convenient/practical.
Someone's view of taxes (downside) and their view of benefit (upside) will determine the risk/reward decision they are willing to take. If a person believes in his/her government and the benefit of taxes, the'll pay the the taxes and there is no risk to consider. If they don't believe in gov't/taxes, then they might be willing to take more risk and not pay them. Still, we're talking about fractions of risk because it's so small. And in the very small chance that someone did get caught for making a few bucks, the fees would be insignificant. So it absolutely does depend on that persons view of taxes. 
Also there is another consideration. People view bitcoin as a currency. When people travel abroad, often they exchange for other currencies (EUR, USD, CAD, AUD, etc) to buy items in that local country. Nobody thinks "if one currency rises in value relative to the other currency, then jeeze I will probably owe taxes!" they just see it as a way to buy things. Same with Bitcoin in many people's eyes. It's another currency use to buy things. 
So yes, it totally depends on ones view of taxes and money in general. And it's practical to use it in various ways or else people would not use it.

Depends entirely on one's view of taxes.
Some might not think it's bitcoins problem what external things are imposed on it. In other words, if taxes are not important to a person, then bitcoin is *more* practical than otherwise.

Bitcoin tests a lot of differing philosophies at the same time. 
I think of *"Greed, for the lack of a better word, is good."*
There's no right or wrong way to use bitcoin. It does not have a purpose, just like a rock does not have a purpose except for the way that we *choose* to use it, which gives it purpose. Even if it *is/was* intendend for one thing, if someone uses it differently, that's cool too. Nobody's evil for that one time they use a car key to open a paper envelope. Not the intended use, but hell, it works.
Hodlers have their place like anyone else that uses BTC in other ways.
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:57:36
Not sure what you mean. I don't think BTC has a huge institutional following yet. Sure, there's a small handful. But I think if a lot of institutions were investing or speculating, the price would be over $100k by now.

It depends on how it's utilized. If you're forex trading...you're using money to invest in changing margins of value between two assets. If you're just tossing it in a bank account to stack resources/cash, then it's not investing.
However, with bitcoin, it *can be* investing to acquire and hodl...but now I'm not sure why exactly the variance. Cash is not a commodity, but bitcoin is. My brain hurts.

For a flash of a second. And why would someone pay a higher price than market price (all else held equal)...?
True market manipulation takes a huge amount of money, is often very risky, but when it pays, good god it can pay huge. But people get crushed often from trying to pull stunts.
My knowledge is more in stocks/bonds than crypto. It's hard to know what's really going on in crypto.

Smuggling that much cash is very difficult. You would need small denominations of cash because we’re talking poor people that usually don’t have thousands of dollars laying around, so $10 and $20 bills. You would need a suitcase of cash at minimum to make it worth it. 
Then, where will you cross the border? Immigration will confiscate it, either legally or illegally. You could be smart and try to cross the boarder off the beaten-path. But, now you’re breaking the law and will most likely face gangs/thieves and crooked police along the way, that’s if their military doesn’t catch you. And we’re not even talking about the challenge of actually doing business to exchange all of this money. 
All of this stuff requires a lot of money and is super risky. Dealing in Bitcoin is much easier and carries less risk. Dealing with cash is terrifying in less secure countries.

If you believe that and you do not believe that the world has some form of centralized/secret powerful elite group that has influence in multiple central banking systems. 
Reading a history of banking will show you how central banks operate with much less transparency then often believed. Maybe you already know that, just saying.
