There is an option to create a segwit wallet when creating a new wallet

Very easy to use. Looks like [this]( You can scan qr codes with it and such and set custom fees, I dont have any problems with it.

Futures are cash settled and no actual btc is traded. Should have no impact on the price.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:51:13
well then no transactions with 0 fees would carry through right? Then there is practically a minimum fee, which is set by the nodes

Surely it is applicable if it is not infinite?

So he bought a coffee for 1900 sat and paid 546 sat in fees? Or am I looking at this wrong? An improvement for sure, but that is still almost 30% in fees which seems like a lot.

Why are you so negative on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:28:02
That is a possibility. It could also be a revolution in money usage on par with adoption of the television, radio, and banking. In which case we would be in the very early stages of adoption.
I dont think focusing on the price is the best thing to do, instead you should focus on adoption rate.

These are psycological barriers, common in all types of trading, nothing manipulative about it

What's the transaction speed / per second on the testnet?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:02
Dont think any have lightning support yet. I use Electrum on Linux and it is very nice.

I was thinking of giving away 1mbtc each for some family members for christmas.. but the minimum fee for such a transaction to each wallet would be 0.7 mbtc, meaning when they swiped it from their paper wallet they would have to pay the same amount ish, meaning they will only be left with 0.3 mbtc, and the total cost for me will be 1.7 mbtc...
I will not be giving away bitcoin if the fees are going to be this high, will the fees decrease in the future? (before christmas..) or will I have to wait for Lightning? When is lightning going to be available in that case? 
Any other way to give btc? guess I could make a coinbase account for them.. but that seems dumb.
e: Also will Lightning Network even work with paper wallets? Dont they have to be active wallets?

Someone has to want to buy at the price you are offering

They have been available in the nordic countries for years now (Bitcoin XBT). I have around 25% of my stocks portefolio in it :)

It's actually very similar to English, and google auto translate works well with it

Anyone know how many transactions per second the testnet is capable of / doing right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:02:07
[Here]( is the article, it's a good read, and also talks about the semi Norwegian Iota
[Here]( is another article about the power consumption of bitcoin.
[Here]( is an article about bitcoin costing more than 100k NOK, a big milestone in Norway.
[Here]( is one about the US striking down on ICOs.
Thanks to the mods for approving my post :)

You gotta figure out what exchange you bought them on, go through your old emails. Sounds like they could still be on the exchange. Let's hope it was not Mt Gox

Look at all the "legit" people replying, they all have only 1 tweet and are new accounts.

My setup is 40% in funds, 22% in stocks, 18% in housing savings (special account), 12% in savings/reserve, 3% in crypto, and some in spending. This is probably not the typical setup for users, and I'd probably like more like 7% in crypto.
Having your entire savings in crypto is very risky, but it's your money, and I feel it will pay off.
