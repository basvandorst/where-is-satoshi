Used Circle weekly... There isn't something as easy to use as Circle was... This blows. Hope Core and small blockers are happy... Sad day indeed
“The story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers, while mainstream companies are using this technology,” Mr. Allaire said of bitcoin. “We’ve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward.”

This is what you're missing: “The story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers, while mainstream companies are using this technology,” Mr. Allaire said of bitcoin. “We’ve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward.”

We actually know that 8mb will work today... in four years we'll be ok with at least 100mb blocks. Again, 2mb was so 2 years ago. We need a larger BlockSize ASAP... SegWit does not show signs of activating, TXs keep coming ( 23k as of this writing ) and we just stay here and debate nothing. How long can this last? It's been going on for 4 years now... Will Cores combined egos bring down this network?

2mb is so 2 years ago. Wouldn't an 8mb increase with a doubling every 4 years work better?

Call it whatever you want, we as a community have a problem if people can't use Bitcoin. How was your transaction with Bitcoin? My first ever TX got confirmed within 5 min. I'm reading posts and have experienced waiting time of 1 day +... I don't think this is what we want from Bitcoin.

That escalated quickly
