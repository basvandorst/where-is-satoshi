The current implementation doesn't work for that purpose because you cant create or destroy bitcoin

Your best bet is probably to hire someone to build a website for you. Are you trying to make a streaming site or a video repository?

or maybe you just want pizza? People buy cars and electronics knowing full well that within a few months they will be outdated and worth far less.

Seeing as how bitcoin is naturally deflationary and 100% electronic, there is absolutely no reason to have a bitcoin bank.

I'm anti capitalist and I like Bitcoin because it's a private way of making transactions.  I don't believe it's subversive in the least. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:22:55
Maybe next time you'll know better than to buy high
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:49:34
it doesn't answer your question, but here's a good fact sheet
EDIT: it does actually
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:40:53
Some people use bitcoin out of principle. They don't like using a government controlled currency. Some people use bitcoin because with some preparation and by jumping through a few hoops, you can make it effectively anonymous. You can get bitcoin by buying them from someone who owns bitcoin, either personally or through an exchange like MtGox, or by mining them. Mining bitcoin is a little complicated, but basically, the way bitcoin works is it needs computers to verify transactions to make sure they are legit. The people that run the computers that verify transactions are rewarded with bitcoin their computers "find" when verifying the transaction that weren't in circulation previously. You can also make bitcoin from mining by asking for a fee when verifying transactions. People willing to pay the fee will get their transactions verified first so they don't have to wait in line as long.

When communists talk about private property and when everyone else talks about private property, they mean two different things. When socialists talk about private property,  they mean private property of the means of production, that is to say things like factories and intellectual property. Things that are used to produce commodities and aren't operated by single person (like say, a shovel).
