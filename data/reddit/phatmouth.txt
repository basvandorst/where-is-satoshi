I am joining Reddit just to comment on this post.  I have been a lurker for many years but my lack of a proper understanding of English spelling and punctuation makes me a target lol.
First I will tell you about me.  I have ran a successful insurance brokerage, sold my book of business for a few bucks (more then $20k). I'm currently a Sales Banker for a large unnamed financial institution and I program in 6 different languages.  I have also ran a not so successful online magazine just for fun. 
Now I have moved into an industry that is still in its infancy and is declared "High Risk" by some financial institution's.  This means that I pay 5%-7% per a transaction and this is why I have a vested interest in this conversation.
Now that I have said all that, it's shocking how limited this topic is. You are not alienating your customer any more then businesses that take only PayPal.  I am working to run in the same direction and this is what I have found, hope it helps.
By using coin.mx as PayPal alternative your customer can still use their CC or Dbt to buy their BTC and thus you are adding just one small step to buying your product with CC.  Use Bitpay as your payment gateway and presto best of both worlds.
There are some downs.  coin.mx has a couple of odd steps to use your card and not sure of the turnaround but this is a step in the right direction rather than saying you're leaving your customers stranded on a desert island during a zombie apocalypses by not taking CC.
Now if you don't mind I am going to go spend my time making this a reality rather than bash people with ignorance.
TY.
