gridcoin has a bet against that and is quite tightly bound to scientific computations.
If you are the first one able to circumvent the grid, show us and earn the reward! :)

ok, fair perspective :)
do you think scrypt is secure? Gridcoin relies on proof-of-work for network security as well.
evidence for computational participation is cryptographically factored into the miner-process in addition to scrypt, via skein, groestl and cubehash (details see whitepaper

I too have had cancer in my family. I want all people to wake up and look for ways out. Gridcoin has plans to further fund health related research projects besides its devotion in putting massive computational efforts to scientific work.
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:41:22
I didn't explain the whole picture:
in order to submit your computation, you hash your credit-signature and CPID etc
and use the security of the PoW-network to validate your contribution :)
CPU-only miners therefore send a small TX called beacon in the background to verify their claim. so security still is as strong as scrypt, skein, groestl, cubehash
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:27:46
why dont you attempt to break it?
the work has to be accepted by distributed boinc network
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:05:20
and even more so if Gridcoin completes implementation of Distributed-Proof-of-Research

Where did you get this info? Everyone can run a decentralized credit-node, BOINC is a decentralized network of volunteers who aim to compute scientific work units.

There were weeks of daily hacker attacks, noone succeeded thus far, only helped to harden our blockchain. Gaming the economics comprising BOINC would be fun to watch.

PiGrid - get rewarded for helping research projects at home
Researchers already have technologies that can help in the fight against climate change and diseases.
Yet, those technologies often depend on large computational ressources for simulation and validation.
Now, a combination of innovations allows to incentivize progress.
In citizen science projects, each individual can volunteer to help.
By devoting spare computing time to research groups everyone could "recycle" idle working time of any computing device for a good cause.
BOINC[1] is a scientific network that has a paramount solution to manage the needed logistics:
it distributes small work units to participating computers for calculation and collects their results later while maintaining scalability.
On top of that, another innovation, Gridcoin[2], is able to reward participation in the BOINC network.
Gridcoin uses a blockchain algorithm to achieve fast and secure payments in a global, energy-efficient network.
While Bitcoin was consuming more than 15 Million US-Dollar in electricity each day[3], Gridcoin is able to strip energy waste and
dedicate 98% of globally networked ressources to scientific tasks.
This became possible by utilizing self-organizing properties of Bitcoin, asymmetric cryptography of Blackcoin[4] and
Gridcoins advanced blockchain concepts in "proof-of-research".
Still, a remaining problem is user adoption. The setup of Gridcoin combined with BOINC is time consuming and tricky.
This bars novices from easy access. In order to provide end users with a plug-n-play solution, PiGrid[5] has developed open-source software
that works out of the box and takes care of all related configurations and updates.
PiGrid can be used on existing hardware or bundled with pre-installed systems.
A graphical user interface allows choice of research projects via drag-and-drop, monitoring of progress and tracking rewards in Gridcoin.
The first generation of PiGrid solutions will be crowdfunded in this Kickstarter:

Besides various updates in our Kickstarter campaign many things will change in the Gridcoin world this month, there are great things coming up:
1.    The new feature Research Age will be introduced enabling unlimited scalability. Thereby, we can support hundreds of thousands of researchers without any loss of payment. Again, it’s not a payment lottery in Gridcoin like it is in Bitcoin, miners/researchers are paid based on their contribution to the BOINC crowd computing network in relation to the whole Gridcoin network.
2.    The second last step in our decreasing reward schedule will take effect on October 20th 2015. This sets a maximum daily coin production of 75000 new GRC. Including the 3% annual interest rate, the inflation rate will be ~9% until the final step. The final step will take effect on November 20th 2015 where the daily coin production reaches fixed 50000 GRC and the annual interest rate will be 1.5%. The global inflation rate will then be ~6% and logarithmically decreasing because of the fixed amount of daily produced Gridcoins (all details can be found in our extensive wiki: 
3.    Gridcoins second birthday will be October 16th. This date will be a landmark in a history of incremental iteration and innovation concerning development.

May I ask for your noble reason? What has made up your mind? So far, Gridcoin has put electricity worth of 800k USD to computational research in order to benefit scientific progress. Energy that otherwise whould have went into hashing.

Did you reach out to our developer over at contact ?

sorry didn't know this was wrong :-/

exactly, atm this is happening at BitcoinUtopia.
If things geht out of hand, there is on-blockchain-voting to blacklist projects, which is decentralized.

sounds cool, eligius 4.0 then? :)
srsly, would love to see your participation, our board might help your BOINC pool to grow beyond fake-WU!

Why mine when you can research?
 
Advancing science, mathematics, technology, and understanding the world around us.
A secure blockchain developed on the philosophy of benefiting humanity.
 
Get introduction at  and guides on 
Proof-of-Work algorithms have been criticized for wasting energy on meaningless equations in the mining process and for centralizing transaction processing by encouraging a specialized hardware arms race. Gridcoin introduces a Proof-of-Research algorithm that gives computers something productive to do. Instead of racing to solve meaningless equations, Gridcoin miners Researchers work on problems such as finding cures to diseases, mapping genomes, or climate studies, and are compensated for the work they do.   
 
Gridcoin rewards you for doing real work. Our goal is to divert computing power from wasteful hashing to productive computing, creating a supercomputing cluster that supports all kinds of scientific investigation and technology development. Access to supercomputers has traditionally been restricted to large research universities and corporations. By creating a large network of computing devices, complex computations once out of reach for most researchers are now possible. The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), an open computing platform that supports all kinds of hardware and adapts as technology changes, has been providing distributed supercomputing since 2002, but until now the network was limited to those willing to contribute their resources on a volunteer basis. A few cryptocurrencies have attempted to create a compensation mechanism to increase participation in research, such as Ripple, Curecoin, and Research Support Coin, but these have used a centralized model for determining reward distribution and selecting research topics. Gridcoin lets you decide what to research, and pays you for your research.
 
Gridcoin is built on top of BOINC and is not limited to any one program, algorithm, or type of hardware. BOINC supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. You don't need special hardware to participate and earn rewards for your contributions to research — the computer you use for a few hours every day can contribute to CPU-based scientific projects when you aren't using it, and you won’t waste electricity competing with GPUs or ASICs for rewards. Those with special GPU mining rigs can also participate in projects designed specifically for parallel computations and you don't have to worry about losing your ROI to the next generation of ASICs.  There are currently over 30 different projects available, each with its own hardware needs — some need CPUs, some need GPUs, and some need sensors. The diversity of hardware supported makes it possible to contribute to the network with almost any device, making it more secure and minimizing the centralization of mining power.   
 
The reward system is designed to pay you in the same way as a pay-per-share mining pool, so you are rewarded fairly based on the work you do — not by how fast you can solve a block. The devices you can use to contribute to scientific research through BOINC include CPU, GPU, Android, R-Pi, and ASICs, with more being added all the time.   
 
We ask for the community to join us as volunteers, developers, investors, and evangelists seeking to enable a fundamentally different paradigm for the blockchain and the benefits to humanity it can produce.
