It is exciting. I pre-ordered a Jalapeno and i hope the opensource community can make some custom firmware for it so if it's not profitable in mining i can use it for something else. The only thing we can hope for is that they deliver. They got a lot to lose if they don't.

Cyprus use to have the Cyprus pound that it closed when they switched over to Euro to 1.71EUR. In my opinion Cyprus problems begun just because they didn't keep their own currency and because of bad decisions made by the government.

It would take much more than a law student to accomplish that. You have my respect but only if you mean it.

Cyprus ≠ (not equal to) Greece

I agree with you, it's one of the cons of a monopoly in a product. When competition grows fees are going down.
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:46:05
Yeah but are they getting 3% fees on the BTC price and other 3% on the when you buy/sell?

If you can get cash out of this ATM it would be awesome in any country. But does anyone what would be the limit on that?
