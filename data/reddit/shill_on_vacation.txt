Inheritance, gifts and gambling suffice to show that the quote is wrong. Capitalism does tend to generously reward those that provide value to others but that's about as much you could say.

Yep, totally agree. Notice that what you wrote is quite different from the tweet. Increasing the block size is a reasonable approach until better solutions are developed.

Sounds like a scheme to avoid/evade capital gains tax (e.g. the "free" bitcoin is probably used to justify higher cost for the car but the "gift" stays off the book).

True. Most long time bitcoin core developers, when they first started working on Bitcoin, had little real life crypto/distributed systems engineering experience. At the time, Bitcoin wasn't worth much though so there was little reason to suspect they were trying to "get rich quick".
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:05:25
Well at least that was a relatively cheap lesson :) Please do take the time to learn a bit about Bitcoin and you might change your mind.

@_date: 2018-01-09 04:56:30
No one knows. In practice, miners will just move their equipment to other countries so it shouldn't affect the hash rate very much (neutral). It will reduce mining centralisation which is a good thing (price up).  However, it's indicative that the Chinese government is serious about cracking down on cryptocurrencies (price down).
In practice, the price movements of Bitcoin is really unpredictable so it doesn't really matter in the end.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:11:58


That is so true it's not even wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:47:35
It's unfortunate that you invested in something you didn't understand... Bitcoin has had those "flaws" since its inception. Bitcoin is not a "get rich quick" scheme and you definitely should not buy more unless you understand and believe in its potential. If you want to learn more about the technology, start by reading the white paper and technical documentation on bitcoin.org. Also, it's reasonable to think that fees will go down in the future.

For the technology initially (and the potential to separate money from nation states)... But I also realise that a larger market cap is necessary for larger adoption and possibility to realistically challenge gold/USD.

Miners are just a special type of node that can mine blocks. Nodes do need to verify blocks/transactions since Bitcoin is a "trustless" protocol.

You can transfer it to GDAX and withdraw it from there (0 fee). You should  then use a wallet which lets you set an arbitrary fee (e.g. 0).

Also developer here (who developed a full validating Bitcoin node for a startup a few years ago) and long time HODLer.
My biggest frustration with core (and this community) is that they don't seem to get that "perfect is the enemy of good". There is such a thing as short term solutions (e.g. doubling the block size) until longer term solutions are ready.
Also, the idea that everyone should be running a full node is so, so naive. Even with small blocks, the vast majority of Bitcoin users aren't running full nodes. Those days are gone. We need to find ways to keep those users secure while keeping the cost of running a full node accessible to hobbyists and businesses who are willing to invest some effort and resources into running one.

If some altcoin discovered a solution for faster transaction times and lower fees, Bitcoin would probably just adopt it. The reason those altcoins have "faster transactions and lower fees" is they sacrifice security, decentralisation and they just aren't being used much.
