3.6mil is the value of the setup?
or is that the value in lost bitcoins?

Seems to be the case. I'm more concerned about the amount of trolling.

That's akin to a christian asking an atheist why god doesn't exist.
I'm not here proving bitcoin will cap at $1000. I just think it's a tad ridiculous to think it'll hit some of the marks I've seen. 
And why would I resort to name calling? If you think everyone is a troll and treat them as such, you may find they respond in similar fashions.
I'm here to learn, if all you have are lines like "Bonus points if you don't resort to name calling." I figure I'll most likely have to find another place to learn how bitcoin operates.

I'm curious. 
Are people that constantly spout this ignorant? 
Or are they just trying to push people into bitcoin?

Great post! Keep up the good work.

I'm guessing this is why bitcoin has gone up $10 today?

People think this will actually happen?

Do you go around telling people you're set for life because you bought 2 bitcoins?
The post you replied to was actually inline with what I was saying. Are the people who say bitcoin will hit 10k in feb ignorant? are they lying? are they attempting to attract people to their new bitcoin startup? Do YOU believe it'll hit 10k in 2-3months? From your response, I thought you were saying that was not going to happen and most people do not actually believe that.
I'm not accusing you of anything, other than being a little too defensive.

To address your analogy: Houses go up in price for many different reasons. Inflation is probably one of the biggest factors. that $25k house in the 50s is not really 25k, adjusted for 2014 inflation would be 243k. A reasonable price for a house. When you include other factors that increase the desirability of a house(schools, community center, crime rates, roads, public services, malls, etc etc) You can easily find ways to show how a house in 1950 would be worth 10-20x+ the initial price.
Without getting deeper into how housing and bitcoin follow extremely different economics, i bring up the fact that many people treat bitcoin as a volatile stock or investment, they aren't buying 2000 bitcoins because they want to buy something. 
 
Instead of asking me why it's unreasonable, I'd like someone to show me why it IS reasonable to believe 10k for 1 bitcoin(or an even higher price, I've seen 700k/1bitcoin predictions) is going happen. it's something I've looked at as an investment and beat myself up for not buying  a piece last year.
I'm not a shill or anything like that. I'm trying to learn how bitcoin operates and why it would hit 10k without being sold off in mass quantities.
