I assure you I am currently enrolled in UAB as a Physics major! Thank you for the compliment! :)

Haha, should I take that as a compliment or be insulted?

You're right! I've got one bitcoin I'm holding onto just in case. But I am a firm believer in the future of bitcoin as a currency! Perhaps once this job gets established, even if bitcoin doesn't ever drop below 50 again, I'll buy a few more.

Give me 2 bitcoins.

But with bitcoin being as volatile as it is, and I being totally out of cash for the next two months, it was either cash out or go broke. I don't think there was much choice involved.

It's not college that I'm trying to pay for, I'm up to my eyeballs in student loans. I'm talking about rent for the two bedroom apartment I'm living in, food for the next two months, gas so I can drive to work, and internet and water until I get my first paycheck.
My parents are in no situation to help me financially, it's not a decision I took lightly, I literally NEED the money.

Oh, I understand what you mean.
If I had 20 more bitcoins right now, I probably would have sold 5 when the price hit 700$. My car's engine just died and I'm in a hell of a lot of debt after I purchased a new one, on top of my student loans. So 3,500 would go a VERY long way. But other than that, I would definitely hold onto them. 
My goal is to use them as they are intended. I don't mean to cash out, ever. I want to use my bitcoins to purchase things. And if enough people share this mindset, bitcoin will become the go-to crypto currency, which will be great for all involved.
That being said, the higher value they translate to in USD, the more I, and everyone else involved will benefit.

Please don't feel bad about losing 1.4 btc. I lost a wallet with 20 btc in it back when they were around 4$ a pop. I cringe everytime I think of that damn wallet.

Basically I had all the coins on this one bitcoin-qt wallet on this old mac that I only used to store bitcoins. I was pretty careful with my coins since at that time they were pretty much only used on the silkroad, I was pretty young and only bought tiny amounts of different things for personal use, but I was really careful nonetheless. I backed up all my information onto a 32gb flashdrive as well just in case something happened to the computer. Well, I bought like 80$ worth of coins at one point and put them into a separate wallet than my main one. This was the one wallet I did not back up, mainly because I was too lazy. Well so it happens, my macbook got the white screen of death and after many weeks trying to fix it, I finally managed to get it to start up, but the harddrive was wiped.
Didn't think it was a big deal at the time, but now I would do anything for those coins. About that same time I stopped using the silkroad and just forgot about the coins I had left. When I saw them rise to 50$ in January, I got back into the game and transferred all my coins from SR to coinbase (about 20). Had to sell 18 of them at around 120$ to pay my bills and rent when I was in between jobs, but I've made it a goal to only use the remaining two as they're intended to be used, as a currency.

True, but at that time I only used bitcoins for their intended purpose, as currency. I had no idea they would explode into what they are now. Now that they are hundreds of times more valuable, that 80$ would have been something like 15,000. Which is extremely useful to a frugal college kid!
