Thanks for the donations. I know the charities really appreciate it.

Lots of congestion on the network right now

My thoughts exactly!

Fees seem pretty decent for exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:34:53
Know the physical location?

I think it has more potential. I have put a fair bit into bitcoin already

If you add a bank account you should be cleared for $7500 a week. Cards are $1250 weekly I think

As above. Get verified and quick! Good luck
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:44
Exchanges still down I believe

If you can afford to lose it, then YES!
Edit: grammar

Just simulated a buy on Coinbase. $200 buy from debit card cost $7.67 and from bank account cost $2.99. 
Not outrageous but if would add up if set to daily buys

That’s not legit. Don’t give any personal information

Until it changes.....

You’ll be fine. Just hold and be patient
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:26:05
That’s nice. Just messed around with a few numbers. (On mobile app) 
$20 cost me $1.49
$50 cost me $1.99
I wish I could get your rates. 
Thanks for the reply

Heard Exodus is a nice wallet and has the ability to exchange bitcoin for other altcoins
