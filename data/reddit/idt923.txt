Half the world is using Facebook. I will gladly change my position once i can say the same about BTC

FB has Instagram and WhatsApp which is still popular around youths. Also older demographics are more interesting for ads since they have money. Ask Snapchat about that. 
I am quite certain the company is still relevant in 20 years. I don’t know about Bitcoin. It will either be totally worthless or worth a lot.

I would say FB has a better chance at continued success than bitcoin

He is probably dead, so he doesn't need to worry about that

Do you honestly believe Bitcoin can still multibag in the near future? These people had returns of 200x of course it is smart to take money off the table. Bitcoin will not 200x again so buying here may still give solid return, but you can’t blame people for taking a profit

Thing ist that is just speculation. We don’t know if there is 5x next year. So these 200x are very real and yes could be 1000x next year or maybe just 50x or less. Why be greedy if 200x is enough for you?

Yeah you should probably substract Satoshis coins from that 21m and the hundred of thousands other lost coins.

Nope someone could flag inactive addresses, but nobody knows if those are lost or just HODLing for years
