It seems like this basic logic is too complicated for some of the users here to understand.
It is so hard for some people to understand some topics or the logic behind a comment when they're so brainwashed by fiat currency, capitalism, and seeing Bitcoin as a game to play rather than as a serious revolution of money.

This theory makes a lot of sense, but doesnt it imply theyre just awful people?
If my coworkers made millions, I would be happy for them. Especially if I was too dumb to follow their advice and lost out no fault but my own. Jealous? Sure. Angry at them and secretly hoping they lose it all? Holy fuck wtf kind of person is that?!
Great theories everyone. @_date: 2018-02-07 19:39:45
Pretty sure the average person still believes everything they hear on tv or read on the internet has to be true because theyre the most popular ones.
Most people just arent woke. All it takes is one moment to open your eyes to see the obvious, but that one moment never happens to a lot of people.
Kohlberg theorized that most people persist their entire lives in a level of moral development obtained as a teenager. I have heard of research which shows the average age ppl are comfortable with body image is like 70 years old.
While some of us grow and continue to develop our entire lives, the majority (according to most theories and research) doesnt grow past the mental and emotional maturity of a child until they are old enough to, on average, be dead. And even then, some never find that mental or emotional salvation even into their &gt;90's.
When you have that type of people, and theyre grossly uninformed or misinformed?
Constantly flooded with endless propaganda? Overwhelmed with nonsense? Distracted by struggle or psychologically enticing entertainment?
 It is no surprise they are so naive they have no clue what is going on around them. You really cant blame them.

You do realize nations, boundaries, race, borders, "territory", and all that are human constructs that must be taught...right? Tribalism isnt about how you look but the who is part of your inner circle - which can even include other species. You seem legitimately confused about the differences between instinct and learned behaviuor.

The truth is a nuanced version of outright (legalized) bribery.
The owners have a culture (or even direct statements) as to what should be reportrd and how.
This brings an understanding to the network leads, who know to push their master's agenda without needing direct commands. They know what they want and know they will be politely corrected if they begin to veer off course.
The employeed (journalists) who refuse to tow the line will be fired. Even if their agenda coincides with the owners (Glen Beck nutjob) - they will fire if they cant control them in full. They want to hire &amp; maintain only the type of personality who wont be independent of thought. If they are contrary to the agenda, their celebrity is irrelevant. Their profit is irrelevant. They WILL be fired no matter what. (Some of the most famous tv journalists were fired for opposing the Iraq War).
This is NOT because of petty cash advertising. This is big boy cash from propaganda. Political influence, corporate welfare, war profiteering, big money donations, legalised bribery, special deals, Access Journalism, etc. Some of those who were fired for opposing their corporate agenda were their most successful and profitable journalists. Control matters MORE than advertising revenue.
This leads to cultivation of very specific type of individuals, like the ones you see on CNN or MSNBC. The ones who never challenge politicians unless preapproved to. The ones who never do follow up questions. The ones who never cover real news. This is all of them. All. There are no exceptions because the exceptions were fired and replaced.
They hire certain personalities, kindof in the same way the oligarchs prop up Democrats who are weak &amp; pathetic. The type who will fold easily is the kind you want as an opponent. (ex. Chuckie the Schuum.)
Thus you have corporate news which is filled with 100% weak ass non-journalist pro-establishment pro-corporate pro-owner propaganda readers, all who push the unspoken agenda of their owner and corproate friends.
The ones who tow the line the best, like Rachel Maddow, **get paid more in one day than most americans get in one year.**
This type of money and culture will transform most people from good hard hitting journalists to unethical soft spoken corporate mouthpieces.
If you think someone who makes more in 1 day than you lake in 1 year is your friend, then you are more naive than anyone can help.
That is how they bribe these journalists directly. Big stable paychecks, cultivation of culture through hires and fires, mostly unspoken agenda, and cultivation of elitism by paying the leads enough to leave the middle class and join the perverted elite bubble.

I am pretty sure there are a lot of FUD bots, just because so much money is involved. But I am sure many irrational and seemingly crazy-hateful people are around too.
[I asked the community why]( so many have such hate in their heart for an inanimate currency. Good answers as to why.

Are people really this naive to how real life "news" works?
MSM isnt real journalism or news. They are literally just propaganda based on what the wealthiest want to spread.
If this isn't obvious to you for things like Climate Change or Politics, then there is no hope to convince you it is true of everything they "report", especially money and investments like Bitcoin.
It boggles my mind that human beings still exist who trust MSM networks and believe these people are legitimately more than corporate shills and aristocratic puppets.
No informed or intelligent human denies this to be true. The average age of MSM cable tv viewers is a bit over 60. That is because they are the only ones naive and dumb enough to not see the glaring obvious. Theyre the same age group who fall for Nigerian Prince scams.
If you find yourself being among these gullible and naive elderly victims, please call a mechanic to fix your bullshit detector ASAP.

Common knowledge accepted by the majority, backed by tons of evidence, repeatably accurate predictions, and solid reasoning is the opposite of a tinfoil conspiracy.
The conspiracy theorist would be this insane belief you have where billionaires dont use their assets to profit.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:08:00
Anti-Bitcoiners are the types who
* Didnt get in at a low &amp; lost out in tons of profit as it soared from 2k to 20k &amp; are angry for it.
* Panic bought in at 20k &amp; angry for it.
* Panic sold at 6k before bounce back to 14k &amp; are angry for it.
* Missed out when Bitcoin was worth pennies or &lt;$100 &amp; are angry for it.
And most of all...
* Theyre the type of "Stupid Hardworker" who work really hard every day for their money &amp; absolutely **despise** the idea of someone making easy money without any effort (which is everyone who bought bitcoin when it was &lt;8k right now).
Those types abound. They work so hard they get furious with hatred at the idea of someone else making money without putting in the same work they did for less money.
But those types also worship the elite rich 1% "successes" who are lazy as fuck and make billions doing nothing.

You dont think theyre awful when they go out of their way to mock, laugh at, insult, belittle, or wish misfortune &amp; financial destitution of those who invest in Bitcoin?
Your theory gives an explanation. It doesnt somehow undo the negative action in their words and hateful desires in their heart to see others suffer "Cause theyre annoying!"
Imagine a person who wished failure on a game developer or actor simply because they thought their dream was unrealistic, financially risky, or were jealous. How would that not be an awful person?
Wishing harm on people who arent negatively effecting you is quite awful.

What are you talking about? Are you stupid AND delusional? My investments are doing amazing &amp; Bitcoin is on its way back up.
It is so weird when failures who are angry they didnt get in bitcoin early rage super hard at strawmans.
Why are you so emotionally invested in seeing Bitcoin fail? You deny all reality and go off on irrational strawman hunts (which you fail at evem though you created the strawman) ... because why?
Are you really angry that you dont understand Bitcoin tech? Does it make you feel stupid? Are you jealous of early investor's success?
Healthy people dont rage with emotion against inanimate objects like currency. You need help.

@_date: 2018-02-08 19:08:50


No. Even if theyre annoying, I dont wish others misfortune. What kind of sick person does that?
I have trouble even wishing misfortune on my greatest enemies and trolls. I dont want them to hurt financially. I just want them to not be assholes.
I dont understand other humans, but I am sure this is true.
I have to disagree that these peoppe arent awful. Wanting others to suffer for no legitimate reason (annoying isnt a valid reason) is bad. That requires an awful person since being annoying isnt actually effecting you. They arent hitting you in the face or hurting your career by loving clowns.
I also think these are a minority. Definitely awful but not representative of most. Hopefully I am not being naive.

Just to remind the reader: there are many ways to pay (bribe) people.
* Offer them a "job" or "freelance work"
* Spend advertising money on their service, without actually having a goal or caring if it works
* Promise them opportunity or influence
* "Befriend" them out by giving them advice, data, or contacts that can help them grow and generate revenue
* Flex your marketing arm for them, "Hey 200k followers, I found this guy's channel. I am unrelated but I like him!
* Give them a Gift
* Give them a Donation
* Give them ACCESS (Access Journalism)
Of course there is also direct bribery that no one will ever know about. But legalised bribery is so much easier and legal.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:23:33
Ouch. This sounds like a harsh truth. I've heard of this before about friends and coworkers getting upset when you start your own company. I will have to study this alot more - thank you for the similarity.

Always amazes me when people shill for the corporate establishment.
The majority of real people dont trust Mainstream Media. **You are in a minority...** MSM actually has as low or lower trust rating than Congress (a group notorious for its low approval ratings and carelessness for average people).
You belong to the same naive group who gets email scammed every year.
Are you really part of the minority who dont believe the extremely obvious, irrefutably proven, fact that the MSM isnt there to actually help you? Do you really think they're objective when there is a consensus that theyre run and heavily influenced by their billionaire owners?
Is the firing of famous, successful journalists not enough for you? Is their full throated endorsement of an illegal war not obvious enough to show they arent on your side?
How is blatantly in-your-face obvious not enough for you? Amazing.

I will play devil's advocate here.
Mainstream acceptance of bitcoin will result in devices, hardware wallets, and banks. Just like with USD.
The reason people dont keep all their USD in their own home, even in a safe, is because it is less protected than at a bank or safe deposit box.
People dont want all their savings to be stolen during a burglary or murdered because they keep 20 million in a paper wallet inside their floor safe.
A Phone would be like cash in a wallet or purse, but more convenient. A laptop, a briefcase. A tablet, a purse.
But the majority of savings will be stored with maximum security. That is why a lot of people use banks. Safety.
It is risky and insecure unless you have a bank or a very expensive safe bolted to foundation woth not-enough-to-be-murdered-for in it.
Mainstream acceptance, for the most part, will be Bank + Phone.
Daily use will just be Phone. Hence why she explained it that way.

It makes me wonder sometimes what percent of programmers would be rendered incompetent if google went offline or stack overflow was down.

I left out Fox News bc these days, everyone already accepts them as obvious propagandist and establishment war mongering corporate agenda / nutjobs. I targeted CNN &amp; MSNBC in the examples because those still have extremely naive or stupid Americans who still believe theyre legitimate news shows.
When I said ALL, I meant ALL.
 However more trustworthy journalists like independent online news, well... they dont report on finances like Bitcoin.
Your best bet with Bitcoin is finding a trusted online news source. Idk which that would be. Just stay away from anything corporate funded or corporate owned. And try to rely on Logic &amp; Data, not speculation and feeling.

Speak for yourself. My friends celebrate one another's success, not hope for each other's destructions. We're all humans btw. Totally not aliens. I swear.
Really though, I definitely disagree. That would make them quite awful people. No one should wish harm on others for reasons like "He is successful" or "He is annoying." They arent hurting you.
I find this idea strange that someone isnt bad if they fall into some majority. If it were human nature to cannibalize and murder people you invited into your home for dinner, you would still be a very shitty host.
 I also dont believe these people are the majority. Most people dont care at all about your success or failure. Theyre neutral. So much so they dont even login to reddit.
Those who post trash and anti-bitcoin rage are likely &lt;1% of all redditors, who are &lt;1% of all humans.

Speak for yourself. I firmly believe racism is a human construct that must be taught.
 I personally didnt even grasp the concept of racism until someone had to explain to me why my black friend got made fun of for his skin color.
To this day, some of us still dont really comprehend racism. I mean we understand it and know it exists like crazy, but we still cant comprehend the idea of thinking differently based on someone's skin color. We just see humans.
 It just doesnt make sense to some of us.
