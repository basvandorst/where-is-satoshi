Don't shoot me please..  I'll take this down if it violates any rules.  I was told by SonicQuest to post this here.

Gotcha, I got a little confused as to what 'the playa' was...  Burning man is a hell of an experience from what I've heard.  Have a blast!

He actually talks about the twins being worth a ton of bitcoin as well.  This is at the beginning when they are at the baseball field for the party.

I down voted you before I got the sarcasm..  fucking internet not pushing emotions.

Well that is the goal, to make a millionaire using bitcoin.  Why hate on someones vision of this goal.

That is a good thing though.

The article (which I read when it came out) doesn't really have a whole lot of credibility as the guy just states he has 'sources'.
Like I said Nick and Mr. Smith are both still with the company, sure they may sell, but would make sure that their company wouldn't be run to the ground and that it would continue to run even without them.
Tips go through all the time now, especially since the implemented TipWorthy which allows people to tip you for articles that you may or may not have created yourself.  
Reddit users account for a big amount of tips as well, go around and look for comments and I'm sure you can continuously find tips in bitcoin related threads.
They are clearly going strong otherwise the site would be shut down, no one would be able to tip etc...
**EDIT: AirBnB actually bought the company when they hired Nick.  Evidently it was a packaged deal.** [ (

So obviously connecting your account doesn't work yet.  Any idea when?   Compiling and running the bot is just work I'm not completely familiar with (I'll give it a shot though)!

Pretty sure it's too late :(  hope everyone spends their coin well.

Thank you!  I livestream daily for hours (it's my job).  Not many people come around.  Hopefully this changes the community some :D

If only!

And as for the 'dirty hippies' stereotype there are a lot of clean pot smokers that work where you least expect it.  In Colorado there is a lot of places that have cannabis users that work in resturants...  Go to Domino's and pretty much everyone there smokes, but hey you have your own narrow minded opinion.

I've been working on random faucets for a week or two.. [The highest paying one] ( I found, has been down for most of the day.  I've collected about two dollars and thirty nine cents.  So it's up to you.  I personally can't afford to buy bitcoin being poor so I'll stick to the faucets.
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:11:46
I've heard it too much from people being serious, but I digress, agree with you.

Not sure where you're getting your information from, but they just released an app, and are still going strong.  Nor are they stopping anytime soon.
EDIT: and even if Nick works with AirBnB he continues to work on changetip as well alongside John Q Smith

I should have started back then as well.  Not making much money off of streaming these days, but I'll get my foot in the door eventually.

They haven't updated my wallet to reflect my current bit total... I doubt I use them anymore until they fix themselves.. I'll just continue my coinbase!
