Muslims use it to donate to "islamic charities" in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Syria and ISIS controlled areas.  For peace of course (peace = a world with all infidels and apostates beheaded and burned).
I still support bitcoin though.  No government is going to stop muslims from giving money to islamic terrorist groups, that’s racist, bigoted, intolerant and islamophobic.  Not every muslim extremist jihadi with a suicide vest blows himself up... some of the vests are duds and a few chicken out at the last minute. So its not like they need bitcoin to do it. But it hides their funding of terrorism from the nasty racist bigots like me.

I’d love to say money grows on gonads.

Amazon will accept it this year.  I predict.

Ehhh, i loved btc at first but by now I’ve long given up on it... I don’t know what they did to it, but they won.  It just sits around $6500 and doesn’t move.  They, the banking powers and the governments that matter, did something to get control of btc.  So glad i got out of it.

Bitcoin value is determined in dollars as far as I’ve ever seen. What’s the real purchasing power if bitcoin over time?  Just wondering...

Well it can’t be counterfeited, which makes it different from other forms of money.  Even gold coins can be faked. Gold plated lead, whatever.

Exactly, it’s the same whether a pizza is worth 100 bitcoins or .00000003 bitcoin.  Value is independent from digits.

They just need to offer better deals for being paid in bitcoin. 100 oxy-widgets for $3000 or $2000 in bitcoin.  And many do.  If they offer no discount for bitcoin payments then sure I’ll hold on to my btc and use my credit card instead.

This is too good. I call fake.

It will never hit $20,000 again. That much i know. You know why?  Because the dark net markets turned to shit and they were driving 95% of the demand for btc. If you wanna risk prison for some blatantly fake xanax or cheapo made-in-india steroids, go for it. The days of being able to buy a pound of pure fentanyl are over. Thus the days of bitcoin rising and rising are over. Simple as that.  Sell while you can.  Get the fuck out.  And don’t tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about, you’re not gonna hurt my feelings.  You’ll just make me giggle.

All they have to do is say terrorists and drug dealers use bitcoin and bitcoin mining is very un-green, wasting a fuckton of electricity.  It already uses something like 0.01% of the world’s electricity... which is crazy.
Bitcoin doesn’t stand a chance and it will be regulated into oblivion sooner rather than later.
