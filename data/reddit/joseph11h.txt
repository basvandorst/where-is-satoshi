I had always suspected that MtGox artificially inflated the price at this time. The price jump was just absurd...all the way from ~$100 to $1000 in a month or so? It just doesn't make sense. There had to be major price rigging back then.

Because the author messed up. Both those words should have the first letter capitalized.
Side note to grammar people: Yes, both my comments started with the word "because". Your English teacher lied to you if you think you can't do that. You totally can.
Side, side note: When using quotation marks and closing them at the end of a sentence or next to a comma, like "this", British English says you put the ending quotation mark before the period or comma, etc. American English says you put it after the other punctuation mark, like "this." I prefer the British style so that's why I use that one.

Yeah but a little info on how he got it working would give us all some insight on setting up our own P2Pool.
Yes. I am aware OP said to simply search Google. Problem is we don't know where to start or what search terms to begin with. I guess you could type **p2pool server** into Google and see what you find. But I'm not mining I just think a short guide would be helpful to many people here.

Because it's part of a headline, or title.
The general rule for titles of a work of art or news in the English language is that each word is capitalized unless it is a small word like "and, or, the, to it, is" or "a". And the first and last words of a title, and the next-to-first and next-to-last words, are always capitalized even if it is a small word.
Going by that rule, the capitalization of the title of this post is *almost* perfect :P

Yeah but OP posted his (encrypted) wallet.dat file apparently. So someone would only need to guess the password to get his Bitcoins. Still a feat if the password has enough entropy, but you don't want random people to have your wallet file, even if it is encrypted.

The Bitcoin technology will eventually evolve to have more escrow systems, so that the buyer and seller both have protection from fraud and scamming.

His point still stands. Killhamster is complaining about Bitcoin ponzi schemes. What does he want? Protection from them? It doesn't sound like killhamster even wants to use Bitcoin.

Drop to 7,000? When was that? Around the time of the financial crisis?
We have had huge monetary inflation since then, and the first place you're going to see inflated prices I would guess is the stock market. So I don't expect it to drop significantly like that again for a long time.
And sorry to harp on you, I think it was your username that told the story of working hard through high school and college to become more successful.

Oh please. You actually believe the NYSE will correct to *14,000?!*
I'm sorry but that is absolutely ridiculous. You could be right about whatever you were trying to convince us of (you're not), but since you believe the stock market will correct to 14,000 I cannot take seriously you even telling me your name and address.
I read your story. I'm proud of you for working so hard to create a better life for yourself. But please recognize you are an exception, and you still had a much better foundation than 95% of the world.
I live in India as a white expatriat American and I can tell you poverty is **not** a result of not knowing how to save money. Try teling that to my Indian friends. Tell them how to find a job that pays more than $5 a day while you're at it. They would love to hear.

He's right. Demand of Bitcoins is almost sure to increase.
Maybe not 10x in a few years. But probably something close. Right now there are 7,878,850 bitcoins in existence, according to [Block Explorer]( so that gives us a market cap of $24,975,954.50 for the entire Bitcoin economy.
Supply of Bitcoins will only increase marginally from mining in a few years. 
It's just an opinion, you can do what you want, but I think the Bitcoin economy is bound to grow to much larger USD, increasing the value of each Bitcoin.

I'm sick of hearing this. I keep my Bitcoins safe inside my encrypted bitcoin-qt wallet on my Linux machine. I'm confident I'm not infected with malware, as most people who run Linux or Mac would be, and I sleep well at night knowing that my Bitcoins are safe. I keep backups of my encrypted wallet on numerous online hosting sites and on a second Linux laptop as well.
I think my approach is more safe, more reliable, and more convenient than having a paper wallet.

Seems so risky though. Being in the US, what's the chance that customs is going to take my rig? What's the chance that Avalon will just take my BTC and not fulfill my order? I really want to do this, but 100BTC is a lot of money.
Thoughts? Anyone here taken the plunge and bought one?
edit: Well I figured they would sell out in a few minutes...and they just did. Oh well. I wasn't going to pay that much for one anyway, especially since I've heard that the Avalon's draw a lot more electric than the new ASICs in the pipeline, to be released soon (hopefully).

The exchange rate between traditional currencies would stay relatively the same. But if Bitcoin drops in price from the time you purchase it to the time you sell it, you are going to get less dollars or euros or whatever than you would if you had just brought your traditional currency to the currency exchange at the airport.

Hmm...I maybe could find an old Dwolla statement to show that they did transfer it to my Dwolla account (from Dwolla I sent it on to my bank). It took something like 2 weeks for MtGox to send to Dwolla, but I expected this since they told me about it.
If Bitcoin recovers from this crash quickly, I'll try selling some through Coinbase and let you know how it goes. My bet is that it's a lot faster than MtGox. But I'll let you know, seriously. PM me if you want and we can continue this conversation.
I do have to ask, though, why do you distrust MtGox so much? It's healthy to have some skepticism in any of these Bitcoin-related businesses, since most of them are registered under fake names or aliases and could run off with all their customers' money at any point. This is a risk I hope most people here understand. But why are you so distrusting of MtGox in particular?

I'll do it. PM me and I will do it today, you don't have to pay me extra if you send me the Bitcoin first.
Check my user history, you can see I am a nice guy. You can send it to my BTC address on CampBX since that will be easier for me to check at work. (as opposed to bringing my laptop with me and watching it through Bitcoin-QT).

What I don't understand is that everyone here keeps calling it "instant."

Bitcoin currency is in a state of deflation. Why would it crash? There is more interest in it now than ever before. Everyone I know who bought Bitcoin continues to buy more every month. And if it dips, then they'll just buy even more. I don't see a crash happening for at least a few years. Maybe a few decades. It's smooth sailing during this stage of increasing early adopters.

If you do decide to sell it, please use the industry leader, Kitco. 
They will pay you fair market price for your gold coins (the spot gold price/oz + extra money depending on how sought after that type of coin is). They are the best in the business. Just fill out a form on their website and package the form with your coins when you send them.
And to those saying not to sell the gold, I sold 5 ounces of gold coins back in 2011 to buy Bitcoin and have done very well. Make sure you backup and secure your wallet.

Well, deflation discourages people from spending the currency, since they expect it to be worth more in the future.

@_date: 2013-04-06 04:20:45
You should just use the mainline bitcoin-qt client. It offers encryption of your private key in the wallet.dat file, so when you (or an attacker) wants to spend your bitcoins, a password is needed to decrypt.
In other words, anyone with your wallet.dat file can load your wallet and see what's on it, but only you can spend it.
Now backup that wallet.dat everywhere and you're golden!
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:40:30
Oh God. Please don't use a brainwallet. You're just begging to lose your coins. And these things are gonna be worth *a lot* in a few years. Please make an encrypted wallet with standard bitcoin-qt and make lots of backups. You'll thank me later.

Yes, but if you spend a Bitcoin for pizza in his scenario and you don't buy it back, you've lost out on $100 at the end of the month. You could have kept the Bitcoin and paid $10 cash for pizza, and then at the end of the month you still have the $100 Bitcoin.
I try to keep my money close to the exchanges so that I don't have to think about things like this when I spend my Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:10:56
Can you back up an encrypted wallet.dat onto paper? I guess you could just write down the code...still if you're relying on this, it sounds like a good way to lose your Bitcoin.

Well, honestly I haven't used it yet. But I've read that it works fast, in contrast to **buying** bitcoins through Coinbase. I'm just not ready to cash some of it out. I've used MtGox to do it before, though, and it was a really slow process. I've read people say that Coinbase does the ACH transfer immediately, however, so it just takes 1-2 days to get to your bank account. I'll let you know when I try it in a few months, if you want.
To answer your question further, there is a healthy maket for Bitcoin trading, and it's not just MtGox. I'm not worried about being able to sell my Bitcoins. There is a huge amount of ways I can sell them, I think it's hard to dispute that.

Will US customers be able to do an ACH (automated clearing house, cost is free) transfer straight to MtGox now, effectively cutting out Dwolla? If that's the only advantage, I don't really see the point.

@_date: 2013-04-13 18:51:55
Yeah, absolutely. One minor mishap and you've lost your key to unlock your account. I'm honestly surprised this kind of stuff isn't posted on here more frequently, seems like an easy mistake to make.
Just keep it in a local bitcoin-qt wallet, and encrypt it with a tough password you don't use on any websites (in case a hacker steals your wallet and also steals your online accounts). Then back it up everywhere and you're set. I think this is a good blend of security, safety, and convenience.
Edit: And only use the wallet on a Linux or Mac machine, to avoid exposure to malware.

The problem with buying property, or anything else that's very expensive, is that no one wants to pay in Bitcoin, when they could simply cash out a small amount of Bitcoin as down payment, and borrow the rest from the bank. Bitcoin is simply too valuable, and taking out a 6% loan is much preferable.

Every exchange site, where you buy and sell bitcoin, and really any site that uses Bitcoin, such as the underground markets, will provide you with a virtual wallet and at least 1 address. It's a standard Bitcoin address and can be used to move Bitcoin from the site to another wallet, or vice versa.
Sorry that answer was kinda long winded. Hopefully you understand. If not I'll try again later to condense that a bit.

You can safely encrypt your bitcoin-qt wallet at any time. As others have mentioned, the only issue is that the previous unencrypted wallet file (and its backups) will no longer work.
Your friend will not lose his bitcoins by encrypting.

I suspect is filling up with astroturfers. Or maybe they're just morons. Who the fuck thinks it's a good idea to put your one copy of a $1 million Bitcoin wallet into a tiny hollow coin?

They're listed under Coinabul.
**Edit** I was wrong, got my Bul companies confused.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:22:36
OK, well it's nice to see this feature. Still, I don't think most people want to spend the time to figure out how to redeem $3 in Bitcoin. I mean, do you really expect them to set up a MtGox/Dwolla or Coinbase account just to claim a few bucks? Seems silly to me, unless you know the person you're tipping already uses Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-15 00:14:32
Just make sure you make some backups, too! Lol

Go to Software Sources in Ubuntu (use the Unity bar search....the thing on the left of the screen) and go to the Other Software tab, click add source, and type the PPA line that they tell you to type to add Bitcoin sources. Then close out, it'll probably ask you to update, say yes. Then install bitcoin-qt however you normally would. You can go to the terminal and type sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt or you can install it from the Synaptic Package Manager or whatever it's called now.
Let me know if you have any problems, I'm just going from memory, since I'm at work right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:24:43
Oh! Don't install using a tarball! :P
Here, I'm just gonna give you a few terminal commands to type. This will update your sources to include the Bitcoin repo, update your software list so it sees it can install Bitcoin now, and finally install it.
All you have to do is type the following into your terminal (type one line at a time):
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
Once it finishes, you can run Bitcoin-qt from terminal by simply typing bitcoin-qt, or you can go to the Unity search bar in the top left of your screen and search for Bitcoin to find the shortcut and run it from there.
For your second question, I did some research and found that what you are looking for is called persistent storage on a USB live version of Ubuntu. Most people who do this agree that Unetbootin  is the easiest way to make a live USB of Ubuntu, and it supports this feature too. I have used it before. Once you download it, just make sure you specify how much space you want on your USB drive to be dedicated to storing your data. In the program, this option is at the bottom of the window, and it says "Space used to preserve files across reboots" I don't know what it will save on there, I would think just the /home/~user folder but I don't really know for sure.
Honestly, I would probably recommend installing Ubuntu on your computer. You can always dual-boot with Windows. And it's easier to dual-boot if you install Windows 1st, and Ubuntu 2nd anyway. So you are in luck! :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:04:00
Yeah, as soon as they deposit your bitcoins in your Coinbase account, you can send them to your wallet on your computer for safe-keeping.

@_date: 2013-04-13 21:30:47
Yeah, my biggest fear for Bitcoin is that it will be over-regulated to the point of driving all of the exchanges out of business. Either that or just made outright illegal. I hope it never happens, but if it did I'm sure Silk Road et al would continue operation, and so Bitcoin would still have *some* value.

It redirected me to the US site, which did not have these options for Bitcoin listed.
So I logged onto the Spanish site, [igmarkets.es]( and used it to make an account. Bitcoin options showed up there.
Very nice, but I'm wondering if I went this route would I make more cash than just holding BTC? Anyone have any idea? Thanks

It's going to be hard to exchange such a small amount though. I mean, the fees on a bank wire would be more than six bucks. So unless they're doing a free ACH transfer through Mt. Gox -&gt; Dwolla -&gt; Bank or something similar, or they trade the coins to someone who wants them for cash, they are going to have a hard time getting that into dollars.

Some exchange sites will buy your bitcoins from you, and send you a MoneyGram/Western Union wire. The fees might be high, but this sounds like something that might interest you.

He worded that badly...he just means, name something another cryptocurrency would do better than Bitcoin? Seriously. Name something. The only thing I can think of is less inflation of the money supply. Because Bitcoin is inflating at a faster rate than USD at this moment in time, which is not a good thing.
However, adoption has kept up with it, and in less than 4 years we will have another block halving, drastically reducing the rate of inflation. So I don't see a big problem, do you?

1) Download the official bitcoin-qt client. It is the most reliable since it has by far the most developers. If possible, don't run it on Windows, period. Use Mac Or Linux.
2) Encrypt your wallet with a password you can remember, preferably one you don't use on any web site so that if you're hacked and your wallet is stolen, a hacker won't be able to figure out your password. You can encrypt your wallet within the bitcoin-qt program.
3) Backup your wallet.dat everywhere. Look up on Google to find where this file is. It is different depending on your operating system. Back up to external hard drives, jumpdrives, Gmail, Dropbox, etc. More is better, assuming you're using a good password.
4) Once bitcoin-qt is fully synced with the network, you will see a green check mark in the bottom-right of the program. Now you can send funds to your Bitcoin receive address! As soon as you send them, you will see a notification box pop up from bitcoin-qt telling you that you received funds. Technically, you can transfer the bitcoin even before the blockchain syncs and you get the green checkmark, but you will have to wait much longer to see that your Bitcoin arrived safely. I like to see it immediately, so that's why I wait for the check.
5) Unless you're making a lot of transfers (over 100) you don't need to make a new backup of your wallet.dat unless you just want to. When you get a lot of transfers, I'd update your backups though.
Good luck! But you won't need it...if you follow this guide your bitcoin will be ridiculously safe. :)
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:18:46
Why is someone going to be compelled to keep track of a $3 Bitcoin wallet though? Assuming they don't understand the significance of it (and they won't).

Thank you. I will try it out tomorrow (I'm busy tonight).
If I like it, I'd like to send a nice  Bitcoin tip your way. I don't have my account set up on Reddit to do that, so if you can just give me a Bitcoin address that would be awesome. 
Thanks again, peace : )
@_date: 2013-02-27 19:40:34
Come on, man. If you had no interest in Bitcoin, or at least very little...not enough interest to buy a couple hundred dollars worth for investment, what would you do with .3 bitcoin sitting in your account? Would you hold on to it? Would you even bother taking the time to import the keys? And if you did, because sure, free money, I would import it too, how are you going to get it exchanged to dollars? You'd have to get on one of the exchanges and either do an ACH transfer to your bank, probably either through Coinbase or MtGox + Dwolla or find someone who wants to trade the coins for cash, which seems unlikely. I would feel guilty, myself, as a huge Bitcoin proponent, if I tipped someone with one of these paper wallets. I would know they're gonna have to spend a lot of time to get that 7 bucks from me in their hand that they can use to pay for their groceries.
But, on the other hand, it does get them accustomed to using this new currency which (as we know) will continue to gain popularity and increase in value. After typing this through, maybe I'm becoming more complacent with the idea of handing out paper wallets. But I would definitely hold on to the private keys and send it back to one of my wallets after 3 months or so if it's still sitting there. Maybe that's what bothers me most. I hate the idea of a lost bitcoin, unusable, just sitting there waiting for someone's private keys to spend it, and they never come :(
So maybe I might try this, but like I said I would have to keep the private keys in case they're never spent. I don't think OP did this.
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:09:36
You think the same way I do. I f*cking hate MtGox, absolutely hate them. At the same time, what they are doing by creating a new market (Bitcoin to MtGox FunBucks rate) is hilarious.

There is nothing wrong with using money as an investment. Deflationary currency encourages this. When more Bitcoin is "hoarded", there is a smaller supply being bought/sold on the markets. Lower supply + same demand = Higher price. I see no problem with this....although I do try to spend some of mine too, to spread the wealth :D

Why is that so crazy? It might take hundreds of years, but it's bound to happen eventually. Most likely a country will keep their old currency too, and also adopt Bitcoin as a secondary currency, allowing citizens to purchase them at banks. I don't see this happening anywhere in the foreseeable future.

@_date: 2013-04-09 13:47:48
Bitcoin currency is in a state of deflation. Why would it crash? There is more interest in it now than ever before. Everyone I know who bought Bitcoin continues to buy more every month. And if it dips, then they'll just buy even more. I don't see a crash happening for at least a few years. Maybe a few decades. It's smooth sailing during this stage of increasing early adopters.
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:24:51

The Bitcoin transaction figures include when some Bitcoin in the wallet is sent to a "change" address to obfuscate (to obscure, disguise) the real destination wallet.
This hugely amplifies the real transaction amounts. With that said, there were exponentially more Bitcoin transactions this year than in 2012.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:04:30

Dude, don't pick a fight with me. I'm not claiming I know how the market works. I said in my post that volume alone should not contribute to that huge price difference and I stick by that.
Who knows, maybe that is the only reason for the price gap. I'm not saying I have the answers. The market will behave exactly like it is "supposed to", I realize that.

Paul Krugman and the idiot who wrote that article are missing some glaring differences between Bitcoin and baby-sitting coupons. For one, the baby-sitting coupons aren't appreciating in price. Bitcoin is.
Also, you can't cut those coupons into half or .1 or .01 like you can Bitcoin.
They also forgot that those baby-sitting coupons aren't **the first major cryptocurrency that can be sent to anyone, anywhere, through the internet, for free.**
What a bunch of airheads.

@_date: 2013-12-19 20:58:25
This is what I keep trying to explain to people! The money printed is sitting in the big bank's accounts, and it has not entered into the M0 or M1 money supplies. So we have tons more dollars but no one gets to use them. We just printed them to balance debts.
So yeah, inflation **of the money supply** is still very low right now.
Inflation of prices? Now that's a different story, and they do a fantastic job of manipulating that figure to **to look way smaller than it actually is.**
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:48:59
I would transfer a very small amount to CampBX, perhaps $5, so you can get past the 31-day Dwolla hold. The way it works is that you can transfer money from Dwolla to CampBX. You can buy bitcoins. But then you can't transfer them to another bitcoin address until 31 days have elapsed.
So I would just start that process with a small amount, that way you can get your CampBX account good to go : )

Hey, I hope we eventually evolve to a point where mortgages and loans are a thing of the past, too...but I just don't see the advantage to paying in Bitcoin in this situation, even to someone like myself heavily invested.
I hope you prove me wrong, though, and I wish you the best of luck!
@_date: 2013-02-28 19:26:34
Yes, I would prefer that it worked this way, too. Like you said, the most important reason to me is that I get to use the password more often and commit it to memory. Also I don't want people to be able to see my wallet!
But this will work *okay* :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:34:50
It would be faster to send straight from your MtGox account. If you send to another wallet first, then on to the store, you're gonna have to wait for 2 transactions to confirm instead of just 1.

It's seriously pissing me off. Bitcoin went up over $1.50 today, and the ask price on my 37 call moved from .202 to. 208. Ridiculous...a move like that should send an option soaring.
I just don't understand. You really think the small moves are due to low volume on mpex? I think regardless of volume, the options should move more than that. Do you have any other explanation for this? Maybe the upward motion is priced in? :S But that really doesn't make sense either.

These guys have a lot of misconceptions about Bitcoin. I've just listened to the first few minutes so far, but here are a few funny things they've said:
- "So do you think it's a scam?"
I don't understand this question. The guy says he has a Bitcoin wallet with Bitcoins. There are people and institutions online who will buy your Bitcoin from you for the current market value. This is fact. I don't see what they think the scam part is.
- "It's like you gotta go through the exchange and then you've gotta transfer it from that to...you know...you're losing money all the way"
This is true if you don't want to deal with local people, you use an exchange. But I pay 0.65% to sell on MtGox and a quarter ($0.25) to transfer to Dwolla. From there I send it to my bank for free. These are about the amount of fees you would pay if you were trading stocks.
- "Get out of Bitcoin!"
'Nuff said. :) Apparently Dvorak has made a lot of bad predictions, and I'm sure this will be his most staggering in time.
