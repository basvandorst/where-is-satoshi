Undelete (from Piriform) might help, unless the area has been overwritten.

They should be able to roll back trades. If they cut it early enough and if the BTC/fiat has not left the exchange the financial losses for the customers from this should be minimal to none.

I used to trade on SX during the Gox lockdown. (with mixed results, but that's not the point) Here is my take on it.
It's true that their engine/trading interface is not perfect, but for a while it was in fact horribly bugged as far as automatic stop losses went. 
As the GoxCoin price crashed, people could initiate a trades where the system didn't set a proper stop loss to prevent it from going negative. Never mind the individual trade deposits, I'm talking about whole balances going red. Trainloads of people must have abused that. Place a trade, if it goes (permanently) red or gets closed with a negative balance then just abandon the account. If it goes green, close the position and cash in. This was an open vulnerability for a time on part of SX and they swallowed the losses generated by malicious users.
Secondly, and I know this is mostly irrelevant for current customers, just putting it out there: SX must have had a huge loss due to Gox closing down. The "leverage money" was probably sitting in a Gox account, while that of the customers was in secure storage as collateral. Despite this, as far as I know, every customer (who didn't abuse their system?) go paid.
As for the spread and the higher/lower displayed executions, this is the de facto fee you are paying for the opportunity to have such a high leverage. It doesn't come free.
After Gox turned off the lights I decided to cash out and put those Bitcoins to use elsewhere. My first withdrawal went flawlessly, the second one a couple of days later was stuck however. Sent a mail, my account got reviewed, no sign of abuse found, and my Bitcoins landed in my wallet a day later.
All in all, SX is not for everyone, especially not rookies (not talking about OP). You have to pay a fee for the leverage, and at times of high volatility you can get stopped out within minutes. 600 ask turns into 606 bid and you are up almost 10%, and vice versa. People intending to trade through their system better know exactly what they are doing.
**Calling SX a scam, however, is completely unwarranted.** 
It's not an exchange as such, just a tool to expose your coins to even more upside/downside risk if you want to. Obviously, if I personally had an extremely negative experience with them my post would look different, but just take this as a post by someone who didn't encounter any major problems.

The problem is that it's not even that expensive to buy RATs on the black market that will not show up on any virus scanners for some time. In theory it is possible to run the best AV + scan regularly with Malwarebytes (or whatever) on a fully updated Windows without a detection, while there is already malware hiding in the background.
I'm not saying your system is compromised, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying that an all clear from your trusted AV is never a 100% guarantee.

LocalBitcoins, but Paypal is not safe to use except if you trust the counterparty 100%.
If you want the best price you either list as a seller on LBC or sell at an exchange and have the funds wired, if that's an option for you.

Whether you opened the client or not is probably irrelevant.

This is one of the mysteries I would like to get a clear answer to one day.
We named him Bearwhale in one of the IRC channels for traders. The bot easily sold 100k (or more) coins, and there were plenty of days when most of the volume was generated by it. In its high gear (it had 3) we had 150-300 coin dumps every couple of minutes, irrespective of price or technical setup; most of the time it didn't even let the price bounce at critical levels where it was feasible. 
All of the bounces happened when the bot was randomly turned off for a while.
There is plenty of speculation as to who it was behind it, from Karpeles himself selling conjured up coins for arbing or some sort of exit strategy, to someone with an absolutely huge stash of coins thinking they were better off with GoxUSD instead of Goxcoins in case of a bankruptcy. We might never know.

good news?

Nobody here actually knows where they are based, de facto or de jure. Bulgaria, Cyprus and Switzerland have all been mentioned. 
The only thing we are more certain of is that the owners are Russian and the whole thing was set up to cater to Russian clients (as well others, obviously).

2 BTC?

Russian authorities suddenly sound extremely hostile towards Bitcoin, so I'm not that surprised.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:45:49
I'm interested as well!
