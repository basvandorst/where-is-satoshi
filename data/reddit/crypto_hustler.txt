got email from Ledgerx yesterday...said they are onboarding customers for new OMNI platform(retail) where you can trade bitcoin options and futures and they are physically settled...said I would hear from them soon to begin my application.

Ledgerx has launched today the OMNI platform for retail traders to trade BTC spot,options or futures which are physically settled.They beat ErisX and Bakkt to the punch.

Not sure as to what types of contracts theyre offering...hopefully they will offer perpetual contracts that you can exit at any time
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:01:39

SEC just announced 3 days ago they are looking for more input
Meanwhile, individuals have 21 days to make their case to the SEC about the VanEck bitcoin ETF, while any rebuttals must be submitted within 35 days.

Bakkt launches Nov 5...they should be buying bitcoin to warehouse it for their physically settled bitcoin futures
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:15:17
new fee structure at cb pro....no more free trades unless institutional size amounts for past 30 days...squeezing the little guy in favor of institutions just like gemini...screw that.
@_date: 2019-03-27 20:00:57
k....are you that guy from the movie "Back to the future"
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:14:25
crypto market will plummet....we are still in a bear market....obviously not all creditors will sell but some will sell a percentage...u gotta understand these people haven't had access to their btc for 5 years now....stops will get taken out....we are headed to $2k or lower if SEC denies Van Eck and Bitwise applications by April 5 and mt.gox creditors btc hits the market en masse...Happy Trading
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:11:57
Anybody see a Consensus 2019 price pump this year....can we rally to $6k....chart looks like it can happen....read somewhere there is enough cash on sidelines and exchanges to make it happen....what do you think ?
p.s. everything looks good from an infrastructure point of view....Bakkt coming online ...nasdaq futures coming online....fidelity and institutional investors...van eck and bitwise etfs still alive and kicking....only negative I see is mt.gox creditors and they won't start receiving any payouts until May at the earliest.
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:42:43
all comments are valid....bullish or bearish...no one can predict the future
@_date: 2019-03-21 13:19:43
Looks like Mt.Gox creditors will receive 141,000 bitcoin in May at the earliest....some will sell....will definitely put a lot of pressure on the spot market.
@_date: 2019-03-25 17:04:42
and I'm speculating that bitcoin is a sell and hasn't bottomed yet

tether trading
whats the problem
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:08:17
Noble Bank is looking to be acquired...used to be a bitfinex and tether customer...now desperate for cash...Im assuming bitfinex pulled their money out of there.
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:03:08
institutions will spring into action and start buying a shitload....why do u think they haven't started buying a lot ? 
they want cheaper prices or at least some semblance of a recovery with prices rising above 10k.
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:53:33
if tether implodes....I think we will see a quick dump to $3500 before a quick bounce back to $6500
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:12:02
got stopped out
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:51:21
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:46:50
stop it ....everything is fine....stop ur fud
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:15:52
nah...we have gemini usd which is regulated as well as trueusd and paxos....bitcoin would bounce back in a hurry if tether has problems...u saw what happened the other day....u can't even redeem tether for usd in a panic...btc spiked above $7k because people were exchanging tether for btc.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:10:38
wat ? lol
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:17:51
tether  insolvency fud causing this dip ?

@_date: 2018-10-18 22:16:10
then short bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-01 17:54:28
anybody trading on ledgerx ?
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:40:14
They would take a massive dump because this would be considered over regulation...The FATF is backed by the banksters of the G20 and this will be put into place...perhaps they would give the crypto industry a few months to implement it but believe you me....it is coming
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:03:21
I just want to throw this out there...tell me what you think...Obviously we all know that btc crashed from 20k to $3.5k by end of last year....all the retail investors got burned and sold or are holding at higher prices...but what about the pros who shorted via cme and cboe(cash settled) bitmex and kraken(btc settled) et al....they all made big money....tax time is upon us...whats the possibility they will be be dumping some btc in March and April to help pay their capital gains taxes ?
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:35:57
9 days until the crypto industry must verify the identity of anyone sending $1,000 or more:
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:47:27
April 5 is the new decision date
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:09:38
200 countries follow the recommendations of the FATF including the US...if countries dont follow they will be blacklisted and get shut out from global financial system...I believe its coming to fruition and is prob going to cause all coins to take a massive dump
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:23:10
soon...although there are analysts saying we could drop to $1200 sometime this year
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:56:11
we are going to $2k by March then 6k by may
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:44:32
I agree about no tools to verify destination ...what happens if I withdrawl to my trezor or ledger...they gonna alert my hardware wallet of my identity lol lmao

any day now...did u get your lambo brochure in the mail yet ?
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:28:36
no....it won't delay the decision which is expected by Feb 27....realistically it only has a 10% chance of being approved so it is kind of a moot point.
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:22:01
I think we hit $1200-$1500 by June...Today is the 1st day of tax season...people will be selling to lock in profits or sell at a loss to offset other capital gains taxes(same thing happened last year)....then we have the Mt.Gox trustees distributing $1.3 billion in May or June...Not everyone will sell but many will sell a portion and this will weigh heavily on the btc spot markets.GLTA
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:18:05
more like March 5...a week after the SEC denies the Van/Eck SolidX btc etf
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:39:38
however the government shutdown will delay the Jan 24 launch of Bakkt because they need approval from the CFTC which is a governmental regulatory body.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:08:55
this is the final shakeout before the absolute final shakeout
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:50:22

Never trust a man who is afraid to try the keto diet....hehe
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:43:53
not gonna happen...may be $5k in 2nd half of 2019
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:48:38
In all likelihood...SEC is going to reject VanEck/SolidX bitcoin etf on Feb 27 2019...also Mt.Gox will dispersing bitcoin to all the people who were involved in the mt.gox fiasco...that could amount to a lot of people dumping their btc...remember they bought when it was below $1000 and some will want to cash out...I don't see a significant turnaround in btc price until mid 2019.If you're a trader...there will be lots of money to be made...if you're a hodler...dont look at price until fall 2019.
