Hey is high “price/btc” bad ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:48:05
Is there a way to check my balance without the internet ? Like doing some math? For blockchain i would have to make an account ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:34:55
So i should have waited until it was going up or is there not a way to avoid the fees ? Lets hope it goes UP!

@_date: 2017-12-14 07:34:27
Positivity ? Upvote!

Im going to do a small investment tomorrow at the bitcoin ATM : how does it work ? What do i need . And is bitcoin taxed ? Do i have to put it in my taxes if im just going to be transferring to my bank in the future ? And how is the coinbase app ? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:53:49
That program is a hardware wallet and is free correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:59:55
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:23:26
Nope . Reported
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:54:45
Can you please explain what is an escrow ? 
And yes i look for that feedback . Have you ever done a cash meet up?
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:31:03
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:47:58
Forsure . 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:00:29
But why would i pay taxes if there still would be 0 transactions ? There would just be purchasing coin ?

@_date: 2017-12-14 07:29:39
I mean it is in the red right now but yeah whenever there is a huge dip again i will put more money
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:42:01
I dont want to deal with 3rd party stuff i dont trust any of that . And i dont want to report anything to the IRS . The more money the larger the fees?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:33:05
Thank you! Im thinking of buying a whole litecoin before if blows up . But im not too sure lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:32:47
Yup im on ios thats why i couldnt find . Ill look into that program . I really just want to see my money and where its at . All that basic stuff . Im not looking to cash out or buy stuff im young and dont want to have a crazy tax process . 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:48:34
Is this how you create a bitcoin paper wallet ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:05:13
Are you your own bank or you have a 3rd party like coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:07:30
Im about to look into that escrow stuff . I gotta figure out what exactly it means . The median with this guy is low and the average is super high . 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:59:10
Dont play with my heart like that haha . Pm me if youre serious lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:04
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:41:46
I love your positivity ! Upvote ! Have you use localbitcoin before ? Is that anon ? As in will i have to report to my taxes ? That 30% fee will not happen again i found another atm that supposedly is 8%. So imma check it out soon
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:14:49
Airbitz is a wallet too tho? I cant find a app called that . Pm a link if you can
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:29:33
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:27:43
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:49:42
Was just doing research and i cant afford to buy a hardware wallet but it also sounds complicated with the encryptions and a secure phrase n such . I also was thinking to start with a 100$ investment
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:48:07
Can you pm me ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:52:09
Nah . I just didnt do research on the ATM fees . Another local atm is at 8% and i might do localbitcoin ... chill
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:37:59
They say you learn the hard-way and yessir i did lol . Any way to avoid fees or calculate the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:06:40
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:38:55
Also if i check my balance i wont have to report to IRS ? As in it doest count as a transaction?  Correct?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:51:01
Coinbase the app to hold / managw my bitcoin ? So i must cash out this year ? I cant hold for as long as i want? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:04:54
Thank you so much . Just made a paper wallet with your site ! Ah the colors and stickers make it look so cool might have to buy the package soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:31:05
*plays chief keef*
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:15:51
Thats what im thinking . Forsure then . 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:59:06
Can i hold forever ? Or i must cash out within a year? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:15:46
What is it exactly? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:31:12
Sounds legit but i want to be anon just like when i put cash into the atm and scan my paper wallet . I dont want or have a digital wallet because im avoiding doing transactions that i must report to the IRS . 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:56:19
Also is it better to buy from someone with higher or lower “Price/ BTC” 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:50:28
Can you please PM me ? If you have used it before
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:59:08

@_date: 2017-12-14 01:47:04
How can i know if fees decrease ? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:15:14
Thank you so much man . Any idea about the tax side of this post?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:49:15
I just dont want to do any transactions where i must report to the IRS in the USA
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:27:15

@_date: 2017-12-12 05:53:39
Thank you

@_date: 2017-12-15 06:33:48
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:51:50
But coinbase has a fee to move the money no ? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:45:11
I just want to experience the atm :) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:48:23
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:11:32

@_date: 2017-12-14 04:58:26
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:19:43
Blockchain is 3rd party?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:47:29
If i have .004 and it goes up how do i calculate to cash ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:52:59
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:00:34
Hey i just made a localbitcoin acct with a throwaway gmail . It says that i have an online wallet . If i want to stay anon and use my paper wallet how can i do so ? Im still trying to play this safe 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:53:30
Same thing with litecoin? Is it worth investing ? Also i can hold on to my coins for as long as i want and i wont have to put it in my taxes because i didnt “realize “ appreciation?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:09:33
You’re welcome : 
What i have learned is ... HODL ! And only invest what you can afford to lose . 
Also to calculate how much money youre at is .. ( .003(your investment) * 16,000$ (bitcoin price)  
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:02:33
Idk who you are but damn youre helpful . Imma shoot a pm
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:14:34
How you do that haha 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:09
Thank you sir
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:44:05
Nope no fingerprint i scanned my paper wallet QR code . 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:37:00
Bitcoin atm .

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:14:03
Thanks crazy . Nice!
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:19:25
Oh thats crazy its like a middle man . But whats up with the time difference tho
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:08:36
I have ios which app would you recommend ? None really have good reviews . Im liking the airbitz reviews n such . 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:30:19
And how can i get a hardware wallet ? I dont wanna use paper . I would think that the wallet apps would show how much my money is going up right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:56:59
Cool . I just made this post to confirm it is only taxed if theres even a single transaction. I think im going to invest and just hold . 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:59:36
Can i pm you?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:25:02
Ugh :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:52:25
Coinbase is a third party thing and has fees . I read the wiki here . Thats why i got the app i mentioned
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:25:39
Oh okay sorry i didnt know . 
Please if you can pm me an ios app link im interested . 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:13:23
Can you please pm me or check out my recent post?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:45:57
Cant i get scammed on that site ? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:33:31
Isnt a paper wallet the safest ? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:35:33
Explain GDAX please ? If i want to invest more today how can i avoid fees?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:13:06
When you first type the machine it asks for a phone number to send a verification code 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:55:16
I dont know what that means but sounds sick
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:53:40
Paper wallet gang
