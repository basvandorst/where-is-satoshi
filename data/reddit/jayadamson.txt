Haha, I was thinking of this very idea. But would make much more sense for the major players to start accepting coin than creating a competitor with that tiny advantage
TL;DR - No

localbitcoins.com. You pay a premium, but can also sell at that same premium.

I work with a few regular families. Christenings, birthdays, first steps, that sort of thing. I'm good friends with this particular family and see them regularly, even when not taking their photo. Fundamentally, we're on the same level when it comes to banking/government/fiat currency/poor economy so after I was introduced and learnt the basics, I introduced him and he instantly saw its potential. Now he can pay me directly, bypassing the central banks. "It's my money, I earnt it, you don't need to be involved anymore", said the freelance photographer to the banking system. Who knows, maybe by the end of Spring the whole shoot will cost 0.001BTC :D
As for introducing clients who aren't close personal friends to Bitcoin, jeez, I wouldn't know where to start right now. Except refer them here or ask them to google it. I don't want to start getting "political" with the clients.

Very! I feel a real sense of empowerment over my own destiny for the first time in... well, ever.

It took him that long to create it...

localbitcoins.com I've used them. Had the coins in an hour. Slightly above market price but you can always sell them there too.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:49:12
I think it'll settle at ~$35 but will take a few weeks to get there
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:30:29
Excellent! Thanks for the reply
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:37:16
fine here too

I do mean the fiat figure. I find it to be extremely accurate, apart from the recent two day, hence the post. I already use a variety of other tickers

I liked this Matrix reference, shame on those downvoters :)

Bit of a short story. Heard about Bitcoin from a friend a couple of weeks ago. Loved the idea and bought a few (not many!) coins off him. He has more than enough to spare. Anyway, I'm a photographer by trade and decided I was going to start offering a chance to do a chunk of my business using Bitcoins. So far I've sold two full resolution digital jpg's (for 0.1BTC each) and I've got a family shoot in late Spring, wanting to pay in BTC! **edit** who knows where the price will be in a couple of months, as such, we've not agreed a BTC amount yet. **edit**

Very few people use Intersango. That exchange died Q4 2012, when they stopped UK bank transfers. I doubt anyone would bother attacking it.

If you're asking this, then I doubt you'll need to worry about capital gains tax.

Absolutely, kudos for being so observant. It's great to see the community keeping the community safe.

I don't think likes hearing stories of people making good decisions. I say, well done to you.

Multibit reads and restores .json files. Unfortunately bitcoin-qt doesn't. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:07:25
I thought the same as you, so I sold ~20% of my holding. If it drops sharply, I'll buy back in. If it continues to rise, I still have ~80% benefitting from the rise in price.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:16:59
Look for the peaks and troughs in the charts and *try* and *predict* where the next one will be. Buy and sell your way back to your initial *investment*.

Nikon 5100, various lenses ranging from 18-55 stock lens, 50mm 1.8g for portrait work, and 18-200mm for landscapes.

localbitcoins.com, you could have coins in your wallet in the next few minutes!

buy 999 more?

Agreed, I call BS based on plasmoske's finding. Shame they were caught out so quickly, looks like they spent a lot of work on the site :P

Your poor security practices are not Mt. Gox's problem. There are plenty of posts on here with the very best information on securing your account properly. I take it you didn't have 2-factor authentication enabled?

Difficulty won't stay constant for a year. Although I have no concrete figures, I'd say it could just about pay for itself in 6 months.

Thanks for the comments. I've tried all that and nothing. It's not like I'm new to BTC either. This is more complicated than it has to be. Someone sent me 0.005 verify, I send the tip bot an accept message and nothing. Maybe they just wrote the words or something. Highly pissed off at my own ineptitude 
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:49:18
Ah well, it sucks, but is only $200 at the end of the day. A cheap lesson that could've been learned for a much higher price.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:30:59
Oh right, I wasn't aware. I just logged into my intersango account now and it's a ghost town. About 50 coins on the Bid wall and 30 coins on the Sell.
