I know its a joke but he will just ask you to send some very small amount so it will appear from that address first.

I also made an account on coinbase, and blockchain.
But where can I get coins in Israel?

BTC worth was a bit too volatile recently so I cashed out at the recent peak and I was too busy to have it on my mind.

this can't really work anymore?

I closed the tab, but it was still in history. And since there is  no
authorization to access invoice pages, it opened again (but now I had two opened :/ and I paid the old one). And the refund button is just a email to them with the invoice number in body of the message, anyone could use them and for the same reason above, doesn't seem so secure you can find number on google.

Actually the exchange the withdrawal  worked pretty well (in bitpay's time window), it wasn't the problem. I had fiat there that I need to get out and it was easier for me.

I think bitpay and bitcoins accepting companys are a bit tolerant right now. I hope that stays that way in the future, or there will
be more fool proof and robust way to pay.
Glad it worked out for you.

Yea I figured so, and that's why I had trouble contacting them, since the only way on their (cjs) site is with a support ticket and  I tough it might show on their knowledge base recent page. So I found a email to contact them by searching the page and when I sent a email it still opened a support ticket :| but it wasn't visible to the public.
