I meant August 7th.  I've edited my original post.
Thank you for the privacy tip, I expected as much, and since no one seems to have seen this issue before I think now is a good time to take the screenshot down
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:18:40
I'll try this, thank you.  But to be clear, my issue is that there is tx on Aug 8th that I did not authorize, not that it isn't showing up on ledger live
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:00:04
no, the device was unplugged and sitting it a drawer during the time of this tx
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:50:41
I verified the address that it came from was an Amazon warehouse, and I really feel it's unlikely that someone would successfully alter the device. maybe if I were a Winklevoss twin this would make sense in a coordinated mission impossible style attack but I just don't think it's what happened here

Thanks for all this
The outgoing transaction you mention was made after I discovered this situation, this was me sending the full amount to another address I own to a different wallet.  This is mentioned in my original post.


I appreciate the insight about the IP/Blockexplorer connection - I had not thought of that.
Also I appreciate the insight about running my own node off a raspberry ip, I will look into this.
I don't know if this is malware, or something else.  I originally thought that it was an internal process on the Nano S that moved the btc around for some reason.  I now know that is not the case, and that no one reading this post has encountered anything like this in the past.
I definitely feel the community getting a bit defensive on this. and I understand that it looks like user error, I would think the same thing if I saw a reddit post like this.  I assure you that it's not user error, I would not even know how to send btc from one address to another in the same wallet like that.
I am contacting Ledger about this today and I'll update this thread.  I don't mean to trash them at all, and I do trust their devices.  It's possible this one was tampered with (another posted suggested this) and to be clear I did not buy this device directly from Ledger, but from Amazon, which I will not do again.

I'm hesitant to do this because I'm very security conscious.  I understand the difficulty in debugging without this info, I was more just wondering if anyone else has seen this, and it looks like no one has so far.

Same on [live.blockcypher.com](

I will do this, thank you for the suggestion.
I'm also of the opinion nothing malicious is happening here, because if so, I would have lost the btc.
However, if there was malware on the device (unlikely) then it seems it can only move btc between addresses on the wallet, and not off the wallet
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:12:21
It likely was, which explains why i still own the btc.  Is there an easy way to tell the seed for the address?
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:34:06
I didn't init a new wallet with this seed, and if someone else had successfully done that, I don't think I'd own this btc anymore
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:35:02
if seed stolen I would not longer own the btc which I do.. unless the hacker was being nice.  This was sent between addresses in my own wallet

not satoshi but knew him
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:59:40
Correct, the tx is not visible on the device itself, but appears on the blockexplorer at [blockchain.com]( 
I have just verified again on [blockchain.com]( that this does exist.
A bug with the blockexplorer at [blockchain.com]( would explain this.  I will try looking up on another blockexplorer
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:56:14
I am a developer, and I'm aware that most bug reports or issues of this nature are user error or user misunderstanding.  That is not happening here.
I have nothing to gain from this, and I have lost nothing.  I am just looking to see if any others have experienced the same thing (with a Nano S, or any wallet for that matter), and no one has yet to say they have seen or heard about this.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:43:38
OK I have added a screenshot to the original post and I've removed some details
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:59:01
understood.  thank you for this
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:23:12
No.  They just saved your BTC if you were going sell.
If you contact support about this, it should be to thank them.
