or the bubble pops and you are left with something less valuable then wow gold
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:59:10
your argument doesent make much sense and relys on speculation and holding them to two entirely different standards
the dollar is hyper inflated and unstable, despite the fact the worse inflation rate in its 250 year existence being 1/10th that of bitcoins, and such big changes being common with bitcoin, hell just this month it had a change of almost 30%, how can one be unstable when the "stable" currency is literally 10 times worse?
and thats entirely speculation, you have no math or trend to back the idea it will become  more, stable just your own beliefs more importantly thats completely irrelevant, if its not stable NOW then its not a good store of value NOW, the fact it might hypothetically in the future stabilize doesent change that

no im using dollars as an easy to understand representation of general value, replace it with 5 gold ingots or 3000 twinkys or just 100 abstract value points if you want 
also as long as there is no major economic disaster the dollar is stable(relatively, nothings a perfect store of value after all) if it wasent stable it wouldn't have survived as a currency this long, 
certainly more stable then BTC or any other  crypto currency, just since the start of this year its gone from 3000 to 1,2000 and  took a nose dive from 16,000 to that 3000 the year before that, thats an inflation rate of over 400% for comparison  that absolute worse inflation rate over a year period for the USD  was 30%

we are talking value of the total supply of BTC not literal paper dollars, an individual BTCs value being tied to value of the total amount of BTC does not make it stable since the value  of the total amount of BTC is not stable, thus its still a shit store of value

so you are pro terrorism,  pro-drug cartel  pro-child sex trafficking then?
so its not actually good at making money and just as likely to fuck you over, making it a bad investment 
and nothing on that list is useful to a normal person who isent a meth head pedophile
@_date: 2019-08-20 17:18:41
im sorry are you trying to say its use to gangs and terrorists to pull illegal shit is a positive? you can also watch it dip and loose a fuckload of money because its value isent stable, or you know make a lot and then have it all stolen because its not secure
yes such as buying a car, paying for services, paying for school, paying bills, and a bunch of other things bitcoin can not do
but you need to exchange it for fiat to actually do anythign with it, as you yourself have admitted it can basiclly do jack shit if your not looking to buy child porn
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:18:44
things you listed: buying illegal things, laundering money, tax evasion, profit off the drug trade, none of these are legal ma dude

so the " currency of today" cant actually be used as currency today?  if its purpose is not to be exchanged for goods and services its not a currency, its a get rich quick scheme 
because they are? they can be exchanged for goods and services anywhere in the country, which gives them value, i cant go buy lunch or pay my bills with bitcoin and its value is unstable so it doesn't work as an intermediate in a trade system, which was kind of the point of currency
also arent you assigning value to fiet to since you admit bitcoin doesn't have everyday use so its value comes from being able to be traded for fiat?
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:49:09
its pretty clear cut, store of value is the ability to well, retain its value, value if something makes a good store of value you can buy $500 of it today and be reasonably sure that 5 years down the line you can sell it for somewhere roughly around $500
, BTCs prices are not stable and fluctuate to much, 5 years down the line 500$ in BTC might be worth $800, might be worth $300. might have collapsed and be worth jack shit

finance degrees dont teach you how to use money,again just using it easy, literally children understand it, it teaches you how to manage a large amount of money to make more money or reduce the amount you spend, you need a degree to make a job out of managing money, not just normal every day use

"1BTC is always exactly 1/21000000 of the total supply." we dont measure value in percentage , because the value of the total supply can still change, if the value of the total drops to half so does the individual BTC, 1/21000000  of a dollar and 1/21000000  of 100 billion dollars are both 1/21000000  the total supply but they are not at all equal in value

dude if you need to read a manual on how to use your currency its not working beautifully, its money, the instructions should be step 1. give money step 2. receive goods and services, end of instructions
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:14:50
but if they can ONLY be used for evil things, which is the only things you have been able to list, then yes they are evil
meth head pedos and also people who have been tricked into thinking it will be useful for osmehting else or will make them rich, but you have shown you very much know its not useful for other things and is not a good investment if you arent doing illegal shit so the fuck man

i was more talking about the analogy  used by op and also if you look at the overall price its making a general downward trend these past few years

don't uh, don't roller coasters always go down after going up?
