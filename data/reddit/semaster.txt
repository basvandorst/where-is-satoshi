If you do not want to install it yourself than you can use any public node from list  
I can advise public p2pool node 
You can switch between nodes and all your work in p2pool network will be saved.

it is not 'Cryptographic' too. it is simple digital currency.
for example every browser can use ssl but it doesn't mean that browsers are "Cryptographic browsers'
and every service that use authentication is not calling 'Cryptographic service'.
the same with bitcoin - it is nor 'Cryptographic' only because it uses some sha algorithms

I will buy only from stock. especially with bfl - no preorders
they do dirty business:
- pay for great device for now
- wait a year while they spend your money
- get device (in a year) that do a little bitcoins that never cover the cost of device
