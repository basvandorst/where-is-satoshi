I’m assuming he went North until he hit it.
Are you this unfamiliar with our Double Double for real?

Wish I could upvote this twice
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:02:35
Did you try Tim Hortons while walking through Canada?
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:43:39
Sellers are smellers.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:16:44
Wow. That’s wild in retrospect.

Nobody puts Bitcoin in a corner.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:31:11
Just get a Ledger. Done and done.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:40:02
Wake me up at Lambo
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:21:01
I’m a Kraken guy.
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:31:16
Shit is shit
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:41:00
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:02:06
Well done, amigo.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:33:55
Recess is over. Get back to class.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:12:16
I would just leave it parked there until the Ledger arrives.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:18:44
All day, every day.

Drugs are bad, m’kay?
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:36:10
See you in July, Nostradamus.
@_date: 2019-07-06 01:00:05
Doesn’t seem particularly complimentary.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:11:06
Yeah, that jibes with what I’m hearing as well.
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:03:31
Coinbase is by far the most user friendly. I know complete morons who had zero problem getting verified and then buying/trading. I’m talking serious morons. 
Kraken was my initial foray a few years ago since they were one of the few exchanges that had Canadian fiat for deposits and withdrawals and I’ve been pretty loyal since. Not to get overly fanboi but heir security is second to none AFAIC.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:00:00
It’s not hard. Once you buy crypto on an exchange you *immediately* move it to your cold storage wallet. JFC people. If you have $1000 worth on an exchange, it is vulnerable so understand you might lose a grand. If you an afford this, carry on. 
If you have $10,000 worth of crypto parked on an exchange, you’re a dumbass.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:28:12
JFC r/Bitcoin attracts the stupidest fucking people.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:35:10
JFC seriously?
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:09:02
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:20:29
Had nothing but good experiences with Kraken.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:01:16
If it doesn’t I’m gonna ridicule the fuck out of him.
@_date: 2019-10-30 22:02:46
Have you considered a time machine? Might be more realistic.
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:29:17
My god her pants are terrible.

@_date: 2019-06-27 02:10:28
Whatever it is it’s way too high and only 10% are amusing.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:29:05
JFC that’s stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:26:45
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:00:51
I’m a big fan of Kraken.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:58:05
I haven’t deposited fiat to Kraken in ages, but a wire XFR from a Canadian bank to an intermediary bank to Japan takes a few days. Again, just my previous experiences.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:26:49
Even point  is ass because bumper stickers are lame af
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:13:42
Sorry to hear that. I’ve had nothing but good experiences depositing fiat to Kraken, in that it has never taken more than a few days for the funds to be there. That said, I’ve never sent more than $8k at a time.

@_date: 2019-12-10 17:16:29
As funny as it is fresh and original. Bravo.
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:55:41
No, it isn’t tbh.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:53:28
Ugh. Terrible. Your teenage is showing.
@_date: 2019-09-09 22:31:57
The post is juvenile and doesn’t belong here. It’s lame.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:05:56
You’ve got cabbage in your muff!
