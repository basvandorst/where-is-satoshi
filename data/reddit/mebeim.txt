0.2 BTC is indeed a good amount. If you want to be super safe I would suggest you to buy an hardware wallet (like the Ledger Nano S) so that you have your private keys and your coins are safe. Once you have it you can send all the funds to the address provided by the hardware wallet like a normal transaction. Otherwise if you do not want to buy an hardware wallet and only want to move the coins from the current position you can create a wallet on Blockchain.info and once you have it set up you can send all your funds to the address of your new wallet (again like a normal transaction). There are no hidden costs except for the transaction fee to transfer the money.

I'm calling BS on this article. There is **no way** 7nm is even near production level. 5nm are basically a dream right now, and 3.5nm? Well, it's not a question of money or time, at that point it's just the laws of physics that make it basically impossible.
Also, first comment on that article:
  &gt; Mike Bowman - a month ago: Ok I will say this and say this once. I DIRECTLY work in the semiconductor industry. I'm a diffusion engineer for the Thermal Processing Systems department at one of the biggest fabs in the world making computer chips. 7nm is not massed produced yet! I repeat...7nm is not massed produced yet! IBM at the College of Nanoscience and Engineering just finally created 7nm like 6 months ago....in R&amp;D! Let me explain a KEY component in the process. ASML makes the photolithography machine to make 7nm. It's called an EUV (Extended Ultra Violet) litho process. At the Nanoscience school the machine was built into the ground to reduce vibration on the Ziess lens. We are currently building the bay still for the machines. I see they have moved like 1 machine in...or parts of it. It will take another 6 months to a year to get them installed. You need a bunch of them. They cost about $150 million each! 10 would be a good start. I think this place is getting 5-6 of them. Hard to say, the bay is super weird. Unlike a bay I've ever seen doing this for 18 years. Samsung, Intel, TSMC, and Global Foundries are all currently ramping for 7nm...but we aren't there yet. There is ZERO talk of 5nm and 3.5nm might be impossible. That's 5-10 years away still! My company had to design a whole new machine to handle 7nm (NT333) and it's only in a few fabs. I'm having a hard time trying to get trained on one because the only one that's working is at the college! Great times ahead but I laugh when I read this article because some random company magically is getting 7nm before Intel chips? No way! I'd be weary they will be 7nm. Probably more like 10nm-16nm. But since they said next year I can possible see 7nm later in the 2018...like Q3 or Q4. Forget about 5nm or 3.5nm. It's not even developed in R&amp;D yet. 7nm was a HUGE feat announced all over the news. You'll hear the same with 5nm.

Exactly what I'm thinking. I tweeted at them asking this. It looks like this "exploit" only enables SSH. You still have to log in and it is still in the local network only. Also, I don't really think you can do anything serious through SSH like flashing the firmware or similar stuff. I don't know about this.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:13:08
Agree. Also, nobody has SSH ports forwarded by default on the internet, so this is pretty useless unless you invite someone in your home and give them access to your private network to hack you.

Oh ok, that would actually make more sense...

The ultimate secure wallet can be achieved pretty easily if you have time and some money. You'll need an offline PC (let's call it P-OFF) and an online PC (let's call it P-ON).
1. Buy a Laptop to use as P-OFF, this doesn't have to be the next gen gaming monster since it only serves the purpose of storing your private keys.
2. Download Electrum on P-ON and sync it to the network. Also, remember: always **check the hash and signature** when downloading software before installing it.
3. Download Bitcoin Core &amp; Electrum on a pendrive with P-ON and then install it on P-OFF. You don't need to connect P-OFF to the internet and sync the blockchain, just install it.
4. Create one address (or more) on P-OFF and export the public address to the P-ON so that you can watch it using electrum.
Now you have two separate machines: one which only stores your addresses and private keys (P-OFF) and is not connected to the internet, and one which serves as an intermediary for any transaction you would like to send/receive.
Of course you should make it sure that your P-OFF is **always offline** and **password protected**, and you should always be 101% sure you can access its data at any moment, so it would be best for you to use a BIP39 mnemonic to remember your private keys and put it somewhere safe to make sure that even if P-OFF is destroyed you'll still be able to retrieve your coins.
To send a transaction you'll have to:
1. Create an unsigned transaction with Electrum on P-ON using the address you have stored on P-OFF.
2. Copy the data on a pen drive and copy it to P-OFF, then sign it with your private key and save the signed transaction on the pen drive.
3. Copy the signed transaction on P-ON and broadcast it to the network.
This is the most secure way of having a BTC wallet since the wallet itself (private keys) is always offline and safe in your P-OFF machine, and the keys **never** get out of the machine. This is the exact same mechanism used by hardware wallets like Trezor etc. Of course buying a little hardware wallet device like Trezor is far more simple than this, but you asked for it and so I'm answering. This process may seem easy and fast, but is actually pretty easy to fuck things up and lose all your coins (e.g. if you lose access to P-OFF or if you lose your private keys or if you store the keys on P-ON by mistake, or if you wrongly copy even one character of your private keys), so if you really want to do it you should first try it out on a new empty address.
Here's a more detailed guide if you want to know the exact commands and steps to take: [Safely Transfer Bitcoin from a wallet.dat File to Anywhere, Using Air-Gapped Offline System, Bitcoin Core, and Electrum](

Buy an island? I don't fucking know man. WTF.

The point is to be 101% sure you should actually buy a new pendrive, run a antivir scan on your P-ON (or better use linux so you're basically sure there's no virus), then download the Bitcoin Core and Electrum, check their signatures using GnuPG and put them in the pen drive. To check signatures using GnuPG you'll have to download the signature file for the program (usually a file with .asc extension) which should be provided on the same site (e.g. bitcoincore) and GnuPG from the [official site]( then run a test from command line. Checking GPG signatures is simple, just google "GnuPG verify signature" and you'll find several guides. You want to check signatures to be sure that what you downloaded is the original and untouched program that is hosted on the site, and it hasn't been modified by an attacker while you were downloading (this is very uncommon, but like they say: better safe than sorry).

Sorry for the question, but how does this work exactly? How can someone "boost" a transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:48:36
So this means this guy has a huge hashing power or something? Also how do you prioritize a transaction while mining?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:51:36
You are indeed right my man, sorry for the error, the private keys are created on the P-OFF of course! Follow the link I provided which explains better.

No way, people managed to get a Model 3B (latest) to run a full node with CPU always at 100%. I wouldn't try running a full node on something less powerful than that.

Either that's insider trading or bullshit, either way I don't buy it (the claim not the BTC LOL).
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:01:49
I think we are far from another significant increase. BTC is weak right now, more or less like any other Crypto. Yes we might see some price rise, but nothing big imho. Anyway that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:59:09
Fair point, I suppose I can give you that.
