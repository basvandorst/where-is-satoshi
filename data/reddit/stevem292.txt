looking more and more like yesterday's man, andresen is looking to 'spend more time with his family' - a politician's statement if ever there was one...
he's seen the demise of hearn's reputation, and is now realising that he's viewed in a stark light by many for his repeatedly politically motivated actions - the ludicrous, corrupt  'Foundation', the insidious 'XT' and the degenerate 'Classic' (Bitcoin as a democracy Gavin ?  GTFO....)
it seems to be a technical cusp for the project - versionbits/segwit/relative locktime - and it also seems it's time for some around it to fade away... so be it.

my understanding is that no, you have no idea of A being the initiator, or D as destination -the onion layer encryption of the HTLC determines your ability to 'know' where you are in the routing process - i think the idea is for you to only know as much as you need to to play your part in the payment process and nothing more.

you sequentially making 100 $1 deposits to your channel and 100 $1 payments from it to the recipient is, i suppose, not impossible, but would take time and a method to do it that i'm not aware of existing presently.
(also, in reality a $1 channel has a max payment capacity of less than $1 so it would actually take more than 100 deposits/payments ).
it's an interesting thought though, and it seems some of the replies here aren't really engaging with it on the terms you asked.

it requires a core node 0.16.3 or 0.17.0
also requires a tx-indexed blockchain which can take a long time to generate if you don't already have it (days) - but it's worth it.
windows installation video on youtube -
if installing on linux, check java version, get java runtime environment if you don't have it, get openfx
java -version
sudo apt-get install default-jre
sudo apt-get install openjfx
personally, i run eclair from Downloads folder, so to run it -
cd Downloads
java -jar eclair-node-gui-0.2-beta6-3fc5da0.jar   (or whatever eclair release you're using)
there's also some further conf commands that can be added to the basic ones in the video tutorial - github list
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:45:57
i don't know if you've seen this - or if it meets your needs, but other than the fact that it requires a tx index of the blockchain (which can take a long time to generate if the Bitcoin node doesn't already have it), it seems pretty simple as an installation  process.
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:07:38
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:02:53

@_date: 2017-01-22 08:07:18
i kind of get the segwit approach - 1mb of tx data, or 1mb+ with the witness data retained - the thing i'm not clear on is why the data is retained by anyone - is there a reason to retain that data, either an individual reason, or a general 'network' reason for that ?
i'm trying to weigh up the value of either pruning or retaining it
@_date: 2016-12-10 20:20:48
sounds like the XT and Classic crew's vocabulary - why, it's almost as if scaring up anti-segwit sentiment is the latest angle of attack on the project...

there are a variety of options for dealing with bandwidth restrictions - 
remember, you aren't just running a full node to 'serve' the network at large, but to engage in trust minimization in the arrangement of your own affairs, as ALL nodes independently do - it is still by far the most advantageous way to interface with Bitcoin.
another option, and entirely bandwidth free, would be to connect to the Blockstream satellite downlink - the project is progressing nicely, and is becoming much easier to set up.

as others have commented here, it's most likely that your router settings need to be changed to give a static i.p. to the os on the device you are using - look in the 'DHCP Reservation'  tab in your routers settings to do this.
the reservation template will require a number to be supplied by you - open a terminal and type ifconfig (or ipconfig in windows) which will show ethernet/wifi internet connection data - you will want the last digit of the ipv4 internet addr - it will look something like 192.168.0.2 - (in that example you would use the digit 2 at the end of the addr).
you'll need to forward the port to that number too - some routers call that tab port forwarding, but other names are used - my old router called it 'virtual server' for example.

none of it - it's the default fallback position of those who cannot win the argument with information/facts/evidence to try to nullify it all by shouting 'racist'.
it's been a successful strategy at broad levels in western countries for a long time now to extort whole societies into going along with things they'd never otherwise agree to - but both in the political sphere and here, thankfully,  it seems to be losing it's power.

is there an upper limit on how many signatures can be combined - 10, 100, 1000 ?
and could this be an enhancement to coin join-like approaches ?
if so, it could mean a significant increase in transactions per block - and if among them were lightning channel openings, cheaper opening fees too.

200+ hard drive space, and GB's of sent and received information each week.
this varies depending on how you choose to configure the node, however.
whether you forward port 8333 on your router, whether you choose to limit numbers of incoming connections,  and whether you choose to enable pruning/ blocks only greatly affects the traffic and storage requirements of running the node, with the caveat that each of these approaches affect levels of participation at the network level  (principally the serving of historical block information to other nodes/wallets, and awareness of unconfirmed transaction information in the case of blocks only).

you would at least need to download the chain in order to verify it, but the configuration of the node is possible - pruning, port forwarding,and the limiting of connections, upload limits and more are also available options -

it's rapidly developing on various fronts, so shitcoiners and spooks are getting ants in their pants about it.
personally, i'm gleefully pressing my face up against the glass, watching main net formalise - it's even outpacing developers ability to keep a lid on it, the market is so hungry for what it can offer - it's clearly going to be huge.

they mostly know, but are part of a system based upon what's being described - they're never gonna 'listen', or 'change'.
political rhetoric is largely irrelevant, or at least only of marginal importance anymore - actually getting on with changing the monetary system is the only really useful strategy.
the stakes are very high for BTC - you could say the extent to which it can provide a 'solution to the problem of banking' is the extent of the success of the project.

you need to remove the bluematt PPA from your software sources list, and then add  luke's PPA

then install thru your software updater.
once running, you can look in Help/Debug window/Information to see the User Agent label.
or go to  and 'check node' to view User Agent, (and various other info).

to enforce BIP148 you'd have to go to the UASF site - don't know if i'm allowed to link it - and download the appropriate UASF BIP148 binary, verify the integrity of the software and install it.
if you're on ubuntu or a derivative of it, you can get the luke-jr ppa from launchpad.net and install it through your software updater.
