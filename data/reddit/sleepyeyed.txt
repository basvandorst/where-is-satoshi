Yup. Not just with Bitcoin either. I bought about $300 of different cryptos and all have fallen below what I've paid for them with the exception of one. Just gonna hodl.

This is exemplary. If no one has mentioned it yet Doctors Without Borders is another excellent one. We need more people like you in this world.

You can purchase partial coins, no need to buy whole ones. I only invested a couple hundred and have watched it double. I keep purchasing more per week to build it up.

Huh, so does that mean I could buy bitcoin in the U.S. and sell at a profit in EU?

My moon consists of a Tesla in the driveway of the house that I own outright.

Good hustle there. Great addition to the conversation.

I'd prefer to have a physical card to use offline.

Uh, no.

I've just bought into Etherium also. Would be nice to hit a nice price spike in the next year or so. Guess I'll hodl for now.

This is fantastic. Just what I didn't know I needed.

I really, really, really hope you're right about that. I just started buying small amounts of bitcoin and would love to see this come true. I'm skeptical though and not putting too much into it yet, but the idea of not going in big now could hurt in the future. What are you basing your prediction on?
