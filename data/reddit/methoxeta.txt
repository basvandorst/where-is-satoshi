I never said cost to produce = intrinsic value. Cost to produce is, to me, more of a minimum value, and not one that works as a limit but rather a long-term expectation/projection/total guess. It's a price I would probably buy under, and sell over, for example. And I have no trouble admitting that this is all an opinion, not a fact.

That is no longer bitcoin.

bitcoin, at its most basic, costs what it cost the miner to generate in electricity, or otherwise what he's willing to accept in return for his mining investment. it's essentially commoditized computing power (including cost of electricity, cost of infrastructure &amp; machines, and cost to convince the miner to give it up).

Because it's cryptographically, mathematically, as of yet, not possible.

I don’t disagree with that. I also completely agree that mcafee is a useless dirtbag. Don’t understand why people listen to him. He’s just rich, that’s it. He made a crap security software 20 years ago that he admits he doesn’t use because its total shit, and yet people listen to him just because of name recognition.
As for the valuation of bitcoin, I personally think there’s numerous ways to look at it, just like with stocks. There’s fundamental &amp; technical ways of validating stocks. There’s endless variations from each perspective as well. There’s no single answer but the balancing of numerous. I wouldn’t discount the value of the network’s penetration just as I wouldn’t take away from the importance of how much it costs to generate one.

It would have to be. One of bitcoin's core parameters is that the limit is 21 million. Anything else is no longer conforming to the set of parameters that make up what we refer to as "bitcoin". It could be called Bitcoin (22 million edition), buttcoin, whatever you want, but that's a massive change in the economics established by the founder.

First of all Mcafee is a useless dirtbag. I do not understand why people listen to him. He’s just rich and famous, that’s it. He made a useless security software decades ago that he admits readily that he doesn’t use because its total shit, and yet people listen to him just because of name recognition. His opinion means nothing to me.
I don't disagree with the network penetration point.
As for the valuation of bitcoin, I personally think there’s numerous ways to look at it, in fact numerous ways you need to look at it. just like with stocks. There’s fundamental &amp; technical ways of valuating stocks. There’s endless variations from each perspective as well, and endless combinations of both. There’s no single answer to "what is a bitcoin worth". That's why there's so much volatility. In the end we'll see it's the balancing of numerous different ways of valuating it. I wouldn’t discount the value of the network’s penetration just as I wouldn’t take away from the importance of how much it costs to generate one.
