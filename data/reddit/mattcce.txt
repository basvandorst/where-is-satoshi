A couple of things. 
First off, bitcoin is not a good that is consumed, and hence the candy analogy breaks down at that point. The closest analogy here is monetary inflation. The *inflation rate* of bitcoin is effectively halving. It seems reasonably to treat this like an expected decrease in inflation in the next period, a commonly modelled situation (which I won't get into, but I'd encourage people to look into).
Secondly, let's be clear: we're not dealing with a supply shock. For a change in supply to be a supply shock it has to be unexpected, by definition.

As this information is public there is no real (fundamental) reason why this will happen - the price *should* already reflect this.
Though I do concede historically they have been correlated with bull runs.
*Edit* I'm really being downvoted for pointing out a pretty fundamental concept that people seem to be overlooking?

I'm not sure I fully understand your argument. 
I'll try to clarify mine: 
you, or perhaps more accurately the original commenter has placed a value on the fact that (increase of) supply will decrease on the halving date.
As this info is also known to everyone else, the price should reflect the information accordingly and at the date the value of bitcoin will not change for any individual (assuming everyone is rational and everyone has the info)
Edit for double 'date'

Yeah that's really the crux of the issue. If you feel that a large chunk of the market doesn't know this information, then you are getting an increased expected return for no added risk.
One argument against:
there are a lot fewer people buying &amp; selling bitcoin than all who own it or may theoritically buy it come closer the date. That smaller group would be much more clued in on the info, and they're the ones setting the (current) price.

Yeah cheers mate. It's slightly worrying but I guess is the nature of the beast
