Electrum isn't just a Bitcoin wallet, it's also a Python library. And it's the most developed and feature-rich library in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. The entire GUI of Electrum is actually just a wrapper for the Python library.
If you are specifically working with low level transaction construction Vitaliks old library is actually really good too.

Exactly what I was thinking. Hong Kong isn't some random third world country, this kind of trading volume is insignificant

We need lightning to work and fast because this is not an acceptable way to run a global currency at scale. This essentially makes micro payments impossible

I've been following this PR for the Electrum integration on Github.
Please for the love of god can you merge in those updates that implement PSBT as a separate feature. Electrum needs this functionality in a main release. You just developed the most needed feature on Electrum and it's just sitting around on a random branch we have to checkout commercial servers to

As someone who works for an exchange I can tell you it will be a logistical nightmare for every exchange involved.
If we have simultanious requests for withdrawals over a significant amount we have to perform an internal audit of trade history incase there's been a hack.
We then have to get on Skype with both the CFO and CEO to have them manually sign batches of withdrawal transactions from the cold wallets.
At the end of the day everyone would get their withdrawals but there would be big delays as we made sure no hack was occuring.

He is the most likely candidate to be Satoshi.
Come on, he basically invented Bitcoin with his Bit Gold, except for a few minor tweaks! Bitcoin is basically just Bit Gold with small changes to the way blocks are mined.
And why did Satoshi leave Bit Gold out of the whitepaper yet referance all the same referances from Bit Gold?
Lastly... Nick Szabo.. NS... SN... Satoshi Nakomoto.
I listened to a great podcast with Nick Szabo and Tim Ferris, the personality of NS perfectly fits SN. He's modest, articulate, intelligent, and intensely private... basically the complete opposite of Craig Wright.
