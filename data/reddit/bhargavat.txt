Lol no. Just no. That means they can only beg near the WiFi hotspots areas. I see bitcoin like I see mobile payments (ex: Apple Pay). Mobile payments are supposed to replace your wallet, but your wallet can’t simply be replaced because there’s more utility than just storing cash and credit cards. Plus other vendors have to accept mobile payments which requires additional infrastructure and that just isn’t feasible for every vendor

Taxes are a necessary evil. We need to have a well funded government so that our public areas and services can be utilized.

Geez. We all missed out on the bitcoin ride. This is the first time I am hearing someone kill themselves over not hodling their investment on bitcoin or any investment for that matter. Your brother is probably dealing with other issues and knowing that hodling could've made his life better made him feel even worse...
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:57:20
Lmao. Bitcoin isn’t going to go that far. What’s to stop blockchain from being used by the dollar? In order to use bitcoin, you need a smartphone and internet connection, which is not ideal for poor people. Can you imagine a homeless person begging for bitcoin? Also I think of bitcoin to be more of an asset than a currency. Assets going up in value won’t devalue currency.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:08:52
Again. This is not ideal for those cases. They need to be online to access their funds which sucks for them.  I cannot see this being practically used beyond the e-commerce market. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:38:27
I just can’t imagine a poor person being able to understand that level of technical depth. I got into bitcoin a few months ago and even I can’t understand everything about it 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:31:17
Or Hoddle
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:04:31
If that’s how you quit smoking then good for you. However, you don’t necessarily have to put your bad habit funds into something else. You can always hodl it...but buying bitcoin and hodling that isn’t bad either. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:35:38
Only thing I can think of is that large large of pizza from Costco for $2. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:06
That’s my point. The currency requires them to be internet connected. It solves one problem and create another problem 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:11
Ha what a fool. Eventually that $200m will be worth the same as Zimbabwe money is today ;P
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:04:20
Problem is that once you pay someone with bitcoin, there is no way to retrieve it back from them. Suppose you paid $100 and the seller never gave you the item. That means there is no central authority to get the money back for you. When you add the auditing and fraud protections, Bitcoin is essentially the same as the dollar but with more volatile pricing
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:49:22
I don’t get it. When people have a differing opinion they are criticized but when they have the humility to change their mind, they are called insincere or whatever...
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:04:42
Bitcoin is a great concept, but I found the process of transferring to be a bit cumbersome. My wallet address seems to change every instance that I need to copy it. I wish it was easy to pay with bitcoin like it is with Apple Pay and Venmo. Not to mention the volatility makes it worse. When I pay someone $10 this year, those $10 retain almost all their value the next year. However, $10 in bitcoin can either be $20 or $2 the following year or w/e. My favorite part of bitcoin is that there will only be 21 million in existence. Still have though, I’ll be hodling onto a few hundred dollars in bitcoin to see where it takes me :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:54:36
Ok so what happened to fiat being bullcrap and bitcoin being the savior? Shouldn’t bitcoin be used independently from fiat? I think bitcoin won’t be used much at brick and mortar but may gain some popularity in the e-commerce market. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:45:35
Good to know. I still think a username would be better than a large alphanumeric string. The concept needs to be a little more dumbed down for more acceptance or else people are going to see it as nerd currency 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:42:08
I do too. I just don’t understand why they would have to blatantly exaggerate their stats 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:25:50
More people are starting to realize that Bitcoin &gt; fiat in so many aspects. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:31:06
Even though there can only be 21 mil bitcoins, isn't it true that a handful of wallets hodled a massive quantity of them? Practically speaking only a few million are actually circulating in the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:23:56
How on Earth does it go from $5500 to $7000 in a week? That's absurd
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:23:58
It’s only a matter of time before they stop paying out I suppose. I’m guessing the fake numbers are for noobs to be fooled since they don’t realize that that only 16m are out there and a large chunk is not in circulation. If these numbers were actually true, they would be at Coinbase’s level. Now I feel stupid for gambling my money on this site :(. 
Payments are instant and balance it updating when it should so just gotta see if this site lasts long enough for an early bird like me to at least gain a bit of profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:12:57
What's next is always HODL
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:44:15
Not sure if the surge for the past week was people getting in on it for Thanksgiving. There might be a sell off soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:42:31
It may be decentralized but for newbies, wallet and exchange businesses like Coinbase/GDAX are considered a centralized entity because it lets people buy and sell their bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:21:31
Oh I see. The way you made him sound was like he was a technically inept and blue collar person. I assumed that someone with a 6-7 figure salary would know how to purchase or learn how to purchase crypto. I take back what I said :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:22:52
I just can't imagine a world where I go to a store and the price tag says something ridiculous like 0.0034385 BTC vs $29.95 or something. I think bitcoin will capture the e-commerce market but not brick and mortar
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:00:05
I’m not promoting it. I’m mentioning it because their site’s numbers are insane. I never mentioned anywhere that you should sign up. Just wanted to discuss the insanity of those supposedly accurate numbers. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:51:35
Welp...I signed up and they have been paying instantly so far. I deposited 0.01 to my account there and got instant withdrawals 4 times so far. 11 more times to go to be in the profit side. I’d be happy if they stick around even for just 1 month. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:46
Fucking love McAfee. He regularly goes on air and challenges the doubters. All of a sudden his 6-figure valuation per BTC sounds realistic. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:49:09
Aww. Sorry to hear that bud. Maybe the Reddit community can donate to your bitcoin address? :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:32:42
What are you waiting for???? JUST. DO IT!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:55:22
I was on a sports betting site and they took bitcoin. I bought 0.03 BTC for $155 and then realized that the amount I can earn by letting it sit is faster than the amount I'd gain from betting. After withdrawing my money back, I realized that I lost 0.015 :(. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:44
I've told my dad to buy it when it was in $5500s and he was one of those "bitcoin is a bubble" people. Even when it has hit $10k, he thinks it's not a valuable asset and thinks the bubble will pop any time. Unlike your dad, mine actually made a ton from stocks (quadrupled a $20k investment in Visa stock), so he has some credibility
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:50:43
So...definition of a bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:02:52
It's not a bubble because the technology is robust and secure. There is no basis for bitcoin to all of a sudden have bearish sentiments. Since it's a finite resource that can only be mined, it will not experience inflation. The increasing popularity of it will only take it to record heights. The best part of it is that it can be treated as a global currency and isn't exclusive to US market only. So with billions of people in the world and only a few millions of people owning bitcoin, the market can reach half of gold's market cap. There are simply too many benefits it has over fiat currency to pop like a bubble. It will experience temporary dips like when it went from 7000 to 5500, but it will keep increasing in value in this digital age.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:31:04
At the time of this comment: The website total deposits are 1.8m BTC and their users withdrew 422k BTC. How on earth does this particular HYIP have 1/17 of the BTC in the world in just 9 days?...Unless these numbers are lies. Whoever runs this site is loaded with money right now, even though a lot of it has to be returned back to users eventually...Just scary to think that they own over 1 million BTC
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:23:46
Yes! Bitcoin is plan B! Makes so much sense!
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:48:50
Buy high and hodl. Period.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:45:14
Probably feared that the bubble was popping and will start dipping to 6000 and stagnate
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:06
I dropped $500 @ $10,000 just now. I wish I didn't do it via limit buy. If the Great McAfee's words are true, buying it at a higher margin would make no difference if the ceiling is 6 figures
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:22:57
This GIF can be used to describe those who think bitcoin is in a "bubble" and will crash when it starts going down for a few hrs.

You may not like it but it is the 2nd highest used social media 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:00:28
I mean milk and gas are still $3 a gallon, so obviously it's bitcoin that's going since only 16-17 mil are in circulation.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:38:57
I’m wondering what happens when the number of bitcoins is near 21 million. Will people lose interest and switch to another crypto currency? If bitcoin can revolutionize currency, what’s to stop another thing revolutionizing currency again and being the better version of digital currency?
@_date: 2019-09-04 00:45:50
I don’t buy into the whole Bitcoin thing as a replacement for fiat. The reason fiat is great is because there are a lot of institutions in place that can act as an authority and help you store, lend, borrow, invest, and protect money. For example, I pay someone $100 but they don’t give me the item I bought off of them or it’s defective. I now have no recourse because there’s no authoritative entity that can help me recoup my funds in the case of fraud and the recipient can run with the money. By the time we get cryptocurrency to the same level of infrastructure as fiat, there will be little distinction and it’ll make you wonder what made you love Bitcoin in the first place. There are too many players in major fiat currencies that will let it get devalued. So fuck “freedom” with my cash given this limitation. Bitcoin is nothing more than a black market currency. Unless you live in a shithole country like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, you’re better off with your country’s fiat.

Google+ is like dogecoin. Ethereum is like Instagram and Twitter is like Litecoin
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:08:16
I suppose that might be the case. I can imagine Ethereum being a Samsung equivalent to Bitcoin’s Apple
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:15:45
I also think that the jobs back then didn’t pay as well as they do now for college degree holders at least. Nowadays, people in the right fields get $100k out of college, while some people may never earn that much

Yeah but the problem with cryptocurrency is the altcoin market is going offer many currencies with better features and transaction speeds. People seem to have trouble agreeing to 1 central coin. The distribution of this currency is also really screwed up. The USD is so powerful because of how widely accepted it is and how well regulated it is. We have banks and credit card companies that protect our money in case of fraud. Decentralization of currency is actually a bad thing. All it does is promote covert transactions and prevents governments from maintaining a civilized society with tax revenue. Not having a physical option for the currency hurts low income people. At best, it's an alternative form for storing value, but will never be widely accepted unless it shares the same characteristics as fiat.
