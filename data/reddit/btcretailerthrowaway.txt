First two sentences on Wikipedia - Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency introduced as open source software in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a cryptocurrency, so-called because it uses cryptography to control the creation and transfer of money.
You can see the confusion here, right?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:59:22
That's where the majority of us have landed here at the company.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:07:20
? Please tell me how it's different than a prepaid card?  You use $ and purchase an amount of BTC, just like a prepaid card, then you use that BTC to purchase things, again, just like a prepaid card, and you're asking for a refund in $ when you return your item purchased with the BTC/Prepaid Card?
There are two major differences:
1) Wild valuation fluxuations. (Can be a win or loss for BTC depending on the price you paid for your BTC.)
2) BTC technology is more secure than a prepaid card, but in your scenario, it'e performing the same functions. (Win for BTC)
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:45:14
? Prompt and irreversible? we're talking about a refund transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:54:54
We have many international operations and have currency hedges to protect us from fluxuations.  If this were an option, we'd be closer to adoption.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:44:10
I said I worked in the finance function for a major retailer... do you really think my office is located within a store?
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:46:57
Seems plausible, we'd have to look at our processes for verifying return reasons.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:24:01
haha, everyone is a troll if they don't want to show "proof" right?  Geez, the paranoia on reddit never fails to amaze
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:28:11
that my friend, is a great syllogism which illustrates the circlejerk around here perfectly...
1) if you ask tough questions, you must be a troll
2) if you're a troll, we don't have to provide you with answers
THEREFORE, 1) because you asked tough questions as such 2) we don't have to provide you with answers.
Keep your head in the sand bro.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:07:49
Depending on the product purchased, it can be returned even years later.    We can't afford to just hold the BTC while our shelves are empty, we have to purchase inventory from vendors to keep stock on the shelves.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:00:24
Then as soon as BTC users figure out they can cash out of BTC by simply buying and immediately returning items, we've become a de-facto BTC ATM. It's just not feasible in this configuration because returns are not free. We have to verify the return (pay a cashier/manager), restock the item, send back to a manufacturer if the box is damaged, etc. These are substantial costs.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:22:29
Since we started this thread, BTC price has dropped 8%.  If you bought a $1000 washer/dryer and returned it 6 hours later and only got $920 would you be cool with that?  And that's 6 hours, it's not even a full day or an extremely volatile day in BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:06:05
This illustrates the moral hazard perfectly.  A customer will want the $ value of the return if BTC drops substantially.  That same customer will want their return in BTC if the value rises substantially.  It's a lose/lose for the retailer at the moment.


Not sure we follow you here or how you got the idea we are trying to influence your purchasing decisions after the return is processed.  Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:57:23
Customers love when costs are passed to them.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:35:59
Lol, if I'm trolling, this is the greatest troll perpetrated on @_date: 2014-01-07 16:42:06
If our policy is to only refund in $USD, then we didn't exchange BTC, we exchanged the $ value, as such, the currency is still $s, the means of exchange is BTC.  As such, BTC is not a currency.
Currency and medium of exchange are not the same thing.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:44:22
We have many operations in foreign countries, we refund their purchases in those currencies.  We have hedging vehicles to protect us against forex fluxuations.  There are no such vehicles for BTC, yet.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:03:51
How do we prevent BTC users from abusing the return policy to easily convert BTC to $ just buy buying and immediately returning products?
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:16:27
it would if the $ was deflationary.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:02:14
They've lost 20% of their bitcoin, in many cases, no fault of their own... they're gonna be pissed. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:30:58
Then we have a risk they just return the item to get cash and we've become a de-facto BTC exchange.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:49:02
My point was that calling me a "fuck" and just saying "let them use it" without actually providing a solution to the real risks our organization has identified is not the best way to help a new technology grow.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:41:44


Lol, that's not legal.  That kind of false advertising can destroy a brand in hours.  As soon as the first redditor posted that they had returned something, you'd have a class-action suit from all the other folks who'd been forced into store-credit because of the NO EXCEPTIONS policy.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:04:38


We have not decided that piece either, we would likely not hold BTC for long as we'd need to purchase more inventory with it, but it's hypothetical right now.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:17:58
Good argument, I'll take that to my bosses.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:53:26
That's a huge issue that we've considered as well.  We'd be a de-facto exchange.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:53:08
Yeah, it's starting to appear that way.  The solution here has been, "just pay them in $s"
I thought BTC was a way to eliminate the $ and banks that issue it?  To remove the banking industry from the middle?
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:33:40
Haha, This.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:26:02
If you own BTC, would you be cool with this?  
Also, this creates the potential for a customer to use us as a de-facto BTC exchange.  Buying something in BTC, then returning it tomorrow for cash.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:19:24
Creates a new problem, users will just use our store as an exchange when they want cash for BTC.  They'll come in, buy an item with BTC, then walk to the customer service location and return it for cash.  This will create a ton of work for our employees for which we will see no benefit.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:37:38
Great response, I'm sure our bosses will be looking for some type of hedging vehicle (insurance, etc) to cover short-term fluxations before adoption becomes a reality.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:43:31
How do we prevent the risk of customers using us a BTC exchange by buying a product in BTC and returning it tomorrow for cash?  
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:35:17
Then why not just pay in $s?  What's the benefit of BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:54:05


No one takes days off anymore?  Even when most of the country is shut down with ice and freezing temps it's not possible that I'm at home and not my office?


I asked a question that's pretty tough, how do we accept bitcoins and minimize risk to the customer and to ourselves being that many of our purchases are durable items that can be returned.  We're not selling DVDs or groceries, we're selling things that have warranties and products that result in a large % of returns just by their nature. 


Can you return those gift cards to those retailers and get CASH?  Because that's what everyone here is telling us to do.  Pretty sure if you returned your merchandise you'd suffer the EXACT problem we're trying to solve here.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:34:10
You're right, assuming you keep the item in question.  When you pay for something (like a fridge) and keep it, you don't care.  When you pay for something and a week later return it and now you have .8BTC instead of 1BTC you paid, you're pissed.  
If we did this to customers, we'd have Better Business Bureau complaints all day long
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:28:45
ON CCs agreed, this was how we originally got into the discussion, we pay loads on CC fees.
On $s though, transaction fees are still lower than BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:56:06
In doing so, we'd become a de-facto exchange.  Want some cash for your bitcoin but don't want to wait for Mt. Gox or Coinbase?  Just buy something at our store with BTC and return it.  In the meantime, we'll be glad to cover the costs of stocking, ordering, paying employees, and adjusting inventory in the meantime.
Cmon man, that's a huge issue that's not covered by just giving cash back.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:07:23
Haha great post, Lowe's would definitely be the type of operation that would have to solve these issues as well.  Not saying who we are, but if we were going to roll something like this out, it would absolutely be in a limited release test.  It would be fun to see the look on a manager's face when they're told they're going to be the test store and they were likely to have 50,000 redditors coming in that day.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:00:18
Do you hold the cash value of the BTC in reserve?  How are you insuring against a 50% or more flash crash?
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:34:54


9% of sales or $264B in just the last 3 months is not just "in my head".  That's more than the GDP of many countries on earth.
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:59:00
Then as soon as BTC users figure out they can cash out of BTC by simply buying and immediately returning items, we've become a de-facto BTC ATM. It's just not feasible in this configuration because returns are not free.  We have to verify the return (pay a cashier/manager), restock the item, send back to a manufacturer if the box is damaged, etc.  These are substantial costs.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:42:55


Yep, that's apparent from the responses here.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:56:46
It's not convenient for a retailer to process return transactions, period.  There's restocking costs, cashier salaries, manager approvals, all of which cost money.  How do we as a retailer get compensated for those when the consumer just buys a $1k item with BTC with no intention of keeping it, just so they can turn around and return it and get cash because Mt. Gox takes too long.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:17:50
Haha, thanks, I knew that would happen a little with the circlejerking, but i expected legit questions to receive at least attempted answers.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:01:15
this is what we'll have to do.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:12:27
Not my intent, we are actively seeking a solution to the risks associated with accepting BTC as payment.  We are taking your comments seriously, however, the major solution everyone is offering is just to use USD to refund customers.
If the solution is to just use USD, then why accept BTC as payment?  You're not making a great case for adoption.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:17:33
That would be great.  We wish it were that simple, but asking the consumer to bear the risk is not really a solution, though, in a competitive environment.  Especially if we get out to their house to install something and it just doesn't fit, and they lose a couple hundred bucks, we'll lose them as customers for good, likely.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:47:07
Right, but to give them 1.12BTC back, we'd have to purchase BTC and incur additional cost to refund the customer.  This is a risk for which there is not a good hedging vehicle at present.  
As such, that's the solution we're looking for.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:01:54
Careful what you wish for, in this scenario you're not using BTC is not a currency, but rather, a payment method.  As such, it's not revolutionary because it's just a gift card that has wild valuation fluxuations.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:15:40
Really? no costs?
Costs: 
1) Advertising the new technology so that customers are aware - Marketing costs
2) Training thousands of employees on how to process the payments at stores all over the world - HR Costs
3) Preparing and approving new SOPs for accounting for BTC transactions - Finance Management Costs 
4) Ensuring compliance with all applicable laws - Legal Costs
And that's before transaction  has occurred.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:45:03
Sorry, have to maintain confidentiality, even the idea that we were considering bitcoin could cause a market response and likely get me and my teammates fired.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:47:31
Yes, another issue is the risk around returning $s when we accepted another form of payment (bitcoin).  If someone uses a gift card and returns the item, we issue store credit through another gift card, we don't give cash.  If someone pays with a credit card, we put the credit back on the card, we don't issue cash.
If someone uses BTC and we refund them cash, we create the risk that they just use us as a BTC exchange.  They think, "hmmm... the price of BTC is up, i'll go place an order for a fridge, then return it an hour later for cash"
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:39:26
Good point.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:12:12
Lol, who is the troll now?  I asked you a couple questions, and you didn't answer them, you just started attacking me.  I've thanked people for helping us understand the protocol better.  
The compensation we're potentially is getting a large retailer onboard with Bticoin.  
Have you tipped anyone in this post?  Have you added any discussion of value?


First time you've been accurate today.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:45:40
I guess that makes credit cards money, oh wait, they're a medium of exchange and NOT a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:01:32
Haha, well said.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:12:15
TIL that canadian dollars fluxuate as wildly as BTC to USD
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:00:51


We are a retailer, we have to purchase goods from vendors and resell them, we don't hold cash (or Bitcoins), we use it to buy inventory which we resell.  We can't afford to hold BTC, just like we don't hold cash.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:58:54
Not a bad idea, remember, money doesn't grow on trees and we're not in the business of banking, we're a retailer.  That's a lot of expense to incur to accept a currency.  Granted, maybe we could show that we'd save money in CC fees or prevent fraud through counterfeit bills, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:32:33
We're all janitors in one way or another.  The messes that we clean up are just different, that's all.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:08:40
We accept of number of them, with appropriate hedging vehicles to protect us against forex changes.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:17:59
Haha, thanks for that insight.
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:54:53
Then as soon as BTC users figure out they can cash out of BTC by simply buying and immediately returning items, we've become a de-facto BTC ATM.  It's just not feasible in this configuration.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:31:22


For small purchases (say &lt;$100) I'd say yes, this is a reasonable assumption.  But for larger purchases, or products with warranties, etc, most customers (even risk savvy Bitcoiners)  want to have some type of protection that the TV they just spent a BTC on actually turns on when you plug it in.  
I'm a BTC owner, and there is no way I'd buy something over $1000/worth of BTC without some guarantee by the merchant.  What if they never send it to me on an online purchase?  Where is my recourse?  Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I just don't trust my fellow-man that much to do the right thing.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:00:42
This the first original idea we've seen in 5 hours.  An option to purchase BTC price protection is kind of brilliant.  If the customer chooses not to purchase it, they incur the risk, if they do purchase it, then we incur it.  We use a metric to determine what level of risk we're willing to accept and apply that amount to the purchase price, thereby insuring ourselves.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:19:38
Or far more likely....
Have you tried getting USD from Mt. Gox?  It can take weeks.
If all you have to do is return a product you paid for in BTC and you'll get cash back, we're now an exchange.  This is one of the biggest concerns that our business has.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:55:39
Actually, I think it's a lot less work for the customer.  To sell BTC on localbitcoins.com can be a risky proposition.  Coinbase.com for all their merit can take time to process.  It would be much easier to walk into a store, buy a TV with BTC, then come back in an hour later, return it saying it didn't fit in your living room, and get cash in hand.  No paper trail, no banking trail.   
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:52:15
Yep, basically, the replies here have reduced the "innovative" currency of BTC to a gift-card that fluxuates in value wildly.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:51:19
Not a troll, i own bitcoin, but no one here has offered a real solution.  They just say, "pay them back in $s"
What's revolutionary about that?
Where's the creativity here?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:53:31
Then BTC needs to advertise itself that way, instead of calling itself a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:57:07
You are absolutely right, I got blasted for saying the same thing earlier, but this appears to be the consensus.  Medium of exchange, yes.... Currency, no.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:20:07
This really isn't a solution, put yourself in the shoes of a customer.  You  just bought a $1000 fridge for 1BTC, a week later you return it and get .9BTC back because of market fluxuations... You're pissed now at our company, and don't come back to shop in the future because you feel cheated by us even though we don't set the price of BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:32:32
I've pointed out why we don't want to use bitcoin, yes, but i've also pointed out why we do want to use it as well.  We want to use BTC to save on CC fees and to avoid issues associated with theft of PII due to keeping credit card data on our store computers (think about Target right now).
However, in order to begin using BTC in our stores, we have to investigate risks associated with adopting it.  Some of those risks have been identified above and some folks have attempted to help us find a solution or craft an argument to take to our superiors.  


If you think i'm trolling, it won't hurt my feelings, I just won't take your advice.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:08:12
God, if I could upvote this a thousand times I would.  
And we do have operations in Canada/US/Mexico and stores on the borders, we have forex hedging derivatives to protect against currency fluxuations.  We also don't process returns across borders.  If it was bought in Canada, it can only be returned in Canada.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:42:22
Yeah, but then the question becomes, how much store credit? let's say when you bought it was $1k/1BTC and now it's $500/1BTC when you come back to return the item, we're holding your 1BTC worth $500 and give you store credit for 1k? we lose twice (the lost value of BTC we're holding and the new store credit).  The other way around pisses you off as a customer.  Lose/Lose
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:48:55
If this is the solution, then BTC is not a currency.  It's a prepaid credit card that has wild value fluxuations against the dollar.
There's got to be something more elegant.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:02:58
Who do you think it is?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:22:54
If it's not good for us, then it won't work on Amazon, eBay, Home Depot, Lowe's, WalMart, Target, etc because we are all retailers.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:30:42
If they pay us 1BTC and we pay them back .5BTC because the price halved, they will not be too happy about it.   Look how many posts on here are pissed at Coinbase for processing transactions late, resulting in lost purchasing power due to volatility.
Calling it the "customer's problem" is not a solution for a company of this size.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:40:35
Thanks, our main reason for the consideration is the low transaction fees and lack of need to protect PII that comes with credit cards.
As a payment method, many things about BTC are superior to credit cards.  As a currency, BTC has some hurdles to overcome.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:42:20
This would be an acknowledgement that we don't see BTC as a currency because we won't be exchanging in BTC, but rather using it as a form of payment, like a Credit-Card or gift card.  
Are we saying that BTC is not a currency?
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:58:22
We've been discussing this is as well.  Huge issue, restocking fee is probably the only way to prevent it, however, then a customer gets mad when they have a legitimate reason to return an item.
