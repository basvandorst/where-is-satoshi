They have "sorted it out", but the Satoshi client has to maintain complete backwards compatibility, and is a far more difficult task than the changes merchants have to make.

They will never, *ever* implement Segwit as it goes against the Rizun/CSW/Ver "chain of digital signatures" dogma. ASICBoost may or may not also play a role (I lean towards not). But they have and will take the parts of Segwit they need, and are solving most forms of transmal in other, inferior ways. "All transactions on-chain" is certainly one of their holy tenets, but Bcash will 100% have LN, as their narrative/wedge vanishes without it. Litecoin is already far better by their own metrics, but in their eyes it is tainted by Segwit (and a benevolent dictator with actual morals).

By using LN you *are* using mainnet, and there's an upper limit to LN tx value, so large value txs will have to be on-chain. Channels may not be closed for a long time, but eventually they will be closed for accounting purposes, server maintenance, ease of mind, etc. LN won't be the "main" thing, it is simply another tool in the chain. Think of LN as kind of like a hashgraph backed by mainnet security (kind of).

I believe they're using the original whack-a-mole approach to transaction malleability. I suspect they know they will need LN to survive, and they will end up implementing it, despite all the previous FUD. Roger Ver-y Stable is right about one thing though, it will work better on their chain. Censorship resistance is an abstract concept for a lot of new participants (including Roger, ironically), and fees aren't. All I'm saying is that bcash is a more agile chain that has completely shed the shackles of censorship resistance and long-term sustainability, and no-one should be flippant about the threat this poses to Bitcoin, at least in the short term. Hopefully the ecosystem will be smart, but judging by opinions and actions of some executives in this space, I'm not confident.

Hashpower is not correlated with price, other than to set a floor at which mining becomes unprofitable. Hashpower will grow regardless of price action due to the inherently competitive nature of mining, as per design. The hashrate is currently exploding, and yet the price falters. Any historical chart will show you a lack of correlation.
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:57:09
You are incorrect because the computation required to validate transactions is essentially non-existent compared to the computation needed to find a nonce. Hashpower is not correlated with transaction rate. Competition for block reward will grow regardless of anything other than complete price collapse.

Privacy improvements are the last thing that should be rushed. Subpar solutions can cause anything from disk/txo-set bloat or infinite inflation to putting lives at risk with a retroactive privacy failure. I believe this is already a high priority for some prominent devs, but there isn't a solution out there that doesn't have trade-offs. In the meantime you can always use a privacy coin that has found those trade-offs acceptable. In my opinion real privacy for Bitcoin will probably realistically occur at higher protocol layers.

I also agree with him to an extent, but for Bitcoin to survive the real issues he references, it needs to be globally cheap to host, function over tor, etc. If the bad actors ever succeed in negatively shifting the window of discourse, then indirectly it is an existential threat. These ideas need to be constantly called out, and Andreas absolutely does educate people on these issues, but never by calling out the bad actors. That is totally fine, admirable even, and expected in his position, but we still need those that are willing to go for the jugular. We just shouldn't expect him to fit neatly into that role.

If an entity spins up a single node for themselves to run, they are providing security and assurance for themselves.

Bitcoin may be pointless for you, that doesn't make it pointless. Wikileaks donors found it extraordinarily useful, for example. Why don't you think a merchant can both avoid the processing fee and then cash out into fiat? Those that can keep the Bitcoin are better off in the long run, but that's not always practical. Coinbase being slow doesn't mean Bitcoin is, although centralized on-off ramps are certainly an issue with the ecosystem. Honestly, I think 10-20 minute final settlement is quite fast, and will get much faster in future. It is still early days. Whole new use-cases are on the horizon wrt *actual* micropayments.

I'm unsure how they reconcile this dissonance with their typical Libertarian ideals, however. Self-identifying as "willing to compromise for progress", "having good instincts" and "socially intelligent" is inevitable for someone who has climbed to that position, and is a difficult mental armor to penetrate.

In the context of a recession, sticking to one asset class is *not* diversifying, as you pointed out. Ignoring black swan events, it makes more sense to diversify a class that moves in sectors with inverse correlations and where each asset has more agency over its own valuation, than one where most assets are valued as a function of brand recognition, maturity, regulatory climate and aggregate trust of the asset class as a whole. The vast majority of crypto assets are *worthless.* A small diversification into assets with an actual use-case *might* make sense, but class diversification makes more.

Spam alone shouldn't cause fees to get *too* high, as any fee higher than that will confirm in the next block. The problem is exacerbated by companies who are incentivized to make ridiculously high fee estimations to prevent support issues, and pass that cost onto their customers. Unlike spam, this actually *saves* them money, and causes all other network-wide fee estimations to more-or-less rise to match, affecting the whole ecosystem. Bitcoin has certainly had something of a watershed moment recently, where companies in this space were encouraged to do better wrt fee estimation and block space usage. Things have really improved, but it shows how the tragedy of open access is a real issue, and how usability, for better or worse, is somewhat correlated with a form of social consensus/action.

Bitcoin received a blocksize increase while an almost unbounded payment network was being built on top. Heavy shared resource users were incentivized to make their usage more efficient, and they did just that. This only worked *because* of the temporarily high fees. If we had just added more space, then a handful of companies would still be filling a significant % of the blockchain themselves. You seem to be talking about exponential increases in blocksize like it's nothing. Why are you comparing a website to the Bitcoin network? Costs aren't externalized when websites scale up, it's completely different. Websites aren't distributed. If your concept of scaling doesn't favorably change the CONOP to tx/s co-efficient then you are just increasing capacity and not really scaling at all. LN is the solution that decouples that co-efficient, or at least goes some way towards it. You should also be able to see that exponentially increasing the blocksize is simply out of consensus for the BTC community. This is why BCH even exists at all, because its' proponents simply found themselves out of consensus. In that scenario, forking off is the exact right thing to do. It's the only mechanism that exists. Bitcoin still works just like it did before (other than a now much higher value, causing fees to be exponentially more painful when measured in a quote currency). The difference now is that companies that abuse the blockchain shared resource now know that the community isn't willing to just increase the blocksize for them. They must be more efficient first.
The phrase "put it on extreme hold" implies that someone is in control here and making unilateral decisions. I see this attitude a lot in certain BTC communities, but the developers don't have, nor want the right to make such decisions. This is what really sets Bitcoin apart in my opinion. It is the community that decides, and they don't seem convinced (and an alternative option now exists for those that do).
LN could be used on BCH, and likely will be once that community sees the benefits (beyond scaling, that is). But for now, BCH is committed to on-chain or bust, to the point of increasing the blocksize to 32mb despite it currently being wholly unnecessary for them. It is nothing more than a signal.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:42:42
BCH can't handle worldwide adoption and will never be able to. Their fervent adherence to on-chain payments only and no-fees-ever are *simply untenable*. If you still don't understand the issues with 24GB blocks and no mining incentive, you never will. Their coin is doomed, and they're too zealous to care.
Bitcoin is being built to actually serve the world's people and machines, with or without your participation. If you would rather continue playing in the sandpit, that is your choice.

My opinion has been entirely consistent with this, and any other proposals with unrealistic timeframes. Unless you are tribally and projectively grouping me into a strawman? I really hope it works, but to say it isn't rushed would make me a hypocrite.

The only person suggesting no more improvements or parameter changes in future is you and your pointless strawman.

He didn't even want it on an altcoin. Quite *reluctant* indeed.

There is no such thing as a "quick" block-size bump, or a "simple" hard fork. These are misnomers, used by high-stake actors in a proxy war of words and capital, with a reckless disregard for a 30 billion dollar blockchain.
Who would have thought personal-stake centric, yet highly complex protocol development could be so contentious? /s

The original title of the whitepaper was "Electronic Cash ***Without a Trusted Third Party***." I know of some people who want to red-line that, but you won't find them here.

Yet another implementation of a Bitcoin full node. Except this is worse, because the people behind the other implementations, whilst receiving funding from bad actors, do actually care about the health of Bitcoin. Craig Wright couldn't care less, and could potentially receive the same backing.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:07:14
"Core" are not fundamentally against a [blocksize increase]( nor are they against [appropriate hardforks]( You are emotionally invested in a false narrative, and continue to propagate it despite any and all evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:42:15
false equivalence. Lightning is designed to trustlessly route through other nodes in the graph. Running a hub isn't required to attain best results. At worst your tx hits the blockchain prematurely. If you're already running a full node, you already have the "hosting" to be watching the blockchain for this. If you're SPV then you rely on one or more third parties, but you are relying on someone else already anyway, so your risk model hasn't changed.
The entire scaling debate revolves around whether trust should be degraded on layer 1 or layer 2. Slight trust degradation on layer 2 (but not really) instead of layer 1 is feature, not bug.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:21:44
If a trustless client becomes out of reach, we have achieved nothing. This is the real value behind Bitcoin. Increasing a constant value is not dreaming big, it is taking the easy road. It is sacrificing proposition for adoption.
Nonetheless, I appreciate the tone of your post. It would be nice to get back to this level of discussion.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:08:55
I wouldn't want to waste a hard fork on just changing a constant value, but I think most would agree with the inevitable requirement.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:56:15
I like Bruce, but he is being naïve. The responses he is receiving there are true to form. Appreciate the effort though.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:22:14
He thinks unbounded blocksize increases are a permanent "solution" to a temporary problem. A solution that wipes out the most important property of a cryptocurrency; financial sovereignty.
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:23:55
The main chain can scale to the limits of global full node distributed operation cost whilst retaining Bitcoin's original value proposition, or much faster whilst radically changing the proposition. The former will not meet the rising slope of the adoption S-curve, and the latter will fundamentally change the nature and purpose of Bitcoin.
I can't speak for "Core", but they appear to be taking a sensible middle-road, with a "modest" doubling of on-chain capacity (did this conveniently slip your mind?), whilst exploring non-linear 2nd layer solutions. Followed by post-adoption network health analyses.
The solution they have put forward provides exactly the on-chain "scaling" you are asking for, and you call their behavior "weird." You will need to further expand on why you think this is the case.
What you consider "normal" is very much just your opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:22:01
There are plenty of anecdotes such as the one you gave, and while interesting, you must be able to see that hopping from used cryptos to unused ones is not a scale solution? As I said, BCH will either have the same problems with scaling, or it will give up and turn into a trusted validator federation (the latter seems to be the signal). I'm sorry, but I can't take Rick Falkfinge seriously. Any criticisms of LN are entirely pointless. LN is just another permissionless layer, with known trade-offs, built on top of Bitcoin. It is coming regardless of what misinformed people think of it. Its use is not mandatory. Anyone is free to do the same.
It's nothing more than signal because that's what it is? They don't need 8mb, never mind 32mb. It doesn't matter to them because their Alibaba nodes are likely run by wealthy early adopters, or nChain, or Bitcoin.com. It is emblematic of everything about BCH, designed purely as a signal with a disregard for long-term sustainability or network health. There was a difference, caused by irresponsible companies and malicious actors with an incentive to congest the network, as I said. Bitcoin currently works fine. Once a decent percentage of transactions occur off-chain, the mining incentive still needs to exist. If BCH uses LN, this will be an issue for them. If they don't use LN, scaling/trust will be an issue for them. No problems have been solved here.

I believe ViaBTC and Ver both alluded to a Bitcoin "ICO" before the announcement.

Agreed, but this is the risk in basing your business model on a temporary gap in the spec.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:38:15
I agree, and if failure does occur I hope it doesn't prevent BIP8 style activations in future. We must move in that direction, regardless of the outcome of BIP148.

Pack it up boys, I think we've found Satoshi.

Chaincode Labs have empirically more of an impact to the codebase than Blockstream, Blockstream is the company that is actually attempting to implement fungibility, privacy, and non-linear scaling, *and* maintain defensive patents in the nChain era, and yet Blockstream is the bogeyman. Here we all are expending energy fighting the same falsehoods over and over again. In terms of controlling the narrative, the charlatans have already won. It is so disappointing to see how easy it was.
Corporate takeover would more likely refer to the likes of Coinbase, or Bitpay, no? Companies that actually have a massive impact, process more bitcoin transactions than Bitcoin does, and seem to be more than happy to split the network to reduce their OP-EX.

Ironic, considering Roger's proclivity for revealing private conversations.

Difficulty adjustments can always be smoothed out in future. Bitcoin is still young, and easier to upgrade than Gold! Having said that, Gold won't always have minimal inflation or immutability, and Bitcoin/crypto may prove to be more stable precisely *because* of their intangibility, but by that time money may not be so important anyway...
Physical reality also has room for improvement :P
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:52:26
And to add to your excellent post, once the genie is out of the bottle there is no going back. This is why maintaining financial sovereignty is fought for so vehemently by users and developers alike.
It is true that, of the core raison d'êtres, both the *cashiness* and the *scale* of Bitcoin are lacking. But the Bitcoin "trinity" (trust-less, cash-like, global scale) is at technical odds with itself. This impedance mismatch will not be solved by degrading the only property of Bitcoin that works, whilst still utterly failing to achieve the other two. And it will not be solved by round-tables, talking heads and world-class bike-shedders. It will be solved by brilliant minds, brilliant ideas and devolved paradigms, anchored to the most secure and trust-less database in the world, that better suit the proposition they attempt to realize.

Do you even understand what Blockstream is? It is a generic blockchain tech company set up by developers to take money from clueless corporate venture capital subsidiaries and funnel it into the development of Bitcoin. That's it. These are the people who came up with Confidential Transactions (used in Monero as RingCT), they are clearly not at the behest of corporate interests.

You need to sub them all for sipa. Did you know the actual pronunciation of his last name is a cryptographically secure shared secret? The software development community knows him only as the legend of Maxwell's Demon, and the ghost of Claude Shannon resides in his beard.

It's a bit more nuanced than that. The Core devs don't support merging BIP148 into the Satoshi client, for lots of very good reasons. Some of them do still *personally* support it though.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:32:33
There are also no signs that Bitmain *actually* support segwit2x. Recent events and statements would suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:16:09
You don't appear to be responding to anything I actually said. I made the case for *why* it *doesn't* have consensus, and here you are talking about node counts, active versus passive participation, surveys and a lack of "fucking data" to... prove me right regarding lack of consensus?
As for the why, if you are honestly claiming you can't see the staggering amount of FUD and smear that circulates regarding Segwit and Core and the sources it comes from then you have no place discussing it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:17:58


The perception is Segwit doesn't have consensus because the discourse surrounding it has been poisoned and politicized by a very small number of key people heavily leveraging their influence and communication channels, and if it wasn't for this sustained intentional mischaracterization, Segwit *would* have consensus. Ultimately it isn't even about Segwit. Any proposals from Core will be rejected, and anything from any other group will be invested in and marketed. A narrative has been successfully constructed around Core doing 'too little, too late' by the same people stalling actual progress. The smear campaign against Core is now self-sustaining, and the damage is probably irreversible. This behavior was always going to frustrate and galvanize the community, and this blowback has manifested as BIP148. It's not ideal, but I can understand why people are advocating for it.
The only people who need convincing are mining pool operators, and they won't be convinced. The reasons why are a mystery. Maybe fees, maybe Asicboost, maybe regime change, maybe just ego and spite. But there are clearly misaligned incentives here, or at least an over-reliance on an expectation of rationality, and I think it's still very likely we don't know the full story.

There are plenty of subscribers to the sub you reference (including me) that most certainly *aren't* represented by your views. You need to shed this tribal notion that all participants of every social microcosm have perfectly aligned opinions. A cursory glance at either 'sub' easily dispels this concept.


The entire point of SegWit2x is to make *everyone* feel like they got what they wanted, and you certainly haven't disappointed in your response.
