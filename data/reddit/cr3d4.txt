Whatever the process was to have this cleared to be shipped across the border is one that needs to be looked at and turned inside out. In 2016 with everything that's possible not being able to have electronic's shipped across imaginary lines is crazy? International shipping or Trade needs its own Bitcoin revolution. 
Really happy that they have been able to set it up and that they were able to jump through all the hoops I'm sure it wasn't easy.
Does someone know if not being able to ship electronic's across the CAD/U.S border has more to do with Customs and Duty or Security etc or could it be something else?

I am no fan of Jihan. But if I were to send a message it would have to be "Way to go Jihan, you are one of the very few in the bitcoin mining space who has made a profitable and lucrative business and despite that has continued to sell bitcoin miners to the general public. I hate the fact that you basically hold the network hostage and that I don't really share ANY of your views pertaining to bitcoin BUT I also don't see anyone trying to compete with you. I hear a lot of folks like me talk about how much you suck but as of yet your not telling me that I'm not entitled to my views so....have at'er.  Oh and word to your mother, Jihan"
While I'm at it I should send a tweet off to Bitfury and thank them for selling their fantastic chips to the general public at the wicked low entry price of a million dollars!
I sure am glad those two companies don't ever get together and talk about what would be in their best interests.
There are no bitcoin mining companies that will do what is best for the network before their bottom dollar.
I just don't see them being swayed by tweets, I hope I'm wrong.
It is bitcoin's biggest problem going forward. Radical measures are needed.
