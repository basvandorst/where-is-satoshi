Well, the governments own the roads (after all, without government who would like build the roads man) and profit from the tolls. And I'd be OK with putting every government official in prison for life. So I guess I agree with you?

Nice to see someone with some good sense in here. I also believe everything the government tells me.

Sure, but I heard the judge who runs that pedo site also hired hitmen to kill nonexistent Canadians. I think that's not right. Throw the book at her!

Wow. Looks like he cooperated with the feds and got off easy. Unfortunate. At least he'll be punished with a wife.

No, I seriously believe what the government tells me. That's how I know DPR tried to kill people. I'm not sure why u/spooninacerealbowl seemed to think she was disagreeing with me. We're clearly on the same page.

Ross has done far more good for the world than the judge who sentenced him. He will be remembered as someone far more important than her.

justice dot gov. Thanks for linking to a reliable source. The government never *wittingly* lies. Ask James Clapper.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:53:36
That's right. And it's important that you and the others in this thread continue to remind people. The government claimed Ross ordered people killed. Even if they didn't try him for it, it obviously happened. The government doesn't just lie. Not *wittingly* anyway. It's good to see there are some people who have the good sense to just believe what the government tells them.

Because the true criminals are the government officials. They are the ones who deserve jail time. Along with those who enable them.

This judge clearly factored her menopause into the sentencing.

He actually could get out someday. He only has to outlive the US.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:56:24
Well, it's easy to understand. The government told the story in such a way that people would think he tried to kill people. Then people, under that misconception, would repeat it enough that most people believe it. It's a very effective strategy. Especially coming from a government like the US that actually does kill people, all the time.

Are you confusing Ross with Karl Marx Force XL?
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:04:14
Come on. You can trust government agents like Karl Marx Force The Fourth. He wouldn't use his full admin access to SR to plant evidence of a fake hit. The government can totally be trusted.

Many people don't know that Al Capone was the maternal grandfather of the judge who sentenced Ross. The paternal grandfather? Hitler.

LOL you believe in the moon landing? You're probably a Rounder too. Normies.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:41:46
Yes, I mean, I don't know why so many people here are defending Ross. If the government says Ross ordered multiple people to be killed, then it happened. The government doesn't just lie about things like that. At least they don't *wittingly* lie. If the government just went around lying all the time, there'd be consequences, right? *Right?*
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:09:02
Amen. I'd say I'm amazed at the number of pro-government commenters here, but it's probably an inevitable side effect of increasing adoption. The reality is, the vast majority of people would happily lick the boots of their dear leaders. It's sad. For the rest of us, the important thing to keep in mind is to look around and see the boot lickers around you and know them for what they are: dangerous.

Touchin' Kids makes a good point. As important as Ross was to the history of bitcoin and the rise of crypto-anarchy, he also "helped make alot of fucked up shit happen." Thanks, Touchin' Kids, for pointing that out. If more people were to be like Touchin' Kids, maybe less fucked up shit would happen.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:50:42
Thank you. I can't understand why the people here don't just believe the obvious evidence presented by an unbiased government that has no history of *wittingly* lying to the people. Ross is as guilty as the government is honest.
