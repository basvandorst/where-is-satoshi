Hey, lots of different people are into bitcoin. Not everybody claims to have superior financial or economic knowledge. Maybe that was true in the beginning when bitcoin was not known to most people. But even then I think a lot of people were *learning* from bitcoin as opposed to coming into it because they were already learned.
When we are fortunate enough to not be affected by an attack, we should have the humility to recognise that somebody lost something and the compassion to realise that they may be in a state of despair, regardless of whether they took unnecessary risks.

I think you can apply this to absolutely anything. You can hold only fiat in the bank but it won't matter if your government collapses. You can keep gold in a safe but it won't matter if somebody breaks in and steals it. The question is one of probabilities
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:43:02


Apparently a lot of people trade more frequently than that, making (or trying to make) money for themselves by predicting the market. It wouldn't make sense to deposit/withdraw funds every day.
What I don't understand is when people apparently trade/speculate using their whole fortune.

You can always buy bitcoins locally, then transfer them internationally (and the receiver can sell them locally if they want).

OK, big guy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:15:06
IMHO it depends on how much control you have over outcomes.
If you play the slots you have no control other than whether to pull or not.
When speculating you have to choose what to invest in and that choice is (hopefully) informed, i.e. you have some reason to pick something over another and the timing is important as well.
Choosing to leave deposit most of your money in the bank (in a single currency) also carries a certain risk, but it's a fairly safe one (with corresponding low expected profit).
I don't think it's as easy as saying "speculation = gambling", there is a continuum ranging from pure randomness gambling (very little control) to insider trading (almost full control) with a bunch of stuff in between where limited knowledge of the market can bring it to a calculated risk you're willing to take.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:51:40
Nah, it could be a technical failure, e.g. a bug that allows widespread theft of private keys or something.

Debt can do a lot of harm to young people. Look at this:  ("Art students/graduates, how much is your current student debt?")
There are stories about student debts on reddit every day. It's *bad* for people. Debt can bring people to depression and suicide and can bring you into a negative spiral that lasts the rest of your life. People who start educations they realise they don't really want (or which won't be able to repay their debts -- in the case of things like art school above); it would be much better for those people to restart their education doing something else, but they can't because they're already a year in (and with the corresponding debt).
I came from a family living at times from paycheck to paycheck but still finished 5 years of university debt free (and I only worked a 10% job on the side for 2 of those years). I live more than comfortably now even paying as much tax as I do, with free healthcare (and state provided unemployment insurance and retirement benefits), and I honestly vastly prefer this over entering adult life with a soul-crushing debt that perhaps has no end in sight.
But yeah, our taxes do cover at least in part roads, schools, healthcare, and college, so maybe you *should* be all over it :-)

It's not healthy. People are pouring in a ton of money on what is essentially a bet that it will keep going up. We will see tragedies from this when it eventually tips the other way. Not from everybody -- but those who buy at ATH with everything they've got. If early adopters start cashing out now it can still drive the price into the ground and remember there are people out there with tens and hundreds of thousands of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:06
Yup... every sell is somebody else's buy
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:38:06
Right, that's another point; the college debt isn't just the size of your loan, like some of the people in that twitter thread said, their loans are actually growing faster than they are able to repay it.

I think people in Greece are not withdrawing euros from ATMs because they want to spend them immediately, but because they don't want to lose their money in a bankruptcy/seizure.
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:17:53
You raise a valid point, which [I myself raised only yesterday](
Still, personally I would prefer to be in possession of my money than at the mercy of the banks and the government in this kind of situation. At least you can still make transactions with the people who *do* value bitcoins, right? I also wouldn't be surprised if you could persuade somebody who hasn't heard of bitcoins before to take them -- after all, they will want to keep doing business too and they can't do that if people don't have money.

Many of the people ITT are trolls, it couldn't be clearer to me. BTC is volatile, it has problems with mass adoptions, it doesn't have a fundamental use if nobody wants to take it (unlike gold, which still has its physical properties). All of these things are true. I'm just saying that BTC cannot be seized or controlled like bank accounts, and people are arguing against it. It's bizarre.
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:44:18
Then we are in agreement.

Okay, here it is, real simple:
* Money in the bank: you don't control it
* Money in the blockchain: you control it
@_date: 2015-06-29 08:38:36
For the regular guy in the street. Presumably by holding a currency which is not subject to government intervention (be it devaluation, just straight up seizure of funds, or capital controls). [Right now, you can't draw more than $66 per day from ATMs]( and anybody who bought bitcoins before this limit was imposed would have no such problem.
That doesn't imply a fix for the larger problems in their economy, however.

@_date: 2014-02-25 10:14:57
That's exactly what happened. The transaction malleability issue was a bug in their internal accounting.
It's a bit like your bank not including on your monthly statement that somebody drew $100 at ATMs every day. It's just that in this case, MtGox was both the customer and the bank.

I'm guessing/hoping the next generation of exchanges/services will be based on well-architected open source software. And by well-architected, I mean programs that are designed to be split across multiple physical servers and includes a lot of security measures. For example: The front end (what the user interacts with) should be on a separate machine and communicate with a business logic layer on yet another separate machine via a minimal custom protocol that leaves little room for mistakes. The two machines should otherwise be completely firewalled off from each other. The business logic machine should communicate with the back-end server which does things like internal accounting/database communication (yes, the database on yet another separate machine). Both the business logic server and back-end server should have mechanism in place for alerting about suspicious behaviour (large transfers, invalid requests, etc.) and put any such requests on hold until they can be verified manually by an admin/operator. All machines should have their own dedicated (firewalled-off) logging server so that in case of a break-in, you can always inspect and/or correlate logs.
Multiple tiers of security, compartmentalisation, separation of concerns, logging, error reporting/alerting, and minimising the room for error are all VERY important aspects of using bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:38:55
Yes, you are still at risk.
Just as an example of what could go wrong, the hacker (or whoever has your information now) may use your drivers license and utility bill to create an account on another exchange. Then they may use your account there for laundering and put the blame on you.

@_date: 2014-05-26 09:37:49
There was a [blockchain fork]( in 2013, but I don't think there have been any actual double spends for 1+ confirmations. Orphan blocks aren't so rare, I think, but executing a double spend means that the two blockchains must have incorporate two different transactions spending the same coins.
I also wanted to add that the number of confirmation increases the confidence in the transaction exponentially. Say you have 50% of the hashing power. Then by definition you have 50% chance of generating a block. To fork the chain 1 block ago, you need to generate 2 blocks in a row, so you have 50% * 50% = 25% chance of success. To fork it 2 blocks ago, 12.5%. For 3 blocks, 6.25%. For 4 blocks, 3.125%. For 5 blocks, 1.56%, and for 6 blocks 0.78%.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:17:23

Small miners are not going to even make a measurable dent in that 47% hashrate, no matter how many you put on the network. By now, large mining operations are starting to look like data centers, and those are the ones contributing the most to those 47%.

People who tried to make BTC withdrawals will have received multiple payments instead of the single payment they tried to make.
Note that the person receiving the multiple payments may not be the same as the actual hacker/attacker who modified the outgoing MtGox transactions.

As far as I know, distros have the right to package whatever patches they want with their packages. The users may disagree, and the package maintainer should listen to that. But in principle, I don't see a problem with people running a patched version of bitcoin -- it's a democracy after all.

Well, I don't know. The problem with 127.0.0.1 is that I might be running something locally on that port, which is a much bigger risk IMHO.

Relevant. Buying comes with a lot of problems, including possibly having to trust an exchange with your money, possibly having to pay taxes on the coins you buy (but not the ones you mine yourself), and obtaining coins completely anonymously. Mining vs. buying is a trade-off, completely dismissing these issues as "not relevant" is a mistake IMHO.

No, that's not the point.
You have to distinguish between negative news ("MtGox went bankrupt", "&lt;Country&gt; outlaws bitcoin", etc.) and negative posts ("Bitcoin will never work", "Bitcoin is dead", etc.). We want the former (or at least, I do). I don't want the latter.
The point is that this is a subreddit about bitcoin, for bitcoin enthusiasts. I don't care what some random journalist/person *thinks* about bitcoin. I am already convinced that it's a good system and their opinion is just noise.
It's a bit like like trying to tell that smoking is bad for you. If you come to to tell me that bitcoin will never work or that dogecoin is superior, I will downvote you.
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:02:55

There's always [tip4commit]( but they take 5% for themselves. If you use this, I recommend donating smaller amounts over time, since each developer gets 1% of the pool for that project for every commit (meaning that the first one to author commit after a donation receives the most).

For sure there are users and their sockpuppets placed here (i.e. paid) to spread certain ideas, call it propaganda if you want. But you're wrong about the bitcoin community being controller by a few insiders. By now, the bitcoin community is pretty large and diverse. And most of us are not participating in the drama of MtGox or this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:55:53
So if you searched the blockchain for two transactions of the same amount to the same address, probably with a specific interval of time between them (1 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours?), that would probably be a good candidate.

Actually, it needs more than that, in a way. If the developers make those changes, it will create a hard fork of the block chain. Anybody who is still on the old chain will still be on the old chain. So if your merchant is still using Bitcoin and you are still using Bitcoin, you would still be using good old fixed supply Bitcoin.
Another way to view it is that it has already been done; all the various *coins that exist are exactly that, forks of bitcoin with their own chains. You can choose to use them instead of or in addition to Bitcoin. Whether they are useful is just a matter of who (else) is using them.

@_date: 2014-10-21 17:17:14
There is a problem with forking if your block time is too short. I think gmaxwell explained it really well at some point. The basic problem is that information needs time to disperse, so if your average block time is shorter than the time it takes for two miners to verify all the transactions and agree on the longest chain, then each of the two miners will always consider their own chain the longest (and you have a fork with no resolution in sight).
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:04:43
As far as I understood, he wants miners to trade in their bitcoin gains today for their forked blockchain "fakecoin" gains at some point in the future. I don't really see the difference between this and mining altcoin chains, as nobody can really guarantee the value of a fakecoin at some unknown/unknowable point in the future.
I'd guess most miners would prefer the tangible value of a bitcoin today.

For the record, I didn't mean that you should use multiple servers as a way to scale up, but for security alone (putting physical barriers between different parts of your program to prevent a small exploit to turn into a full compromise) -- and doing this on Rackspace won't help that much, since you still don't have physical security.

Things to consider:
* One of the oldest, largest, most well-known exchanges just went belly up and the price has stayed remarkably stable
* Is that because people can't buy/sell? (because the market place is gone? because people's assets to trade are gone?)
* There were a *lot* of news around bitcoin in the last month or so, even in mainstream media. Although the news were mostly negative, it helps to get a wider audience
* People everywhere are starting to hear about bitcoin. Several people have independently talked to me about bitcoin without knowing that I've been involved for a while (I don't usually talk about bitcoin IRL unless somebody else brings it up first)
* Just look at [Google trends explore]( for a few terms. We seem to have peaked recently, which is hard to interpret as anything but good for bitcoin spread/adoption
* Because of the total bitcoin cap, greater adoption almost always correlates to higher price in the long run
* The feeling I have at the moment is very similar to the one I had in mid 2011, when we had a massive surge of interest and the $30 bubble
* Looking back at similar bubbles/crashes, I would say we're looking at between 1 and 6 months until we go back above $1k. I am fairly certain it will happen sooner or later, HOWEVER:
* This is not financial advice. And something could come up that violates everything I've said above. A bug in the protocol, "bad news" about bitcoin regulation, massive cashout from a whale, etc. are unpredictable things that could still cause a massive drop

Let me offer you a bit of perspective. The "big players" have seen large losses before. The history of bitcoin is FULL of examples of fraud, theft, dishonesty, and negligence. People have been scammed out of their bitcoins on EVERY DAY of the past 3 years.
The "big players" know what the risks are and how to avoid them because they've seen the same thing happen over and over again. They're not responsible for what you do with your bitcoins, nor what some unrelated company does with your bitcoins.

Their agenda from the beginning has been to ridicule and discredit bitcoin and the bitcoin community. This is not even speculation, they say so openly.
As also wrote, I think there were a LOT of bots and sockpuppets there in the beginning to try to create the momentum and a false impression of a community. Afterwards, true, a lot of legitimate users joined in. It's a bit like what you see with the (formerly) satirical subreddits that reach a critical mass.

Although not fool-proof, there are ways to make this more painful for the hackers. You could have another server monitor the source code that is being used to serve the users by periodically logging into the machine -- if it deviates from the expected value, lock down everything.
You should also be generating graphs of user amounts entering/leaving the system, so that you can receive an alert if too many users drain their accounts in a short amount of time. Again, not fool-proof, but it's basic damage control. Just like cold storage is not fool-proof, just damage control.
Of course, having no security vulnerabilities is the best option, but that's pretty hard to achieve in practice.

The early miners got a lot of bitcoins, simply because there were few people around who actually wanted them.

Now that there are so many people mining, you will get very little from it, even if you have the very last in bitcoin mining hardware.

Not saying you're wrong, just wanted to add a nuance to your argument: In a mining pool, typically only the pool operator has the power to include/exclude specific transactions or to mine a specific (fork of the) block chain. And IIRC, most of the reward goes to the miners. So in your analogy, it's not like the pool operator really owns the eggs that the goose lays anyway.

I didn't say that. Personally I think there should be a slow growth, and I think the provisions for a limit increase should go into the code ASAP so we can grow the block size in the future.
I posted this a while ago, you should find my opinions there:
In particular, we need *some* limit in order to prevent exponentially increasing initial download times. I don't know what that limit should be, though, but I know that jumping from 1M to 8M in one go is crazy.


That is not true, as miners can always run whatever client/code they want. Personally I am all for encouraging client forks (including protocol changes), as that's the only sane thing to do for a truly distributed system. I mean, concensus among developers is nice to have, but trying to enforce it is foolish.

@_date: 2016-03-27 13:04:04
This is assuming:
- no block size limit
- (as I said) no pruning of spent transactions, etc.
- exponential growth in consumer broadband bandwidth
- exponential growth in transaction volume
I didn't calculate the exact time when it would be impossible to download the blockchain anymore, but it looks like it would be pretty hard in 15-20 years.
Of course, this is not a binary outcome: the more time passes without a blocksize limit, the harder it gets to download the whole blockchain; it will vary from person to person whether they are able to do it or not, as it depends on their connection, hardware, etc. The result is a gradual decrease in the number of full nodes, which is always bad news for decentralisation.
That analysis is optimistic in terms of exponential bandwidth growth (personally I don't see it growing exponentially for the next 20 years, but who can know), and pessimistic in terms of pruning and compressing the blockchain (I'm quite certain that these things *will* dramatically help the initial blockchain download time, but it would be foolish to completely remove the blocksize limit as long as those features are not available to us yet, IMHO).
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:57:41

Sure he can. But something being allowed doesn't mean it's moral.
@_date: 2016-03-27 07:23:23
Good strawman.
Human population growth is self-limiting, initial blockchain synchronisation without a blocksize limit isn't (currently -- pruning and other stuff might alleviate the need for a limit in the future, but that's not the reality today).
What happens when the initial blockchain synchronisation takes too long for any new node to join the network is that existing full nodes together form a single point of failure which can be targeted by governments or other malicious entities, and bitcoin is by definition a failure (as it is no longer decentralised).
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:35:32
Raising the blocksize limit is not as easy as changing a constant in the code. Without an appropriate limit, nodes could be forced to store terabytes of transactions for all foreseeable future, raising the cost of running a node. The more expensive it is to run a bitcoin node, the fewer nodes we'll see. And bitcoin absolutely relies on decentralisation of miners (i.e. a multitude of miners), otherwise there's a single point of failure which can be easily attacked by anybody who doesn't like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:30:29
One problem that I keep pointing out over and over is that simply raising the limit is a bad solution in the long term because it means that we will eventually reach a point where no more new nodes can ever join the network (because the blockchain will grow as fast as our network speeds). Remember that every single node needs to keep track of every transaction ever made, and so the cost of adding a new node to the network grows in step with the size of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:14:28


@_date: 2016-03-05 19:03:39


I don't really agree with that.
Firstly, you *could* also limit blockchain size by doing off-chain transactions (like intra-bank transfers). I'm not saying it's a good idea, I'm just saying it's one way to limit the amount of storage required.
Secondly, if the blockchain is so popular that every block is full, then surely bitcoin is a success?
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:58:40
Primary risk (IMHO) of bigger block is a blockchain size explosion which will prevent anybody but big mining operations that can afford it to run nodes. In other words, centralisation.

It's not an artificial limit. Without a limit, initial blockchain synchronisation would eventually take so long that no new full node could ever join the network.
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:50:15
It's not that nobody was able to foresee the capacity problem -- Satoshi did, and imagined a slow change to the protocol similar to the various BIP proposals we've seen -- it's that nobody was able to foresee how much power the (now centralised) miners would hold. Satoshi imagined that every person would run a miner on their desktop and be able to "vote" with their CPU. This is no longer true, as the weight of a regular computer's vote is so much smaller than a specialised computer's vote (technically, it means that the specialised mining hardware is so incredibly much more powerful than a regular CPU that trying to mine on an ordinary computer is purely a waste of energy).

@_date: 2016-12-08 22:05:47
The problem is not actually storage, it's about accepting new full nodes on the network. New full nodes must necessarily download at least the full current txo set. So if the full dataset is too large to be downloaded, then no new full nodes can join the network. At that point full nodes can only leave. At that point, bitcoin is no longer decentralised.
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:57:56

@_date: 2017-08-03 10:32:57
It's not the hd space that is the problem, it's the bandwidth.
Specifically, it's the bandwidth required to bootstrap a new node.
Imagine in 50 years that somebody wants to add a node to the bitcoin network and they have to wait 5 years in order to sync up with the network.
If you're at the point where no new nodes can join the network, bitcoin is doomed, because at that point nodes can only leave, which means you now have a centralised network. A few people control the whole thing. That is a really bad situation.

Your message comes at a bit of an odd time for me. Following the discussions in this very sub (although also elsewhere on reddit) for the past year or so I've been thinking about an idea relating to a decentralised/peer-to-peer protocol for a discussion forum like reddit/twitter. One of the main features would be "uncensorability": everybody has the right to speak, although you don't necessarily have the right to be heard. Yes, there are similar projects out there already (bitmessage, twister, etc.), and a lot of them have very good ideas, although I feel none of them have all the properties I'd like to see. It's not nearly as revolutionary (or complicated) as bitcoin, but I really think this would be worthwhile as there are many, many accountability issues with a closed platform like Reddit where a lot of moderation happens behind "closed doors". Anyway, I've been thinking about this for more than a year and over the holidays I've finally been able to get my code in a state where it almost works the way I want it to (not saying it's done, but the very bare bones of the p2p node is there). I feel like your message ("Satoshi's lesson") applies to me. I have a ton of failed/incomplete projects in my portfolio, this one might just be too important to not finish.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:40:47
I didn't check your numbers, but I don't think your predictions are accurate.
Here's an analysis that I did extrapolating download speeds and blockchain size:
That is a very simple analysis (that does have flaws in the form of assumptions) and I don't have much reason to believe things will unfold exactly like that. But I think it still illustrates the point: extrapolating the trends shows us it will take ~40 days in 2035 and ~273 days in 2040. And that time to download grows exponentially if we allow the blockchain size to grow exponentially.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:25:37
Not currently. Maybe in part because of the block size limit? The point is we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner we can't get out of. There needs to be *some* restriction on the block size, otherwise the time to join the network will eventually be too large. The bigger the block chain, the longer it will take for a new full node to join, so it's in our interest to keep the chain small to that the network can remain decentralised.
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:44:27

The bandwidth doesn't just have to keep up with block sizes, but with the size of the whole chain (or at least the UTXO set).
It is absolutely necessary that new nodes can join the network in the future too. But they won't be able to join if they can't download the entire database before the operator dies of old age. When new nodes can no longer join, the network is no longer decentralised.
@_date: 2016-12-09 07:42:02
The straight line is on a log scale, so that assumes exponential growth in the broadband speeds (which looks reasonable from 2009 to 2015). If you want the exact data, the broadband speeds data come from these websites:
 - 
 - 
 - 
The blockchain size also reverts to an exponential curve after mid-2013 or so.
Let me know if there is anything else I can explain.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:28:02


That's not entirely true. If you see a transaction for you which was from an address that existed before the fork, then you could just submit the very same transaction to the other network and receive it on the other chain as well.

I'm sorry, but you are talking out of your ass.
Bitcoin was founded on the idea of a decentralised system where every participant has the freedom to make their own choices.
In fact, one of the core principles is "one-CPU-one-vote" (it's in the whitepaper) and this is how concensus on the longest chain is reached:

@_date: 2015-08-02 13:14:33


It needs to be increased, but maybe not an order of magnitude? We also need to be careful. There's a good reason why people are afraid of increasing the block size too much and too fast. We need slow, smooth transitions that don't cut off too many full nodes.
Why can't we double it to start with, and make another decision later? I get that potential forking decisions are hard, but I don't think forks are as bad as everybody seems to think. Miners are quickly going to converge to the longest chain in order to not lose out on their share. I think it's much better to have a new decision every year than to make a decision that the block size has to be increased by an order of magnitude right away.
@_date: 2015-08-20 04:16:50
If you want a literal answer, it is "increasing fees doesn't facilitate more transactions per block", however it *does* allow you to move up the queue if some blocks are full and some aren't.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:14:22
Why not? It helps the network.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:59:38
There is a difference between hitting the block limit a couple of times and always hitting it every time.
If your fee is not large enough to make it into this block (which is full), hopefully it will make it into the next one (or the first one which *isn't* full). A few full blocks here and there isn't going to hurt much, it's just going to slow down the time it takes for the first confirmation.
The real danger is when every single block is full. That's when capacity has been reached and you risk never getting your transaction confirmed at all.

I think all bitcoiners should be excited about this kind of news. We might want bitcoin to grow either because of a vested interest or a genuine belief that it's a better way. Either way, a country switching currencies is an interesting event in itself, it allows us to look at what lead to it and what comes from it and. We can learn from it. We might even be able to say "I told you so" or "this is a good reason to use Bitcoin". It generates interest in economics and monetary policies. We *want* people to be educated on these matters. We don't all have to scream "to the moon".

Has anybody explored (publicly) what this would entail? So banks would set up a semi-private network where each bank has their own miner and they compete for transaction fees? Since there are so few participants compared to the global bitcoin network, the difficulty would probably remain fairly low, or do you think the competition for fees is enough to drive difficulty up? Then there is also a question about propagation delays, though I guess the transaction volume would be smaller if you can batch intra-bank transactions. And how would this really work, would the numbers represent fiat amounts or a (yet another) new (unregulated) currency? Also, wouldn't banks have to actually cooperate to make the whole thing useful?

Bigger block size is not faster. Bigger block size does not let people mine on "lesser" hardware.
Bigger block sizes mean higher transaction rates, therefore more transactions, therefore higher cost of running a full node. But it also means lower transaction fees (since getting the first validation on your transaction is a competition between everybody who wishes to spend at that particular moment). On the other hand, it might also mean spammers get to bloat the block chain with "useless" transactions that serve no purpose other than to take up bandwidth and space.

Well... Right now, they could have used their own currency because that would have meant they could print more of it as a means to repay their debts (and pay for their imports). However, I think we all know that printing currency is a bit like a hidden tax; everybody's holdings decrease in actual value. You also cannot inflate away indefinitely.
I think the actual problem is balancing imports and exports. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but when you import more than you export, and what you import is for consumption, then you're actually losing value in exchange for that consumption. I think this is analogous to balancing your income and your expenditures; if you keep buying food but don't sell anything to obtain *money* to buy that food, you will eventually run out of money altogether.

Hi. The "stroke reference" was making fun of the fact that I had absolutely no clue what you were actually trying to say. I agree it was a cheap shot.
Here's a more serious reply:
You seem to say that regret is not necessary or somehow not appropriate. I disagree. I don't think you can decide or control how people should feel when they had an opportunity 2, 4, 6, 8 years ago to buy something that would be worth a fortune today -- and didn't take that opportunity for whatever reason. It doesn't matter what bitcoin is or isn't, or what its nature is. It doesn't have anything to do with "ruining someone". It's purely about how people feel.
As to the website -- the "Bitcoin Regret Club" -- I think that is also an attempt at humour. More than anything, maybe it can show those with a great amount of regret that they are not the only ones. By joking about something we can make it less serious and maybe help them get over it.

That doesn't mean we should be careless in everything we do. Changing the bitcoin protocol is a sensitive operation that we should do with great care. I do think it needs to change, I just think there are way too many people shouting "let's practically remove the limit because I want bitcoin to be as good as the VISA network" with no regard to the technical problems that could arise.

I'm not saying it will *only* ever be supported by home computers running nodes.
I do think that if banks and governments are the only ones who can afford to run full nodes, then bitcoin is a failure.
If you think about, "one-CPU-one-vote" was *the* major innovation of the bitcoin whitepaper. Bitcoin is fundamentally a democracy; it doesn't matter that mining is centralised through pools, the hashing power is still distributed among pool contributors. However, if we take away the possibility for anybody to start new pools (i.e. add new full nodes to the network), then all somebody has to do to shut down bitcoin is to crack down on a pool's full nodes and nobody will be able to start new pools.
In other words, it doesn't matter that people can't start mining on their own computers anymore, what matters is that people won't be able to start new pools in the future.

I'm all for keeping the block size limit low, but it's hard to take your comment seriously.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:42:00
It's funny that you call raising the block size limit "scalability". For me, raising the limit implies the opposite; with big blocks, you are forcing full nodes who cannot keep up with the network and storage requirements out of the network. Bitcoin's processing speed needs to scale with hardware capabilities; raising the limit by too much and too fast (without a possibility to halt the change) has the potential to destroy the network as we know it. If no new full nodes can join the network, I think bitcoin as a project has failed.
@_date: 2015-09-28 12:42:00
The criterium for the IBD being "too long" is how long it would take to download on a consumer internet connection.
Based on the chart, in 2035 it would take &gt;10^3 hours, which is ~40 days. In 2036, it would take 75 days, and in 2040 it would take 273 days. You see where that's headed.

I am not sure I get what you're saying. Which issues did we mix up?
For argument's sake, let's assume an artificial limit of 1 KiB/block. Then the size of a full blockchain download would be at most linear in the number of blocks, i.e. 5 KiB for 5 blocks, 1000 KiB for 1000 blocks, etc. After 20 years, the blocksize download would still be linear in the number of blocks, whereas download speeds might still be roughly exponential, which means the blockchain would actually download faster and faster with the years, even though its absolute size is bigger.
Please correct me if I misunderstood.
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:08:09
This is true.
I still think the amortised speed will remain about the same. Think about it -- that sudden jump from 50 to 1000 is not sustainable over time. Just because there was a factor 20 growth in one year doesn't guarantee a similar growth in the subsequent years.
I don't know enough about Google Fibre (or fibre internet in general) to say anything about their expansion plans for an area once it has 1000 Mbits, but my guess is they would keep that infrastructure more or less unchanged for a long time. I would love to hear expert opinions on this.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:47:54
I don't think raising the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB in one go is "evolving at a rational speed".
We have the technical means to make gradual changes; why not use it?
There are some fundamental limits of bitcoin, such as the 10 minute block interval. Would you change that, too, in the name of scalability? The 10 minute block interval is very important. It ensures that the network can reach global concensus about confirmed transactions. With shorter intervals, you run a much greater risk of two independent nodes discovering a block roughly at the same time and the network forking because the two parts of the network are following the resulting two chains. A too short interval would not allow the network to settle down into a single chain.
Just because you want bitcoin to have a certain property it doesn't mean that it is technically feasible. Raising the block limit too much and too fast is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:40:12
It may have to be raised, but it should be a slow transition from what we know currently works to what we *don't* know is going to work.
What scares me is how careless people are. The limit is currently 1MB and we haven't reached that limit. Why raise it 800%? That's an irresponsibly large change.
What if it doesn't work out? What if we get flooded with spam transactions and the block chain size rises sharply? Any sort of fix for the problem will require a long timeline to be implemented, just because it takes time for clients to upgrade.
Why not go for the safer option of a slow, gradual increase, something like 1% per day? It would take ~210 days to reach 8MB and allow at least *some* time for countermeasures to be implemented instead of just working like a flipped switch.
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:17:25
I am making the implicit assumption that the initial blockchain download will not be verified -- this is reasonable because when the chain is multiple terabytes large, there is no point in verifying transactions all the way back to the genesis block. Instead, you would download a snapshot from a trusted source and only verify the hashes, which is much faster.
Anyway, this is an optimistic analysis; if you incorporated verification and such, you would reach exactly the same conclusion, except the point at which it becomes impossible to add new nodes to the network would come much sooner.
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:14:15
I *think* we agree, but I'll spell it out just to be sure.
My point was just that adding a brand new node to the network does not necessarily need to do all the verification work since the gensis block.
What I meant by "verify the hashes" is that you only verify the block hashes as a kind of structural verification of your download. If you trust the validity of a recent hash, then you can trust the validity of the data that went into that hash as well. The core client already has a list of "checkpoint blocks" which are universally accepted to be part of *the* canonical blockchain. This means that you don't need to verify each and every transaction since the beginning of time.
I agree the UTXO set is what really matters when adding new nodes, and if you could sync only the UTXO set up to a certain (trusted) checkpoint then the initial download would take less time. I don't think we have a good way to estimate the on-disk/download size of the UTXO set? It would be an interesting addition to the analysis, as it would reduce the download time for new nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:23:48
Yes, though I think we can reasonably assume that the speed of a harddisk copy is linearly dependent on network speed (i.e. they grow at a similar rate), so it would only delay the moment when it would no longer be possible to add new nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:00:51
Conservatism. Slow change. It's so easy to make a misstep and throw it all away. Let's play it safe. We can increase the limit, but bitcoin shouldn't change that suddenly.
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:36:34
It doesn't have to be a government, specifically.
However, we should recognise that bitcoin was created as a response to government ("The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks") and designed to withstand/operate outside it.
Let's say we get to a situation where all existing full nodes are run by pools. Now these pools can collude to forever control the blockchain amongst them. This is significantly worse than if they were to collude today, as anybody is free (and able) to create new pools.
I don't think having *a* blocksize limit is crippling bitcoin. The point of a limit is to have a safety valve against the blockchain growing too much/too fast. I don't know if there has ever even been a 1MB block yet -- at least the average block size is still well below it. Obviously the limit should be raised, but it needs to happen slowly and in a controlled manner so as to match network speeds.

As I wrote [here]( I think a limit should be chosen so that we ensure new full nodes can exist in many places, not just in a few well-connected areas.
I *don't* think everybody's watch and fridge should be able to run full nodes, but bitcoin was designed to be a global network and the blocksize limit also draws the line between who can start up a new full node and who can't. Removing the limit entirely is certainly not a good way to go.
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:00:58
I fully agree the nodes should be able to run in as many jurisdictions as possible -- that's the best way to ensure that bitcoin remains a global network.
But by including countries that have slower internet speeds than the UK you would only shorten the time it would take to make adding new nodes impossible. (That much should be obvious.) So it wouldn't change the conclusion. So I don't understand your complaint?
@_date: 2015-09-28 12:58:33
The projected "time to download" chart is based entirely on maxing out the capacity of your consumer broadband regardless of which protocol is used to download it. If you were to use the bitcoin client to download the whole chain from the beginning (which would probably be stupid when the chain is multi-terabyte) it would likely take even longer.

This is a bit of an echo chamber, for sure.
However, I don't think you understand the bitcoin roots/history very well. When people here say inflation is bad that's because it's part of the bitcoin belief system. Satoshi included a headline in the genesis block: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". This is a reference to the financial crisis of 2008 which was heavily seen as being a fault of the banking system (which itself is largely responsible for inflation through fractional banking). The original Bitcoin whitepaper boasts that Bitcoin is "inflation free".
So being anti-inflation is baked into the foundations of Bitcoin. Many of the early adopters also shared these sentiments and saw Bitcoin as a way to escape inflationary currencies altogether (without having to rely on something as impractical as physical gold).

8MB is not that much by itself. But in the worst case, where somebody fills those blocks each and every time, you have 8MB every 10 minutes, or ~1GB per day. Now try adding a new node to the network. We would like new nodes to still be able to join the network next year. Or in 5, 10, and 20 years.

I readily admit my knowledge of SPV fraud proofs is a bit patchy, but I believe your question was already answered in the comment you replied to. The problem is that if that one honest node is shut down, the size of the blockchain will prohibit any new full nodes to join the network. The ability for new full nodes to join the network is essential to the security of the network, otherwise all a malicious entity has to do to shut down the whole network is to start shutting down existing full nodes by force (such as e.g. a government might be able to do).

I don't get the people who keep saying Bitcoin isn't democratic. Isn't that what "one-CPU-one-vote" in Satoshi's paper is all about? That's how concensus on the longest chain is reached.
I am against raising the block size limit too much (definitely against removing it completely), but I am very much FOR proliferation of clients. Ideally, every bitcoin developer would have their own repository and every bitcoin user (pool/miner/merchant/end-user) would make their own decision about which developer's repository to use. Bitcoin Core, being in a somewhat privileged position, should never include code that would cause a hard fork until it is clear that everybody is already using the new rules.

Deflatory by design? I don't think so.
The total number of coins in existence is still increasing. But at some point it will stop, at 21 million coins.
What is causing "current deflation" is the expanding user base -- increasing demand, because more new people are learning about bitcoin. (There is also demand generated by speculators, though.)
But at some point, increase in demand will level off. At that point it will presumably not be deflationary any more, but have a more or less stable value (like gold, which also has a limited supply).
Unless you were referring to this period of expanding user base?

It's a new paradigm. Ethereum has literally solved every problem bitcoin faces at 100x the speed and accuracy. They have superior technology and several massively successful dapps. The chart is vertical and can't change direction it would literally implode the universe on itself.

Well, if you also consider the fact that your profit is somebody else's loss, then we might as well say that you're taking advantage of dumb people (or at least people who are dumber than you are).
This is exactly why day so many people hate day traders as well.

You didn't get it -- the shop doesn't immediately receive the money from your credit card either. So in that sense, bitcoin lets the merchant get their money even faster.
(Double spending could be an issue with bitcoin, though.)

Only the operation of the bitcoin network is "backed by" mining/physics/mathematics. The currency itself is not backed by anything.

I personally believe that the "community" here consists of a massive amount of sockpuppets who are trying to manipulate the general perception of bitcoin (propaganda, if you will). Just look at the whole dogecoin thing. I seriously doubt that so many people feel so strongly against bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:11:37
Dogecoin is not really funny if you're a Bitcoin proponent. There's a hidden agenda there to discredit Bitcoin.

It's dead common to buy Ibuprofen in packs of 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg tablets. If you don't say what you want, they will ask "400 mg?" I'm pretty sure it's the same for nasal spray.

He's right, nobody knows with certainty what's going to happen with bitcoin. Some people say it's a penny stock or tulip mania. Some people say it will be $100,000/btc if the whole gold market moves to bitcoin. There's no way to know for sure, you have to evaluate each argument and take a calculated risk.

The merchant can always verify the transaction themselves. If the transaction is valid, there is an overwhelming probability that they will receive the funds. The only thing that can "go wrong" (i.e. cause the merchant to not receive the money) is if the customer secretly released another transaction spending the same bitcoins to another node in the network. In that case, it's simply a matter of which transaction is mined (incorporated in the block chain) first.
I'm not sure if they've added "conflicting transaction detection" to the mainline client yet, but there really ought to be a warning if you're on the receiving end of an unmined transaction that is in conflict another unmined transaction on the network.

That's not what I mean by backing. For example, the US dollar was backed by gold until 1971, since the exchange rate between gold and US dollars was fixed.

It's not really deflationary by design. It's designed to have a fixed (and limited) supply -- in fact, I suspect the halving of the block reward was designed precisely so as to compensate for adoption.

They said something about risk management.
I'm guessing they don't trust coinbase, and that they are afraid of chargebacks on coinbase transactions.

It's not about the number of clients connected to the network, it's all about the miners.
But even the miners cannot really do all that much damage. They cannot start awarding themselves more bitcoins per block than they are entitled to, or to make up illegitimate transactions.
It's all about which protocol you're following. If you don't follow the Bitcoin protocol, you effectively have your own currency which is separate from Bitcoin. You cannot subvert other clients running the true Bitcoin protocol even if you have more non-Bitcoin clients than Bitcoin clients.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:57:59
I think he meant overestimated.
You'd expect that place to be one of the last places for bitcoin to reach. Well, turns out it's already there. So where else can it grow to?

I keep seeing Bitcoin articles in the newspaper which I *know* a lot of family/friends/etc. read, yet none of them actually picked up on it until I told them about it.
But this is about to change. I see more and more Bitcoin articles in local mass media, and people are going to notice it soon whether they want to or not.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:38:56
Simplified, but not wrong: Miners essentially try to find some big number that when combined with publicly known transaction data hashes to a number with a certain number of 0 digits in it, i.e. they try to find the solution to a math puzzle.
Finding a solution takes time. The solutions themselves are not useful for anything except serving as the "proof of effort". When you find a solution, you can publish it to the rest of the network, which can then easily verify that your number is indeed a solution to the math puzzle.
The fact that it takes time/effort to find a solution is what gives everybody a fair chance at solving it.
Technically, the miners calculate a double SHA256 hash over a transaction block (including a hash of the transactions it contains, a timestamp, and a random nonce). See 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:12:33
While you are correct, I'm pretty sure you also take into account which way the price moves, so a "sell off" moves the price down, while a "massive buy" moves the price up.
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:47:15


That's not entirely true. Whenever you make, say, a purchase in bitcoins, hopefully wealth is *exchanged*, not transferred in one way only. So you explain the distribution of *bitcoins*, but not the distribution of wealth.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:28:29
This post comes across as somewhat unnecessary, but more importantly it also comes across as fear of other cryptocurrencies.
People seem to be starting to realise that Bitcoin's advantages over traditional currency are also exactly Litecoin's advantages, so in a sense it doesn't matter for the price of a bitcoin that the number of bitcoins is limited, as long as you get exactly the same storage/transfer properties with another currency.
Now it becomes clear that whatever "market share" (fiat cap) Litecoin has is at the expense of Bitcoin, thus driving Bitcoin's price down. So it's in every Bitcoin holder's interest to discredit other cryptocurrencies.
Sure, the article has a lot of good points. But I'd also prefer if it told the whole story. As it is, it seems to be driving a hidden agenda, which is never a nice thing.
