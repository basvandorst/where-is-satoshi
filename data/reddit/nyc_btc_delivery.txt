Regarding LA, we were also considering other regional markets too. I certainly think a chain/franchise operation woul be the best way to build a brand, though regulatory concerns could be more serious at that point too. 
NYC is to us the most immediately glaring market because of the high prevalence of delivery services, as well as the presence of EVR club, the high quantity of BTC traders around Wall Street, etc.

It sure does! And outside of a single craigslist ad for a part-time trader, I don't think this service exists yet in that area at all.

I think I can safely say that any ID requirements are flat out. Like you say, the main point of such a service is anonymity.
I think we will have to take a combination of measures to protect ourselves, while our clients can feel relatively safe, so long as enough of our customers report their successful transactions here on Reddit.
We will likely restrict a buyer's first few transactions in quantity, in favor of repeated small transactions.
For bitcoin sales, we will likely require the BTC to be pre-deposited to an address provided in advance. Once confirmations are received, cash could be delivered in a simple hand-off since we'd have already cleared the BTC in advance.
I think these measures would reduce our risk enough that we could avoid charging new customers excessive fees, but that is also a route we could take to cover our bottomline against risk.

I think that would predominantly be a risk we would face as the service operators. I hope that building a reputation can help reassure any potential customers, particularly large ones, that we are about getting business done, not about throwing away a reputation for a lousy $10k max.
Public place meetings are always possible as well, I just think with on-going relationships, many clients might prefer the privacy of in-home or in-car exchange.

This is definitely a threat we will make every attempt to mitigate. Obviously this gives us an incentive to strongly incentivize our repeat customers and solid referrals.

Well, not quite an alternative to localbitcoins. I am sure we would list our service on there (though we would probably handle our own escrow)
