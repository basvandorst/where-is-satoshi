Wouldn't it be funny if Satoshi is actually the US Reserve bank or other reserve bank draining the available money supply by disclosing a bug when BTC is worth $1m because they did too much QE and needed to claw it back from somewhere. Remember BTC was created shortly after the subprime mortgage and initial QE by the US Reserve.

Can someone explain to me why wouldn't the  government just keeps on borrowing money while interested is negative? They can effectively reduce their defecit this way. Sure they might take a hit with exchange rate initially but if everyone does the same thing it shouldn't really matter.

I feel sorry for the people who got 400 per coin but now will buy them at 10k per coin. Talk about being short changed.

The article is comparing 2 years of Amazon to 1 year of BTC and ETH (or 3 yrs to 2 yrs depending on how you look at it). If you zoom out and change the scale to 2015 to 2017 for ETH you will realize the return is ~2200X or 220000%
