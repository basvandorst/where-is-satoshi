 I never sent coins from circle to any shady addresses. Unless they looked at my BTC Address and noticed some transactions going to alpha Bay. So they'd have to look on the Block chain.. I always went circle - personal BTC address - purchases (Various stuff, legal and not). Never had any issues with coin base though..

A very frustrating experience with circle as well. I was with them for two months. I asked twice to raise the limit and they declined. After asking the second time. I got an email
We have carefully reviewed the information you provided us and unfortunately we will not be able to offer you service. We made this decision in order to comply with federal regulations and protect our customers from fraud.
We cannot go into specific details about what led us to our decision. Thank you for understanding..
So I'm going to coinbase and would recommend it for others over circle
