So on Robinhood when you want to sell your shares of BTC what happens? Can you still transfer that money to a bank account?
Are you saying you can't make a profit or are you saying you can't actually own the data that constitutes the amount of BTC you own?
Sorry, I'm *very* new tot his and just trying to figure things out. I just bought $50 of BTC on Robinhood as an experiment/learning experience. I figure I can lose it and it won't be too big of a blow, but I'd like to get more involved the stock exchange and cryptos.

Asking as an honest question: why is this?
Does the value of BTC rise the more people buy it? Are people still discovering new blocks (am I using that term correctly)?
I find this really interesting but also I don't know much about it at all.

True, but is there a good reason to expect that kind of thing to happen again? And it could just as easily implode, couldn't it?

I'll check it out :D Thanks

Thank you! I really appreciate the help. It's honestly so intimidating to come into this from an outside perspective. I've always just worked low-wage jobs and focused on paying the rent every month. Now I'm doing a little better in life and starting to take an interest in investing. 
I know BTC isn't the stock market, but really, stocks and crypto are like foreign languages to an outsider. With crypto you've got blockchains and wallets and stuff like that, and with stocks you've got futures and EFTs and puts and calls and so on. It's overwhelming when all you know about how money works is that you get two paychecks a month, with one going to your rent and the other going to your student loan payment, gas, and food.

TBH I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing, new (Edit: crypto and also) the stock market in general, but I just bought $50 worth of BTC because why not? If I lose it, oh well, but looking at the trends this $50 could turn into $100 in a year or whatever. It's not much, but making little investments over time can add up. I also bought $50 of a couple actual stocks. I figure I'll set myself at a $100/mo cap on investing and just try it out for a year. I can afford it and it's kind of fun. I do want to actually learn the lingo and concepts, though.

Interesting stuff..I'm definitely going to be reading all about this soon.

Okay. I'll do some research on how to make sure I own my own keys!

Thanks - that's good info. I guess I knew that, I'm just getting involved in both at the same time.
Anyway I have a lot to learn, obviously, but you've got to start somewhere. I'm making a little more money than I used to (not a lot, but enough that I'm finally above the "basic needs only" level), and I'd like to take some measured financial risks to see if I can make anything. Probably never going to own a yacht, but maybe I can snag a couple hundred bucks after a couple years.
