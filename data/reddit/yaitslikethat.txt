And this proves.....what? That you can file for an application? So what? Did you even scroll down the page to read this bit:
Company Name:  	CRYPTYLABS LLC*
*File Number:  	5542023*
*Filing State:  	Delaware (DE)*
*Filing Status:  	Unknown*
*Filing Date:  	May 28, 2014*
*Company Age:  	3 Months*
and nothing comes up for that case number in DCA.gov website. Also, that's the only posting related to this 'company' other than numerous job postings from 'writing' to 'legal', not to mention your post history says otherwise, including your post in r/jobs4bitcoin. I was a serious programmer interested in a cool startup but this is anything but that. now this is just more for shits and gigs. Are YOU even getting paid to pander this shit, or did you get promised an internship? ;)

any effort other than 0% is laughable considering I was joking. 2 minutes of your life wasted for a complete stranger :] you can at least buy me dinner next time.

I'll just leave this right here....
and to quote: 
"The Obama Administration cited national security when withholding information from FOIA requests more than 8,000 times in 2013, the Associated Press reports. 'That’s a 57 percent increase over a year earlier and more than double Obama’s first year, when it cited that reason 3,658 times,' Ted Bridis and Jack Gillum write."

Happy customers with no website and your post is for "bot developers" when your first product is supposed to be a bot that you say you already have....seems legit. Did you show up at their house and promise them a unicorn too? This has red flags written all over it, from the shoddy grammar in your first post, to your lame excuses for not answering basic, fundamental questions and instead answering by making vague claims that have no proof of evidence. Do you even have a business license? If so, I'd be able to look it up in the Department of Consumer Affairs website. Can you even provide that to show you're legit? If not, well then....good luck lol.

"Just too busy" is a poor answer when it comes to your brand and digital presence, especially when the company touts to be a "marketing and design company". People who may be interested in spending their bitcoins will instantly be turned away from the site for aesthetic and functionality reasons. The fixes to implement are minor and can be done by any novice webdesigner in CSS alone -- I'm sure you guys can figure something out. :p

I was going to say this reminded me of MIT's media lab logo but someone beat me to it. Which is a big no-no in the world of design, especially logo design. Breaks one of the key fundamental rules -- MUST BE UNIQUE TO YOUR BRAND. as soon as someone can compare your logo to another, you've failed in your design. What this really appears to be is a beginner designer's attempt at exploring new design techniques. In that case, this is not bad. Definitely will never be adapted to bitcoin though, sorry brochacho.

There are already innumerable techie/hacker hangouts and cafes throughout the world that offer extremely similar characteristics of what you're envisioning, and sometimes even moreso. Although it is a nice idea, your fatal flaw is that you're assuming everyone wants/can afford mining hardware. Especially in a day and age now where smaller mining operations are becoming unprofitable for individuals unless they invest heavily into hardware, this idea doesn't have a strong pull. In fact, you already single out a significant amount of potential "customers" because your main selling point is neither unique nor enticing and requires alot of initial investment that most people can't afford. When you strip that away, all you're offering is a Starbucks.

No salary requirements....No website....Not even a made-up name for a fake representative does very little to instill faith here. You should probably figure out a few logistics of running a business before trying to start one. Especially when you're using the guise of "bitcoin startup" to cover what your real intentions are. And let's face it, day-trading bitcoin has very little to do with "use" and "accessibility" in terms of mass adoption. So either you have no idea what you're doing, or you're simply looking to cash in on someone else's work -- more than likely without paying them or promising them "shares" in your "company".

Where to begin on this one....it looks like a color-blind high-schooler downloaded a Wordpress theme and just said "Fuck you W3C! Fuck you responsive design!" with both hands raised in the air in defiant angst.
Poorly designed UI/UIX, poorly chosen color palette (or lack thereof), random paddings/margins completely throw off vertical rhythm and destroys legibility. I could go into depth, but like cab000se I do this for a living and I normally charge for my consulting services. You guys have more to worry about before accepting bitcoin, like honoring basic design theory.

Yeah, other comments also saying that you were retarded and got played. If I've made a shit ton of money from it, then why aren't you? Oh yeah....because you think someone buying a few DOGE to pump the price ticker is a rally lol. Clearly it is a user error and not the other way around babycakes ;) Keep pretending you know what you're talking about it's adorable!

You use Cryptsy for one day and immediately it sucks?  You got played because you don't know how to read the charts and market history -- simple as that. Don't blame novice trading skills on a tried and trusted exchange, brochacho!
@_date: 2014-08-15 06:27:04
Yeah, and what are you going to 'launch' in 5 weeks exactly, seeing as though you don't even have a developer who knows basic HTML5 or at the VERY least, a site built around a wordpress template you can buy for $45. Who is "we", anyway, you and the mouse in your pocket? Where's your capital? Business model? How are you going to pay employees? FINCEN regulations? Not to mention your supposed million-dollar-idea is extremely late to the game considering the market is already saturated with a handful of trade bots, both for cryptocurrency and external fiat types. You're better off trying to do apply for a position in an existing bitcoin startup and one that's actually doing something to change the landscape of crypto in general because I can guarantee you the amount of users who actually do any day trading who don't already have bots is so miniscule that you're destined to fail before you even begin.
