I'd prefer if he put aside Microsoft stock he bought in the 70s.

You're an idiot.

Retard.

You really are dense. It was a joke to demonstrate how retarded your point was. My grandfather did not actually invest in Microsoft and neither did yours. However, you can invest in a company before it has an IPO. Please stop you really are clutching at straws now.

What do you mean docs? Are you saying it's impossible to invest in a company before an IPO? Companies can exchange securities for investment with private investors without ever offering them publicly. I don't need to provide "docs" stating this because it's a self evident fact only a complete moron would be unaware of. 
You can't actually be this stupid can you? It's actually funny how you think you have a point. My point was that Microsoft stock bought in the seventies would be a better investment than gold. Your response is that the Microsoft IPO wasn't until 1984? That's really the best you can come up with? Ok, in my complete hypothetical my imaginary grandfather was an angel investor in Microsoft in the 70s. 
Money is not an investment. Money is what is used to invest. Now go play with your shiny yellow coins. Quack.

No I understand it. I was choosing to show how idiotic your thought experiment was. I'd prefer my grandfather invested in something rather than left me a piece of paper currency. Preferably a good investment like stock.
