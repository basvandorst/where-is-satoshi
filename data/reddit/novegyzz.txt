The No Vegyzz never thought, that no puzzle will be solved after more than an hour. To difficult for Bitcoiners? Need more hints? Wait a few hours for more hints. If the smart guys let you ..... Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

There is one starting point at bitcointalk.org

I checked the video again and every puzzle is definitely solvable. Some of them are pretty difficult but there are some very easy ones too.

One more address confirmed: 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:35:48
Maybe try hex
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:23:05
There is not only one starting point, but there are several.

Another day another hint
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:30:47
The video helps definitely to solve some of them
edit: and it is a nice clip worth watching

Don't you like the idea?

The puzzle, that lead to the private key 8 was easy:
If you watched the video until the very end, you will hear a sound, which if you were able to reproduce the notation it will result in a 99 notes melody with 6 different notes. If you have turned this base6 code into base58check you got the private key. Pretty easy, huh?

That was indeed a nice move. A guy on Bitcointalk even was talking about he saw this code in connection with the bible. If he only knew about the Satoshi Bible ;-D

There are a minimum of 4 guys close to catch a goose. This much I can tell.

I just got a pm from somebody who is definitely on the right track. It's solvable. Use your brain!
