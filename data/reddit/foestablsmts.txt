Solid point.
That's what I understood too but this extremely fast increase of price scares me, I feel like it's natural that an adjustment of price is coming but the question is at what point will it be? 
I feel like it may drop hard and that would be a great time to buy.
Probably I'm just keeping myself from thinking that bitcoin will grow forever and will eventually destroy banks lol. 
Edit: spelling

guys a quick question: is it better if i stick to buying per dollar average every week or should I wait for a dip?
Things are going extremely fast and I don't know if it's convenient to put an order to buy at 12500 euros if now it's nearly 15k 
should I buy now or wait for an incoming dip?

Oh sorry I misunderstood your question, I guess somebody else will have to answer because I'd like to know too. 
Let's wait for a kind soul to enlighten us

Cancelling order now.
A dip it's the best thing that can happen now, the most natural consequence I'd say

yes jesus the situation on gdax it's mental, 13k euros now and going down 
edit: placed an order at 10k euros because I can't watch gdax all day lol

It's important that you insert a buy limit different from the actual price, doing so allow you to become a "maker" and you don't have to pay fees.
The price really depends on what you think about the situation of the market right now, if you feel that it may go down to a certain price then set it.
If you check gdax once a day you can modify your order following the market's movement, and it also depend on how many bitcoins you want to buy, for example I want 0.02 bitcoin and 250 euros to spend
I set 0.02 at 10k euros limit and wait.
All of this IMHO, if someone want to add something more specific is very welcome, I'd be glad to learn more too.

Good old days playing Counter Strike so I can relate to that.
That's an interesting point of view, I feel that I'm on the winning side big time and will continue investing. 
Thanks for taking time to answer

Hi guys, I just bought 0.03213144 BTC (300 euros) on Coinbase and transferred all of it to my Electrum wallet
is this the right thing to do?
I decided to jump in right now so any advice is really welcome
I don't want to sell any time soon, is it convenient to buy little amounts and transfer everytime?
Thanks
