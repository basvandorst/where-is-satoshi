Bisq is open source.
Edit: no one except trading partners exchange personally identifying data. All personal data is stored locally. So the developers can't 'sell out,' especially given that it has end-to-end encrypted communication routed over Tor. And Bisq does not hold any funds, it is p2p trades (individual to indiviual, no 3rd party holding funds).
It's all information you can find on the front page of the Bisq website.

Ok that's fine but Bisq is a decentralized, open source, free, p2p application. I don't understand who would benefit from paying people (sponsoring them) to give a review of something that is free and open source. My only benefit if someone uses Bisq is that I have more people to trade with, which is mutually and equally beneficial.

Let me clarify: 5-20 USD/BTC trade offers, which is my only interest at at moment. Probably over 100 other trade offers with other national currencies and/or altcoins.

You do not deposit cash on Bisq. 
There are multiple accepted ways to pay for BTC with USD including Zelle, CashApp, Venmo, Wire Transfer, Cash Deposit, etc... 
When you enter a trade to buy BTC, you add a security deposit from your BTC wallet. The seller also adds a security deposit in BTC, and when the trade is initiated their BTC they are selling is locked in and they cant back out (unless you don't send the money in which an arbitrator helps out). You send the money via the specified method, and when the seller confirms they have the money, the BTC goes into your Bisq wallet (which you have the keys for).
You can specify a percentage of the market value you want to trade. So if BTC is $10000, I can put in a buy offer for -1%, and a seller can accept my offer and I would pay $9900 for 1BTC.
You can have accounts in BTC and many other altcoins. You can also trade with other national currencies.
I have never used localbitcoins. Bisq is a decentralized p2p network. By default it sets up a Tor node when you start the application as well.
For details of how to use Bisq, you can find good youtube videos.

The arbitrator is needed only if there are issues with the trade, which I assume only happens with national currencies because they are so far behind the superior blockchain technology. This of course is no fault of Bisq, but the way my trading issue was resolved gave me confidence in using my outdated State "currency" to buy superior technology safely and remotely.

No. Tell me about it.

Not sure, can probably find this info in the whitepaper. I don't know all the nuances of Bisq, I just wanted to share my experience. If I am ever successful enough to trade large amounts, I will be sure to read all the details of the whitepaper. If you happen to find out the answer please let me know.

Not marketing, just a review.

Download Bisq, start trading. You have the option of choosing different trading methods which could require you to use other apps like Venmo, CashApp, Zelle, etc... but this is just a testament to the user 'unfriendliness' of national currencies - it is no fault of Bisq.
If you are strictly trading crypto to crypto, nothing is requied except for Bisq and your crypto wallet(s).


I am unfamiliar with OpenLedger. Could you give a brief explanation of what it is and why you like it?
