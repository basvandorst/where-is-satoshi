I don't know,
But would be very costly and you would need lots of hash rate to be sure to push your big blocks,
But not impossible for sure, but how efficient to push out of business small miner?
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:58:26
Some guys should fork bitcoin -as an experiement- to try this Idea,
With very small block, the blockchain being 100% used to settle offchain tx, the mining incentive might have to be rethought..
Not being sacarstic, it might interest way to experiment..
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:54:49
Never say it was omnitient,
But he has very thought every detail, you should read "the book of satoshi"
You will be surprised to see to almost the issue we discussing now his has always discuss about it in detail before.
(Very very cheap if you buy it as an ebook)
@_date: 2015-08-12 09:48:10
Monero was forked to give it a fair distribution.
There all new dev team now.
Most of the code as been rewritten.
Have a look at thier subreddit if you courious.
What I like about it:
-not a bitcoin fork
-privacy 
-coin 100%fungable
-dynamic -per block- block size limit.
-dynamic -per block- block reward. (No dramatic halving every four years, but smooth reward reduction)
-ASIC resistant PoW
To me big potential.
I have bought a bit of litecoin, just curious to see how the halving would go.
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:57:31
I am don't believe at this kind of argument,
"Too complex you cannot understand" "i know what is better for you"
But then no worry, if the network effectively go on with the big blog hard fork and if having 1mb is so advantageous you guys can fork bitcoin or maintain the old fork ultimatly if it's the better solution the market will find out.
I can expose the raison I like to have bigger block and if I have to make simple it:
-I believe the bitcoin need bigger blocker block AND paiments channel/ side chain/ lightning network/ off chain transaction. To scale butcoin need all.
-on chain Tx should stay as cheap as technicaly possible to let any kind of use/innovation possible.
-a high value settlement network is great idea but I fail to see how it cannot be done with big blocks.
-a expensive to access blockchain and pure settlement network is massive change for original bitcoin philosophy. 
-I don't like the idea of relying in third party off chain Tx to scale. That might end up making people move away from bitcoin (I certainly would)
-relying on not yet ready innovation is a big bet. (See the post on lightining network where it is say the LN is no where near ready)
-number of node will increase with mass adoption. (As a merchant running is a small price to pay for the added security)
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:31:54
Ultimatly they vote your design by buying or not your end product
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:12:00
Forget about bitcoinXT or bitcoin core,
It's about the block size limit, bitcoin with a bigger block size will obviously be bitcoin!
But a 1mb bitcoin based on third party solution and blockstream to scale will certainly completely change his use and purpose I would argue that 1mb bitcoin will be the altcoin!
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:03:04
Then don't read the said post.
You seem to have a bias toward small block.
It is not because you disagree with that the discusion should stop.
Unless your are a mod :)
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:26:19
Full node being too expensive is exactly the reason why I don't run node... /s
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:37:34
If you want bigger block than 1mb you have to do an hard fork. No way around it.
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:20:01
SN made not doubt about it,
Temporary fix;the limit will be raised in the future
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:53:18
Running a node is a way to vote..
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:23:11
I would to avoid any fork for sure..
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:08:20
Hey I have quite surprise by that too!
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:15:45
Sorry but the 1mb was a temporary state and known for a long time.
Saying that bigger block would be an altcoin is dishonest.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:29:03
This great, it is way it should happen,
For once we have 'open' financial system were we got vote (by running node) even if that mean it might not going the way I want.
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:40:32
Why better?
I just wished there would not need to open port to run a node.
I travel a lot I would run my node everywhere  I go otherwise,
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:45:06
I would agree,
But It might be worth doing the experiment...
On separate chain with limit like 10kb blocks and a LN taking all Tx,
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:15:06
Lightning is not likely a good tool to scale now,
How many bitcoiner send Tx daily? most of us only probably send only few Tx a week, you would not locked some coin away unless you use the network more..
If use LN now will likely not help the network much.
When Bitcoin will be more use by everyone on daily basis LN will be probably very efficient..
But -at least- in Europe we are far away from that.. Its hard to find any place/merchant that accept bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:22:06
I am not sure I get what you say, but i would expect the hash rate to drop as the BTC price as it less profitable to mine, its a good sign for the halving next year,
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:27:09
More fees = more fees income fore the miner get it?
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:57:24
100% agree they should give thier opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:30:16
I thought I could also keep not activate prunning on my node,
So it would act as an archive node, and help other node to get the blockchain, that help thet network a bit am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:55:25
There both at early stage of development..
I think they should be integreted to bitcoin when ready and that might mean after an increase in block size,
Even if ready thier adoption will take time, they a preventive solution not a curative one.
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:35:20
One attack of the monero might be interresting to study dynamic block size.
The attack meant to grow the blocks until a bug has temporay broken the network.
I believe the Tx was for a will big than bitcoin.
It might be a good live "experiment" to get lesson from.
(Simulating a case of rapid adoption/ high demand on little number of node.. Etc..)
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:58:22
I feel like you,
A just to 8mb is unlikely to kill the network.
Bitcoin has to grow,
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:06:47
I think not,
The fully transparent ledger may lead to many issue for business, personal safety, opresive gouverment...
I believe it will be the next big controversy subject on Bitcoin.. Probably bigger than the block size debate..
@_date: 2015-08-12 09:51:07
IQ..  Why they are constent insulting in the sub..
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:48:47
I did run a bitcoin core node, I stopped when I had access to SPV wallet and being told that if can't open your port you are not helping the network.
@_date: 2015-08-13 10:28:25
Censorship.. I thought thanks to bitcoin it would be a thing of the past.. This a hard reminder..
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:25:59
What make you think the off blockchain solutoin will be ready in a year?
Even if the off blockchain where ready now you them to be tested and mature enough to be truted at large scale with YOUR bitcoin!
It take also time to deploy them..
And lightining and sidechain show now sugn to be ready soon
@_date: 2015-08-13 10:06:41
But please explain how my node with no port open how my node would help the network,
Have been told the opposite so I like to know.
I guess is my node will help Tx propagation..
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:50:32
Don't you think its important to know that the limit has been added as an after thought? 
That the previous limit was 32mb?
And 1mb is no magical number!
All satoshi work was very well thought, you should read his post,
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:29:37
I think it is relevant to say that satoshi added the 1mb as a temporay protection and was meant to be removed.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:39:19
Really let's crash my car it might just end up work better than before..
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:57:26
You have no control of those coin as long as they are locked,
Or close the channel repay fees which and add another Tx the blockchain.
LN or payment channel for 1 Tx -&gt; 2 Tx on the blockchain
2 LN Tx -&gt; 2 Tx on the blockchain
3 LN TX -&gt; 2 Tx on the blockchain
Effectively very effiecient when the Tx increase,
Depend for those confortable to leave most of your coin in "hot wallet" for long periode of time and with LN well deploy you indeed greatly reduce your blockchain footprint..
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:19:17
How about onehash?
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:08:35
Thats a tyran we've got here..
And nice to know that the block size limit is a bit less controvertial than an unlimited number of coin!
I almost fell down my chair when read that..
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:49:32
But I will not be validating Tx, so not helping the not network,
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:43:40
I wish I could open the port on my internet connection,
I would be running a node for a good 6 months..
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:35:51
Halving in 20days smart move,
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:14:44
No access to my internet router.
The cost for me to run a node would be literaly zero.
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:19:00
It definitly better to act far before an overload of the network..
Waiting for some magical solution to be ready on time is not very wise..
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:13:48
None of them are design as a settlement blockchain..
(Very low and restrictive blocksize limit)
And that make me think there is no demand for it.
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:38:23
I like the idea of a dynamic block limit.
If set right would not need any further adujtement and can soft forked to lower the limit if it grow beyond bandwidth capability.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:03:01
So you think there will never be more than 1mb of non-spam Tx?
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:57:32
Actualy it is interresting to see that the hash rate has continued to raised over the last year dispite the drop in price,
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:31:42
And that what is good with bitcoinXT it will fork only if it get consensus.
It give the comunity the oportunity to take the decision. (Or not)
I think its fair,
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:53:11
Well said, 
It make sense that you want the network to be patched by too much soft fork.. I might get the all process unstable,
 
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:33:57
High fees might block innovative use of the blockchain we have yet no idea of.
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:46:16
Lightning is very good  to get Tx off the blockchain for specific use, 
But are the commun bitcoiner send Tx daily? 
Would lock coins away unless you use it daily?
It is not clear LN would give any help for bitcoin before mass adoption,
It might just give 0 help on that regard now,
In few years it would a diferent story..
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:52:14
I like the idea of dynamic block size limit, some other crypto use successfuly,
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:02:53
When ready, LN will use the network capacity 1mb if it is ready on time.
As a big block supporter I would befinitly like to be ready on before that but it doesn't change the need for network increase capacity at some point.
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:41:38
How convinient people disagree that propaganda..
A least on the big block side there no conflit of interrest, 
All network will benefit from bigger capacity not third party solution.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:20:46
So I am clearly on of those people and you are the smart guy,
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:54:40
How you can be sure a Tx is spam?
There are many use of a Tx beside sending money.
My guess is as long as the Tx got enough fee it is not spam.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:19:10
And what is your point?
@_date: 2015-08-12 10:20:35
Dynamic block size limit (monero) might be interrested.
Plus they had an attack last year (flooding of Tx) this give a chance to how the network has dealt with extrem growth in short time.
A good controlled experiment to study I think :)
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:42:21
In my case I cannot open port on my internet access,
Otherwise I would be running a node for a good 6 months..
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:47:30
With 10% of the hash power, the old chain would be so expose 51% attack it would be ridiculus even thinking using it!
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:41:43
Dynamic block size is being used succefully by other crypto currency,
Any proposal of that kind for BTC?
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:58:05
Read what you say you clearly say that it takes an idiot to want bigger block..
You say uneducated people naturaly want bigger block, please explain what secret feature is hidden behind 1mb so complicated that only 20% will get it?
Give it a go, or stay with your argument bigger block is for idiot..
@_date: 2015-08-12 10:45:32
Bitcoin need to scale to survive.
At this stage bitcoin is two small and can kill overnight by bank and state.
A massive for a state pump and dump would kill thrust in all crypto...
It not to be big enough so it will politicaly stupid to try to kill it (to much protest)
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:47:53
What make you say bigger block is a solution we know it's not going to work?
Bitcoin has mostly grown until now by creating bigger blocks,
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:51:59
Thank for your reply!
You got my respect!
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:30:29
Note that there was 90 XT nodes two days ago..
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:45:22
More fees = more fees income for miner is wishful thinking?
Please explain,
@_date: 2015-08-10 09:50:51
And bitcoin relying massively on third party solution to scale is still bitcoin?
I don't think so,
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:06:13
I agree and Bitcoin need both big block and lightning/side chain.
As most of the big block crowd.
@_date: 2015-08-10 09:40:08
True the 1mb bitcoin will have rely massively on blockstream and third party offchain solutions to scale..
Not at all what bitcoin was meant to be!!
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:15:18
BitcoinXT give the option to the community to get bigger blocks,
If the comunity wants it will take over if not it will not,
Thats sound more democratic than an attack,
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:06:55
A hard fork can be created without breaking any rule.
If you had a blocksize minimum size let say valid should be at 800kb, you have created an hard fork without breaking previous rules.
You description is not accurate.
@_date: 2015-08-13 05:55:01
You say miner has nothing to do with a fork,
But if left with 25% of the hashing power, the old fork will be left with very long confirmation (retargetting will be far far away) and so expose to 51% attack, 
Any coin on this chain will have no value as Tx would be at high to be reverted/double spend,
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:04:06
You say the drop in full node come from the getting to be full?
So SPV wallet has nothing to do with that?
Effectively if what you say is true we are all doomed and bitcoin will explode if get any block bigger than 1mb.. .. /s
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:44:28
The solution is not bigger block or something else.
The solution is bigger block and sidechain and lightning network and offchain Tx, bitcoin need all to scale,
Bitcoin, if successfull, need to grow 2,4 order a magnitude..
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:08:49
With the price almost stable for quite some time.. I would have imagine the hash rate would have dropped by now.. That s good!
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:35:29
I do have an opinion,
You think its too complex and you cannot have an opinion, well why not.
Or your asumption is if you are for big blocks you are uneducated on the subject,
You know some people can disagree with you without being an idiot.
@_date: 2015-08-10 09:28:29
I would go monero..
Privacy, dynamic blocksize.. It a shame but maybe Bitcoin has gotten too big to make any change,
I am also decreasing my holding,
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:43:29
Agree, but even LN cannot scale to visa level with 1mb blocks
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:22:43
Well raised if you will,
I believe it was 32mb before he put the 1mb
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:38:26
And in that case the fees income will start to get significant, which is good!
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:46:09
Bitcoin being the only cryptocurrency viable due is network effect is true today but you can't tell for the future especialy if the blockchain can't deal with the demand.
I too want want to become rich by owning only fews "only to be used" bitcoins.
But there is no clear sign of that, competition is around (i think its a good thing) quite the contrary other coin got key feature that bitcoin lack and they likely to gain adoption.
(Actualy even litecoin can get a boost if bitcoin get overloaded his feature would be capacity available)
For the settlement blockchain it was hypotheisis creation a coin from stratch with that idea in mind is an interesting project IMO
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:43:42
How can you tell?
Only time will tell when they be stable, 
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:21:22
Spam I believe, 
I have to check the book of satoshi,
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:26:25
You coin will exist in chain.
Its unlikely both chain coexist form any long time,
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:35:05
Yes a softfork that need a hard to be reverted
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:38:22
You prefer being conservative by blocking post that doesn't fit you believe...
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:37:25
I would argue than increasing the block limit before the reaching the limit of the system is the conservative move.
That is to say changing the engine BEFORE the old engine stop working.
I am an aircraft maintenance engineer we keep any plane safe by change parts before they have any chance to fail.
Failing to do so could be catastrophic.
