Your response is that you would tell the person threatening to rape your children that they are upstanding citizens merely utilizing their freedom of speech to threaten your children with rape. You somehow arrived at the idea that a teenage girl saying “hey stop threatening to rape me” is equivalent to “I want to ban any and all speech I don’t personally approve of,” so that you could feel and seem superior when your argument was actually not against anything anyone said. 
You’ve also clearly never dealt with the reddit administrators. Reporting any threats to them, you’ll be lucky if they respond in less than a week. If you contact police, they will be most likely to dismiss you because “online isn’t real,” despite the fact that threats made online—even from people thousands of miles away—can become real very fast (such as the man in Wichita, KS, who was killed when police shot him after being summoned to his house by a false report from someone in California). 
In short:
You don’t view rape threats as a problem, nor threats made online in general, because you’ve been lucky and privileged enough to never face actual harm from any you’ve received, and you’ve likely made those very threats against others without personally intending to carry through on them, merely to intimidate. You’re out of your league in trying to dictate how others should respond, and are the exact reason a lot of people want nothing to do with reddit, bitcoin, or online communities in general. 
Sorry if this offends you.

Aww, an anon account accuses someone else of needing a safe space. How cute.

hoo doggy. didn’t realize how brittle you lot get about differing opinions.

seems pretty weird to think “don’t send rape threats to people on the internet” is a ‘retarded opinion’. might want to ask yourself why you’re so opposed to that idea.

lol ok, quite a brigade here snowflake

so you’re accusing me of brigading because, in a specific comment chain about a specific thing, I didn’t address things from other comment chains that are not this specific comment chain. 
have you considered you like to argue for only the sake of arguing? if you’re that desperate for attention, like, I dunno, start a twitch stream or something.
