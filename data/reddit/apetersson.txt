web rtc could be an option. but somebody will have to keep the full node index, so i have a hard time imagining a pure browser&lt;-&gt;browser p2p net.
but why not simply embed a indexing service inside the electrum servers/bitcoin-core/blockchain-info. that way every browser could chose from a vast array of servers, and each could act as a SPV wallet. as a transport protocol i would say websockets/https is most suitable.

i have the device in front of me.  the final product looks much different than what is in the video. no meshnet, no marketing BS, no tracking. 
but offline TX work, and the form factor will be ID-1. you can also connect it via USB to have it act like a Trezor. it will be possible to connect it to other wallets to hold/sign your private keys. for more annoucements talk to us at bitcoin2014, we have a talk there.

indiegogo = basically pre-sales with the option to do a chargeback if you decide otherwise, that needs to reach a certain threshold.
bitcoin = sale of final product that is ready for shipping.
this is a basic "misunderstanding" that mining companies have - do not do a presale for bitcoin. we will offer direct for-bitcoin sale of "batch 2" once we reach the initial goal.

you can only activate a pin if you have a verified backup. the backup is kinda important ;)

the old version did contain a key import tool from schildbach-&gt;mycelium. since he did update his software to HD an uses a custom non-bip44 key derivation it is not trivial to get it working again, so we had to disable the direct key import.
i do suggest that you create a backup and store it somewhere else (offline) in case you need it again. in a future version we are happy to re-enable the key import especially if someone contributes the code for this. (new version, custom bip32 keychain, new account type)

FYI. Mycelium - the advanced Bitcoin Wallet for Android has [experimental support for BitID]( a very similar standard. it will take a few weeks (because we will have fresh HD wallet keys as the user ID per site) until we can release that as part of the normal distribution, but people operating sites can start implementing and experimenting with BitID right now. 
Regarding BitAuth: I have not fully understood the spec yet, but there is nothing preventing us to support both BitAuth. 
one weakness that i see from BitAuth is that it does not specify a URI schema. 
please explain the differences. why do we even need a new address prefix? in this context, a raw 20-byte address would be enough. the distinction between mainnet/testnet/sin is not obvious to me.

even if you replace the system keyboard (which you need to do consciously) with a keylogger you still need to expose the encrypted key to the malware. i don't think this is very easy to do for a malware. it is two-factor for a reason :)
and i don't belive malware that keyloggs would survive on google play for long
we developers have ZERO malware-related reports on mycelium and plenty of reports where users mismanaged their keys. the user is the biggest enemy here ;)

Mycelium allows you to spend your unconfirmed change and 1 block confirmed outputs.

Yes mycelium fixes the broken RNG in 2.3 exposed in securerandom. It uses /Dev/null directly.

@_date: 2014-03-02 21:45:10
without root on your phone that is not possible. for security reasons, i advise against rooting. if you want to verify the integrity of the download 
i would recommend going to mycelium.com, download the apk from there and do 
    sha1sum mbw-v1.1.10.apk
after that, adb install mbw-v1.1.10.apk. the correct sha1sum should correspond with the hash from the homepage, 19ffbbeab321c5a96768d656fb0b94fe30b7ace4  this is also the exact hash that is displayed in the play console for us developers. besides rooting, i am not aware of an easy method to obtain the "play store" sha1sum, which should be identical to the downloaded sha1sum.
anyways, checking out from github and compiling it yourself is always superior security-wise.

@_date: 2014-08-12 12:20:27
Mycelium dev here. typically, those qr code images would also contain a bitcoin: URI that the wallet can easily decode. 
you are thinking about "sharing" the image / screenshot to mycelium and the app could decode the qr code directly? this sounds doable but really a lot of effort. we have no immediate plans to support that specific use case. 
please explain further how you would like to see this working.

and if you already have a LT account attached to a different address, you can detach it by enabling expert mode and selecting the key.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:32:00
it is sent right back to the wallet where it came from. so it does exactly what you want.
if you DO select "max" - it empties the cold storage and tries to spend the maximum amount. (calculating miner fees correctly)
edit: fixed typo.
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:48:41
we tried it out in our internal build of mycelium, with BitId and the SSL cert fails. if the hostname does not match it is hard to say if there is a MITM ongoing or not.

@_date: 2014-03-25 11:48:32
the way you described it is not how Mycelium works. 
* if you delete a key it is gone, both form main memory and flash
* mycelium will not upload your keys anywhere, not even encrypted. it will keep them in local storage unless you back it up.
* the backup is two factor, so the printed PDF is useless without the on-screen password
* the activity with the password is protected against screenshots, as well as the single-key qr codes.
* without obtaining root access it is impossible for applications to access other applications private storage
* there is no known malware on android that targets bitcoin wallets on devices that have already been rooted
* a hypothetical malware would need to find a root exploit to escalate the privileges
* even if there existed such a malware, it would not exist in the google play store for long.
* even if there existed such a malware, outside of the google play store you would need to download the apk manually and install it.
if you don't believe my word, get the source, look at the code, compile the apk yourself.

@_date: 2014-09-05 20:21:36
there are many ways that we need to scan the blockchain to discover all funds:
* scan the regular receiving chain
* scan the change outputs
* after scanning both chains and there was some activity proceed to the next account.
currenctly, we only do items  and  - scanning through accounts is doable but not implemented yet - but as you point out it is very unintuitive if this is not discovered automatically
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:20:01

@_date: 2014-03-18 10:27:08
yes the backup is safe once you  verified it. the verification is important so you can check if you wrote down the 2nd factor (generated password from screen) correctly.

our lawyer is working on more detailed TOS. here is what i posted to him that he will put into legalese:
* We will never store: passwords or private keys of users.
* We currently don't upload or store: real names. current location. 
* We chose to ignore/discard: ip addresses. 
* We DO store: the user public key. This also serves as a user id and to establish end2end encrypted channels . The location the user manually specified. the text and prices and parameters of bitcoin sale ads. We store numeric statistics about completed/aborted trades and are able to connect them to users accounts.
* We cannot  and don't store plain text messages but we store the encrypted messages and who the sender/receiver is. (Eventually we can have a policy to discard even those after delivery, but it is currently hard to say when the delivery is finished).

mycelium wallet dev here. i am not directly writing this firmware, but i am aware of the current status. 
because so many are asking for it, we are building and extension so you will be able to verify the correctness. before we are officially announcing this we are collecting feedback and making a POC implementation.
basically, you will be able to configure the stick with your own randomness from dice results or just mashing the keyboard. the Mycelium Entropy then calculates h(dice + raw entropy) and prints out the raw entropy on a 2nd sheet of paper. so you can verify the hardware cannot cheat you, and after the initial configuration you can enjoy high-entropy non-repeating paper wallets.
of course, everything in the firmware + wiring that we produce will be open source. only the cheap off-the-shelf mass-produced components are not open, as is your Intel/AMD cpu.
this discussion about safety is necessary but it should not distract from the fact that using this device is a STRICT IMPROVEMENT over any other way to generate a paper wallet. so no matter how critical you are of the process, you should still get it. and check that 2nd page proof.
if you have any further suggestions regarding this process write us to info  - or post here in reply.
edit: while using webcams and radiation is a neat idea for RNG, it does nothing to solve the "provable" aspect to this. the way i know to estimate the usefulness of an RNG is painful analysis of huge quantities of brown entropy noise, coupled with solid open source hashing accumulators.

yes, this was a problem in all android versions. we were able to fix it inside the application, user who generated keys before Aug.11. were migrated with a wizard to new private keys. we have not heard of a single Mycelium user losing Bitcoins related to this issue.
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:37:26
Skip step A. Mycelium supports bip38 natively. There is no practical advantage to this.
When using your Android you save yourself from any potential trouble if you 
1) do NOT root your device (there are practical ways to exploit this)
2) do NOT enable USB debug and avoid plugging it into anything else than a dumb charger. (this is only a theoretical problem, don't worry about this too much)
In general, it is safer if you empty a once-used paper wallet quickly after the first use. if you have change leftover after this TX, prepare a fresh empty paper wallet where you send the reminder with a second cold storage procedure, using the "MAX" button. (this is only a theoretical, future problem but some people will insist it is needed)
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:00:14

no, some countries have ruled that if you exchange fiat &lt;-&gt; bitcoin they do require you to pay VAT on that. it seems completely irrational to do so, but according to the letter of the law it is at least ambigous. if this sticks, those countries would be completely excluded from a BTC economy (unless you never exchange back to fiat, and stay 100% in bitcoin). i do expect a correction of the interpretation or a new law in those countries.

this bugfix is rolled out now. if your phone is updated from 1.3.3 (or earlier) to 2.0.2 it will preserve the selected record. if not, nothing is lost, just go to the "accounts" tab and select the item that contains funds. but i do encourage everyone to backup their new HD seed and move funds there, it is better for a number of reasons.

Mycelium transactions usually confirm within one block. I have never seen a transaction skipped by a normal miner.
 
For smaller amounts i am comfortable with the built-in transaction radar that checks propagation, double spends unconfirmed parents, malleability, and much more. i is not worth wasting 10 minutes waiting. for anything &gt; 200€ i'd wait for one confirmation.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:42:17
this would not be my immediate conclusion. coinbase has to resort to very shady practices to filter out bots/scammers from their bitcoin selling systems. so they can identify "high risk" users. they have to do this to prevent chargeback problems.
on one of the conferences they explained that they detect if a user uses copy-paste to enter name/credit card he is automatically assigned a higher risk factor. having a specific known font/plugin fingerprint which is similar to preexisting high-risk users will also lead to a worse classification.

first, we invite everyone to audit the code and compile it yourself from 
second, it is very unfortunate that android 2.2 requires the user to have a google account in order to use cloud push. since we do support even this old version we have to request this feature. 
it is possible to provide different version of the program for different target SDK numbers. we will try to produce different versions where only the old API 8 devices have the account permission.
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:51:56
of course, this is the case. we use standard bitcoin message signing to authenticate. anon2763's suggestion is in principle correct, that using the same keypairs for different purposes should be avoided, because if one part of the application would contain a bug - the other part of the application would be affected as well. defense in depth.
@_date: 2014-04-19 07:36:43
it uses mostly a single key. so it is deterministic in a sense, just in a slightly retarded way ;)  not like bitcoin-qt which is straight-out retarded.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:58:44
the server software is maintained outside github. but since you can not verify anyways what server software we have deployed on our servers, you should only rely on the sources of the local client. and hopefully even more people audit it and they will assert that the server is really irrelevant for security. it is only there to speed up the syncing compared to a pure P2P client.

uninstalling is not needed. 
if you uninstall the wallet all internal data is wiped, including the private key. make sure you have a backup first. also, after creating the HD seed, you can use the main menu to do a backup.

@_date: 2014-12-19 13:38:31
a seed contains unlimited amount of accounts. the 12-word backup allows you to restore all accounts.
if the seed if compromised you need to move the funds to a new seed, with a different 12-word backup. the easiest way to do this is with a second phone - since there is no cold storage spending from seed yet. (this is a future feature)
* on the primate phone that will receive the bitcoins install a fresh version of mycelium - this will ask you to create a new seed. 
* Backup this new seed by writing it down.
* then use a secondary phone where you enter the 12 words at the first run and restore all HD accounts (by creating additional accounts until the app tells you it cannot create more) 
* send all funds over to the primary phone.

mycelum was never ported to iphone. Android is the primary platform.
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:12:22


yes, we did make a change here: you now can NOT set a pin wihout a backup. and new pins created this way are not recoverable, unless you set the option when you create it.
Does this address your concern?
and i have to contradict rassah, the internal DB is currently not really encrypted. this would not make sense to encrypt it with a 6 digit pin, since any serious attacker could brute force it offline. we do have other features in the pipeline though, which will really improve security (password based encryption, multisig)

2^31 - 1 normal addresses and 2^31 -1 change addresses per account. you can have a large number of accounts, this is defined in the BIP44 spec. - limited by your phones memory and your ability to create tx.
ad b) this is a reasonable request - but not the top priority for us. if somebody wants to contribute code or resources for that we would happily pickit up.
ad c) currently we don't use password or pin for encrypting locally, but it is something we will be working on. combining that somehow with bip38 cold keys is a neat idea.

Correct. Bitcoin only needs 256 bits of true entropy. Both ME and a webcam are technically overkill. The challenge lies in getting it secure to the printer.
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:33:12
downvote and warning. this is not a method to secure your funds if your original phone is stolen or your backup is compromised.
the correct process of recovery is a bit more complicated and involves two phones or a fresh temporary paper wallet.
also, clipboard addresses are only a fallback since it is globally read/writable on android, between processes. if you want to move funds between accounts, they are already automatically in your address book as a seperate tab.

if you have a bitcoin-qt wallet on the same computer as another user (possibly in another VM) and you create &gt; 200 signatures with the same private key, a very specialized program could analyze the status of the computer and from that calculate  the real private key.

if you faill at typing the key manually (say if you are unable to spot your typo), you can obtain the raw private key in WIF also after importing it to mycelium, selecting the key and chose the menu item "export" - that shows the key as a qr code in WIF and you can also put it into clipboard. but be aware that any app on your android has full read/write access to the clipboard only do this on a clean device. it is much safer to take a photograph of the qr with a plain old camera.

with an address the key is protected by two hurdles, both impossible to solve. 
 *) the inability to get a private key from a public key.
*) the inability to get the public key from the hash of the address
by spending from an address the public key is revealed. this means if somehow elliptic curve math with secp256k1 is broken - your money would still be safe. since bitcoin would be completely broken anyways, i don't think this is a big concern.

no, you cannot recover via USB unless the phone is rooted. most methods of rooting require a complete data wipe, so it is counterproductive. 
if there are enough bitcoins stored to make it worthwile, i suggest putting in a new screen, many shops can repair a broken screen.
if that also fails, it is possible to forensically recover data directly from flash, but that is extremely expensive.

im pretty sure its unaffected in most cases since it is also implements HD wallets and for a couple of other reasons. typically each key is only used for signing once. (it is technically possible to receive funds on the same address multiple times but unlikely in standard use)
a use case where it might be affected is if you use it for BitID, since there keys are reused.
since the android SDK is using some openssl for the BigInteger.multiply operations.
i am pretty sure moving to libsecp256k1 would be a very good idea anyways.
in practice this will not be super relevant since:

i don't think bitcoin should be viewed as a tool to promote a certain ideology. 
It is a tool to make a lot of use cases more efficient, and it gives more power to the people. it removes artificial drag on the society.

if a democracy decides to tax certain transactions, so be it. if anything bitcoin will help them identify them.

i does not surpise me at all. in scientific studies weed is totally harmless from an addiciton pov. even coffee is worse. it is obviously only stigmatized through its prohibition, and its a matter of class/social discrimination.
i fear my wording in the original response has unnecessarily provoked. my point was not to judge buyers just to distinguish between the three parties seller, site operators, and buyers. the word "addict" just came to my mind first, "drug user" or "buyer" would have been a more neutral identifier.
my other point is that many people are dependant on their habits and especially if they have negative aspects (like social isolation) they are most likely unable to change them. if it was so easy to chage a bad habit - why has he not stopped yet?

* People robbed, because they want their money back. (which includes me, but i won't move a finger for 10 BTC lost)
* Mtgox, aurumexchange, liberty reserve should immediately report to the police and not post more data. if they accuse someone innocent and leak his personal data to the net they become liable. even more because someone tried to instrument them for money laundering.

Very interesting read. I was honestly expecting higher numbers for their volume. It looks like Silkroad has a very safe business model for themselves, and the sellers.

i have to agree the valuation seems a bit high. i would think it takes a lot of commitment to keep the site running as it is now. will you have the commitment to constantly improve the quality, service responsivness, and maybe also features of the site? or will you do a "zuck" and go on party after the IPO?

 in bitcoin?
essentially, the current lending model is quite broken.
its always: rich entity (bank) with lots of money loans one chunk of money to poor guy who needs it.
when a person wants to deposit money he must do so at the rich entity which gives him a petty return.
IMO, it should be like
if i want to invest money i give it to 20-100 individuals who each pay me a modest intrest. 5% of them will eventually be unable to repay fully, and have to declare bankruptcy.
from a lenders perspective, i borrow from lots of people. this should mean the incentive to repay since i would disappoint lots of people - this would damage my future reputation.
so in essence this models more "village community" then what we have now. of course we need a mediator who can 
 * ensure the identity of the borrower
 * keep track of payments and repayments
 * has a legal representation so he can try to collect missing money in case of default
 * due to technology this should be done with minimal overhead
 * should be a not-for-profit organisation which has very clear financing (this should be trivial to set up due to the way bitcoin works)

i think the best way for you right now is to run a local wallet on your computer, (multibit or bitcoin-qt) define a price conversion (like mtgox 24h average) see -  and tell each person who wants to order a price and give him a unique deposit address. you can generate those from the client easily. once you see the payment arriving at this address you ship the coins.
if you want to get rid of the gathered bitcoins and get USD instead you can do so at the various exchanges. the biggest is mtgox.

i don't know exactly how app2sd works, but i suspect when storing the app on the SD card its private data is stored there as well.
in order to provide a reasonable level of security the private keys must not be stored on the SD card, otherwise every other app with the SD card access right would be able to read the key.
right now, the schildbach app stores its keys in the private encrypted app storage internal to the phone.

its interesting that Eric Schmidt came up with Bitcoin in this conversation.
Somehow I think Google, Amazon are sympathetic to it and are just waiting for Bitcoin become a little more mainstream before they endorse it.
The guy asking the question wanted to pitch faircash, a collection of ideas sketched out in his? 230 Page Dissertation. 
I have scratched the surface of it. So far i can see that is a hardware-based crypto system with central PKI, but there is no prototype of it yet. 
Furthermore i suspect double-spending is not solved, even theoretically, because transactions can occur in isolated (non-internet-connected) environments.

this is no protection against double-spend. i think it is just protection against replay attacks, when a payee requests two identical payments.
a double-spend occurs for example if i pay one merchant offline, then physically restore my crypto chip to its previous state then pay a second merchant. they do not talk to each other and thus do not know the same money has been spent twice. only when they try to redeem the money to their bank account it is possible for the issuer to detect the double-spend.

there are lots of possibilities what could happen. first, in a situation like this a "regular" user will not download the whole blockchain but rely on a service provider somewhere using split key crypto to perform day-to-day transactions.
second, even those service providers will start to use clustering somehow.
also, some people propose that even for that to happen, the bitcoin network will not scale infinitely but it will rather only include "expensive" transactions. "micro" transactions will have to be performed out of band between service providers.

9) **untick** i would like to get Spam

what i am unsure of is if every client will display it as such..
if you have the hashing power to generate one block you might be able to pull it of, but this only works in automated systems, you will need to try the double-spend every second until you find the block.

at the moment, this is true. a high-end android phone can barely run the client on the device. this will become even harder when the transaction volume rises.
there tons of e-wallet services that would be usable, given they establish trust. (see mybitcoin fiasco)
also, the protocol can theoretically shrink down that only a fraction of the data must be held on the device (partial merkle-trees) this has however not been implemented.
there are however projects like "Webcoin" that *don't require any trust*, you still have all private keys on the device. you just use a public service (somewhat like blockexplorer) to calculate your balance
when sending transactions you generate the signed transactions on the device and submit it to the webcoin service to inject it into the p2p network.

if you physically manipulate it (freeze, heat, magnets, radiation), the amount of randomness might drop. the firmware will detect this state and refuse to generate a key. 
The device will blink three times  and you'll have to try again. 
the same happens if you eject it and directly insert it. (normally you'll have to wait about 7 seconds)

oh, i have another idea: let's mix little endian with big endian notation in the same protocol 
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:12:33
basically yes, but bip38 is currently not supported in the firmware. bip38 has scrypt parameters defined that would take the device way too long to generate a key. (i remember talking to our hardware guy - it might be 10 minutes for a single key!)
so bip38 could be implemented - but in a v2 which would be more expensive with better hardware.

@_date: 2015-02-11 10:32:50
if you use the "camera" button in mycelium to start a cold storage spending the app does the right thing. it sends back any change to the originating paper wallet.
in the past, many people have lost their bitcoin because their cold spending sent the coins to a fresh "change" address which they did not back up- this won't happen with mycelium.
the concern many users give "do not reuse addresses" is only academic. if you want to have the same security level as true cold storage - generate a fresh paper wallet and send the rest there as a second step. if you don't - you have the same security as a regular hot wallet on your phone. for many applications this is sufficient.

As one of the authors of Mycelium, i can guarantee you that Andreas Schildbach is more than capable of writing good Wallet software.
We should all work together and try to improve security and find the "root" cause of this problem. - please excuse this weak pun :/ If a problem/malware can affect Andreas Schildbach's wallet there is no technical reason why it could not affect Mycelium as well. 
The only difference i can think of - if the problem was eventually a weak AES password chosen by the user in the backup, that would really be solved with the 2-factor backup where there is a guaranteed entropy in Mycelium.

well you could pre-generate points for the next 50 years, calculate H=sha256(x+y+radius+salt) - with at least 128 bits salt publish all H beforehand in a textfile and publish x,y,radius and salt each day.
that should be good enough such that you could only "run away" with only one day of winnings, because if you attempted to cheat and chose different x,y anybody could (and someone eventually will) detect that very soon.
**EDIT**: of course that does not protect against placing winning bets for yourself. to make it more safe you should do something else which i will outline below

@_date: 2013-11-08 08:10:37
it depends. i am not an expert in password managers, but there are three aspects here:
first, they are two-factor. to obtain the cleartext an attacker must obtain the encrypted text first, for example with malware. 
second, a password manager can salt the password, so an attacker must target all computation resources at one specific file. classic brainwallets can be attacked all at once.
third, a key might be stretched using reasonable Scrypt parameters. that way an attacker might only check 10 keys a second and not millions.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:48:37
With Mycelium you can manage your private keys very efficiently. You could easily import a key from mycelium to multibit for example.
@_date: 2013-10-02 10:36:26
you are absolutely right. wallets can evolve into digital id providers.
the next step of evolution should be encrypted content that is encrypted with the users pubkey, to make sure only the recipient can read it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:20:49
places where private keys/passwords are generally safe on Android:
* internal app storage
* the display if the screenshot protection flags are set
* in-memory
places where unencrypted keys on android are not safe:
* on the SD card
* in a third-party backup application 
* "in the cloud"
* in the clipboard
* in a screenshot
* non-wallet barcode scanners, (or barcode scanners created via intent)
grey area: rooted phones. if rooted correctly malware cannot access private keys without asking. however, if rooted and connected via USB debug, keys can be read, sometimes without asking.
best practices:
* backup and verify your backup.
* do not root your phone
* install apps via play store or self-compiled apks from source.
to make a secure backup, use [Mycelium Wallet](  and create a 2-factor backup. the PDF that is created can be shared since the private keys are encrypted, if you write down the generated password by hand. for large amounts, keep them on paper only and spend them via the cold storage spending wizard.

co-author of the app here:
the security model is that your private keys stay on your device or on your paper backup. we do not store them on our servers and are not responsible for them.
it has encrypted backups, with two factors.
you are encouraged and the Mycelium Wallet supports backup verification. so you know if you will be able to restore your keys if your phone is gone.
it does not drain your battery, syncing in fractions of a second on demand.
import private keys, from paperwallets and use them instantly. 
when using the cold storage spending wizard the key is only kept in memory.
support for multiple exchanges (currently only bitstamp/mtgox) and many currencies.
casual pin protection for your funds, which protects against simple theft. (pin is not strong enough to withstand true brute-force + forensics anyways)

i'm not so sure. Satoshi seemed very humble. He made sure he was not mining alone - almost from the start. There were of course developers like ArtForz who built much more efficient miners - first GPU miners - who apparently DID accumulate massive amounts of bitcoins. I have seen estimates of 200000. Almost all of these coins have never been moved.
This is not based on empiric evidence just on anectdotes i read in the forums. It seems plausible though.
IMO, they have earned it. Bitcoin would never be where it is today without these people donating lots of their time into a very uncertain project.

Very nice article. But a small correction from one of the Mycelium Authors (me):


we specifically do not force the user to do "cloud" backups of your encrypted wallet, and also do not provide storage ourselves, because even if it is encrypted it does contain address information in cleartext, and thus has privacy implications.
What we do is share the generated PDF with installed apps, which might be email, gmail, dropbox or even save to local SD card.
The user then has the opportunity to write down the generated password and put it on a separate sheet of paper or on the printout.

One of the devs of the Mycelium Wallet here. You are free to print/store out the paper backup offline if you configure your phone to that. (for example storing them on sd card if you install a "share to sd card" app).
**OR you enable expert mode, select one key, select "export" and show the unencrypted qr code of the private key. Then you snap a photo with a good old-fashioned offline camera.** This process is a bit more complicated than the default but it is here, to empower experts to do it.
By no means we want to upload the encrypted pdfs to anyone. in fact, we don't even offer to host those files ourselves. we believe the user should take the responsibility himself.

mycelium works really nice together with paper wallets. export your privkeys from mycelium to paper, verify that the backup restore works. then delete the privkey from the phone and just keep the address. if you need to spend from this key, you can do the cold storage spending wizard or import the key again.

to make it harder for you to cheat, you should lock betting for a set amount of time and then in a defined window salt the coordinates additionally with public non-predictable data. 
examples: exact value of the DOW close from a day, or better hash value of the first block mined after midnight. 
so for a given day it might be X = Xo+mod960(blockhash), Y=Yo+mod500(blockhash)
edit: another solution could be the [NIST random beacon]( but that appears to be not public yet
note that the blockhash might be a good but not perfect solution since there is a slim chance the winner of that particular block could increase his reward by betting on your site and place a bet before publishing the block. that person could even be you. you might need to be precise about the lock times and such, and publicly announce the bets beforehand.

the spread they offer is suprisingly small, and comparable to the mtgox fees. interesting.
they also offer shortselling 1:4, at least in their demo account. stop-loss, trailing stop. 
just watch it - this is the new bitcoinica. if they keep their conditions as they are now they will get a metric ton of bitcoin users.

A very good way is to just snap a camera photo of the private key qr code from the key export in Mycelium. Then print it out and remove it from your camera.
Before deleting it from your phone, check if you can import it - after scanning Mycelium should tell you 'private key was already present'.

correct - Bitcoin and Euro are now (and retroactively) considered equivalent in terms of sales tax (which will continue to be denominated in Euro). 
This does of course not mean what the title and first paragraph implies, that sales done in bitcoin are tax-free.  
First paragraph says:


precise translation would mean: People using the digital money as a payment method do not need to pay value added tax
this is sort of misleading. i am sure most media who do copy-paste jounalism will continue to misreport that.

my point of the Nietzsche quote is very specific and has been elaborated by many philosophers of the past and of our time.
a person with good intentions might start of acting good in spite of aggression against him. after a while, you take on the bad habits of your enemy if you watch him too closely, and gradually, you become like the enemy you were once trying to fight, and you are no better than him.
a person with a "pure heart" would have seen the provocation posed to him by the extortion, and he would NOT have tried to hire a hitman. instead he could have warned the vendors and customers about the security breach, and deal with the consequences. but to have that kind of courage, that is very rare. but i am not too quick to judge him. maybe he did act A-OK and the situation described in the documents is just fabricated by the investigators. time will tell.

While i agree this is pathetic, i will explain to you in detail what happened.
First, i imported the private key shown in the video, just by scanning the barcode with the Mycelium Wallet. I did not intentionally load bitcoins up there.
When i was sending Bitcoins somewhere else to test it, this paper wallet address was still selected as the primary address, which is the default change address. The only way to be affected by this behavior is to use the beta version 0.6.0 of the Wallet software, which is not released regularly in the play store. 
One of my mottos is: eat your own dogfood. Playing around with the edge cases of the software reveals things that are not that obvious. You could say i invested 10 BTC in quality control of the software.
As a consequence of my experience we will rework the way change addresses are selected, and release version 0.6.1 without that behavior. The Wallet will send change to one of the originating addresses (until we implement HD Wallets)
of course, you still have to think about what you are doing and take care of your private keys - but it should be impossible to lose coins like i have demonstrated here.
Thanks to who is an honest person i got my coins back within 1 hour of noticing they were gone. the way he moved the coins also made it very obvious who got them  :)

i fully expect companies like BRK to disversify into bitcoin once it is possible to do so. there is not much point in flooding a 1B market with 49B. it needs to grow organically with non-speculation growth over the years, and if the market cap is high enough it will also fit their investment characteristics.

Proper Wallets (where you control they private key yourself) like [Mycelium]( and [Schildbach Wallet]( already make it really easy for the user to make a backup.

this means if you exchange 1 bitcoin for 100€ when the price is 100€ you have to pay 0 taxes.
this propably ALSO means that if you exchange 1 bitcoin for 100€ and pay 5€ commision fee you have to pay 0 taxes, even on the commision part. (IANAL)
but you still need to pay taxes as usual (in most cases 19%) if you pay 2 BTC for a new phone. this tax is still calculated in euro, and the invoice must contain that amount. in this case 38€.

To spend Bitcoins from paper, clearly, Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet - which runs on Android - is the easiest and most clean solution.
You can get it from [Google Play]( rom the homepage mycelium.com or [build it form source yourself]( .
it includes a "Cold storage spending wizard" that does the job in seconds. no blockchain to sync, plus the keys stay local unlike web wallets.
if you are unsure how to do it, this video explains it nicely:

if you simply don't like the play store, go to mycelium.com and download the apk directly.

my tip to you: if you start investing now, be prepared for lower and higher prices. bitcoin won't go to 1000 in the next week. but it could possibly  go to ~15-18 and still be growing in the long term - just look at a 1 year chart.
so my tip to you: buy only 1/12 of your "decent amount" now. buy exactly  1/12 of the dollar amount each month. that way you won't lose sleep and possibly get many more bitcoins than today.

you are correct, this looks like a nonstandard transaction, so it is normally not relayed in the network.
this means it got relayed directly to a miner, who ignored the "nonstandard" rule to collect the fees.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:36:31
if you are using bitcoin in a non-standard way it could happen that your transaction remain in limbo for a long time if you trigger anti-spam anti-dos  protections in the code. that happens quite regulary. very rarely normal users are affected by this, this might be painful to recover from, but never has that lead to a situation where a user lost his coins.
it is much more likely you simply lose your private keys or they get stolen.

@_date: 2013-12-06 01:49:01
It has 26^15 possiblilities, that is about 70.5 bits of true entropy.
The keystretching makes it much, much harder to bruteforce it, depending on hardware by a factor of 10^8 - 10^10 (guesstimation), which makes it even harder. The key is also salted, so you must do this for each key and cannot crack all wallets at once.
Of course, even encrypted backups should be handled with care, since they contain privacy-sensitive information about your addresses and balances.
this password is optimized for entering on a mobile. Adding three characters is much better for entropy than a larger keyspace since 26^15 &gt; 52^12. This will you allow to enter the password quicker on a mobile with reasonable security. - switching case and numbers/special chars is really slow to enter and leads to mistakes. what counts is the relationship between keypresses and entropy. having a slightly longer all-caps password wins here.
remember, the user must write that down himself, so it is not a good backup if in a few years he will wonder: was that a 0 or a O ? was this a backtick or a forward quote?

imo, the database should not play a significant role in this. steps would me: socket accepts order, logs it to a write-only sink. (for example sharded DB, syslog, plain old textfile...) then it is handed over to a in-memory matchng engine which executes the trade, simultanously sends notification via websocket and again logs. the acutal reading of the disk is only needed in a case of system restart, recovery. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:08:52
I think this idea makes absolutely sense and would be a success. It is however not trivial to implement, code and promote it to developers and also maintain the catalog of apps.
I also see some problems with integrating in-app payments with it, since this is basically a proprietary API that uses Google servers. Each app that uses in-app payments would need to have two separate code paths, depending on which app store is installed on the device. If is is possible legally, you would need to provide a library,that implements a fallback mechanism for users to pay with regular in-app billing if the app comes from the regular play store, or with bitcoins from their on-device wallet.
