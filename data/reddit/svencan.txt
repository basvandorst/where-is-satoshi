Stand straight, shoulders back, become alpha lobster. And clean your fucking room.

Good comment.
It's enough to learn blockchain because you will learn Python and Blockchain technology (asymmetric encryption) along the way.
Python, Python+Finance, Python+Blockchain are some excellent skills to invest time, in that order.

I have a lightning wallet. Can't do shit with it because I don't have capacity.

No, but you can link it to your exchange via API. I don't know where they source the price.

When I used Bitcoin Ticker Widget it requested permissions to files at every start, and even when I switched from landscape to portrait mode and on other actions. That's shady as fuck.
In Bitsnapp I can set my holdings in the various cryptocurrencies and see my actual values. I use it in €, It's easy to switch, Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Choose default currency.
Also if you judge an app because of the default displaying crypto you're a bigot.

Use Bitsnapp, that app is way better.

Ok, you have to click on the balance on the main screen. I tried to change it in a request or payment screen. It's not obvious.

Why can I not enter amounts of satoshi for payments and requests?
