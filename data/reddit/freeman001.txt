Can you actually make money running a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:55:15
Can't remember offhand, but it's an option I'll be looking at this year.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:49:32
Ok, makes sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:56:43
I'd put all my resources into cuntcoin, seems like a safe bet.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:09:01
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:38:09
Do you need to hold bitcoin on the node or do you just need to have it up and running?
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:51:31
Of course, if you sell and use the proceeds to buy a house, there's tax breaks for that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:36:01
So, if I'm running an LN node, do I have to keep bitcoin in that wallet or do I just passively gain sats by being the intermediary?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:33:22
Yes, please. I've been downloading a full node for over a week just so I could set up LN on my computer. Dem tx fees, tho.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:38:51
What's the deal with all these alts requesting linking twitter accounts? That sounds pretty sketch, like you'd be giving your password away to some rando crypto for an unproven shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:02:35
This is one of those things when I will get to say I remember back on January 16th, 2018 when I held.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:40:19
God, he is such a fucking retard.
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:10:02
Yeah, bitcoin, but also Xoom.
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:15:50
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:35:46
Ah, thank you.
@_date: 2017-02-10 00:20:39
I sure hope that isn't the case. I bought this morning at $974, so now that it's over $1k again, I'm feeling pretty good about it. I got in at $1008 a few days ago with $117, so hopefully I won't get dicked around too badly.
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:34:57
How was it possible to get ahold of it back then?
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:04:53
Right now the line is being held at the 900 mark. How long that will last, who knows.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:27:06
Um, I have no idea. It says my bank account limit to buy is $5000 per week. I can't say if your limitations are different or why. It might be in their FAQ.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:31:22
Or 25 days.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:57:54
Oh man, if I don't hear anything by end of business day friday, I'm in for 2 btc because monday I'm going to be getting a late birthday present.

@_date: 2017-03-05 14:00:27
Doing ok so far.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:30:58
From everything I'm reading, they're going to tank their new alt-coin and it's so buggy that it's going to suffer attacks. So they'll commit financial suicide in the hopes that they can force the rest of the world to crash with them.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:23:06
Yes, possibly, but if what the article says is true, they wouldn't wait till the last minute to make the decision, they'd either have made it by now or before the decision date where it would default to approved.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:12:54
It can take about 4 days to pull from your bank account. At least for me it does.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:39:51
You pay the price it says when you purchase, you lock in that price. If the price goes up after 7 days, that's money you've made. If it goes down, that's money you've lost.

@_date: 2017-03-31 05:04:38
Apparently I'm the only person here who has had zero issues using coinbase, but it's worked fine so far, as long as you are patient.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:27:04
Essentially. If you spend the bitcoin as bitcoin, you are free and clear.
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:35:21
When is the etf ruling going to be announced?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:12:46
Right here.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:55:49
They hedl. Now only sky.
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:15:15
What does it mean if coinbase can't to business in WA? Does someone have to use an out of state Bank to do transfers at that point?
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:17:53
Why go with the ETF over the commodity itself? I'm waiting for the announcement to buy or wait. If the etf falls through, the anticipatory growth bitcoin has seen up till now will drop to below a normalized value. Then it will be cheap to buy up as much as possible before it inevitably goes back up. If approved, I'm pumping in as soon as I see the news and watching that rocket fly.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:35:30
Then there may be limitations on your card.
@_date: 2017-03-06 04:17:32
I'd rather blow a load half way there than bust a nut before it drops through the floor. Bitcoin is always going to go up, but it see-saws on its way there. I'd rather not have to wait a few months for the recovery.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:11:55
There's never any taxes on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:35:01
That's the plan, man.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:50:35
Well, I don't know if my account is 'verified' to begin with. I don't have a USD connected account, I've only transferred and traded crypto, so I haven't taken the extra steps. Still, this is enough for me to peace-out from BFX. The % on IOTA is tiny and not worth the risk any more.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:04:03
Yup. Fucked up state laws.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:25:05
I'm not an expert. I do not know.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:51:00
Oh, as soon as my loans come back, I'm pulling the plug.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:40:13
[Looks like shapeshift might be supporting IOTA soon]( Might be able to exit from most exchanges, except for the odd lending on Polo, and keep everything on Jaxx if that's the case. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:36:09
Does this mean NO us customer can trade cryptos on bitfinex or that you just can't transfer USD to/from a bank?
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:29:40
Fortunately, I don't have any of those.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:13:42
Poloniex 'doesn't allow' residents from washington, new york, or new hampshire.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:05:42
That would be great as well.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:38:58
I feel pretty comfy with the ones I have in Coinbase, being that they're insured. But I'm consolidating other coins from other currencies.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:43:41
AND the only currency I have leant out is IOTA. AND IOTA is only being sold on Bitfinex exchanges right now. FUCK.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:13:56
Your idea got me thinking. I downloaded and installed the TOR browser and logged into poloniex and it does show me accessing the website from a different IP address, which is great. I don't know whether it's a US based IP address or not, but I think this is what I'm going to be using, going forward, for polo at least.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:46:58
Probably, if you create a new personal/individual account and have the VPN based outside the US. If you're that hard up to use them, it should be fine, but you could be playing with fire.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:40:43
SHIIIIIT. At least the crypto's I have loaned out will be closing before then. God dammit. Motherfucking god dammit.
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:26:33
If you're already using a vpn, tor isn't really going to add too much.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:44:36
Yes, but how comfortable are you and have magnets become a problem?

What kind of income are you seeing on this node?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:03:05
Saw a youtube link. Binance didn't get hacked. A trading bot people were using got hacked. Bots liquidated alts into one coin and dumped the market. FUCK, glad I don't use bots. Binance is fine.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:58:27
WTF happened at binance??
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:47:15
Well, my little pie will probably be used more for old NES games in the meantime, then.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:06:24
Mine is fine. Everything is there. I don't use trading bots.

@_date: 2018-02-05 22:38:58
You and me are in the same boat. Shoulda dropped in that first week of Jan and kept most of it. Well, I'm still ahead, so that's a good thing.
@_date: 2016-10-30 04:13:49
Well, mine doesn't have any money unless I have it attached to my bank account. I'm sure you can use it your own special way.
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:32:13
Yeah, I get that. Doing it with your bank account is just as easy. You have to have a bank account for PayPal to work, regardless, so it's just as valid an option. If they want to go with paypal, fine. If they have a checkbook, that works to.
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:19:56
Well, that's why I said they need a bank account.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:44:45
Feed me Seymore. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 00:02:25
Coinbase. You can get the app, link it to your bank account and go nuts. Bitcoin shot up $100, from $622-$722 within the last month, so you might want to wait for a dip.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:50:09
All I do is buy, brother. HODL until relieved. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:12:41

ID? No. Checking account and routing number is all I needed.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:19:59
They have some...weird guide now, but if they can create a simpler process after, that would be great. Thanks for the news.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:56:00
I'm wondering, if you have accounts with exchanges, if you can simply send your bitcoin to your exchange wallet (say for lending) and then import your old empty wallet private keys into the BCC wallet, push that BCC to the exchange, trade for btc and get back to lending.  Cuts down on extra transfer fees.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:27:56
Awesome. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:46:09
They stay there and you don't get to split them afterwards to get free coins.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:38:41
Wait till it bottoms out for a bit and buy. Never sell a drop.
