So then how should governments account for bitcoin valuation?

So you're saying digital currencies shouldn't be taxed at all? There's some sort of economic benefit attached to bitcoins though

There is inherent economic benefit whether bitcoins are used for purchasing stuff or just held like an investment. That economic benefit is what has to be taxed, like anything else (income, sales tax, gift taxes, etc.)

My point is that, any other form of income is taxed. You get a gift.. it's taxed. You work.. it's taxed.

Any other form of income is taxed. Let's be honest, bitcoins are income: you are using them (or their attached value, however you want to phrase it) to buy things. You can't just not tax things; that isn't how the world works. Either the things you buy are going to have some form of tax added or the change in value of your bitcoins will be taxed. This is the question I'm asking.

Society functions through taxation. Whether taxes are good or bad, high or low, in general isn't my question. You simply cannot deny the fact that, in general, we need taxes to function. A few examples: military, emergency personnel, schools.

Saying this is indoctrination, we won't stand for this, this is a bunch of bullshit, etc. isn't helping answer my question or the greater problem

Thanks for the answer /s
Seriously though, I'm just wondering what you or any other bitcoin users would have a government do. Say what you want about taking property, but taxation has to happen someway or another
@_date: 2014-11-03 04:58:59
The bitcoin money that's used to buy things. Or, if it's just held to appreciate like a stock, that value

This is the most circular thing. You're a dumb piece of shit that's probably gonna go to jail for tax evasion

Thank you for your well thought-out answer. Jesus christ, no wonder this shit hasn't been implemented moreso
