Increase a bit more, drop to 5500ish , bounce up to 6350, settle there a few days with some small percentage changes up and down,  then increase past 7k again with no trouble.  
You want random predictions,  that's mine.  I expect the peak in the next weeks to be around 7600 or 7700. 7777 would be a 'lucky number' and a lot of people may want to cash out.

Over the past few months,  eth has performed fairly poorly,  while btc has skyrocketed. When btc was 2400 ish back in July,  eth was about 220 usd. 
Eth is now 333 usd,  and btc is +7000.
This is a very very simplified example,  and I suggest you keep track on your own for a bit before pouring money into something, even btc. I have several alt coins just for fun,  it's neat to have a lot of a coin. I have some eth and ltc, and I'm hopeful they will improve in value. 
I also have grc, arc, burst, and doge. I expect these to never perform at all,  but when you can easily get thousands of them,  it's hard not to diversify a bit.  Grc I specifically like because it's proof of research instead of just proof of work. 
What's interesting to me is that generally, before September, when btc price moved,  the greatest other crypto moved with it to some degree. Since September we've seen a lot of breakaway in the price of btc, where is price increases,  and alts have no movement.  Now,  like others have said,  there is some movement downwards of alts while btc is still increasing. People selling alts to get more btc it seems.
