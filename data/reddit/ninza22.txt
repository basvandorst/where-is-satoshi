@_date: 2015-06-17 21:34:37
These guys were earllyyyyy adopters, like pre 1146 days, its not a surprise they dropped off for now especially when theyre running tight as businesses anyway, but im sure theyll be back, sooner then you may know

Im saying that bitcoin would just be a vehicle for the transfer, so its bought and sold at market price equivalent to whatever amount is being sent at the time of sending. How the funds would show up to the receiver in fiat Im unsure of, unless they decide to just keep the btc and roll with it:)
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:41:51
Is this still open?
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:28:11
The fee is just to give miners incentive to confirm and verify your transaction. You could pool transactions i think? Might need some clarification on that. He may have just sent a whole bunch of separate transactions from his wallet to all the people in Zanzibar, I donno. The fee is minimal, and will continue to shrink at the network grows

Its important to remember that the US represents roughly 4% of the worlds population. Hindering innovation in one small percentage of the pie won't stop it from progressing in the rest of the world. :)

i'll never get tired of seeing this

I think its about time companies like western union face the music. They've been extracting wealth from people for god knows how long. Fuck them, they deserve to be ridiculed into obsolescence 
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:11:07
I also think that a lot of the businesses that this regulation applies to will become irrelevant in the future, especially crypto to fiat exchanges. The regulation will never keep up with the technology, I just wonder how long people will try
@_date: 2014-09-19 20:57:18
great guy too
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:59:24
i stand corrected
@_date: 2014-05-29 06:06:52
Also there is a delay in price discovery between exchanges, not just these ones
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:03:05
Theres a miners fee to secure the transactions, if it was 80 separate transactions, and he paid the fee every time thats 0.0080 bitcoin thats like $4. if he didn't pay any fee it would be totally free, or if he pooled transactions it would be less, 0.0080 would be the most expensive way to do it
@_date: 2015-05-19 05:54:04
Seems like these guys are banking on a huge increase in the price per bit
@_date: 2014-03-12 07:01:04
This is actually good news

Ya, i always found wikipedia a great place to find additional sources for material I was studying, especially history. The footnotes are actually very helpful, it makes it much easier then using the libraries keyword searches

Yea a big reason i posted this was to warn people away from wasting their time on these sites
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:07:02
I was going to post a screen of my blockchain to show what kind of numbers newbies (like myself) can expect from faucets and ptc sites you can make in a week just to show some perspective. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:31:13
I just want to observe it right now
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:32:25
I feel like this should be the motto for this sub
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:56:22
Its even more depressing to calculate how long it would take you to make a single coin
