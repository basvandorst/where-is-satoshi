The odds are high this is the case, there is a chance it was coordinated to crash the market but it is a minimal chance.  I was just trying to point out that there is a chance the OP is right, I should of stated it was a small chance.

Depends on what exactly you want to know.  The general concept which I fully assume you know as it seems you have done a lot of research.  To figure out how to actually do the hash by hand.. I really think without learning all of the math leading up to it that it is an impossible adventure.

$1000 isn't that much.   *edit*  I don't think you boys get my point.. If you spend $1k on bitcoin right now and it goes to zero who gives a fuck you lost $1k it sucks but w/e.  If it 100x in price you just turned it into $100k.  Anyone not considering investing in bitcoin has no clue about risk vs reward.

I can't see why you couldn't use slush pool, well I guess actually your hash rate might be to low to even register on their pool.  
HOWEVER,  
will 100% work, you might even get widely lucky and win a block.. the odds are almost zero but not zero so it is possible you win a block.   IMO go with ckpool as you might actually get nothing from slushies if your hash is too slow.  Without an ASIC I don't know if it will register your mining.

Now all have changed their tune, not pro bitcoin but interested.  I was at a may 24 party 3 weekends ago, the price had risen insanely, Friend mentions he is dumbfound I haven't brought it up with the other bitcoiner there, so I do.  ANWAYS the point of the story, me and the other bitcoiner stop talking and EVERYONE (15-20) people are talking about bitcoin perhaps 3-4 separate convos.  Even the girls were talking about it.  It was pretty cool the fist time I had seen everyone talking  positivly and curiously about cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2016-06-23 17:36:55
AHHH!  Are you using core? If so this is how core works, it has happened to me many times.  It will send more than I asked and send what I did ask to the address I asked but that "extra send" is actually your wallet just sending some btc to a new public key in it's address book so it is still yours.  With core you might end up with coins in several different public addresses because of this. 
Do you know how to use the debug feature with core?

huh...  why would $535-550 have support... Old resistance turns into support.. $450-500 will be a rock solid support line.. if that breaks it collapses to $220 no questions. 
570-580 is old resistance thus current support.   If 570-580 hold, quite bullish, if we drop back to $450-500.. who knows..

he most certainly did.  he "claims" he is not currently upset he sold all of his BTC.  
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:39:21
You should listen to mom on this one.

My last bitcoin will cost 50 trillion dollars soooo

For you use but you are stealing your parents power. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:32:08
Actually.. we are all technically dumb money.. only financial institutions are "smart" money..
@_date: 2016-05-27 18:02:58
If such a hardfork happened BTC would collapse.  The idea your coins are only good for x amount of time would decimate bitcoin.

This, pay the tax the pigs are brutal.. brutal brutal.. pigs is even an understatement for what these people do to other humans.  Keep under the radar.

If you have free power you are 100% going to ROI, no questions.
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:30:36
That is not what I want lol. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 15:54:55
probably not.. it's pretty true lol. .. ohh :(.
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:39:27
Depends on electric prices.. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:06:52
unhackable lol that is cute.
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:06:29
Ahh pigs and they wonder why they are hated. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:36:42
My S1 is STILL RUNNING... so.. ya.. 100% to prove out how long it can go.. it's been 2 years. This will ROI in two years at zero power. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:37:54
This thing is a beast, good buy.  That S7-N seems like a good start though, perhaps grab 1 to learn the ins and outs.  It comes with a PS so that is nice too. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:29:39
I am a slacker lol :S :(.  I have a raspi I can play with.
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:52:36
I would also like a 100-200 watt miner.  Running 1400 watts in an apt is not feasible.  Although.. this might just be the time to start a small business.. hum.. I dunno with the halving coming though..

I'd vote this guy for Prime Minister. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:56:27
Sir, I like your attitude. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:49:04
You need to create the wallet on an offline computer, encrypt it with a sold passphrase.  Burn the files to a M-DISC, bury it.  Save the files on e-mails not attached to your name. 
Good luck, God speed.
@_date: 2016-05-27 18:27:04
Alas that is probably correct.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:30:16
kijiji. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:48:02
I think we need a new high or to be close to it.
Although I will say the run from $200 to $400 and holding there has brought some of my nay sayer friends to the neutral side.  Even some to the buying side. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:30:46
Paul Vern own this?
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:32:58
This is what we need... we need the more average person buying.. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 17:59:03
Like MT Gox right?  Or banks that the govs can stop people from withdrawing from because the bank doesn't actually have the coins and has been running a fractional reserve and now the entire ecom is completely fucked and the govs will attempt to use brute force to keep the fractional scheme alive!!
YA no thanks.
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:05:22
That triangle does not promise a break out though...  it could.. and WILL go either way.  IMO we are sub $500 or plus $800 in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:31:51
a poker chip I can send across the world for 10 cents.. it's a pretty powerful poker chip.. 
If you want one of my chips, $10k for the 1st one, $100k for the 2nd.

I wish I could pay like 100 bits to read the entire article :S. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:41:38
Boys.. if you think Bitcoin is going to stay at a pathetic 7 billion market cap... It's going to zero or it is the new gold.. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:26:36
Nnice!!!!! so long from now :(
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:34:29
what the....

The Rothschilds and Friends made it quite the bumpy ride in the 1800's so 1913 could come to pass...

Wouldn't finding a dead body be a good thing.. could solve a crime..
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:06:17
It's reddit though.. they ban everyone and anyone
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:08:18
I think we should be pressing the entire point of bitcoin is to have your wealth IN YOUR control..
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:44:54
You are buying actual coins, but that spread is crazy.
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:32:20
The very first transaction with them takes some time.  E-mail them a few more times, it will come through.  You can thank the fine regulators for this.
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:37:50
The man is not a market god but a crypto god.
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:11:32
I am utterly dumbfounded someone would buy some shit ass bond instead of gold.. wtf.. IT IS NEGATIVE YEILD.. what the fuck.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:29:12
What is this show....
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:02:20
Indeed.. The ONLY hope is to show the moronic public how things work.. this will not be easy..
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:35:41
I use them, no issues.
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:49:31
Transaction ID.
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:10:44
At that point.. unless you have people that will swear loyalty to you, you will become dead, a slave or at best join a warlord yourself.
