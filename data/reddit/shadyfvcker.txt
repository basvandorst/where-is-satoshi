My comment is still correct, we've made lower highs for the past 3 months. 8500-7400 and 6800 respectively, theres no bullishness till we break 74-85 
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:37:35
Last i checked thats the nature of markets, if youre in it for the tech host a node or something. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:08:04
You clearly dont have weed stocks then, also lower highs are the crashing pattern.
@_date: 2018-09-07 10:47:54
It wont crash down again untill sunday-wednesday next week, it will most likely range/move sideways

I know there is a sub reddit for this kinda thing however there is a lot of people in this market who are fooled into buying false bullish impluses and dont understand the market framework and psychology, im tryna help em out.
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:02:44
And we've made lower highs every wave since
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:50:07
To your first question, the stoch rsi/rsi are used as a measure of overbought/oversold, the nature of traders is to take profits in the short term so when they short btc ath theyll take profits at the low and vice versa. This gives a clear indicator of where sells and buys will be entered on daily/weekly timeframes. 
Also, check the weekly stochastic rsi its headed towards a downturn and is bearish despite this the daily stochastic rsi is bullish, what does this mean? Most likely we will see a small pump Friday-saturday and a bearish weekly close on sunday, this will make the structure of this wave more clear as we head down to lower prices. 
Also bearish momentum in this case means the direction/volume of the markets. Other useful indicators include long vs short positions, market cap and bitcoin dominance, those will make you aware of alt cycles. 
Im not wanting you or anyone to bet their money on this, i just want to inform/educate as many as i can hopefully, if you want you can check the pattern over the weekend/following weeks and see how it works out and make a decision for yourself.
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:31:39
There was no mention of delay, only mention of an extension, so a decision still may come forth at the end of this month. Even if it doesnt we should still follow the technicals.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:22:25
Yep, sorry i used the wrong word, what i meant was the market would be overbought. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:24:40
Yep, whether or not you believe in TA wont change one fact either, volume precedes price. Theres a low volume low volatility region that creates a strong support and changes the market tide. Its visible on the above graph and we havent seen that with bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:08:17
Ive been in bitcoin for a long time, just because we didnt break 6k in feb doesnt mean bears arent in control. Just look at a weekly chart.
@_date: 2018-09-30 10:54:12
Bears and bulls are weak right now, also its not easier to pump or dump the price, we had 5k-20k and 20k to 5750, arguably it took longer to dump it and is harder, 2 months vs 10
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:47:38
Bears are only really bears in a bear market, they follow the trend they don't make it.  Although they contribute by shorting, theyre in it with the technicals
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:56:22
Proper Margin traders will always use tight stop loss to mitigate loss or they would add to their short position raising the liquidation price virtually making it impossible to lose money shorting a bear market, i think OP did this
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:15:25
Short with lev, keep liquidation above 72, we wont reach out to 74 and if we do its likely a massive bull trap, but it could be bullish. The most likely scenario is that we reject 68 and fall to 62-64 range, i wouldnt short the yearly support but etf rejection could be our final leg down to 5325 before we lose volume and switch to bullish.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:13:07
Without bears the market would collapse due to hyperinflation, money needs to change hands once in awhile
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:58:39
In my opinion btc will continue to fall to 4800 (probably on bitmex) and 5325 on most major exchanges. Check out my post on this. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:00:50
Thats still called a crashing market, breaking down every support down to 6k and failing every resistance.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:11:47
we revert to bartering, society will be driven by the utility of what we own rather than a note. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:50:33
Shame on him for riding the wave? I think notm
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:50:04
Sorry i put it in bad words, they mentioned they can extend it for 180 days or something but they never said they will. So its kinda like a proposed extension it hasnt been verified  (to my knowledge)
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:25:58
Unless youre in the denial stage of course... just a thought.
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:37:13
Btc will either fail 6800 or reach 7k before failing to new lows, long squeeze is coming before 28th sept :)
@_date: 2018-09-07 10:46:44
Yep i could always be wrong, but this is my scenario and it seems to be similar if not identical to most other traders out there 
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:18:17
I check the chart everyday, we've been crashing for 9 months..
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:35:06
It wasnt an anomolous spike to people who payed 20,000$ for a single bitcoin, it was a bubble that burst, we're currently in a crashing pattern and untill we lose volatility and volume for a period of time we arent having any bullish momentum
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:52:02
TA is made for trading, cryptocurrencies are listed on exchanges for trading purposes? Its not a get rich quick ponzi, where do you think volume comes from if not traders? You expect people to just keep paying higher and higher prices for your own personal gain youre a lunatic. Everyone is in this to make some money so respect their means, even if it means shorting this market to death they'll have been more successful than you ever were.
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:38:38
Bears are looking for interesting prices to buy, right now it looks like that extends to 5750, we could break down to 5325 but i doubt much lower. Either way bears are still in control. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 10:42:07
I mean they really fxcked the price up from 20k down to 5.75k tho...
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:35:34
This is not nonsense, look at a weekly chart, buy volume is strong on the bottom of a pump and weakens near the top where the momentum changes, furthermore its what drove the Dec-January bull market. volume has always been a key indicator in markets. When we lost buy volume at 20k the tides turned.
@_date: 2018-09-07 09:54:22
There are many other factors at play wave trends, stoch rsi, rsi etc. Check my post for a more in depth explanation.
 
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:14:10
I think btc will either go sideways from here (64-66) range or face a bearish breakdown - 5325 (weekly support before the bull run) 
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:52:55
Someone may have typed the wrong address and sent a test TX?
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:15:43
Coinbase is the easiest
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:56:36
Capitulation candles are identical. If you sold 3500/4000 you've made a grave mistake. 
Note: we may pump to 54 before once again visiting lows of 3500 as shown in the RSI
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:44:52
Coinbase works fast in the EU taking minutes to buy with a card and 2 days to withdraw, use revolut and buy using euros.
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:28:33
This makes 0 sense
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:02:35
Create a trading account on coinbase, connect your bank, sell your Bitcoin there and withdraw it to your bank, it arrives in about 15 minutes or so. Just curious tho, how do you earn the gift cards?
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:18:45
If you need any help in regards to setting up or cashing out let me know via dm, thanks for the info  :)
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:16:16
Wouldn't short this area, long only with  liquidation below 2900. Shorting this area is the dumbest thing you could do.
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:35:47
These prices are gold. Congrats.
