You can't use it to buy drugs, so it's pointless. A bolt-on alt-coin that no one will even end up using. .01% of retailers accept btc less than .01 of those will accept 'Lightning btc'.
It's a gimmick.

Plebs love/need to be told what they can and cannot do. It will never change.

Groups with agendas are trying to discredit him so his future proposals arnt taken seriously.
Reddit is a great platform to generate fake consensus, as the silent majority don't comment.
It all comes down to preventing the ability of widespread Bitcoin adoption. 
By inventing Bitcoin, Craig has made enemies with the system itself. All this fake backlash is the system fighting back in the only way it knows how, by manipulating the narrative.
