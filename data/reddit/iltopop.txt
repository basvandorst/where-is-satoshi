Bitcoin could technically be anonymous as long as your name isn't tied to coins. The issue with using bitcoin for criminal activities is that in order to cash out you run into fiat money. No matter how sneaky you are, it's going to be suspicious when you pull large amounts of money out of what looks like nowhere to the feds.

Monero / XMR is the current "holy grail" and was being pushed super hard after the Hansa and AB busts earlier this year. It wasn't being pushed as a solution to fees, but a solution to blockchain analysis. Alexander Cazes, the admin of AB, was discovered to be in Thailand partly because a coalition of governments tracked AlphaBay bitcoins all the way back to his bank accounts. The fact that XMR fees are lower right now is just the cherry on top.

The fee just makes your transaction more likely to be put into the next block. The miners pick the the transactions that go in the block, and higher fees give them more incentive to pick your transaction.
Theoretically even the smallest fees will still get a transaction processed eventually, it's just that "eventually" could be sometime after you're dead.

Except that's not how that works at all. 
Customer buys an amount of bitcoin they think they need. They try to send it to the payment address but don't have enough cause of a fee. They complain to customer service about it. It's not valve's fault, and the customer SHOULD have done more research, but they didn't. How the world "should" be has no bearing over how it actually works. Bitcoin payments likely confused customers and caused enough problems in customer service that they made this decision. Telling people who want to give you money via a channel you advertise that they should have paid a different way is how you get pissed off customers who don't give you money anymore.

S/he's not saying anything about coinbase going down, they're saying your risk is if you buy 1btc at 18k, and next Wednesday when you get your coin, it might only be worth 16k, giving you a net loss until it goes back up.

We don't, we expect coinbase to do it. Just like the users I support at work aren't expected to request we upgrade to Server 2016, that's my job to know when, why, and how.

Bitcoin isn't "anonymous" as long as your info is tied to a wallet address that touches coins. All transactions are public, so if your coinbase account sends BTC to a private address, coinbase definitely knows you own that address, and can see the addresses you send those to.
If you want to be anonymous, the best way is to buy from localbitcoins, shapeshift to Monero, "churn" your monero wallet a few times, then send back to a different BTC wallet that doesn't have your info attached to it. You can add a tumble for your BTC in there as well if you want, and technically you should be able to buy from an exchange just fine, I'm just assuming worst case scenario, hiding from someone with near infinite resources. (Like, to pick a completely random example, the government of a large nation)
This is a lot of work and only really worth it if what you're doing HAS to be anonymous. There's also no guarantee that future tech won't de-anonymize monero, and your transactions will be on that blockchain forever. Coin tumblers work fine if you're just worried about some random jackoff looking at what you do with your coins, but if you get the feds or something on you, tumbling makes tracing the coins a pain in the ass, but not impossible.

Because some people have this weird fetish where they get off on the idea of bitcoin failing, I think. The amount of antipathy I see when people come on here to troll borders on obsession. Like I have maybe $70 in crypto and am really just here as an enthusiast, but my alt account got spammed by a troll I had to block telling me I was "retarded" for "putting my life savings" into crypto. Literally all I did was suggest that the first plunge in January was a correction.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:08:05
Reminds me of every time there's a correction people from come to the crypto subs to tell everyone how stupid they are for having money in crypto. Mysteriously silent other than the normal trolls right now....
