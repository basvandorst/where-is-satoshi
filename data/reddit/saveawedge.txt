A Psychotherapist who comes across as arrogant and pompous. I'm guessing every criticism you hear comes across as an attack and warrants a three paragraph response? I think it's great that you're accepting Bitcoins, and I like what you're doing. 
Next time, however, just take the compliment and think about the critique. Good luck!

Thick as thieves (a member on bitcointalk) has set up a 1/100 PT on btct -  - you'll find a lot more information on the btct website and the numerous asicminer threads on bitcointalk

I really dislike the flyer because of the white background - personally I think it looks very unprofessional. It's a great idea though, and I like what you've written.

I love bitcoin and I'm an avid documentary watcher. Having said that, I'm really not keen on the whole premise of this documentary. 
You look like a very happy couple, things seem to be going brilliantly for you. Lots of smiles and happiness and sunshine. Now, I may not speaking for the majority, but I personally wouldn't' want to watch an hour of smiles and cheesy laughs to push bitcoin. It just feels very forced. I don't understand what the aim of the documentary is. 
When I watch a documentary, I like gritty, hard hitting stuff that makes you think. This looks like an escapist documentary bordering on reality television - not my cuppa' tea. I want to see your trials and tribulations, the struggle and contrast between the good/bad times, without pushing bitcoin - and unfortunately this documentary doesn't seem to offer that. Great idea. Preliminary footage looks very professional, and the sound design is fantastic. However, the  execution is less than professional and unfortunately, I still won't watch it.

What are you trying to say?

I love it how you can tell that they are using a green screen in every one of his videos. Both Stacey and Max always have a green glow around them. Absolute joke really.

This is why I think PPCoin is going to be much bigger than Bitcoin in the long run. I love Bitcoin, but this issue is going to be one of its biggest downfalls.

Count me in for one please :) I'll PM you

btct.co is at 1.8722 as we speak - I think you'll be hard pushed to find shares at under 1.6 now. If you do find anywhere let me know!

Stop spreading such craziness in this thread. There's more than 10 comments from you here and all ridiculously bat-shit crazy speculation. If you believe what you are preaching, buy your shares and shut up. I am an ASICminer investor, but your comments inspire NO confidence in ASICminer - you have no facts, just brain-farting all over this thread. A chore to read.

These guys don't have a fucking clue what they are doing. It's sad to see people fall for the most blatant scam of the century.

I really don't know where to start with this one. This is a forum for bitcoin, not 'junkcoin'. I can barely understand what you have written, but, do you really think a coin named junk coin is going to get any real use or investment? I would probably put my money on no. I'm guessing it's another one of those pump and dump junk coins.

I know confirmation is coming... but this has obviously been shopped.

Take this with a pinch of salt. It's the daily mail...
