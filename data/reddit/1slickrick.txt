Register/verify with Kraken takes a couple of weeks, than you do a bank transfer via sepa from your Portuguese bank account into Kraken Fidor German account which takes one day. Once you have the funds in your Kraken account it easy to buy the Crypto of your choice and transfer it to your hardware  wallet like a Ledger Nano S or Trezor. Don't leave it on the exchange. Boa sorte as they say.

Someone famous predicted $13,808 beginning of 2018. Let's wait and see.

Isn't that what the SEC will do once approved or will that only be for ICO?

Could it be that yes they and other exchanges are experiencing high levels of traffic, but at the same time could they have a dedicated team which steps in and buys as much BTC/ETH.. as possible for an anonymous group? High frequency Trading but on another level. Cousins of Senhor Alan Greenspan.........

Thanks for your reply, the alternative to buying another hardware wallet would be to move it to an exchange, but risk is they aren't safe and they would also be paying transfer fees. I think these are the only  two options to give them.

They are a good exchange but unfortunately support is super slow. I think it will get better but during the next three months expect to have exchange shutdowns during busy periods.  Plan ahead so you prepared.
