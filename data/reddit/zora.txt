let me try to figure this out: 
* 1) attacker requests BTC withdrawl
* 2) mtgox screws up txid, thinks it didn't go through, refunds attackers account
* 3) attacker modifies the transaction to 'make it 0.8 compliant' and resends it, gets accepted and added to blockchain. 
* 4) attacker gets her btc in wallet in addition to credit on gox
* 5) repeat? 
So did gox just let an attacker clean house? until someone noticed "whoops" there aren't any coins left...

maybe, I'd have to clean it up a bit. I doubt it would be useful to anyone in it's current state. I'ts not really a well thought out and designed piece of code ;-)  I was just trying out some ideas and kinda ended up with what you see.

so I can catch fontas :-) when some junk coin moves up or down 10% I need to know.

sure, but it's not too easy to get dollars into btc-e.  You could use your btc to ltc to usd to btc  but that doesn't work.  The market has already eliminated any arbitrage that route.

Well said. I know we're not in but you forgot your highness scale.  If I had to guess, I'd put you at a solid [6] maybe a little more.

Let's not talk about it.  Just say that education is expensive.  Right....

about march 11 -

dont.  You'll drive yourself crazy. It's a terrible anxiety when you are out of position and the market is moving the wrong way and you aren't sure whether you should cut your losses and get back in or ride it out.  Take me for example.  Last night I was trading a little, and sold @ $95 because I was sure it was gonna tank. buy back in at $90 and make almost 1btc in the process.  Kept going up and up.  Went to bed this morning and woke up now it's closing in on $120 and I don't know what to fucking do.  I'm certain that if i get back in, it will crash, and if I don't it won't.  I'm fucked.  It's not worth the anxiety.

this.  Plus I have lots of different coins in different places and I have no idea what I bought them at. Don't require it.
