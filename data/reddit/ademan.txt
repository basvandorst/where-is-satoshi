I'm not claiming that Bitcoin is "stored value" or a "payment instrument".
Bitcoin is "monetary value" if not "Money" as defined by the financial code. The redeemable codes that libertyx are issuing, are what I believe is "stored value" or perhaps a "payment instrument".
I'm still not a lawyer, this is still not legal advice.

I'm more familiar with CA state law than FinCEN, but in California you are a money transmitter if you issue "stored value cards", which are functionally equivalent to the redeemable codes described here (CA law might even mention redeemable codes, I don't recall). It's stupid, but the law is backed by force regardless of its merit, so break it at your own risk...
Most importantly, when researching the California law, I found that *at least* one other state had straight copy and pasted parts of the California law (or vice versa) so this may apply to more states.
Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, just my recollection of research I conducted ~6mo ago. If anyone's curious I can dig up the actual text of the law later today. ~~Also if it ever was signed AB 2209 amends some of the relevant law.~~ AB 2209 amends some of this.

This is basically verbatim of my comment from another sub but, I expect a good technical crowd will be in here.
Very interesting, but I'm concerned about a few things. From the technical side, running somebody else' turing-complete code on my computer is a bit scary. Of course it's been done before, for example with Javascript, but Javascript can still hang my browser...






From [here](
Compounding that, they're *selling* the first units of currency, I don't need to tell anyone here how scammy that sounds.
Next, from a technical standpoint, their scripting language doesn't strike me as well thought out, especially if they want to implement a language on top of it with higher order functions...


If the scripting language is turing complete, then it's difficult to know ahead of time how many "step"s it will execute. How do they plan to extract fees after execution? Do I have to overpay by a lot to ensure my script executes completely? Could I accidentally write an infinite loop contract and chew through all of my "change"? Either way if I can reasonably determine ahead of time how many steps my script will take, and I have to "guess" at the halting problem, why do I need a turing complete language anyways?

You completely misidentified the reason Bitcoin users are hostile to altcoins. The consequence of the wild west state of cryptocurrencies is users *must be vigilant* in spotting scams. Altcoins are frequently pump and dump scams, whether intentionally or inadvertently. Rather than spend all your time evaluating each of the deluge of new altcoins with no advantage over Bitcoin, it's efficient to adopt a "bad until proven otherwise" approach. Moreover as I said before, a coin may end up failing miserably and costing a lot of people a lot of money even without malice on the part of the creator.

Consider the sentence "Bitcoin addresses are 160 bits" as just one of many obvious examples of why "bits" is confusing. Only someone who already understands Bitcoin addresses is able to discern which meaning of "bits" is being used there.
Furthermore, if Bitcoin achieves any kind of mainstream success, Bitcoin's context starts to spill over into everything, and any time you're discussing *any* technology it becomes unclear which "bits" you mean.

The context of your post is why claimed FUD. Of course it's true Bitcoin has a public ledger, but you were implicitly comparing it to banks sharing data with the NSA, which is really not a fair comparison because Bitcoin is pseudonymous. They have to work harder to tie a Bitcoin address to a person despite the transactions being public and CoinJoin severs this link beyond reasonable repair. So even with a public ledger Bitcoin compares favorably to these bank practices, but your comment could be interpreted as claiming otherwise.
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:09:33
Well right, I guess I didn't mean to imply that the *absolute* quantity of people who know what's going on is small, but that relative to the size of the community it is. That's why I think it's important to have high profile people like you who are "known good" sources of information. Obviously saying "hey that's what gmaxwell said, we should trust it unconditionally" is dangerous (that's why I'm slowly doing my own code review), but in the absence of widespread expertise, I think it's better than nothing.

As said, the signatures themselves can be represented multiple ways and still be valid. Leading 0's are ignored (by OpenSSL!) so you can modify the signature to have more leading 0s (doesn't change the actual number) without invalidating the signature. There's also a function f(x) which you can apply to the signature, which results in another valid signature, and doesn't require knowledge of the secret (the signature is still for the same secret, and signs the same data, the integrity of the signature is not affected).

That's my favorite video describing how Bitcoin works, but there are a few inaccuracies worth mentioning.
1. [Anonymity]( The narrator seems to imply TOR is enough to anonymize your Bitcoin usage, but that's not true. If you purchased your Bitcoins on an exchange, mined your Bitcoins from an IP address linkable to you, or purchased goods shipped to you, you've potentially leaked your information in each case, and TOR does not help you there (except in the second case, mining on TOR would prevent that situation). As he goes on to say, analysis of transactions could use any of those three methods to reveal more about your bitcoins and transactions. [Wiki page describing Anonymity Issues](
2. [De-anonymizing Transactions]( Though not yet common in the "wild" yet, CoinJoin allows users to trustlessly issue transactions which appear as though they were issued by a single person, but are not. [Some discussion]( resulting in 51,000+ BTC which would appear to be owned by a single person, according to that naive analysis.
3. [An attacker needs much more than 50% of the network hash rate to solve several blocks in a row]( This is technically correct, if you have a 50% chance of finding the next block before the rest of the network, you have a 25% chance of finding two in a row before the rest of the network, and 12.5% chance of 3, etc. But that's not how an intelligent attacker would attack the network, since the network will switch to the longest chain, all the attacker has to do is ignore the rest of the networks blocks, and only use their own chain. An attacker controlling &gt;50% of the network's hash rate is guaranteed to *eventually* out pace the rest of the network.
4. I didn't particularly like what he says about proof-of-work proving that the entire network's hash rate was brought to bear, but I suppose it's fine for the intended depth of the video.
5. "[You can send down to one-one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin]( That's also technically true, but as of right now, bitcoin core (bitcoin-qt and bitcoind) nodes will not relay your transactions if they contain transaction outputs smaller than 530 satoshis. I suppose you can submit your transactions directly to a sympathetic miner and still have them go through but... eh.
EDIT: A couple of these are pretty nit-pickey, but oh well.
[He made a new, more concised 5-minute video]( it's pretty good other than pretending each block contains only one transaction. The author obviously knows better (as evidenced by his previous video) and explaining that a block is a set of transactions wouldn't have taken much time at all. Oh well.

I agree.


I agree with that general principle, but I think any impartial judge would look at Bitcoin and Litecoin and declare Bitcoin to be *far* more likely to succeed, and Litecoin *far* more likely to fail. **Most importantly**, though, you don't achieve meaningful diversity by buying Coke and Pepsi Co, you buy Coke and GM (or whatever). Litecoin is Pepsi Co in my opinion, in any plausible scenario in which Bitcoin fails, Litecoin also fails.
There is one scenario where Litecoin ownership makes sense, Litecoin organically absorbs Bitcoin's user base over a period of years. Not only is that scenario unlikely, but you would have years to react and purchase Litecoin as well.

I'm not a constitutional lawyer or anything, but here's my armchair/layperson analysis: We know that there continued to be [a variety of state currencies and private currencies]( until the National Banking Act of 1863 (and even since then). If the constitution made such currencies illegal (that those powers were exclusive) the Act would not need to carry provisions against them, they could just enforce existing law. I consider that evidence that those powers are not exclusive.
The powers which you cited are indeed exclusive, but by their nature. It simply makes no sense^1 that a random citizen could claim the credit of the entire united states any more than me claiming the credit of my employer (without specific approval).

There's an unfortunate terminology issue here. (Right) Libertarian is essentially a tendency/classification for a range of ideologies which promote personal liberty and private property. I'm unfortunately not familiar enough with Left libertarianism to provide a comprehensive classification.
Anyways Anarcho-capitalism is a libertarian ideology which prefers no state. Minarchism usually refers to a libertarian ideology which prefers a limited state, as do constitutionalists in general. The american libertarian party is roughly minarchist which is why the term "libertarian" is often associated with minarchists, which are by definition statists.
*More concisely there are libertarian anarchists and libertarian statists, in general when I use the word libertarian to describe a person I mean they are minarchists and thus statists.*

I may have just missed it, is there a link to a donation page or project page? In particular I'm curious if I can donate fiat, I value my few btc much higher to be honest, until I can find a way to exchange USD for BTC with reasonably low fees in small volume that is.
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:16:39
Sorry to belabor the point, but can I donate in fiat (and how)? I don't have many coins to donate and because of how annoying they are to obtain relative to all the USD I already have, I'd rather donate in USD. Is that possible?

I just did my second transaction today with  . My first one was a test run for $40 (the maximum value you can do without a fee). As they didn't run away with my money I did a second, larger transaction today and they charged me a ~3% fee which isn't too bad. Basically (after you initiate things on cashintocoins.com) you walk into a bank, fill out a deposit slip with some info from the website, deposit some cash, and send a picture to the website operators. It was super easy, but makes coinbase sound really easy too, I may give them a go too, especially if they have lower fees.

I used bitinstant, their fees are rather steep though.

Please explain how freedom requires laws (externally imposed restrictions on freedom). That's clearly contradictory. More importantly, please explain how individuals making voluntary transactions for agreed upon goods, services and currency, require law... 
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:03:55
That's actually an excellent point, which I'll have to consider further. I suppose my immediate response to that is: Why does it have to be externally enforced? Surely you don't think we're all so sociopathic that the only thing keeping us from initiating force against our neighbors constantly is law?
But what about markets though? I would maintain that laws are necessarily opposed to the aggregate of voluntary transactions that make up a market.

Thanks for the response! I really do appreciate it, if you don't mind I have a couple questions beyond what I saw covered in your FAQ.
1. I bank only with a bank not on your list, can I use your service?
2. Does the bank I deposit at charge any fee on top of yours?
3. I assume if I can deposit at any bank (If the answer to  is true), that the issue of FinCEN compliance then lies with the bank to verify my identity and whatnot. What would the in-bank procedure be for performing the deposit at, say, well's fargo?
Thanks again!

I'm glad Adafruit exists to service beginners, I wish them all the success in the world, and furthermore I applaud their move to accept Bitcoin, but components on their site tend to be marked up significantly, their shift registers are almost 50% over digikey's price for instance.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:25:09
The best thing you can do is *use* Bitcoin. Buy things with Bitcoin, sell things for Bitcoin, sell your services for Bitcoin... Bitcoin is primarily a tool of commerce, if it's never used for commerce it's failed. (Yes Bitcoin is also a store of value but I would argue its long term value depends on actually being used, though possibly not entirely)

I think your concern is unfounded. If you tipped at a restaurant that's actually a front for the mob you're essentially in the same situation. I'd even say there's better plausible deniability in this case.

There might be a market for Prusa i3 RepRap kits and assembled printers. The RepRap project is pretty awesome if you're not familiar with it and there are a number of existing kit distributors. It doesn't hurt that a full i3 kit is less than half the cost of a replicator 2 either.

I don't understand that train of thought *at all*... some people act like they genuinely *hate* Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a tool, to me it's like saying you hate screwdrivers. Even if you think screwdrivers are poor tools and hand drills are better in every circumstance, I can't fathom anyone being as emotionally invested as these bitcoin haters seem to be.
EDIT: Probably would be a better analogy with screwdrivers and drills reversed, but oh well...

Two people making a mutually agreed upon transaction *do not need laws* for the success of their transaction. I suppose depending on the law you're talking about it may not be directly opposed to these transactions, but many are. 
Again, why are laws necessary for a market? The single greatest boon to trade and preventer of fraud is escrow, which does not require law to function correctly.

Kudos for doing this, as someone else said, I'm shocked that bitcoin hasn't taken off for porn, and I think you'll have a nice niche for a while. Entirely out of curiosity, how does one round up enough cam girls to start a site? Where do you find them? It seems like you'd have to poach them from other sites, but then again I don't know how the "industry" works. I always assumed that cam girls approached sites, not the other way around, and that seems like it would make it very difficult to get started.

I don't know, Mozilla is relatively software freedom oriented, so it's possible. Still, a browser plugin isn't the way I'd do this if I had the choice, your computer already has support for resolving domain names.
 is the ideal situation, but you would need to trust the namecoin DNS server more than I do at the moment...
 is slightly more secure and slightly easier to implement, but not really "the right solution".

I disagree with this. Would you personally start initiating force against your neighbors if there were no laws against it? Everyone answers no to that question. Expand that to your friends and family, would any of them start initiating force against their neighbors? Some people say "a few might". Yet if everyone thinks they and their immediate family would essentially behave well, who are the people who will cause the problem? Invariably the answer is "the others".
This common world view consistently boils down to "myself and people I like would behave well in the absence of laws, the laws are necessary to restrain the others". It's contradictory for everyone to hold this position. Therefore either the statement "The people I know and I would primarily behave well in the absence of laws" or the statement "The other people would not behave well and need to be restricted." is false. You are the most qualified person to predict your own behavior in the absence of laws. You are more qualified to judge the potential actions of your immediate family, friends, and acquaintances than you are to judge people you know nothing of. Likewise, people who know nothing or little of you and your network are less qualified to predict you or your network's behavior. Given all this it is much more likely that everyone would primarily behave well in the absence of laws, than for everyone to behave primarily poorly in the absence of laws.
EDIT: I realize I made a lot of assumptions about the core of your belief here. Please don't take offense if I'm wrong, it's my best attempt at analysing what I believe you believe. Feel free to correct me. At the very least there seem to be many with this view point, so even if I'm wrong somebody else might find it interesting.

Unless both buying and selling transactions were with cash, I can't imagine a sufficiently anonymous bitcoin transaction that would make me feel comfortable not giving the government what they want. (Maybe if the amount was too small for them to bother) I kind of figure governments will be aggressive in enforcing capital gains on bitcoins.

You're right, fair enough


Well that was actually my primary concern, as I couldn't find anywhere what the price was that we buy the bitcoins at. When I talked about the price he bought them at I really meant what price he's selling them at. We assume from what we know we pay 1.045 * $PRICE per BTC. To know how much we're buying at we need to know what $PRICE is. I semi-incorrectly called $PRICE his cost but I was really after $PRICE. (In my defense though I was technically using poor terminology, we can assume pretty reasonably that he does not have 10k bitcoins, but buys as needed with some reserve, therefore in practice $PRICE is roughly his cost) Per his post below it's the current mtgox price but that was not previously clear to me.

Namecoin is also a currency like Bitcoin, however. You could make an argument that Namecoin's really cool features (which you mentioned) give the currency inherent value. That value is far surpassed by the value of Bitcoin's network effect, but hey, it's still an inherent value. If it ever became easy enough for end users to use namecoin DNS I think that inherent value would be quite high. (It's relatively simple to add .bit domain resolution, but try getting end users to do anything...)

I think you're spot on about 99% of altcoins, *especially* litecoin, but the one I make an exception for is Namecoin. The distributed DNS it provides is an excellent idea in my opinion. Unfortunately 3/4 of my last comments have been pimping Namecoin so maybe I've turned into one of those "dedicated followers" but eh, that's my 0.00002210 BTC

I have an arbitrage bot that watches btc-e, vircurex, and crypto-trade (soon more) as I gather data on what alts if any tend to have more arbitrage opportunities. In the week since it's functioned, the largest profit in arbitrage available I've seen was about $0.25 and that was DevCoin/Bitcoin. Average profits tended to be $0.001 yeah, 1/10th of a cent. Both are completely unprofitable because of the withdrawal fees between exchanges. So basically: you're right alt/BTC exchange rates aren't EXACTLY the same across exchanges, but they are negligibly different at all times as best I can tell.
