Above when you say "The richest holders" do you really mean the people who control the fiat currency?  I'm not sure I'd consider the government to be a "rich entity" as much as one that becomes rich by printing money whenever they run out.

aw false alarm.  the guy emailed me to say he selected bitcoin by accident.

Wow great response. I learned a lot. I made an edit earlier that also asked how bitcoin combats "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer" and I got some great responses about there being no printing press with bitcoin so there isn't anybody in the system who gets a huge advantage on interest rates and such (banks.)
If you believe that bitcoin will incentivize essentially storing bitcoins under their mattress so to speak because the deflationary interest would be great enough to warrant such, do you think the level playing field would in some ways balance this? Or just different people (non-banks) would have a fairer shot at gaining wealth and those people will just sit on it, but not invest it, just like with the fiat currencies?

This is similar to arguments I've heard against returning to the gold standard ala Ron Paul.  That our financial system has evolved to a place where we couldn't exist without credit and the capital market.
I still like the idea that my money won't devalue expressly because those in control of the money supply decide to print and spend more money.

why doesn't it make sense as a currency?
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:23:02
Interesting okay...so not only does fiat allow banks to profit and lend on free money, but our government too gets to spend money that doesn't exist by printing it and then my paycheck in turn loses value as a result.  
That was a big Ron Paul argument when he was speaking out against the federal reserve.  Has Ron Paul come out in support for Bitcoin yet? It's the next best thing to his unrealistic suggestion to return to the gold standard.

would that be the "Master Public Key?" Or am I basically giving you access to my empty bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:55:23
I think this answers my question.  Can you explain more about how the richest holders will "tend to lose bitcoin as they spend it."
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:49:44
I was reading that somehow bitcoin combats the old adage "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is there any truth to this?  I think this is more aligned with my above question.

helpful :) thanks.

What are the implications of the regulated exchange that was just announced today? I already buy bitcoin from coinbase. What is new now?

Who do things change for?

I didn't even know bitifnex existed... glad to discover now. I'm in NY.
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:42:28
really like how you said that.
@_date: 2015-03-06 12:48:39
Wow had no idea. Time to switch bt clients.

maybe i just don't understand the system well enough yet.  why are you being charged?  does it somehow enhance the security of the transaction?  I'm pretty sure that's why they have those wire transfer fees in the first place.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:47:13
Wouldn't a wire transfer from a bank cost at least $40 though?

While talking to a friend about my interest in BitCoin he said "So what's the immediate benefit to me of using BitCoin?" and I didn't really know how to respond.
I understand the general advantages of the currency but what can you do with it right now that is worth converting some of my cash into bitcoins?  
Should we be worried about the currency post-silk road?
