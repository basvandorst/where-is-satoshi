Alright, is there anyway though for me to transfer the money from paypal to bitcoin though?
@_date: 2016-08-22 22:03:09
Yes, very helpful and professional. 12$ PayPal for 10$BTC
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:25:42
If transaction fees and times went down bitcoin would probably be back up higher
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:30:18
No it hasn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:04:49
Ah, every conspiracy is now a well known fact. Who knew!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:25
So one article predicts 100k, another 40k. I believe 1 million 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:06:23
Yes but it's not in the correct format. It's in a word document
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:30:37
To everybody saying "he should have HODL!!1!1" what if everybody held? If you want your investment to be stable and actually used as a currency. ***spend***
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:01:13
That uses so much data, I'd  like to run one
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:36:07
Two weeks ago, 14 days, I made the mistake of paying 20 sat for a transaction. It's been waiting with 0 confirmations. Is there a way to resolve this?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:28:55
I still have a transaction from December 25th that's unconfirmed....
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:51:52
I hate how bitcoin isn't looked at as a currency anymore and as an investment opportunity.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:48:28
It should be a currency first. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:36:22
It's been 2 weeks
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:22:04
Idk I don't like the look of electrum. I don't like the changing addresses. What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:29:24
I edited the initial post
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:24:06
They are in Epstein’s book. Just sayin
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:28:23
I found two wallets.
1.) It starts with : {"pbkdf2_iterations":5000,"version":2,"payload":" RANDOM TEXT =="} It was labled 0.121 Bitcoin wallet back up. But for watever reason, i copied the wallet contents into a word file so the origional .dat is gone.
2.) I found a 20 word phrase also labeled "bitcoin" it has a password on top, but i cant find out where I encrypted it initially. It has words like fenn and Gethsemane in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:15:06
I'm in the same boat, I did the exact same thing as you. But I did it with bread wallet to bitWallet on iOS. 
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:53:36
Isn’t there a fee to set up the channel?
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:38:57
Is there a way to get this on my chrome book?
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:37:57
Just for shits and giggles, if you feel up to it could you expand a bunch on this? As to what everything you mentioned is?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:38:17
Hypothetically, why is that a bad thing? I’m also not a writer too
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:47:47
Because it’s not talked about and I don’t know too much about it. It’s also interesting to know the issues that it faces because I’m putting money into it
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:29:19
Ok cool
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:12:40
I have made like 100$ maybe in crypto. I have no idea exactly. What do I do in this situation?
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:27:11
Really. I don’t see any big threads or discussions about it
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:34:10
Any proof from your photoshop friend?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:38
What are some criticisms of bitcoin? I see people praising it, what are some cons to it?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:29:23
How can I help speed up transactions? I know it won't be really much but is there a way I can help? 
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:13:50
How do they track monero’s cap?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:28:34
Last week I made a dumbass mistake of making a small transaction fee, it's been unconfirmed for about a week. What should I do?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:55:43
Would you be interested in selling it, if it works?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:47:38
Does anybody think holding is dumb? If people want a stable(r) currency, they need to use it. This should be a currency, not an investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:54:48
Deal, I want to see the photo first.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:19:08
I want to help the bitcoin network. I have a few raspberry pis. Is there anything I can do?
Also, I know it's not worth it at all, but is there a mining guide for raspberry pis?
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:30:43
Funny story, I bought 30$ of BTC a couple years ago. I forgot about it. One of my friends was talking about bitcoin and I remembered about my wallet. I some how remembered the password and got 200$ back
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:25:54
I got a gift card, I don’t really care about KYC. How do I use it to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:00:57
I’m tasked with learning as much as I can about bitcoin/blockchain as I can this upcoming month for my company. Where do I even start?
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:26:12
Attack the argument not the person
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:43:19
Does anybody have a extra bitcoin USB miner lying around? I know it's not profitable I just want to tinker 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:44:09
So if everybody is hodling, who is spending?
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:26:01
Ive been looking for a use for my cluster, is there a guide to this?
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:51:07
I’d love to own some mining hardware but it’s so expensive, a big upfront cost. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 05:05:07
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:10:01
Hi I have two questions:
1.) do we get a percentage of a few or something from running this?
2.) could I use a rpi3 or rpi0 I have laying around?
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:55:42
Thank you! Lol
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:26:15
I just switched to breadwallet.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:13:57
I don't have the money to buy thousands of dollars worth, so at the time I thought I'd invest 10 dollars here 10 dollars there... I ended up just buying 26 dollars worth and forgetting about it lol
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:04:41
Could I mine them with a laptop?
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:12:26
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:25:29
I just moved my coins to iOS breadwallet. How's that?
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:34:23
How do I get the Bitcoin out of the received address? It's different from the spend address.
@_date: 2016-06-19 14:03:58
How do you live with the constant fluctuation of Bitcoin? I couldn't do that.
@_date: 2016-06-16 02:20:22
What if you payed x amount for say... 5,10,20, unlimited transactions?
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:42:26
And the software was teamviewer 
@_date: 2016-06-11 14:04:05
I haven't used it yet, but changetip I heard works for buying small purchases. I think between 10-50$.
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:25:23
Well if anybody is looking at like 3 month charts or longer, it has a steady increase and then now is shoots straight up.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:31:11
What do you guys think of Bisq?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:50:26
The fees are getting crazy.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:48:58
Would that affect student loans?
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:41:12
I bought about .5 a few years ago when it was 100$ for a Bitcoin. Spent it all and lost the other part in a wallet I forgot the pass phrase to. This was when I was 17-18. Hurts lmao
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:45:15
What are the biggest issues bitcoin is facing? I feel like I don’t really hear some of the bad things about bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:12:20
Opinions/thoughts on NimbleNode? I’m thinking of getting one with my next paycheck
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:35:29
@_date: 2019-06-03 02:05:34
Set the charts for 5 minutes. Bet 1 shot if it will be red or green. Winner hands out the shots, loser takes them.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:20:22
The next block fee is almost 7$
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:42:10
Real talk, would bitcoin be a good way to buy internationally without tariffs?
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:40:24
Is there an exchange I can use on my phone? Binance is getting suspended in the US
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:58:27
Where can you buy newly mined bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:57:52
Wouldn’t the paper money be a representation of the government? So the government has zero value
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:50:20
That’s just like your opinion man
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:44:32
Kwik trip plz
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:45:13
I have some raspberry pi’s I don’t need. I was wondering if there was a recommended guide somebody has to set up a full lightning node with my pi’s?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:33:26
What does the photo mean?
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:09:16
Look up nimblenode
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:11:40
What’s KYC?
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:54:23
Hypothetical question: what if I bought bitcoin and sold it for a profit and didn't report that? Would it be obvious? 
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:34:57
What if I take the bitcoins out of coinbase and into my personal wallet? 
@_date: 2016-02-02 03:06:34
What is this? ELI5?
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:26:40
Definitely, get raspberry pis or old laptops minings, something is better than nothing 
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:31:35
If you can't pick it up and pet it because it's on the internet and doesn't exist, does the internet exist? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:32:36
Ha! I trade at night
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:31:22
I'd like to know who's still sending at 2000+
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:57:16
I enjoy hearing the more reasonable predictions like I think by Saturday, bitcoin will be around 9010 dollars. Nothing crazy like by Saturday bitcoin will be 100K! I like to make the predictions just cause
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:55:16
Yeah I feel like if it's something you are sure is right up his ally, go for it. If he doesn't know what it is, don't. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 02:39:33
Noted. Thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:16:49
I don't mean this in a bad way, but why does that matter?
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:40:56
Guerilla marketing
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:31:39
Never know if it’s going up or down. I play a little conservative. I’m happy with what I got
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:39:11
I made 16$ on my 150$ I keep in Binance by buying and selling the last few days lmao
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:40:50
I nance is supposedly getting margin trading soon. Will you still use Binance or a different exchange?
@_date: 2019-05-04 03:26:41
Could you remove the text and add more charts and what not in its place?
