Woooow great! I payed just 0.0002 to open the channel and was confirmed in the first block. Awsome!
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:35:48
Should I stop my lightningd and start again? If I stop it, what happens to my opened channels?

We ship the product exactly as received, with the original seal, and you can check us on their webpage either.  
  
It can take more than two months to a product clear the customs, so many people like to buy local stuff 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:51:50
So blame on TREZOR. It's how they ship it. Any man in the middle can alter the product if you think this way

Yeah,  is my Twitter. I tried to change to my Twitter and website, but it was over 32 characters 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:30:18
Oh, will fix it. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:09:32
Not yet. It's still in development. Soon there will be many wallets. DDoS isn't a problem, there will be so many nodes that a new route will be available for the transaction 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:18:21
That's why TREZOR ships their products with super glue and a seal
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:16:53
It depends. To make a LN payment, you have to open a channel directly with the seller (my node, and you have to know my IP address) or to open a channel with someone that indirectly has an open channel with me. For example, if you open a channel with blockstream (I don't have a channel opened with them) and blockstream has a channel opened with bitrefill (I have a channel with them), your payment would go through blockstream, bitrefill and then me. But, LN payments are onion routed, so blockstream and bitrefill doesn't know necessarily who is paying me and if I'm the final node, nor that you are the initial node. In this second case, you don't need to know my IP.  
  
If I explained it wrong, please someone correct me
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:42:36
Thank you for the explanation. Now it makes sense to me. My trezor doesn't work the same way, all change goes to a P2WPKH address, no matter the address type I'm sending to. I really like Samourai. Thanks again! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:19:55
Thank you for the reply, but could you explain better what's the benefit of doing this way? 
 
Because now if I want to spend to a P2WPKH address my coins are coming from a P2PKH address, and I won't benefit from SegWit 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:44:13
Another thing, when are you going to support other fiat? I wanted to choose BRL as well, but there isn't this option yet
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:18:59
Yeah, but last time I spoke with them, they were just accepting German companies. We are established in the UK  
Edit: The UK subsidiary of Fidor just accepts personal accounts
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:27:51
Yes, I think Fidor is the best as well. But when we tried to open an account with them \(last year\), they were just accepting German companies :\(
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:33:45
Yes, I gave them this example. But they said it wasn't possible 
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:00:56
I think you haven't read the announcement correctly. From June they will start to charge €500/month to maintain crypto\-companies accounts

ELI5: Is a hardware wallet safer than a paper wallet? Why? 
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:13:05
Yeah, I have a paper wallet, but I don't spend from it. When I want to spend btc from it, I always make a new one
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:57:29
Yeah, I've talked to many banks, they are all open until they hear the word bitcoin. Then, they all close their doors

Perfect, I haven't noticed this mistake. Gonna fix it ASAP!

The problem is that I'm using a free api, and it's a bit limited. I'm implementing an alternative to cache most searched stocks. I hope this fixes the issue

This is strange. Gonna check it!

You guys from Reddit are great! Thanks so much for the answer

Unless you start using it!
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:09:31
Actually ViaBTC is accepting BCH deposits. I sold mine there
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:30:58
Title says pretty much all.
My motivation was to show nocoiners how they could be wealthier investing in bitcoin instead of stocks/funds.
There are some other info, like my public open channels and a watch tower service to anybody that doesn't want to run their LN nodes 24/7.
I would really like feedbacks and suggestions to improve the platform
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:49:54
Not right. They require just 1 confirmation. To withdraw the btc then is needed 20 confirmations from your bch deposit, but to trade 1 is enough 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:28:28
Besides that, nodes using the core version will reject 2x blocks
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:15:51
Each transaction you make gives you a new address. Each address has a private key. So each new transaction you get a new private key. All they are derived from the seed you backed up 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:09:42
Just keep your seed from mycelium and you are safe
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:24:16
Because you have access to your private key. With the private key you can spend the coins you earn (because both will use the same private key, since it's a fork from the same blockchain). So then is just use some service that let you spend the btc you want to sell using your private key  
  
Edit: on the bch fork, trezor made a tool to spend the bch coin, so probably they will make another one for the upcoming fork
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:54:29
Core didn't sign any agreement. The problem is being solved by the activation of the original segwit that will make possible the lightning network

This script made by a friend of my help you check the balance and withdraw the forks: 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:11:11
This won't happen. SegWit is supposed to activate on block 481823. So sooner or later the activation will happen 
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:25:52
Yeah got it. Nice work! 
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:18:49
Yes you can. I do this with my partner, we have a 2/2 multisig wallet. I sign the tx and send him. You can sign it and then import it in electrum, it will open the window with information about the transaction, and then you can select to broadcast it
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:27:37
Explain why do you need the privkey?
Edit: nevermind, got it, it's the key from the site's wallet
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:23:01
I think you can use electrum to import the transaction, and then broadcast it

Right now there is a guy exchanging your btc for Amazon wish list for $1367.72 the best offer I'm seeing 
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:47:54
Sure it does. I always exchange my btc there for Amazon wish list.  search for the best rate 
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:48:15
Localbitcoins.com has better exchange rates 
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:26:15
First you go to Amazon and create a public wish list, and set to show your address. Than add what you want to buy to that list.  
  
After you've done adding products to your wish list, go to lbc open a trade with someone that accepts Amazon wish list and put the link to your list.  
  
The person will buy the products to you and you release your btc to him
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:52:38
Search for all online offers. Then under payment method search for Amazon wish list
Edit: follow the link and search for Amazon wish list or Amazon gift card under the payment method field
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:01:53
Yeah. Purse has bad exchange rates. Lbc is much better. There are some other gift cards with better exchange rates as well

I understand you, but is almost impossible the average user run their own node. I will make a tutorial about running a full node, but I think it's more important now teach the average user to protect themselves from the 2x. Wouldn't you share with me your node IP? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:08:25
I already run my fullnode, and I'm stick with core. I'll teach people to connect to my full node, so they will be secure 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:35:30
Yes, they are good exchanges. Foxbit has a volume of about 600btc daily, just fiat-btc
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:20:53
I think they are an exchange
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:34:07
I think you have to use the coupon code on their website. Than the euros are converted to btc at spot price and you can withdraw it
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:56:09
Exactly, but this price variation only occurred in the btcves price, not dolartoday price, which is cash trades. I wonder why this happens
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:44:57
I recommend P2P. If you need to buy or sell I have a very good reputation here. But if you really need an exchange, then I recommend foxbit or walltime
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:30:38
Hi Luke. I'm an official reseller of trezor and ledger in Brazil. I always recommend using a hardware wallet, but many people here don't understand that they need a hardware wallet. They leave their funds on exchanges or online wallets, that's even worse than a spv wallet. So I try to write articles teaching them why is important to buy a hardware wallet. 
 
Many people are losing their funds stored on blockchain.info and are blaming bitcoin. So I want to teach them how to use a good free wallet and connect to a trusted node. I wanted them to connect to my full node, but my IP is dynamic. Do you recommend a trusted node? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:16:01
Thanks! I'll write a tutorial teaching how to connect manually to my bitcoin core node using breadwallet to Brazilians people 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:49:21
The average user just has bitcoins. They don't even know what a hardware wallet is. How do you think they will run a node?  
  
It's easier and better to teach them to connect to a trusted node than run a node. They are storing their bitcoins in untrusted wallets and exchanges, risking their money
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:47:22
I've just seen that Trezor disabled the SegWit XPUB, even in their beta-wallets. So no way to test it now. But thanks anyway
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:09:14
I use cryptopayments. You can accept many shitcoins and they convert it to bitcoin and make an automatic transfer to your wallet
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:47:30
It doesn't make sense to me. How can a currency in hiperinflation gain against a "stable" fiat currency? And btcves price is far from usdves price in dollartoday
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:46:28
I do, however bolivar is in hiperinflation. It doesn't make sense bolivar gain against USD, not even for a day
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:19:47
Why LBC prices vary too much? For what I can see, they don't follow the USD price, sometimes it goes really high and fast and then start to fall, like now
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:24:35
Yes, that what I meant. But, ie, two weeks ago price was more than 220.000.000. Last week was 185.000.000. The USD price was almost the same these two weeks

Yeah, our cryptobusiness site just got blocked in Venezuela 
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:16:45
Yes, your math is correct. Btcrecover checked 2,876,119 combinations in half an hour. So considering this ratio, it would take 83 hours to check 479 million possibilities. It's not that bad
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:21:07
Okay, actually the wallet is not mine, it's from a friend of mine. He'll give me a bonus if I recover his seed.  
  
I do have a machine to let it running and I don't bother to do it. I would appreciate if you could send me the script, part of my bonus would be your donation
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:42:33
Nice. A friend of mine has the 12 word but don't remember the order. I will give it a try to recover his btc
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:19:14
Yes, I'm running btcrecover and it's written in python
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:28:37
Thank you very much. I'll give it a try. If I have success sure I'll donate. I know one of the firsts address, does it help? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:56:08
The problem is that btcrecover doesn't try all combinations. It thinks that the words I entered are in the right order, and tries typos or a missing word. Actually I have all words, but out of order
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:26:21
Alphabay did have. But just a few people used it
@_date: 2017-07-04 10:51:19
Same in Brazil. Not legal but not illegal. There's absolutely no regulation. The Brazilian IRS tax it as a property, but there is no regulation, just an advise on how to declare it
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:29:53
I'm pretty sure there were no typos
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:20:18
Yes, all words are different. Maybe the address I have is the first one, but I'm not sure. But it's one of the 5 firsts. It's a standard address and I don't have the xpub
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:49:25
Yeah, the point I'm helping him out to recover his seed is because he doesn't have access to this wallet anymore. So we need a way to find the correct order and access the wallet to withdraw the funds.  
  
I think we need a script to bruteforce all the possible orders untill it finds the correct one
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:20:30
It's gonna be solved with atomic swaps. Google it ��
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:40:40
11783972 permutations in 65786 seconds. 179.12 tries/second. It's strange because it was showing 188550000 of 479001600 permutations when it showed the right one.  
  
I tried to import the seed with Copay, that created this wallet. But Copay said the seed was invalid. Then I tried with Electrum, and only worked when I checked the BIP39 option
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:01:19
I'll run it on my Linux pc at home. I'm using the pc that is running your program to work, so I think that if I run both at the same time, the programs will consume too much cpu
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:55:07
Nice, but I have no idea on how to build a program to shuffle the words. I'm no coder at all.  
  
If I download this program from github, how should I run it?
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:27:43
Cool. I wouldn't need to download all blockchain again, right? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:47:50
Thanks everyone. Downloaded the binaries from the uasf github and now I'm running the right version 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:09:22
Lol. I said him too after he told me he made the backup by printscreen 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:12:06
It's been awhile since he lost access to his wallet. So as soon as we withdraw the funds, he'll move them to another wallet 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:06:39
He made a print screen with iPhone. There is this possibility, but I think that is not high 
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:01:35
 shows the price with the fees included. It supports many countries 
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:42:17
Seems great. Will try it on my desktop 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:08:15
Yes I know one of the firsts address generated by this seed. If you write a code and we have success to withdraw the funds, we'll be very happy and donate a part to you 
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:38:22
Actually the seed is from a friend of mine. I'm helping him out. He downloaded Copay, to confirm you have the right seed, Copay shuffles it and asks you to put the seed in the right order. He took a printscreen of the shuffled seed instead of the right one. So I don't know if Copay uses an algorithm to shuffle it, and if is always the same shuffle order.  
  
Edit: typo
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:47:47
Hey send me your address, it worked!  
  
However, there were much less btc there than I expected to be. Is it possible to have more btc in the other addresses associated with this seed? To unlock it I had to use Electrum and select BIP39, otherwise it wouldn't work, idk why.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:59:00
Yeah I'm running your program. It's still running but no results yet. Later I will run his program either on another computer. I'll let you guys know the result 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:57:14
Many thanks! sent me a program too. I'm running it right now. If I don't have success with his program, I'll run the code you sent me!
