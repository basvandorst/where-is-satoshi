He is, as well as yourself. I didn't like the way he stated it, so I rebutted aggressively.

No, he says they brushed the beta release under the rug and played possum while waiting for a better plan.

Awesome. Didn't expect computerphile to tackle this. Maybe numberphile will do another algorithm vid related to this.

Yeah, but some boards and subjects I try to be discrete, fucker, lol.

The fall of the elite will be inevitable. The uncontrolled volume of wealth will disseminate the collaborated evil system will fall under the weight of the of the forced tributes and tithes prearranged to benefit the curs who structured the mafia-like racket of banking.

Sounds pretty gay.

Good luck.

That is it. Though it's kinda gay they won't refund based on the transaction paradigm change.

Need to keep up on this story.

I'm probably too late.

Well, you're right- This is not an innovative product, and I'm having a lot of trouble figuring any incentives to give any generous person. I would be happy to service any investor's equipment at very deep discounts, but that only helps locally.
I am simply putting another duck out there at the moment until I can involve others and bring the project some more life. I would be remiss to not try everything I can do to open a small business with no capital, no personal income, and undesirable credit while it still looks feasible.
If you've looked at the project, you see there will be more information posted online including my skills, business plan, mission statement, and other interactive elements- I need to brush up on my markup language skills before it is finished.
Short answer, I'm including every means I can muster to lay a foundation, and the full scope of the project is incomplete.

While I do not see the immediate stupidity in my idea, I concur it must be flawed. (I have the flu, I'm not totally cognizant atm). What I'd like to express an is an unrealistic hope that future elections would utilize a publicly open record of votes that cannot be altered or corrupted, and a system using publicly scrutinized software for tabulation. I am completely hopeless after reading articles form recent elections, along with viewing "Hacking America", that anybody's individual vote will ever, ever make a difference in electoral outcomes.

Yeah I use a purse. Wanna fight about it?

I'm a little pissed that the Coinbase fees are as high as a regular bank now.
