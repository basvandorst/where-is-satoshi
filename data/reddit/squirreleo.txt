There are so many libertarians on this subreddit that its kinda insane.

Because people have faith in the value to remain largely stable over a large period of time. It also the reason that super large deals in countries with unstable currencies would be done in USD

From Canada here and I have never even seen the µ symbol before in my live before this sub. Millionths is not something anyone normally deals with at all, most people never really need to go past hundreds or thousands.

Your showing your bias with that line. While you may have the computer savy and skills to be your own bank, the majority of people still boot up their computers and open up internet explorer to go on facebook. While great for the savy who want the option being your own bank is not a reasonable thing for the majority of people to do, banks offer security and incentives something that is much harder to obtain on ones own.

I think that you are forgeting the fact that for bitcoin to succed it will need more than awareness. If I told a thousand people about bitcoin and they didn't care at all it wouldn't make any kind of difference. Email was also pretty simple to implement, a few servers and some IT guys. Bitcoin on the other hand will (if you want it to become a global currency) need its own financial institutions, regulations, support chains and widespread adoption, all the while fighting against the current system which the majority don't seem to mind to much.

How heavily will this effect my ability to buy bitcoins here in Canada? I wanted to finally jump on the train and spend a few 100 on some bitcoins but if i'm gonna have to jump through a bunch of hoops then it isn't worth it to me

No you can't send tips with fiat. While this is cool, it really doesn't help me save any money on any of my purchases.

Not a fan of the SR. In my opinion all it manages to do is make Bitcoin look horrible, all someone has to do is mention that people use bitcoin to buy illegal drugs, weapons and other such illegal things and it turns them right off. But then again I'm no libertarian

See this is something I would want to purchase with Bitcoin, simply due to the general amount of regulations and laws and stuff surrounding owning these. That way I don't have a sort of paper trail leading directly to me in case of, highly unlikely event that I get in trouble

Why does this matter?

Most people can barely use Windows, giving them linux would get them no where except frustration-ville

The thing is though is that it will be pretty easy for the customer in that situation to go "they must just be stollen/shadily made/ not good" simply because of the site. All it takes is a reputation for being an intenet dark corner and the average non tech literate person will ask "am I going. Be arrested for being here?" "Is my computer going to become infected by being on this site?" And "am I going to be scammed/ sent stolen goods?"
This is coupled with the fact that perspective buyers will have to go and find a source of bit coins (a pain in the ass for those not near an ATM). Makes buying off the site more of a pain in the ass for the average consumer. The sellers follow the buyers, and if the averages buyers never show up the average sellers won't either

Almost everything you want in this post comes with drawbacks but you seem to be forgetting that. Being able to share music and other media is awesome for everyone, except the creator. Being able to drive without a seatbelt is awesome except when you lightly and accediently t-bone someone and instead of a sore neck (wearing a seatbelt) your now dealing with the other drivers death and your label as a murder. No copy right is awesome until you want to make money off of something you made. There is a trade of for everything, and people would do better to remember it

Is their anything like that available to Canadians? I like the idea however bit wage seems to be available only in the US

I doubt this will turn into the next eBay. The perception of the people will make sure of that. When they hear that people are selling drugs and CP on the site they are going to think "do I want my products associated with that?". While the people on this sub understand why this site is truly good the average person will see it as a dark shady corner of the internet to be avoided.
