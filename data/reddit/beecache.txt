I agree, I had to look it up and it seems like a legal term regarding landownership

Last post I made was about a week ago, and just now I was banned for "abusive".  Not sure if you can see my comments there but only one would be considered offensive (not abusive) that I know of.

I ran SETI way back, I think in the late 90's (not sure how old it is).  But to think how many equivalent Pentium 233mhz CPUs my Ryzen 3600 / 2080ti is equivalent to...

You can use electrum.  I simply answered the question since you didn't know.

Yes I've used them.  Yes you should contact them.

Sorry to hear that.  But can't you see that others may have a positive experience?

Because the US is already paying for it, so "they" are smart and saving money by not also policing it..

I hope your day gets better!
@_date: 2019-04-21 06:24:20
I agree with you.  Unfortunately the US has set the precedent, so it's very unlikely they will stop.

Just to clarify, almost all lightning payments pay much less than $0.10... usually 0.005 to 0.1 cents :)
You are 100% correct though, since you said "and less"

As others said, this is a bad idea and slippery slope. 
 Let BCH thrive or die on its own merits.  I'm not even sure BSV should have been delisted, but I'm not too familiar with it.  Censorship is not what we want.

I went through the preliminary claim process and see that I have a balance of like $0.12 on there.. in Fiat, not bitcoin.  Not worth the effort

You are right though, My brother has a condo in Caracas (He lives in British Colombia now) and he literally sends a check for like $0.01 to the bank in Venezuela once a month for a condo that is worth like $300k US.

Shame! ������
But seriously, I agree with you. Had I not spent *dozens* of Bitcoin on weed and LSD in 2012, I'd be retired now...  It sure was fun though :)
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:04:21


If you generated a change address (ie, didn't send ALL your btc to the other party) then you can always spend the unconfirmed change with a higher fee (CPFP).  Or the other party can do it.  What I'm saying is, it's not like your transaction will NEVER go through.  you can always do CPFP.

Nothing I say will satisfy your legally worded (loaded) question and warped definition of marriage based on contract law.  
So I'll continue being happy enjoying my 11+ year loving marriage and you can be happy doing whatever you want I guess.

On-Chain transactions always have a fee.  The block size limit is somewhere around ~2MB, although almost all blocks are ~1.2 to 1.4 MB.

Just curious why having an LLC or other business would matter.  Which country do you mean?

Excellent points, thank you for taking the time to write this!
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:59:24
I'm sorry I don't have numbers that well defined in my own head.  I'd be happy with a blocksize increase though.  But those bigger blocks would just fill up again.  I don't know lol

I can't speak for Kenya, but I've done mobile speed tests in Monrovia, Conakry, Dakar, Freetown, and Lubumbashi that all beat the best 4g speed test I've had in my home town in America.
The rural African cell network is spotty, and slower, but is mostly everywhere that people are.

Did you ever dial in to BBS servers?  My friend's dad ran one back in '94 or '96 (can't remember exactly when)
But anyway, I used to tie up the phone line every day playing **[L.O.R.D]( with about 100 other people.. my friend's dad had either 6 landlines or a T1 or something.  That was about the most fun teenage me had on a video game 
Point being, we've come a **LONG** way!!

I don't and will never understand why people are still arguing for Bitcoin to increase blocksize.  You even pointed it out in this quote.  BCH **IS** the fork with larger blocks.  We all had coins on both sides.  It already happened.  Why do you want to do it again??
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:00:28


The blocksize was increased almost 2 years ago.  The ticker symbol is BCH.  Do you not use that cryptocurrency?  Why not?
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:36:49
I think there will be periods of high usage requiring (sometimes uncomfortably) high fees, sure.  I also think maintaining the current rules including 4M block weight while improving efficiency without hard forks is the ideal path forward.  If enough consensus forms to hard fork to a larger block size, then that might be the path forward.  One of the amazing things about Bitcoin is the decentralization.  If you and I choose to fork to a 6MB block size, we can.  Maybe tons of people will follow us, maybe they won't.  It's really a fascinating subject that doesn't have black and white answers.
