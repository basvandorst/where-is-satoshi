I agree, but I also think the majority of people don't consider any of those points significant enough to overcome matthewpaul's ultra inconvenience and instability. Bitcoin is..well, impractical to say the least for newcomers. I just don't think most people really care about any of those issues.

I'll try a useful repy:
Gox is a privately-run exchange consisting of a few people in an office in Tokyo, meaning that it exists in one central location. The fact that gox is causing significant problems in the bitcoin world is actually a very good example of how *centralization* can be a problem.
If we had a large, *de*centralized exchange, the incompetence or malevolence of one small group would be irrelevant to the community as a whole.

None of the information on best practices was difficult to find and most of it was accompanied by multiple security warnings. I don't wish bad fortune on anyone in the community and sympathize with those who have lost assets but a basic understanding of the risks in bitcoin is a simple google search away.

I'm wondering this as well. If you're purchasing an item also sold from the same vendor in fiat the conversion seems straightforward but finding an actual btc-to-fiat rate seems impossible.

I agreed with most of the video and found it to be well thought out and articulate but I do agree with you on this point. We have no idea if bitcoin will continue to be volatile in the next hour let alone the next year and I think you will find that sentiment echoed throughout even this enthusiastic sub.

I see this mentioned often but does anyone know how the fees work? Because if they're just skimmed from BTC/fiat from trades, gox would only be making goxBTC/goxfiat so may not be accumulating any assets

If I wanted my identity to remain a secret, I would create multiple false leads like this that have enough logic to make a good story. Media would have a field day with every lead while speculation and confusion run wild and everyone generates massive buzz for bitcoin. Everyone loves a mysterious celebrity.
Pass the popcorn.

It's being tweeted several times/min now too so its making its way around the interwebs. Still no way to verify it other than OP's word and screenshots.

I haven't heard much about this either. I'm not sure I see exactly how this isn't reasonable to do with current CC/bank payment systems -- just add up all the micro payments until they're big enough to justify using CC/banks. I would love to kill big subscriptions and ads and just pay reasonable prices for what I actually use.

Has any coin been vulnerable to a 51% like this? It would be very interesting to watch it play out...

I thought they had lowest pool fees and that was why they had such dominance. In any case, economic incentives will drive the community more than ideology, I think. Especially as the community expands beyond early adopters.

serious question, if you're in international waters, would you have to pay taxes on this? does it count as being imported when you bring it back? I need to know...for...a thing...
@_date: 2014-11-05 13:21:33
Agreed - this is more risk than most people are willing to take and most people (outside would consider this reckless. This is a judgment call for you. 
Don't forget standard investment advice - comparing a BTC loss to starting early and compounding interest makes that initial loss much greater than the face value. Even if it only takes you a few years to recover, it can be millions by retirement age compared to tucking it in a stable investment. 
Of course, this assumes you can find a safe, diversified investment with moderate returns. This is also a judgment call.  Finding that investment may not be so clear for those of us reaching adulthood around the 2008 crash where many safe, diversified retirement funds crashed hard.

trading stopped on gox a little while before the announcement. gox's website went down right after the announcement. not sure how these are connected.

Exchanges still make a *huge* weak point for the bitcoin ecosystem. BTC unfortunately is still very limited without a reliable way of converting to fiat.

Third party, or it could just be controlled from the requester. It's not usually a huge risk or effort for someone to seed, though it may draw attention from law enforcement if the bounties are large!

Call me crazy, but I think anything could happen between now and Fall 2016. There's no reason to think it will only either fail or reach a new ATH. Hang around for a while and you might change your mind.

be sure your keys were not compromised when putting them into the word document (keyloggers, etc). thumb drives are not perfectly reliable. best practice is to write critical data (recovery words, private keys, etc) old fashioned on paper and store that in a secure location.

They're not ready for bitcoin. Or, if you prefer, the bitcoin ecosystem is not ready for them. It's still the wild west and there are plenty of people ready to take advantage of weak players. If they believe their bitcoin is of value (even just future hodler value), they should control their keys or peace out. It's really not that hard.

Agreed -- all the posts about technical skills are great, but escrow/user reputation are what will make a service like this work. Just assume that the worst of the internet will come out and exploit every vulnerability and violate all trust - because they will.

Counting a 3-day weekend, this is taking me a up to two weeks to have 0.1 BTC transaction go through despite me being verified with a credit card and approved for instant transactions -- I'm still waiting for that initial 0.1 to go through that I put in before instant came out. I put that in as a test transaction to make sure things were working before going through with more, I probably would have put a larger order in if I knew it was going to take 2 weeks until I could make more. Pretty frustrating to just sit around for so long despite being approved for instant.

Nope. Just get the wire # for your bank and that amount will go through without a problem.
