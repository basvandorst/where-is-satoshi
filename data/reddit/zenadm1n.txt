Launching the satellite was the expensive part. The latency alone makes it not worth it. It takes hours to reach stable orbit.

Decentralization to start.

I'll buy bitcoin related items with bitcoin. I'll donate to bitcoin accepting charities. But until Bitcoin tops $300 USD I won't be spending it on anything else.

I'm a little tired of news outlets using golden tokens as stock photos and video as if they represent currency. This ain't Chuck E. Cheese.

So simple a federal agent can do it!

I've worked on this angle for a few hours now, but I'm pretty sure I'm either on the wrong track or I only have a part of the answer. The solution to the previous puzzle seems a lot more complex than where I'm going.

It's in your twenties when you should be taking risks with your money and in other endeavors.

I read through those a few days ago. I've administered online shoppping carts and point-of-sale systems. I'm seriously looking at starting a consulting business to connect local businesses with Bitcoin. I would even consider doing it without any upfront payment if the revenue sharing program was adequate.

I guess you could say that they had his number.

I think it was an honest question. It's unlikely that he's from the US.  Here's a short guide:

I buy my milk from a farmer mainly because the cow is a lazy asshole and won't return my phone calls.

I still have people walk by my desk to tell me they sent me an email.

CDROM can hold about 800 MB of data. 100 MB is reserved for overhead. If you want to use the least amount of error correction use mode 2 form 2. That's only suitable for multimedia streams where a glitch or two doesn't matter.
