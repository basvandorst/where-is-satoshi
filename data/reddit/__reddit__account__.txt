That I do not know. If you bought through an exchange like Coinbase, then I believe you're not going to be fully anonymous. Likely that means the gubernment is/will be watching you.
Tax payments are on the citizen, at this point. You have to pay them yourself or risk being penalized and such. The exchanges aren't doing any of the work for you.

@_date: 2017-12-05 14:42:04
I agree, I am not an accountant, don't take my word as gospel.
That said, how could they collect taxes in the case where you just sent to a hardware wallet? Unless they would accept the payment in BTC, that doesn't seem like it would work. You never "cashed" out, so I would assume they would just need to see that you're still hodling them. That said, that doesn't mean you're not right, that's just how I would expect it needs to be done.

@_date: 2017-12-05 13:50:44
Purchases no, only sales.
If you buy some BTC and never sell it, you owe no taxes. Once you sell it, you get taxed for capital gains. 
It's more complicated than that, but that's the basics. This could all change in the future, but that's the way it is as of right now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:42:41
I think I have a unique situation.
Years ago, a friend lent me a decent amount of money, interest free. I have been slowly paying him back. Recently they got into BTC. A few weeks ago, I transferred the remainder of my debt to him using BTC.
In this instance, how does tax work? Do I have to look at that transfer to him as a taxable event? Or do I consider it some other way because I didn't make any gains on the transfer. IE, it was repayment of owed money, not a purchase of a good or service? The money is currently still in BTC, it didn't get cashed out to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:01

@_date: 2017-12-05 20:27:50
Ah yes, I was referring in relation to tax purposes.
Although on my Trezor, all of my BTC got sent into different addresses, so I guess technically I could differentiate what was sent where...

This is actually sort of the mentality I've adopted. If it all goes to shit I'm in a slightly worse off position than when I started. But if it doesn't, my life will be forever changed. That's why I've been able to hodl through some rough downturns so far, even though if I cashed out at 19k+ my life would be better off, it's not quite where I need it to be.

It didn't come out quite as nice as I wanted, but it worked. The impressions are pretty light. I think if I make another I'm going to spray paint it Black first.

I have no idea, but I am guessing you could write it off as a gift, and if they cashed it out they would have to pay capital gains taxes with a cost basis of $0. I really have no idea, this is a complete guess.

"All of these conspiracy theories of fat men in business suits trying to fuck-over the millennials is the result of living in your own angry echo chamber."
In my original question, I guess I was referring to the second sentence on it's own merit rather than in the context of the first sentence about regulation. I don't disagree with you about regulation growing out of the need to stop swindlers and crooks from duping people out of their money. But I also fully believe that fat businessmen have, are, and will continue to find ways to screw over everyone else. I might cite the current tax reform plan. Lower taxes for all, sure, great. Who is benefiting the most from these changes though?

Numerous ways. If you deposited to an exchange with a large transfer, your bank probably reported that to the government. There's situation like the link I just provided. If nothing else, it's just going to get more important to the government that we get taxed. So they're going to crack down more. Maybe eventually the exchanges will report everything and provide us the tax forms, but for now it's on us.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:18:27

I guess so? I transferred some BTC from CoinBase to Bittrex the other day and it took like... an hour?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:13:01
Oh I am by no means an expert. I just know the basics. If you're looking at any sort of appreciable amount of gains, you're going to want to hire a tax professional.
Or try it yourself like I am going to, but I don't recommend anything I do to other people. I am a madman.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:28:24
I believe that is incorrect.
If you invested $1k, and (for maths sake) BTC was at $1,000 a coin, you would have ended up with 1 coin. If the value of 1 coins rises to $5k, BTC would be at $5,000 a coin.
If you cash out $1k, you'd have sold .2 coins. 
.2*(5000-1000)*taxrate = $800* taxrate (probably 25%) so you would owe $200 to the IRS.
I think.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:17:13

Fun fact, this actually happened to me in AC once (nothing compared to this, couple hundred dollar pot) except I had the nut flush on the flop and the guy had an inside straight flush draw. I bet the flop, he calls. Turn is garbage. I bet, he raises, I put him all in, he calls. Rivers the straight flush.
One card in the deck, 3% chance of catching it, calls me on the turn.
"I had to bro, sorry. I had to."
Yeah bro, you had to go all in on a 3% chance. Nice poker playing.

Thank you for the heads up. I'm well aware that I've got to do my own due diligence, and getting advice from internet strangers is a very small part of that.
Your opinion is the opinion that I am coming to as well. I feel that the smaller stocks are going to be subject to a lot of pump and dump volatility, but the value of the coin itself would be less so. Not to say either/both couldn't up and vanish like a fart in the wind, but everything I've been reading recently makes me feel the coin is the safer bet. And a bet it indeed still is.
Basically my situation is I have a bit of money to play around with, I'm not going to lose my house/car/job/food if it all goes *poof*. If I lose it, it sets me back another couple years and I keep living the average life I'm used to, if it rockets to the moon, my life could change dramatically for the better.
EDIT: I already also have some etherium and some litecoin on Coinbase, but the more I research everything, the OG Bitcoin (in an real wallet) seems like the way to go.

I'm new to Bitcoin investing (but not new to Bitcoin, I considered mining it LITERALLY on day 0 but didn't, I didn't understand it and was a poor college kid... sigh... oh well...)  and I am curious: is there any reason to be investing in BITCF or GBTC or any other bitcoin "ETF" that's out there (that's where I currently am) or does it make the most sense to just be investing in Bitcoin directly? I am considering dumping all my shares of BITCF and GBTC and buying the coin directly.

I think you'd have to wait at least a day for the payment to post, maybe longer. By that time the money saved on interest might be less than what Bitcoin has gone up. Conversely, it could go down, and you'd be able to get more BTC when you rebuy. Fees are gonna kill you though. Seems like a not great plan imho.

from the email I got this morning
"Dear Coinbase customer,
There have been a number of developments with Bitcoin Segwit2x since our last update. No action is required and all funds stored on Coinbase remain safe. 
Last week, the Segwit2x development team announced they would no longer continue with the project. In addition, a significant portion of miners and other community leaders withdrew their support for the fork. However, despite these developments, a small number of miners may attempt to go forward with a fork.
We wanted to provide clarity about the potential outcomes of the fork and what Coinbase will do in each scenario.
To protect customer funds, Coinbase will disable Bitcoin sends and receives at 2 am Pacific Time on November 17th, and disable buys and sells an hour before the fork, which is currently predicted to occur between 6am to 8am Pacific Time on November 17th. All functionality will be re-enabled shortly afterwards.
Scenario 1: Network is unusable
If support for the fork remains at current levels or decreases, the Bitcoin2x network will be unusable. Coinbase will not support withdrawals or trading as it will not be possible to move these assets. Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.
If the network gains support at a later date, we will enable Bitcoin2x withdrawals from the platform. 
Scenario 2: Network is usable
If transactions are being confirmed at a reasonable speed and miner support is strong, we will allow Coinbase customers to withdraw Bitcoin2x. We will not immediately enable buys and sells as previously stated, but we may enable them at a later date.
We will keep customers updated through our blog.
Thank you,
Coinbase Team"

Psychologically speaking, 6500 or 6000 are the nice round numbers. If it goes below 6000, it's going to 5000. I'm hoping 6500 holds strong though.
I have no data to back this up, just my fun thoughts.

I personally wouldn't but at that amount you're going to want to make that decision on your own.
I wouldn't personally worry about a one time sub-1000 dollar gain, but if you're going to do it regularly or in greater amounts that's when I'd worry about reporting.
Obviously the IRS wants you to claim pretty much EVERY gain, but there's a whole time/effort/risk/reward ratio.

I love how much this line hits home for me:
"On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite peaked at 5,132.52, but fell to 3,227 by April 17th and in the following 30 months fell 78% from its peak. It took fifteen years (March 2015) for the index to get back to the previous highs."
I literally bought BTC at a cost basis of about ~4800. Right before the ATH of 5000. Right before the drop all the way to 3000.
So as I am reading this sentence, it sounds EXACTLY what just happened to BTC... except it stopped falling and has already blasted though the previous high. It did not take 15 years, it didn't even take 15 weeks.
Granted, that doesn't mean it won't happen still, it could, I just thought that sentence spoke to me personally.

"The reason why I need legit numbers is to convince my family mostly ! If I'd have all that money myself, It'd already be in Bitcoin !"
I read that as "I need to convince my family to loan me money to invest in Bitcoin". Maybe that was an incorrect assumption, but the advice still holds true. If you convince family members to lend you money to invest, and the investment goes sour, prepare for a lifetime of a broken family.
If that wasn't the case, my apologies. Sorry for offering you sage life advice.

I think I have a somewhat related question.
Assuming I'm selling before a year, my short term capital gains are going to be ~25%. So unless I truly think a dip greater than 25% will happen, and I can time my sell and buy to make up that difference, doesn't it make sense for me to just hodl through a &lt;25% dip?

Stop worrying about the fees so much. If you really think Bitcoin is going to gain in value like you want it to, they are irrelevant, and wasting time getting into the market will cost you significantly more than any fees involved.
If you're worried about losing a few hundred Euros on fees, I don't think you're belief in Bitcoin is sound.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:18:54

My plan is to cash out 25% when it hits $9,776, then another 25% when it hits $19,552. I will be debt free at that point, and still hold 56.25% of my current BTC. 
I hope it happens in 2018.
EDIT: This is going to be a very psychologically demanding thing for me to do, because my brain is going to keep going "why the hell are you cashing out when you think it's going to double again" but I REALLY, *REALLY* want to be debt free asap.

A: I believe so, yes.
B: You will have BTC and B2X coins in the same quantity that you had in BTC before the fork when it occurs probably on Nov 17th. A year from now, you will still have the same amount of BTC and B2X coins in your wallet, but (probably) one will have gone way up in value, and one will have gone way down in value, or have gone away completely. BTC is likely to be "Bitcoin" still, but there's always a chance it will be B2X. You will have both coins, at whatever value each coin is currently at.

I have been using Coinbase for a few months now, and I finally have a problem with them (aside from fees, but that doesn't really bother me).
Tried to deposit some money the other day, seemed like it worked, but the transaction never showed up in my "Recent Activity" page. The next day, assuming it didn't work, I made a second deposit, this time twice as much as the first day. This showed up immediately in my "Recent Activity" panel. The following day, BOTH transactions showed up in my bank account, but I still have yet to see the first transaction on Coinbase. Emailed support, haven't heard anything back. The missing purchase was on 11/08.
Still waiting to see what is going to happen, might need to reverse the charge with my bank if Coinbase doesn't respond soon...
Gemini has been much better for me personally; zero issues, lower fees, larger depost/withdrawal limits.

Did it ever get resolved?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:44:47
I believe you do, but I am new to this as well.
For math sake, let's just pretend that 100 BTC cost 100 dollars. Your cost was then 1 dollar per BTC.
Let's pretend it doubled in value. You've now cashed out $100. But that was only 50 BTC.
50 BTC @ 1 dollar per BTC was your cost (so $50). Then you sold 50 BTC @ 2 dollars per BTC ($100). That means your net realized gain was $50 ($100 - $50).
You would then be taxed at whatever rate you fall under times the $50 gain.
HOWEVER, I personally wouldn't even bother worrying for that little money. But you do you.

To be fair, the first thing I do when I come here is hit the "New" posts button, and that doesn't show stickied threads, so I didn't even realize there was one until someone posted "There's a thread stickied at the top of the forum for price discussion." in another thread.

@_date: 2018-11-08 14:50:25
It's an odd situation, because (in the USA at least) you can't ever get rid of your student loan debt, even if you claim bankruptcy. You're stuck with it forever. So there wouldn't be a situation like the retail bubble where thousands and thousands of people walked away from their home(s), never to pay another dime on them.
That said, student loan debt is absolutely MASSIVE.

This is the same question I have. I am currently buying/storing all my coins on Coinbase and Gemini, but I have a Trezor in the mail right now, and I would like to know how to get them off of Coinbase/Gemini and onto the Trezor. I've been reading and watching videos but I'm still not certain.

It is money where I can use it as money. 
Much like I can't pay for a soda in a vending machine that only accepts USD bills with Yen bills, I can't pay for my student loans with BTC. That does not mean BTC is not money.

Let's go back in time, and modify your original question slightly.
2010: "If I invest $150 into bitcoin today, will that turn into a lucrative retirement fund in 7 years?"
Answer in 2010: "Maybe, might be worth 10 million, might be worth zero."
Actual Value Today: "You would now have 1,617.7 BTC which are worth $8,600,188.7 today."
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:45:51
I would estimate you'd probably have mined somewhere between 0 and 100 coins. So $0 to $500,000 dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:50:12
What if I had invested $5000 in Bitcoin on 10/09/2014?
You would now have 13.81 BTC which are worth $79,934.7 today. This is a profit of +$74,934.7 (+1,498.7%).

Nope. Timing the market is basically impossible to do on a consistent basis, and you get hit with fees every time you buy and sell. It is almost a guarantee you will end up with less BTC than you start with.

Well if you have BTC and you own your keys prior to the fork, you'll have equal amounts of both. So if BTC tanks and B2X soars, you technically shouldn't really be down... in theory. But they won't just flop values, you'd probably be worse off in some capacity.

:( *when you wanted to buy the dip but didn't have any extra money*
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:57:26
If you're going to do it this way you have to look at it like this.
Immediately assume you will never get this money back and you will have payments for a 10k loan added to your current budget.
If you can afford the payments, and you want to take a gamble, it is STILL a bad idea, BUT go for it.
EDIT: Also, do not trade, only HODL, unless you know what the hell you're doing. Even then, probably a bad move.

I am in the process of downloading the chain now. Then I just need to get my external setup and transfer it and I'll have a full node running.

Just added 0.38 BTC to my collection, suckaaaaas!
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:41:57
I plan on cashing out 25% if I get my investment to double. Then I would cash out another 25% if it doubles again.
Then I will, presumably, only pay for things with BTC for the rest of my life while HODLing till I die.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:42:40
More like 10+ BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:39:29
I did mentally... I'm out of fiat to spend though. :(
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:01:56
It is money where I can use it as money. 
Much like I can't pay for a soda in a vending machine that only accepts USD bills with Yen bills, I can't pay for my student loans with BTC. That does not mean BTC is not money.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:56:03
There's sooooo much more to learn that I thought when I started really looking into this myself. That FAQ and other links on the sidebar really have a great amount of information that will help you understand most of what you need to know.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:51:55
Best advice? Own your private keys.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:40:15
Not from Coinbase, but there's the regular transaction fee. I think... I'm still new to this too.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:19:53
As long as it stays above 4600, I'm set.

Does HE have BTC holdings or just you? Cause that's a huuuuge slap in the face; "I just doubled my money, now YOU owe everyone lobster." lololol
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:14:05
Create paper wallet, transfer .1 bitcoin to it, print it out, physically hand it to your mum. EDIT: I know that's not what you meant, I'm just feeling pedantic. :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:00:41
Wait, I thought being deflationary was a benefit, not an issue?
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:31:16
Also make sure you are buying from Trezor directly, and not from some third party seller. If you go with a Trezor that is.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:27:42
Well, I say go for it.
Also, obligatory, don't take investment advice from strangers on the internet.

Right, that's why you're supposed to spend your BTC too...

But I was promised free fork coins that would be valuable wahhh
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:02:18
The funds are pending or your BTC is pending? My bank transfers are immediately available to use but my BTC take a while to show up.

Step one, look at FAQ.
Step two, acquire BTC.
Step three, wait a year.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:47:31
It would be an inverse of what is happening between BTC and BCH right now I assume.
B2X would soar, BTC would tank, but overall the crypto market would suffer.
That's my assumption at least. BUT that's all just conjecture because it won't happen... hopefully...
