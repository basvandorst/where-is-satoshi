I can honestly say that our code contains no malware or viruses. I know because I programmed the entire back-end and know the code inside an out. I would never intentionally abuse the trust people place in a website I build.
Many years ago we had issues with people abusing our network with unfavorable advertisements, which lead to the flagging. However, since then we've made a lot of positive changes to our filtering process in order to remove the bad eggs before they hatch, so to speak.
Again, there is no harmful code anywhere on the site.

Unfortunately, I'm not a sales person, just a developer. If you send us a message through the forms on the site or call us during normal business hours, I'm sure someone would be more than happy to answer those question.

Sure thing. I completely understand you're concern for security too. Please let me know if you do actually find anything malicious.
Have a great weekend yourself!

Greetings fellow Bitcoiners! My name is Brian and I'm a web developer from eZanga.com. Today we went live with our new website and I wanted to let everybody know that we now accept Bitcoin for our online and telephone advertising services. We also pay people who want to advertise on their own website(s) in Bitcoin!
We're partnering with Coinbase to make this happen and have already been mentioned in a Wired article discussing Overstock's first day with Coinbase and Bitcoin. Read the article here:
Personally, I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin and can't be more excited to have a project I've been working on for a year go live. Especially with support for Bitcoin! If anybody has any questions I'll be checking in throughout the night/weekend and I'll try to answer what I can. Also, let me know if you find any bugs!
Thanks!
