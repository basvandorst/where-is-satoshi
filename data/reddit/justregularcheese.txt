I honestly don’t know enough about the ins and out of VATs and costs past down through businesses. But what I do know is that automation is coming to take a very large percentage of jobs in the coming years, and UBI is the best way to help people through this. Is your problem with the idea of UBI itself, or how it is funded?

Same in my experience, and I believe people should work. I just honestly don’t believe there will be enough jobs in the future for everyone. Anyone who can get jobs, most likely will regardless. 1000 a month is peanuts and not a great amount to live on.

The tax is 10%, which is not a very high vat, and is actually rather small compared to most countries in the world who have a vat (most countries in the world have one). As his main policy is to give everyone 1000 a month, someone would need to spend 120,000 on goods with vat added to them for this to not benefit them. As for possible loopholes, I can’t answer on that but I imagine Yang has looked into it and it is not a problem considering all his policies are very data driven.

It is certainly not an incentive not to work for most people. Unlike traditional welfare, you can get this while working. 1000 is just above the poverty line in most places and not a great amount to live on. 
The main reason to implement this isn’t to help the poor, it’s to help all the people that will inevitably lose their jobs to automation in the next few years. Millions of people will be laid off and unable to find new work. Traditional welfare is very bureaucratic and inefficient, and is definitely not enough to survive on for most people. Do you have a better solution for all these people who are going to lose their jobs? (It has been estimated in a study recently by mckinsey that 1/3 of Americans will lose their current jobs to automation by 2030.
Also, if you have looked into him in any way, you will realize he is not your typical politician.

Between 14-23% would be roughly the same level as there VAT payed in Europe, so I see no problem here. Yang has also previously said that many consumer staples will likely be exempt or have lower vat levels in future, while luxury goods will have higher levels, therefore not hurting the poor as much.
Cost of goods and services will most likely increase slightly, but competition will keep prices down. Purchasing power will still increase for 94 percent of Americans. The only way this vat will be decreasing your purchasing power is you are very wealthy and spending lots of money each year on goods and services.
Obviously low unemployment would be ideal, but this simply isn’t feasible for the future with automation. It is estimated by several studies that by 2030 30% of Americans will lose their jobs to automation. That is the main reason Yang is even putting forth UBI, to help these people who will be out of work. 
I’ve googled and I don’t know what you’re talking about with these VAT tax loopholes. From what I understand VAT is virtually inescapable and is added whenever a business transaction is made. Do you have any links to websites talking about it?
VAT gives the government a dangerous amount of information? The American government already has a ridiculous amount of data and information, VAT would not reduce your privacy as you already have virtually no privacy. If the American government wants to know something about you then they will have no problem finding it out.

I’m a member of this subreddit. People started bashing Andrew Yang, so why shouldn’t I defend him?
Maybe that’s the problem is it? That you are ‘to’ educated and know that your job is safe so you don’t give a crap. Honestly, how else are people going to survive when their job gets automated away in the coming years and there won’t be enough new jobs to fill the gaps. Most retail, driving, call centre and other low skill jobs will be taken. Do you have a better plan for these people?
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:16:36
VATs typically have a 50% pass through rate, which means that half of the vat is payed by the consumer in raised prices, but half is shouldered by the business. Nonetheless, everything will be more expensive yes, but you also have an additional 1000 a month. You’re purchasing power will still rise.

Several studies have predicted an amount of around 30% of American jobs to be automated by 2030. If you believe these studies are exaggerated that is fair enough, but I don’t.
New jobs like the repairing the machines will certainly pop up, but not nearly enough to replace all the lost. 
Moving more people into construction and trade jobs is definitely what’s needed to help combat this, it is part of Yangs plan. He intends to increase levels vocational training and people going into these jobs. But this will benefit younger people mostly. Like I said, retraining programs have shown to be that ineffective. Can you really imagine a 50 year old trucker being hired and retrained as a plumber?
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:41:10
Fair enough.

“A September 2017 study by the Federal Reserve reported that the top 1% owned 38.5% of the country's wealth in 2016.” 
“The top 10% of families held 76% of the wealth in 2013, while the bottom 50% of families held 1%.”
A quick 2 minute google search. Is that enough research? If something isn’t done to combat automation the wealth inequality will get much worse. 
You need to do more research on the effect automation will have on employment in the coming years.

There is honestly no point in arguing any further with someone who thinks the fear of job loss due to automation is ‘ludite’.  What new jobs do you expect the likes of 40/50 year old truckers and retail workers to take up? Most of the low skilled jobs in America will disappear and retraining programs have been shown to not be effective. AI fears are most certainly not overblown. I don’t know what age you are, but as long as I don’t die young, it will be definitely be an issue in my lifetime.

I’d be all up for banning automaton, but sadly I can’t see that happening. Never in history have humans banned progress and more efficient ways of the doing things, and there is no current politician  that I know of talking about banning automation. If there was I would vote for him.
There is certainly enough rich in the world. Wealth inequality is insane, no one needs as much money as Jeff Bezos and the likes. Maybe VAT would not be the best method to pay for UBI, that I’m not sure of. But I believe it is needed.

It will largely be payed by taxes on big companies such as amazon through a VAT. A lot of the money given out will also re-enter the economy through people spending the money, so it doesn’t cost as much as it seems. He explains it very well in his joe rogan podcast, or you could read up more about it in his website.
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:17:37
Yeah I get you. I definitely see what you mean and do agree now that the advancement in technology should be welcomed. I’m not sure if the sure of the studies think it into consideration. but I doubt it. Regardless of the benefits that bounce back into the economy from this, I still believe the net effect on employment will be largely negative.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:34:00
I really don’t understand your position against taxation. Income inequality at this moment in time is ridiculous and lowering taxation levels would just make it greater. You’re acting like Andrew Yangs policies would hurt poor people, when in fact it would do the opposite.
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:38:00
Phrased that badly. I meant more in the sense that unless already fairly well trained, why would workers hire them over as apprentices instead of fresh young employees. Also a lot of them well not have any applicable skills.
Don’t really understand what you mean? Who has this disposable income. I’d be guessing the companies who brought in automation, but don’t see how that affects other categories of work.
