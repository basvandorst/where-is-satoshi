Thank you for supporting Erowid. This is an invaluable resource for harm reduction and drug education.

Yeah, it did a great service getting people into the cryptoworld but how much more development is actually occurring with Doge? I could just as well use Stellar for very fast and almost free transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:36:05
I agree with this sentiment and am partial to the idea of BTC-core acting as digital gold. 
It's fantastic that so many alts were developed. The ones with the greatest proven utility for their individual niches will survive. Capitalism at its best. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:15:48
No, because evidently it was a massive sell wall that manipulated the price on coinbase. No one was actually buying it at that price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:08:44
My point is that the HODL slogan has become aggressive and childish at this point in time. People can hold, sell, or do whatever they wish with their crypto. We don't need to be reminded by 100 people each day on this subreddit to hold onto their crypto property. Generally, this fad has coincided with a general degradation of discussion on this subreddit - a trend I hope to see soon reverse. I'll try my best by participating in technical/application related discussions and through submitting relevant media to the above. Cheers~
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:14:40
You're illustrating my point perfectly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:16
Bitcoin cash trading at +8k before coinbase went down. It was trading at around 3.5k on Binance. Major Arbitrage opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:40
hehe. crazy times eh
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:58
Dude. These types of comments don't help. The whole HODL thing is becoming childish at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:02:59
Hi, I haven't seen this asked yet so I would like to inquire about how this affects the electricity usage of the bitcoin network. Does it at all? Or, are there other developments currently underway to tackle the large electricity usage issue with BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:38
Not everyone needs to hold. People can exchange bitcoin for other currencies or do what they want. It's become annoying at this point tbh. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:01:48
hahaha. Early mining with GPU's used to throw out so much heat. I remember heating my room from the exhaust of my quad R9 280x rig. (multipooling) 
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:30:05
Lol maybe in places like Berlin but Germany really lags behind when it comes to using cards in general.... let alone contactless. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:20:55
if bitcoin sponsored a racer and both of these coins raced against each other it would be fucking awesome. 
It's so ridiculous it could change everything. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:23:46
The organization has contacts in the UK. Is it possible that I could send bitcoins to that contact and they could then utilize bitpesa to send the money to our Kenyan recipients? 
@_date: 2014-07-29 12:49:37
I had posted a question before about the feasibility of something like this to send funds to a nonprofit there. It's a shame this platform isn't supported in the U.S. it wasmentioned I could use a VPN to set an account up but I have little experience with that (although I'm sure I could figure it out in time.) 
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:20:43
This is exactly what I am looking for; unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be supported in the United States. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:47:53
Love the concept of bitcoin- have been following its development since 2010 but never hopped on board until I figured out mining thanks to some other crypto communities (I bet you can guess which one). Anyway, I have long since converted all of those holdings into bitcoin as I see it as the gold standard in the crypto movement. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:44:19
Thanks for this information, I'm going to pass this along to some people at a youth center I worked with that have been trying to figure out how to receive donations without incurring countless fees. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:49:45
I have worked with a number of development non-profits in Kenya and can confirm that M-Pesa is huge there. One area that bitcoin can help with though is transferring money to institutions abroad without incurring huge fees. Even organizations that help you donate to causes abroad usually take money and/or have to pay taxes by the host countries government. The problem with Kenya is I don't believe there is an exchange there to convert Bitcoins to Shillings.

Excellent website, I donated some LTC a while back but will donate some btc soon too. &lt;3 the vaults of Erowid
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:10:33
I'll try this out. I'm guessing if I do something for 500 bits it will send to me right? How long does it normally take? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:31:41
anycoindirect makes you do this now. I actually need to send them proof of residency and stuff like this. 
Maybe I should just try bitonic.nl now. Hmm, bitonic allows you to pay with Bancontact or iDeal. Neither of which I have. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:32:06
every country is doing this to some extent 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:45:50
OK so, you need to upload an ID, passport, etc. 
This is not under a minute :/

The HODL thing is one of the dumbest things that keeps being regurgitated on this website.

post of the day 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:04:43
These aren't only for Bitcoin though. Again, what makes Bitcoin so special then? 
It's the faith that people have in its value. This is what drives people to continue mining it. It's not being used a currency for the most part and is trading like a commodity now.

Certain sources should just be banned from being submitted to this subreddit. They are so obviously twisted and biased that they contribute nothing to a legitimate conversation about Bitcoin or the Bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:24:38
So what you are saying is if I get a friend to send me the wallet.dat file from my old PC I can put it on my new computer and then sync from there? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:52:45
BTC from 2014... Fork was last year right? I suppose the mechanics are the same for the next hardfork planned, correct?
I appreciate this info man. It's strange to me that there isn't a stickied guide on this in the subreddit.. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:56:26
Diversification is key. I also would echo your sentiment that r/personalfinance is a fantastic resource for people looking to learn more about finance and money management - despite their occasional bitcoin skepticism.

Hi, for those of us that held the BTC on an offline wallet, how would we go about getting our Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:21:25
Is there a service like Myetherwallet but for bitcoins? 
I feel like downloading a private key and storing it on a USB somewhere is the safest bet. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:34:14
Question. I have held bitcoin in a cold storage wallet since since 2014. Do I also have Bitcoin cash? 
I didn't realize that the hard fork before basically gave people BTC e while keeping their BTC. 
Hmm, can someone post a link or care to explain to me how to access the BTC-cash? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:49:53
Hi, this is helpful but I was wondering if there was a guide your followed or more background information. 
I would like to do this but want to make sure I don't screw anthing up. 
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:49:37
But first it is important to move the BTC over to a new wallet, correct? 
I imagine giving your key to a new wallet is risky. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:44:06
Hi, I'm also interested in this process - specifically in how to go about getting Bitcoin-cash when one already holds BTC (from 2014). 
I have tried searching and came across this thread but no guides or anything. 
Can one of you post a link or guide me in the right direction to more info? Thanks
