Is this a human responding, or a bot?

Bee See Aych has had this function for well over a year via Purse(dot)io.
Transaction fees are a fraction of a penny, instant, and you can choose your discount, as the 'earners' value Bee See Aych over fiat. For each part I ordered on Purse(dot)io, which is just a port to amazon prime, I saved between 18-28% (up to 33% maximum, but it's peer to peer; don't be a dick).
Maybe 8 months ago I built out a pretty nice desktop for my wallet on Purse(dot)io: tower, motherboard, CPU, power supply, DDR4 RAM, 1080ti GPU, and peripherals (monitor, mouse, keyboard, speakers).
I paid $1500 for a $2200 build buying individual parts if you bought them on amazon.
purse(dot)io, discounts ranging from 5%-33% (and you decide) for literally anything you can buy on amazon.
Highly recommended. Bee See Aych is accepted.

I encourage you to research Blockstream's relationship to AXA, and AXA's relationship to Bilderberg.
Central banks and governments are terrified of blockchain technology.
They will do anything in their power to stop it.
Do your own research, my friend. We are on the same side.

To each their own, no pressure, but I do encourage you to read up on the owners of Blockstream.

Hmm.  
Try some combination of 'AXA', 'Bilderberg', and 'Blockstream', and do your own research and reading. 
I espouse nothing but informed individuals coming to their own conclusions, and I trust rational individuals will do just that.
You might be alarmed, but I insist.  
I -Insist-
We are all on the same side.

Tell me about your last few BTC transactions.
I would love to hear all about them. 
Did you save roughly $700 USD fiat by using BTC?
Try it,  man. It's what bitcoin was always meant to be before central banks saw the threat and Blockstream hijacked p2p, frictionless transactions. 
If you don't like it,  don't use it. 
But do try it.
