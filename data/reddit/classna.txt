Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

Pakistani here.. Why not go for traditional "Hundi" method? it won't cost you too much in fees and is not through Bank or Govt channels so you will not have issues of capital control. Bitcoin is currently not the best option for you because of volatility and the local exchange is not big enough to liquidate such funds at this point. Secondly, you seem to be quite new to bitcoin and will most likely mess things up if you choose to go this route. I would be fine with small amounts but 50k is not something i would trust bitcoin with.

I would like to use it as my email app or my net banking app on my smartphone where i don't need to know what a private key or multisig is. Seriously, I have a computer background and when i first started using bitcoin, i installed the bitcoin-qt wallet and waited days for it to sync. i didn't even knew where are those private keys that everyone was talking about. Circle and Coinbase made it a bit easy but those long public addresses are scary as hell. For bitcoin to be used by average joe, it needs to be as simple as facebook, gmail or paypal. Stop confusing people with technical terms like private keys, multisig, elliptical curve and shit.

"The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that Bitcoins are 'just data'. But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs).
To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the 'ledger' of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the 'accounting entries' in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient for global transactions.
And this is why bitcoin is important! It is the first from of money in the world that is both decentralized and digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold and more private and transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking. This is why people are excited about bitcoin, it has the potential to completely revolutionize money.﻿"

After being let down by bitstamp and mtgox because of their crazy verification process and the higher fees of BTC-e, i turned to Bitfinex. They don't ask for verification if you are just day trading and their fees are lower. Plus there are no fees for withdrawals of BTC and LTC.  Thumbs up (y). They still need to improve the user interface because i found it difficult to look for your order history and an option to hide the bitstamp orders if you are not using it.
