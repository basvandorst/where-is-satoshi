man I went to uni there 20 years ago. That northern quarter was always a bit cool. 
I remember buying CD's out of some shop there. Great memories. Nothing to do with BTC.

Everyone is here to make money? We're certainly not here to lose it.

Maybe, maybe it'll be worth zero soon. No-one knows. 
Blockchain tech on the other hand is the future, whether it's in Bitcoin or not.

The SEC aren't about to approve a Bitcoin ETF. Yes it's possible but only when certain conditions are met. 
First of all, full regulatory control. So no more pumps, dumps, buy walls and other price manipulation. That is the reason every time for saying no. 
Secondly investor protection. It's not clear how this is going to be achieved with so much bitcoin traded outside the US. 
Do people here really want all bitcoin markets regulated? Cos that's what it's going to take to get an ETF through in the US.
