Yeah, Bitcoin needed scaleability solutions two years ago - and many temporary ones were available even if another layer is required.

Assuming you pay a high enough fee and do not use the RBF bit, the gym can safely assume payment within seconds (as soon as the transaction propagates through the network) without waiting for a confirmation.

It gets confusing if you don't specify.  There is a 'Bitcoin' idea, but several implementations.

An improvement to the network is sorely needed when comments like this ring true.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:54:00


Why do I have concerns?
* Reusing a lightning channel will reveal information - how public is this? similar to a credit card statement?
* How many lightning channels will be required for an individual? what happens if a channel cannot connect to someone else?
* How much money must be tied up to own/open/maintain a channel, it seems a bit prohibitive
* How are lightning hubs organized?  Will there be choice and can I switch hubs quickly and for a low price?
Why is having a discussion hard?
* Certain forums take down posts that go against a certain message

I used $21 a couple weeks ago and had to wait a week for it to go through.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:15:03
But other crypto currencies are offering both (or a middle ground if you take into account their chain is not as secure).  It seems bad if lightning transactions are too insecure - that is - if you have to resync with the blockchain (fees/congestion) to be secure.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:45:37
Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin just before the SegWit fork happened.  It increases the block size as a scaling solution where as the lightning network + segregated witness is another solution.

@_date: 2018-09-17 16:22:29
When Bitcoin was on-chain only, to use it, you just needed to download a wallet (to your phone) and you could receive and then send Bitcoin anywhere.  You had the keys and for the light-weight phone client, you only had to trust the network/node you connected to give you proper information and relay your transactions.  The only third party involved was the relay node for the light-client.
Now when you get a wallet, how do you receive your first coin via the lightning network?  Do you just trust the LN node that 'comes with' your wallet?  Does it matter much if you just use the wallet's LN node?
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:56:57
It cannot be Spam.  Every (valid) transaction has a fee, if that fee is acceptable (accepted), it is a normal transaction.  This is what decentralization looks like.  If 'Spam' is a problem, that crypto currency has a problem.  Bitcoin dies not have that problem (but had had a scaling problem since the second layer wasn't ready before the blocks filled up).
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:33:29
I'm not trying to make a semantic argument about what 'spam' is.  I'm trying to argue that if valid transactions cause real problems, then there is something broken with the coin.

The QR code has error correction.  So losing 1 pixel (or even a few) is ok.  I'd suggest having multiple wallets (each a copy of the other) in case one breaks.
And be sure to check their working status every so often!  You do not want to find two broken wallets in 20 years.
Also, if it is only the screen that is broken, presumably you could buy a replacement screen.
My cold storage plan has an electronic _and_ paper copies to hedge against such issues.

There is no guarantee.  Generally you pay a minimum fee per 1KB.  Transactions with more inputs/outputs (or fancy verification rules) are larger.  I found a nice summary of the general rules, but cannot find the URL at the moment.  This site has a long and complicated explanation: &lt; including a paragraph about no fees at the bottom of the page.
The real answer is every node on the network can decide to forward (and miners decide to accept) each transaction.  If not enough forward/accept yours, it could be dropped from the network.  You could then resend the transaction and hope it goes better or send a new transaction with a fee.  Note that you can do both at the same time.  Odds are the transaction with the fee will be processed the other one will become invalid and dropped from the network quickly.  This is dubious if you send the non-fee transaction to someone else because it will fail if there are not enough funds after fee transaction goes through.

This is what you get today when you join a pool.  And _you_ could form 'small' pools with others who think like you (or join one of the big ones) - the problem is that ASIC miners are so efficient, it is not worth your _normal node's_ electricity to mine.  You would lose money by trying.


Always the challenge to find the balance here.  The best outcome I can imagine (beside benevolent dictator) is a set of large groups competing amongst each other.  Each would not be able to make a major __bad__ change without alienating most of the population (which would go to the other groups) and each group would want to make a major __good__ change as to draw the population to their way.  The hope would be that this would be the best outcome for the Average Joe.

Cold storage is the storing of the private keys always offline and signing all transactions offline.  You own your keys, and if you screw up, your money is gone.  There are 1001 ways to screw up.
I'd strongly recommending using a trusted third party (Circle of Coinbase) to store your money.  They also allow you to transfer money from your checking account.  I would keep your bitcoin there until you are much more familiar with what you are doing.
I say this as a computer engineer who has some Bitcoin in cold storage and some at trusted third parties (because I do not trust myself).

If one organization controlled the mining, they could control the fees charged as well as execute a 51% attack.  The general consensus is that 51% attacks are not a large threat because it is (much) more profitable to mine and collect fees with your hashing power than it is to execute an attack (or even several).
But to a larger point, I think many people in the community would join an altcoin (or abandon Bitcoin) if there was too much control under one organization.
__TL;DR:__ IMHO I don't think the community would let this occur gradually and if some large entity turn on 99% hashing power overnight, that would kill Bitcoin.

Agreed about microtransactions, but that is not a core problem, you can run a node that accepts 'lower than recommended' fees.  If enough people do, it will catch on.  But you do have to worry about spam.
10 minute confirmation times is a non-issue IMO.  All transactions involve some risk and for 'normal' transactions (those under $300), waiting 20 seconds is more than enough.  See [Finney Attack](

Last I heard, Coinbase is not an exchange, rather, they are a service on top of an exchange.  I'm not sure how often they go to the exchange (surely not once per transaction, but maybe multiple times a day).  I know during high trading days, coinbase has run out of coins for a few hours.
In general, they float a lot of Bitcoin and dollars so they can process transactions quickly.
Having said that, if you buy something for $324.99 dollars (in BTC), they will hold on to that Bitcoin until someone buys it.  If overall, they can only sell _some_ of that $324.99 in Bitcoin, then there is a surplus of Bitcoin and the price goes down (as it has been).
To try to answer your question: are these the 'whales'?  Probably not.  Their transactions on the exchanges (done privately) are likely the 'same' as everyone elses transactions, just larger.  I.e. they are not making bets against the market.

As far as I know, no credit card company is willing to partner with a Bitcoin exchange.
I know &lt;coinbase.com&gt; uses Visa to verify - but you cannot buy Bitcoins via your Visa card.

Really, the argument tends to center around semantics.

If you can make a smart contract, then there is no escrow - or rather, it is implicit in the contract.  The transfer will only occur when the correct input conditions exist (i.e. everyone puts their money in the right place then 'zap', atomic transfers)
If you wanted to set up two transfers (i.e. I give you 2 BTC, you give me 400123 flappy coin) - each must be aware of the other at the time of writing.
Then input each transaction onto the network.  Once the smart contract transfer sees the other one, it can authorize itself*
\* And the other will authorize itself - but be careful the other one cannot cancel itself after the first authorizes.  Atomic transfer is required.

Overall, very nice, but I would not recommend that everyone do their own cold storage.
While it is true that _if you don't have the keys, you don't own the bitcoin_, if you make a mistake with your keys, you'll lose your bitcoin.  So you have to evaluate the risks of either way.
My opinion is that people new to Bitcoin should not do their own storage, but rather trust an insured third party (with 2FA).  If they choose to learn more, they can always move their cold storage out.
Never forget, you are always trusting third parties.  If you use a Trezor, you trust that they do not leak data when talking to the computer.  If you use Bitcoin Library X, you trust that the random numbers it generates are secure.  And many other failure points along the way that you trust to not fail.
@_date: 2014-08-23 03:11:11
I haven't done much trading, but presumably all you need is an input address to send coins to, an output address to receive other coins and the price.
You'd need to be able to send coins back to the original wallet (or alternatively, have a 'refund address') if the order needed to be canceled for any reason.

As others have said, a single source of information may be wrong (just as a miner can produce a valid block that will NOT be part of the longest chain).

_Why would you trust someone when you have a system designed to be trustless?_
Because they can do it better than I can.  What are the chances of them screwing you vs. you messing up your cold storage (bad RNG, forgetting passwords, bad passwords, fire...).
I'm not suggesting cold storage is bad, I'm just saying it is really hard.  What is wonderful about Bitcoin, is that people _can_ take the time to work at cold storage and do it themselves.  __I just do not like people spouting out 'third parties are bad' without covering the complex issues of self-management.__

Two factors at work here:
* President's day was Monday (and transfers do not 'progress' over weekends/holidays)
    * The should tell you when the transaction is expected to complete
* Until you have completed your first transfer, you cannot initiate another one.  After your first transaction completes, you are only limited by the daily buy/sell limits.

What is your financial system?
If you live 100 miles from the electrical grid, but can charge a cell phone via solar power, you may have no financial system, but you could use Bitcoin.
If you need to transfer money across borders, Bitcoin allows you to do this with minimal fees and delay*.
\* Today there is not much you can buy in Bitcoin, so you have to convert back to/from fiat on either end which does still introduce fees and delay.
If you are a first world consumer, it allows you to buy a product WITHOUT giving a business (or anyone close enough to watch) the full authorization to spend your money (i.e. you give a business your credit card numbers and trust them to only take out the right amount).
__TL;DR:__ At the end of the day, if/when Bitcoin catches on, you will not _HAVE_ to use a bank, pay their fees, trust them to hold your money (or wait for one to exist, as is the case for a large percent of the world's population).
I personally believe there will be a 'banking system' on top of Bitcoin, but it will be optional for an everyday user, just like an online wallet is optional today.

I've had an issue with this before.
When you submit your transaction (via their wallet), you first send it to them.  They add it to their internal structure/network _and_ to the Bitcoin network.
For some reason, once it took a few minutes for other nodes in the Bitcoin network to see it.  I'm guessing they have some sort of internal queue to the network that was just backed up.   Or perhaps they had a bug and it took them a bit to resolve it.
But this only happened once.  All other transactions through them have been disbursed to the Bitcoin network instantly.

Once you watch/read _some_ information, I'd get started with some actual bitcoin.
Getting Bitcoin takes a bit [read: days].  But I'd go with &lt;coinbase.com&gt; in the United States.  Once you finally get your coin, get a wallet on your smartphone and find a place to spend it.  You can also try &lt;localbitcoins.com&gt;, don't get stabbed in a parking lot though.
Then read more later (or while you wait for your information to verify/coins to transfer on coinbase).
If you believe in Bitcoin's future success, I would invest some money in it, but please research cold storage solutions before buying too much.  __Never buy more than you can afford to lose__.

Agreed.  I cannot believe so many "free market" people are against this idea.  If this is what consumers want, someone should provide it, for a fee.
More to the point, lending is important, especially when buying a house.  Fractional reserves allows others to earn interest on their savings.  Such a Bitcoin bank could still have proof of reserves, indicating how much money is being lent out vs. in reserve.
With Bitcoin, it is __purely optional__ whether you work with such an institution.  This is less easy in our current financial system.
Terminology may be bogging down a valid discussion.  Central bank == insurance (as pointed out) seems to be the crux of Mr. Mu's argument.  I do agree the usage of "Central Bank" is inaccurate, but should not preclude a valid discussion.

You have to store them somewhere, here are common options:
* Trusted third party (like a bank)
* On your computer/smartphone
* Cold Storage
A trusted third party, like changetip, circle, coinbase, with 2 factor authentication (2FA) is very secure and easy.  This is like storing your money in a bank, they secure your coins and give you easy (but authorized) access to your funds.  The problem with this is that third party may go under, lose your money, etc (see Mt. Gox).  Coinbase and Circle are both insured, but if they go under there is no guarantee you'll get your money out.  I recommend using circle or coinbase if you are a beginner (so no, do not use cold storage).
Storing your bitcoin on your computer/smartphone is nice and easy and you actually hold the money.  The downside is that any virus can steal your money!  Also, if you lose your phone, someone may be able to steal your funds.  I'd recommend keeps _some_ money on your phone, just as you only keep _some_ cash in your wallet (for convenience).
Cold storage allows you to completely separate your funds from the internet.  It is not hackable and you have full control.  The bad news is that it takes a decent amount of time to set up and maintain.  Spending from cold storage is non-trivial too, especially if you want to keep addresses 'cold'.  Also, if you lose your cold storage device, your coins are gone forever.  The most simple cold storage device is a paper wallet.  To create one, you need an always-offline computer connected to a printer and a wallet printing program.  Your cold storage device can be encrypted or not.  If you forget the password, your funds are gone (or if you die, your loved ones cannot get them).  There is also a hardware device called a [Trezor]( that attempts to do everything cold storage related for you at about $120.
_When I say "xxx stores your funds", I actually mean xxx has the private key, the thing that signs transactions.  This is mostly a minor point_
TL;DR: depends.  You can shoot yourself in the foot using cold storage, but if done right, it is the most secure.

My answers assume you are in the US.  If not, replace USD with your native currency.


The government cannot.  And more to the point, if you instantly convert Bitcoin donations to USD, you do not have to worry about Bitcoin going belly up (government involvement or not).


That depends on how you are receiving Bitcoin funds.  How do you (would you) report donations from a cash box?  Bitcoin is the same way.  You should use the value of the Bitcoin in USD as the time you 'cash out' or convert to USD.
As far as giving receipts to donors go:  If you just put an address on a webpage, this is similar to a cash box.  You cannot give receipts *.  I would recommend generating a new address for every donation - that is, when you send an email/letter to a donor, give them a unique address to donate to.  That way you can track who donated how much.
\* technically, the donor to the universal/single web address could sign a message saying who they are, then you could give them a receipt.  The donor could do this on the transaction itself, which is public, or they could send you a private message.  All of this is quite technical though.

It depends on how you define 'currency'.  Being an American, any currency I use should be stable and accepted everywhere.  Bitcoin offers neither of these today.  So I personally do not consider Bitcoin a currency _today_.
I do use it as a medium of exchange, but buy Bitcoin when I want to use it.  Thus I can use Bitcoin in this way without worrying about its volatility.
I have a separate pool of Bitcoin I use as an investment.  Without people investing in Bitcoin, the price would be quite low and people may not use it at all.  Speculation increases awareness, which increase its actual utility.  As its actual utility increase, Bitcoin gets closer to its 'goal'.
This appears to be the only path to the goal.  We need people like you to start to use the currency now, otherwise it will never reach that goal.  This does involve some risk, but nothing a little bit of reading won't fix.
When many, many more places accept Bitcoin and the price stabilizes greatly, I'll use it as a currency just as I use the USD today.  That is, start to spend my investment pool of BTC rather than adding to it.

While I agree Trezor is probably the best option (if your funds justify the price), a third party creates it and you must trust them to do it correctly.  Just because you hold it in your hand does not mean it is intrinsically better than an online service.

Mt. Gox failed to implement a workaround for a Bitcoin wallet issue.  So they closed their exchange to fix it (that is what they've said, at least).

It is very, very, very bad for an exchange to close and they've had previous troubles filing the correct paper work here in the US of A.  People don't trust Mt. Gox as much/anymore.
That is why their price has fallen.  The price of Bitcoin in general has fallen for many complicated reasons, including this and Russia lately - and possibly from nervous 'investors' - enter speculation.

But this only takes seconds [\[1\]](

If people could answer this type of question accurately, there would be no Wall Street.  But people love to speculate!


Unencrypted wallets.  Followed by ones encrypted by bad passwords.  Bad passwords are short, contain quotes from published works, etc.  Wallets that are stored on a computer connected to the internet are inherently more available to hacking (but that is ok if they are encrypted properly - i.e. encrypted offline on a non-hacked PC).


Ones stored offline or ones encrypted with good passwords.  Do both for the most protection and only encrypt/decrypt offline.


Finding a good exchange is hard and takes time to get set up.  I use [Coinbase]( here in USA.  Get comfortable with a wallet app on your Smartphone.  I use [Blockchain.info's wallet]( on my Android.  Store only as much money on your phone's wallet as you'd be comfortable carrying in cash.

I'll answer by telling you what I'm doing about it.
I gave some Bitcoin as gifts for Christmas.  I gave a small amount in addition to other gifts and told the receivers what Bitcoin was about.
When I need to exchange money for a product/service with a 'smaller party', I ask them if they accept Bitcoin (no one has accepted yet).
I talk to coworkers about it.
I'm trying to get my wife to accept it at [her BeautiControl business](
_How_ to talk about Bitcoin is a bigger challenge and one that I have not mastered yet.  I usually start by calling it internet money and follow up with 'low transaction fees' and 'you do not give out your key to spend it' (i.e. credit cards).  I also mention that it is very volatile and that I treat it as a risky, binary investment as far as storing money in Bitcoin.  For context, I live the USA.

@_date: 2014-12-29 15:48:52
That depends on the wallet you choose.
If you are unsure of what you are doing, I'd suggest using circle.com or coinbase.com to store your funds (use two factor authentication (2FA)).  You are trusting them with your money, but they are insured.
The core/reference code creates 100 addresses and stores those private keys in a file on your computer.  You can (and should) back this up (but not leave it where hackers can find it).  Other wallets 'seed' a base address and generate all other addresses from this.  You only need to store this one seed/private key.

I tend to agree, but feel there is room for alt-coins that serve a niche market.
Generally, adding more and more features is not a good thing as it make things complicated and bad (yes, even if everyone does not have to use the features).  And yes, those are purposefully vague terms.
I foresee a simple crypto currency with 90% market share long-term and dozens (well, tens of thousands) of smaller crypto currencies that serve a very select group of people in a unique way.
Here's hoping the 'one' crypto currency is Bitcoin.
p.s. we have this sort of thing today: each store has its own giftcard, online games often have their own currency, but they are are related to the dollar.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:31:18
Many people (the majority as it would seem) agree Bitcoin is that solution.  I do not feel your criticisms of Bitcoin are unique to Bitcoin - i.e. how is anyone going to propose an altcoin that governments are not going to bad?  How are you going to assure individuals that their funds will not be stolen AND maintain their privacy?  How are you going to avoid volatility?

@_date: 2014-12-05 23:01:49
Agreed, but you need dozens/hundreds of these transactions for each merchant to encourage the spread.
In other words, it will take billions of dollars, not $100k.  Separately, it is impossible to buy billions of dollars in bitcoin at the moment (or even millions, to some degree).
TL;DR: we are still in the bootstrapping phase and progress will be made slowly until something 'clicks' and the scenario described above is not a significant event.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:21:20
My opinion is that they make everyone look critically at their own Cryptocurrency.  If an altcoin points out a flaw or lack of feature in Bitcoin, Bitcoin should consider implementing such a feature.  You also don't want your coin to suffer from feature creep though.
At the end of the day, if altcoins are bad for Bitcoin, there must be something wrong with Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin cannot cope, the market has spoken.
I do predict that in 5 years, Bitcoin will hold 80% of the cryptocurrency market share and several special altcoins will serve niche markets, but not compete directly with Bitcoin.
I also like [Dogecoin](  It brings some lightheartedness and fun to cryptocurrencies.  I do think Dogecoin is a fad; I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

I'm not even sure how you regulate Bitcoin without regulating other forms of money, such as Target gift cards, facebook bucks, Warcraft doubloons, etc.
Focusing on the US of A: I can understand regulating the point where you convert USD to/from Bitcoin on a large scale (i.e. an exchange) and possibly businesses that store Bitcoin - ensuring their cold storage is proper, etc.
No regulation means that a large entity can abuse trust without immediate repercussion.  Similarly how Mt. Gox is not being punished by any (Japanese) federal agency.  Litigation would always be available, but that is slow and costly.  _I'm not saying this is bad._

While open source is a great step forward, it is not feasible for everyone to read the code themselves, much less _really_ understand it.  This is similar to becoming a medical professional, you just cannot.
And for those who can read and understand code (especially crypto code), mistakes do and have happened.
If you go with an insured third party, they manages these risks for you.
Which brings you back to "What is the most likely way for me to lose by bitcoin".  This is hard question to answer.  I look forward to many solutions in the near future (including open source cold wallets, hardware devices and third party services) to help clear the air.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:59:25
There are multiple ways to go about this.
The first is just to sign a normal loan and use bitcoin as a medium, you can do this today.  If someone refuses to pay, you have to go after them with collections/lawyer, as today.
Another way is to actually code _something_ support the loan + interest.  This can be done in various ways.  A simple(ish) example is to have an address to repay a car loan where the car itself would check that address to make sure the loan payments were on schedule before starting, etc.
A way to (in the future) encode data into the blockchain would be to store collateral in the blockchain.  Say the title to your house is stored on the block chain.  The bank starts out with 100% ownership, each payment you make moves a small percent of the ownership into your account/address.  After full repayment, the title would be 100% yours.  If you were ever to take second mortgage out, you would transfer a portion of your share to that bank.
You cannot, as far as I know, code this directly into the blockchain transaction, as funds to repay are not available when the amount is loaned out (the whole reason to have the loan).
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:11:14

No.  Paypal does the same thing, as do Checks and money orders.
What he appears to be saying is that 'checks came and went' and presumably 'paypal will come and go', and he is saying 'bitcoin will come and go'.  Just because Bitcoin is more efficient today, does not mean it will be in the future.
I believe the point Mr. Buffett is missing is that __Bitcoin is NOT just a way to transfer funds__.  He said "It is dollars on both ends" - which is largely true today.  But Bitcoin will have its own value when there are not dollars on both ends.
The price today is largely speculation that it will not always be dollars on both ends.

This is not necessarily true.  If you keep your private keys yourself, you may have them stolen to your own ignorance/negligence.
What is nice about Bitcoin, is that you do not have to trust a third party, but you do have to trust someone.  And if you are 'new', a third party has a better chance, IMO.

* I like the 'form of communication' description
* _Anyone can accept bitcoin as payment, and no one is forced to accept it._ is a great line too
* I do not like the "Comparing with ordinary money" section
    * The "tax" point seems unrelated to the primary purpose of the document
    * The "power to a small minority" point is also a potential shortfall Bitcoin too \*
* The "Here to stay" seems to argue technically why cryptocurrencies are here to stay, there is no assurances Bitcoin will the one to succeed.  I'm not sure it adds anything to the document, but perhaps it could be reworded.
\* My rant:
In general, I think Bitcoin supporters seem to gloss over this potential problem with Bitcoin.  It seems very likely large corporations could/will gain a large influence over Bitcoin.  While it is 'democratic', it is weighted to those who hold more power.  Thus those who hold more power will gain more Bitcoins, and thus more power.
Sure, people can abandon Bitcoin if the 'powerful' greatly abuse the majority of users.  But history has shown this is very messy and often times painful for everyone (though easier than when fiat money is involved).  More to the point, history also shows that those in power can _slightly abuse_ the masses for profit, but not to the point of revolution.
I am of the belief this will be the long term result.  Bitcoin will do all the wonderful things it promises; people who have control of it will make their gains (such as Wall Street does today), for the most part we'll be better off and hopefully they will not screw the pooch.

I would store 100 BTC by:
1. generating a truly random number on an always-offline computer (private key)
2. carefully copy this __unencrypted private key__ to bank safe deposit box (via whole computer, paper, or SD card)
3. optionally copy this unencrypted private key elsewhere safe
4. __encrypt this private key__ with a very strong password
5. __share this encrypted private key file__ with everyone (but not the password, of course)
This has the benefit of allowing my funds to be accessible (via unencrypted private key) if/when I pass away as well as if I forget the very strong password.  I can also get my funds without going to the bank if I remember my password (and have access to another always-offline computer).
That was for one address, just repeat if you want multiple addresses.

This is a valid point, but not a logically sound reason as to why Bitcoin has failed.  You could have said the same thing about Paypal, but they succeeded just fine.  Every day more places accept Bitcoin.  That is a logical argument for Bitcoin.  You _could_ argue not enough places are and certainly if places stop taking Bitcoin every day...

__Transaction hash != transaction ID.__
There is no quick way to ID a transaction in this respect.  One way to confirm a transaction is using its hash, but the transaction may be complete under a different hash.
__The actual funds transferred cannot be tampered with__ due to the signature which cannot be falsified.
It would be similar to sending an encrypted message through the mail.  Someone could take it out of the envelope, put it in another envelope and deliver it.  If you are looking to ID the transaction by envelope alone, you would not confirm the transaction, but the contents _are_ delivered and cannot be tampered with.  This is not a great analogy, as regular mail is not copied to all mailboxes and someone can rip up a regular encrypted letter!

Consider hosting a Bitcoin node.  This will take you some time, having no computer skills.  This does not help spread Bitcoin itself, but helps with reliability.  In general, read up on how Bitcoin actually works.  Knowing how computers and communication is secured is very important 'these days'.
Carry some Bitcoin with you on your SmartPhone and ask people if they take Bitcoin as payment.
Without computer skills, it is hard to work directly with Bitcoin.  I.e. a self employed job could be offering to get local businesses hooked up with Bitcoin.  Eventually, it may be an option for your paycheck at non-Bitcoin businesses, but that seems to be a ways off.

It depends.
Mostly it depends on who controls which (mining) nodes.  Say 'Company X' owns 20% of the mining hardware.  If they shut off a portion of their devices, the hashrate drops, but that company can turn their machines back on at any time.  Nothing has changed, nothing is more/less secure.
If 'Company Y' owns 45% of the mining hardware and other miners shut off their hardware such that 'Company Y' now owns 51% of the mining hardware, they could perform a 51% attack.  Though it would be in their best financial interest to keep mining vs. performing an attack.
So I would say 'Technically Yes' but 'Practically No'.  There are also other factors to consider too.  Every node in the network adds to stability (possibly correlated with security), even those that do not mine.

To me, offline storage should NOT be encrypted.  If you encrypt something, you might as well share it with the world.  (Make sure you encrypt offline though).
My plan is to diversify, that is, to divide my holdings into:

* Unencrypted paper wallet stored in a bank safety deposit box
    * I'd prefer to use a wallet like [Bither]( to spend from an always-offline-device
* Encrypted copy of that address shared everywhere (I remember pass phrase)
* [Warp Wallet]( with pass phrase in safety deposit box
* [Coinbase multisig vault](
This allows me to spend any of my coin without going to the bank and if I forget my passphrases, I can just go to the bank.

As far as security goes, Bitcoin uses cryptographic hash functions that are also used to protect fiat money today.  [Source](
Mining algorithms are slightly different - based upon how much memory is needed to mine.  The more memory, the harder ASIC becomes.  The larger question is, what happens when 'block finding' is controlled by a very few and very large businesses.
* Is this bad?
* Do altcoins have a better approach?


I am not qualified to answer this question, but it is important.


They seem reasonable - especially since the chance of losing a transaction once it appears on the network is so low a vendor can accept it with no confirmations for low value purchases (i.e. coffee).


It seems like it wills scale: see [discussion here](


IMO you have to give early adopters a significant advantage or a currency cannot get off the ground (well, unless you have guns behind it).  _How_ the early adopters start to spend their investment will help shape the future of bitcoin.  If Satoshi Nakamoto sells all of his coins to an exchange one day, assuming that would even be possible, that would be very bad for Bitcoin.  If he buys houses, jets, chicken, etc. to places that keep Bitcoin (rather than transacting it directly to fiat) it would be very good for Bitcoin.


I think this is a paradox ;)


This is possible, but there is so much invested in Bitcoin, I have faith Bitcoin will adapt and include new _needed_ features while other altcoins will coexist that offer niche features that only a minor of users require.


I believe this is actually good for Bitcoin.
If banks use Bitcoin, but keep it proprietary, this is not much different than our current system (i.e. credit card system, ACH system, google wallet, paypal etc...)  Nothing changes in this scenario.
But if they build services __on top of Bitcoin__ it will help Bitcoin go mainstream.  Sure, users would pay their 3% for transactions (one way or another), but it could be easy.  Hard-core users would skip the fees and maintain their own money.
__TL;DR__ yes, I think Bitcoin will adapt all _nessissary_ changes, but discussions like this need to occur so Bitcoin is examined critically and updated appropriately.

In general, I agree, but for the most part, securing your Bitcoin requires 'new' thinking.  People have to develop a common sense about digital security.

Google makes their money via online advertisements.
Take Chrome for example.  The other browsers increased their features and HTML5 is here sooner because of the competition Chrome brought.  (Just count how long it took IE to get tabs after Firefox showed how good they were).  And more people are online clicking on ads.
Therefore, my opinion is that Google will use Bitcoin or their own digital current - Google Wallet in which ever way allows for users to click on more ads.
I also don't think Google will release their own crypto-currency.  They have not reason to have a decentralized currency; they'd want to be the authority of it - i.e. Google Wallet.

I'm not sure how the blockchain is typically stored, but once transactions are in the chain, they are final.  This makes them easy to copy to your database.
It seems in either way, you'd need a separate database anyway, so keeping 'extra data' on the blockchain may be bad.  Having a separate process to look up some data is going to lead to wasted time.  Also, transaction data is fairly small, so where to keep it is fairly unimportant.
Also, if you lose the passphrase, all of your customer's data is now available to the world forever (not that someone hacking your database is any different).

Generating keys offline does not guarantee they are safe.  If the randomness to generate the key is bad (bad hardware, bad software, bad human) they can be cracked.
If multiple transactions from the same address are signed offline with bad randomness, remaining funds are vulnerable.
[Edit]: also, if you lose your cold storage device, you funds are also (effectively) gone.

IMO, you have to weigh the chance of you screwing up vs. a trusted third party screwing you (intentionally or otherwise).
It is very easy and safe to use Coinbase (or Circle, etc) with 2FA to store your coins and they are safe and insured.  But if that third party goes under, your coins are lost.  Alternatively, there are 101 ways to lose your bitcoins by storing them yourself.  For 'beginners', I strongly recommend using third parties (or multiple, in case one goes under).
I also consider, what happens if I die unexpectedly, can my family get to my bitcoin.

There is a difference for _most people_ though.  They grow up locking their doors, keeping their wallets in their pants, calling their bank when goofy charges appear on their credit cards, etc.  This is all 'reasonable' to them.  Knowing what antivirus to choose and which programs are safe to download (oh, look, shiny mouse cursors, _click_) is often times an unreasonable expectation.
We need new solutions to these problems.  Education is often (or so far) not sufficient for many people.  And if you think _those_ people deserve to lose their money, Bitcoin will have a hard time catching on.
We need the __only__ option to be the reasonable one.  Just as the only option when buying a house is to get one with locks on the doors or buying wallets the fit into pockets (or purses).
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:01:55
Their job is to keep Bitcoin safe.  Presumably they do this better than you.  You have to trust them, though.  They trust you based on receiving a password and code response sent to your phone (or however you have 2-factor authentication).
If they 'go under' your bitcoins are lost.  If you keep your bitcoins in cold storage, but make a mistake, your bitcoins are lost.
As far as Blockchain.info vs. Coinbase or Circle, there is not really a difference.  Coinbase and Circle are insured, I'm not sure about Blockchain.

When a transaction hits most nodes in the network (occurs in seconds) with a proper fee, you can consider the transfer complete.  At this point there is some risk of a double spend, though.
A double spend occurs when you then make another transaction to the network spending the same money.  Only one of those transactions will go through and it is the first one received by the miner who finds the next block (that is, from their perspective).  It is hard/unlikely for this miner to get the second, bad transaction and process it first.  So if you are just selling coffee, it is worth the risk to give the coffee without waiting for verification.
On top of all of that, it is also possible that two or more miners find a block at the same time.  The there will be two chains.  The one that gets longer first will 'win', but until then, it is unclear which transactions are verified.  If you wait for 60 minutes, on average there will be 6 blocks mined and almost a 100% chance the longest block chain will remain the longest.  Wait this long if you are selling a car.

Have you signed into Coinbase at a public computer (or even your work computer) or have you had your home PC hacked?
~~One tool I cannot find to help answer those questions is a log of sign in events on Coinbase.  Google and Yahoo have such logs that document what IPs (and timestamps) sign in events occurred on.  Presumably this log would track API access as well.  This feature is needed IMO.~~
EDIT: I finally found it (took a while to load) - you can try this link too: &lt;
1. Sign in to Coinbase
2. Click 'Account Settings' on the side
3. Click 'Security' Tab (See 'Active Sessions')
4. Click 'View Details' (I had to wait 30 seconds for the page to load)
I had two sessions signed on - one from two months ago.  I'm not sure what that was about, but only my current session was 'active'.  It did allow me to sign out of all others.

In Bitcoin, I can send you money and you cannot take any more.  This is because I sign the transaction with my private keys.
With a credit card, if I send you money, you can take as much as you want.  This is because you sign the transaction with the credit card number + security code (plus real signature from time to time).  My analogy was that your credit card number is effectively the private key to your credit card account.
EDIT: hyper inflated currency/USD: USD may be hard to get/store (if nothing else, they can be robbed and are easily visible).  Bitcoins are less so.  But I am not an expert when one currency is harder to get than another.  And -50% beats -1000% any day!

I agree.  _Needed_ features should be added to Bitcoin.  But which features are needed and which only help a very small portion of the population and add complexity to the whole is a difficult problem to solve.
Presumably if _needed_ features are not introduced to Bitcoin, another crypto currency will take over.  I hope this is not the case, but would support another if it was clearly better.

`Time to wait = (value of transaction) * (time to find a block) / (block reward)`

If you want money put into your checking account, this cannot happen too quickly, because of the current banking system.

* __Average citizens of first world countries:__
    1. As a risky investment!
    2. A way to stick it to the man!
    But you cannot _yet_ pitch it as a currency that is usable today as the price is volatile and it is not accepted in very many places.  Hopefully by the end of 2014 this will be a different story.

As a beginner, I would suggest an online service/wallet.  &lt; and &lt; are both insured and appear to be the best at the moment.  While there is a chance these businesses will screw up, there is a chance you will too.  Many people will recommend you do your own cold storage and not trust anybody else, but until you can trust yourself, there is risk there.  For reference, I am a software developer and I still have much of my bitcoin at those two websites because I do not trust myself.
This problem will fix itself soon, devices like the Trezor and other apps will start to appear.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:24:51
Yes.  Right now the average is under 2 transactions per second.
This will require a 'hard fork', or another way to say it, a new version of the protocol.
The main reason for the 7 TPS is actually the _size limit_ of the block the transactions go into, to avoid spam data.

__Ok, how do you know [Distributed, autonomous computing is very important] ?__ This is somewhat similar to saying (before the internet took off and we have the services we have today) _why is the Internet important?_  I believe distributed, autonomous computing is important because it __lowers the barrier for entry__ on providing a software service and distributing it.  It __cannot be censored__.  It is __fault tolerant__ - this translates into $ savings.  It will progress the sharing of knowledge, provide marketable products and help the worldwide economy making everyone's lives a bit better - as the internet has.
__How can they be the best player in this market if they have no product?__ I've read [their whitepaper](  I am a programmer myself.  They have beta code.  All of this has convinced me (which is what the OP asked) that Ethereum's solution is valid and will be the best, at least short term.
__What is your evidence?__ See my answer above.  If I had real, hard proof of any of this, I'd bet the farm on it.  And if I had that proof, you could bet it would be too late for most of us (including myself) to invest.
__...violates an understanding...__ Simply put: there is a limited __supply__ and if Bitcoin becomes mainstream, there will be enough __demand__ to push the price much higher than it is today.  Thus you should buy now.
Running some numbers:
If 1 million people in the USA use _only_ bitcoin, they would receive $50k/year [1]( or about $4,000/month.  Lets assume during a month, you cannot cycle money (that is, you cannot earn a bitcoin, buy X with it, have X's supplier get paid, who pays their raw producer, who pays their employee); that is, $4,000 for every citizen must be in 'circulation'.
Thus $4 billion of money is required by those 1 million people.  Divide this by total bitcoins and you get 
$190/BTC.  Now, if 10 million people use bitcoin (in the way described above), the prices goes to $1,900.  When you factor in worldwide usage (even moderate) and Bitcoin not in circulation (hodlers, lost coins, etc), $10,000/BTC seems very reasonable.
Forgive the poor terminology, but I think the logic is there if my assumptions hold and I was clear (big if).  For those outside the USA, $1,000 is one thousand dollars, not 1 dollar with three digits of accuracy.

There are many people in the world without a bank but with a cell phone.
There are many people with a bank/western union that have to pay high transaction fees to send money on a regular basis.
There are many merchants whose profit margin is a few percent.  Reducing transaction fees is desirable.
Though for a stereotypical American, there is not much benefit.  This is largely due to the fact there is almost no repercussion for having your credit card information stolen.
My hope is that if merchants use it, it will eventually become as big as Paypal in the US and much bigger in the rest of the world.

@_date: 2014-02-27 19:29:17
Some of those attacks are more valid than others.  My responses:
1. No one (well, most people) are not arguing it will replace any G20 currency.  As far as comparing it to gold/silver - it has many properties that distinguish it - namely being able to transfer it anywhere in the world instantly.
2. This is purely anecdotal and has no logical foundation.  Yes, there is a chance Bitcoin missed a key feature and it will not implement it.  But then we just switch to another cryptocurrency.
3. The current monetary system is too complex for anyone to understand.  But everyday activities (like swiping a credit card, and then paying off that credit card) are easy to understand.  Bitcoin is like this too.  Using coinbase and their smartphone wallet goes a long way for an average Joe.
4. There can be many safeguards.  But people are not used to these yet.  I think this is your most valid point.  I look forward to many 'easy' solutions to this problem.  I am working on one myself.

Those parts may be compromised, just as open source software can have security holes (intentional or other).

@_date: 2014-10-22 13:19:00
I would say so.  Even today, merchants take risk when accepting money for goods immediately.  Credit card charge backs are one example.  So to expect merchants to take some risk has precedent.
As a merchant, you also want to wait for the transaction to saturate the network.  Imagine someone buying food and submitting two transactions, one to the restaurant and one to his other wallet/address.  If this guy submitted the 'first' transaction to a node near the restaurant and the other transaction to a node across the world, it is feasible that the other transaction would be the first transaction in a blocked mined across the world.  Thus the restaurant would want to wait enough time to verify two transactions were not submitted near enough in time that a mining node could mistake the ordering (from their point of view).
As far as I know, transactions saturate the network within seconds.  This is different than the Finney attack as the network is aware of both transactions before a block is mined.

As stated, there are many ways to interpret the word 'fork'.
This is what I understand, someone please correct me if I misused my terms:
The simplest is a protocol version 'upgrade'.  All unupgraded nodes would just drop 'new' packets/transactions.
If most people upgrade, the 'fork' occurred successfully.  If not, the fork failed.  Anybody serious about forking should find some way to get the consensus of many node owners (including miners).

Because it is distributed, there is delay.  You cannot do anything instantly and everyone sees events happen in different orders.  The blockchain is the order and is only updated once every 10 minutes (on average).  10 minutes is plenty of time for everyone to catch up.
Also, to avoid double spending you generally do not have to wait long.  Only about 30 seconds for hundreds of dollars.  See [Finney attack](

While that is true, it doesn't break the protocol.

If two miners produce a block at the same time and your transaction is only in one of those blocks, it may appear as confirmed until that block is abandoned.
The longest chain of blocks is the official one.  Your transaction should be picked up in a block soon.

If it is truly random, large (lots of entropy) and stored in your head alone, you are fine.
If you have it on a sticky note or it is your birthday (or Brainwallet), etc.  Less so.
Do remember to back up your paper wallets in case they start on fire.  If they are truly encrypted well, you can share the encrypted file with everyone and you'll never lose your money (unless you forget your password).

This depends where you live.
The IRS has declared bitcoin a commodity - such as a stock.
Thus any time you buy/sell you should report your gains/losses on your taxes when you file.  This can be done pretty easily with software out there, you just need all of the addresses you've used.  Punch them in and the computer will tell you what to put on your taxes.
It does not appear Bitcoins are subject to sales tax when you by them, though this will vary by state.
Now, this is not quite the rules of other currencies.  If you buy $500 in euros for vacation, the IRS is not interested because you are using this money as money, not an investment (and you spend them soonish).  If you buy $20,000 in euros, hold, then sell for  a profit (or loss) as an investment later, the IRS is interested.  It is up to _you_ to decide how this works (within limits).  As far as I know this is not quite how it works with bitcoin though.

I use Blockchain's wallet on my phone to 'easily' spend Bitcoin.
If you are an investor though, you will want some kind of [cold storage solution](
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:20:39
You can use a tool, like [BrainWallet.org]( offline to generate transactions of cold storage addresses.  Then move the signed transfer back to an online machine and submit it to the network.
If you wanted to use a smartphone for cold storage, I'd recommend the following steps:
1. Wipe the phone (factory reset)
2. Turn of all networking (cellular, wifi, bluetooth, etc)
3. Transfer over your wallet/tool __carefully__
4. Create your sold storage data
5. Send funds to your private addresses (via QR code)
6. Wait to spend cold storage without fear of hacking until you need to spend some
7. Generate a transaction on your phone and transfer it to the network (preferably via QR code)
I left out 'backing up cold storage data' - the more you back up, the less likely you will lose your data on your own, but the  more likely someone else will take your coins.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:33:45
No you cannot.  If they manage your keys, your funds are lost.
Coinbase does have a fairly nice solution for this: &lt;  You keep two keys (only two are needed to spend) with the idea one of those keys is stored really securely, so securely that you may lose it/forget the password.  That is why coinbase also keeps a key.  Thus you have an easy key, and so do they.  If coinbase does 'stop', you do need your 'super secure key' though.
Oh, you also have to trust them to keep your 'super secret key' encrypted with your password and to not remember the unencrypted copy.

Most of those questions depend on the [client/wallet you are using](  Which wallet are you using?


If your program stores your wallet encrypted - if you have to enter a password to launch the wallet, then yes.


I'd recommend having long term storage and easily accessible wallets.  
Keep most of your money/investment Bitcoins in [cold storage]( just like a __savings account__.  Keep some money in a client wallet on your PC just like a __checking account__.  I'd recommend an automatic backup service to backup all your files, including your wallet.  Keep very little money on a wallet on your smartphone just like a __billfold__.
Note, you can use an online wallet.  This allows you to use the same wallet for all your money - I would not recommend this, but you don't have to back anything up.

First some background: when a transaction hits the network it moves from node to node.  Each node can decide on its own to forward it or not.  'Proper' transactions will be forwarded.  Likewise, nodes that mine may include 'Proper' transactions in their next block.  A transaction is accepted as soon as it is in _thee_ blockchain.
All of that gets more complicated because the order of events is different for each node and _thee_ blockchain is not known until much later (even the six block confirmation is not 100% assured, but it is good enough).
Now to answer your question.  A proper, pending transaction may dropped only if it is a double spend.  When you initially see a transaction, it is either the first of a double (or more) spend, the second.  If you see that it is the second, you know it is invalid and you will drop it/refuse payment.  If it is the first, there may be a second double spend transaction.
Thus you want to know, what are the chances there will be a second transaction (double spend) and what does it cost the crook to pull this off.  One way is for the crook to send out two transactions at the same time, but to different parts of the globe.  Then there is a 50/50 shot a minor across the globe will take the 'other' transaction as the 'first' one.  If you wait a bit, you'll see the second transaction get issues and you can refuse payment.  The time for a transaction to saturate the network is within 10 seconds.
If the crook has his own mining operation, he does not have to publish the second transaction and can attempt to mine it him/herself.  Then you have no idea until the next block is mined.  Then you have to know what are the chances the crook's miner will get the next block (this is where 51% attack fear comes from).  This situation is described [as a Finney attack here](

I'll add my two cents.  You have two 'attacks' to worry about:
1. Theft
2. Forgetfulness
If you properly encrypt your private keys, you can share them (encrypted) everywhere, but do not forget your password.  If you leave them unencrypted (simple paper wallet) do not lose them.
Generate all private keys offline either way.  I'd recommend using a raspberry pi, but a Linux live CD is cheaper.

We cannot.
In your situation, all the miners could agree to this, but all the consumers and banks and businesses built on top of Bitcoin would have to support the fork.
If the miners are the only ones who fork, the difficulty would drop sharply and others could start mining, thus supporting the existing/non-forked network.
A larger issue, IMO, is a conglomeration of "miners, banks and businesses built on top of Bitcoin" could conspire to cheat the consumer - similar to how Wall Street makes their gains, often at the expense of Main Street ^TM.

This is true, but unhelpful.  The most useful analogy is that your private key is the coin though technically inaccurate.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:48:25
You can sign a transaction with a private key without sharing that private key.
Anyone with the public key (which is also the Bitcoin address*) can verify it was signed, but cannot forge the signature.
Thus if a thief found Mt.Gox's private keys, they could transfer Gox's coins to the thief's address(s).  Now we would need the thief's private keys to recover the money.  This is what happen when the FBI busted the Silk Road guy, they got his private keys and now they own the Bitcoin.

Yes.  They are the bitcoin miners/the block chain.
Mining a new block issues a certificate.  The work done to mine that block is 'hard'.  And each block is based on previous blocks (this is the block chain).  Thus to forge a new block chain is really, really hard.
On top of that, Bitcoin's value is similar to Silver's value in that people agree what it is worth and nothing more*.  The blockchain keeps you from counterfeiting Bitcoin and the lack of Alchemy prevents counterfeiting silver.

Collisions happen with a probability of [1 in 2^160]( every time an address is 'created'.

Agreed, but what is the cutoff?  Or better asked: what is the risk of a non-confirmed, fee-having, transaction dropping from the network?  I'm not worried about double spend attacks.
Specifically for amounts for $100-$500.

I believe there are two solutions then:
1. Print your own paper wallet offline using a trusted program.
2. Convince a Bitcoin exchange/bank to offer you a physical note.  They keep the private key corresponding to that note and will transfer you the Bitcoins when you present your note in person.
While the second option appears to be your original question/answer, I do not feel it is a good idea.  To implement such a system, you'd have to have a physical branch near most of your customers.  A physical branch is very expensive and I don't think there is a customer base to support such a need.  Right now, the US Postal Service is looking into Bitcoin as a service.
At this time, they appear to me to be your best bet.  They are looking to expand services to increase the utility of their physical locations.  If you are not the only one with this want/need, they seem like good candidates for such a service.  But the reason the postal service is branching outward/closing physical locations is precisely because digital trade is so useful.  Which brings me back to 'this is not a good idea' IMHO.
P.S. If you come to my house, I'll issue you such a note.  But you have no reason to trust me.

[Zerocoin]( attempts to make an even more annomous crypto currency
[Ethereum]( attempts to add much, much more functionality
[Litecoin]( simply offers a different mining rate and algorithm
Each time you add a feature to a system, that system becomes more complex.  IMHO an easy-to-use system is worth a lot and will catch on much faster than seemingly better, more complicated systems.  I predict a simple crypto currency, Bitcoin, will keep market share and there will be several more complicated crypto currencies that offer enhanced features, but do not compete directly.

As someone said, supply and demand.
For a while, the supply keeps increasing, thus lowering the price _when you ignore other factors_.  This assumes people are not [losing Bitcoins]( too quickly.
As Bitcoin catches on, the demand increases, thus increasing the price _ignoring other factors_.
But the _combination_ of those two factors (which are very generic to begin with) is what sets the price.  __This is very complicated__ and no one can say what the price will be.  Thus no one can explain why the price won't slowly decrease in value.
I personally believe the utility of Bitcoin will increase demand faster than supply (coins) enter the market.  Thus I am holding Bitcoin as an investment.

The gizmodo story should just serve as a warning to not use the API key.  The key is disabled by default, so if you tell your Mom to use Coinbase, she should be ok.  This has nothing to do with Bitcoins credibility.  I personally use Coinbase without an API key and two-factor authentication.
The BusinessWeek article went more in-depth into the risks of having a decentralized currency, namely, if someone knows your private keys (be they raw keys or wallet/exchange credentials).  But as the article pointed out, there are business opportunities in providing a more traditional authentication system.
Either way, I did not feel either article called Bitcoin's credibility into question.  Even so, Bitcoin must stand up to scrutiny.  And right now the largest thing I can say against Bitcoin is that it is hard to get into and keep your money safe.

Circle itself does not charge fees.

No, not immediately - in fact, they likely are driving down the price.  For every $1 (in BTC) spent, those companies convert to USD.  Thus someone has to buy back that $1 in BTC or supply increases (w/o demand increasing) so the price goes down.
Now, some people (myself included) buy their bitcoin back right away, but not everyone does.
But new people do buy bitcoin every day - partially because of these large companies accepting it.
Speculation has placed the value of Bitcoin higher than 'what it should be' \*.

Anywhoo, all I'm saying is that coins have been mined for a long time (all time, actually).  If anything, the steady supply increase is the only constant.   Yet we've seen price spikes and drops.
And I'm still curious - how much (as a percentage) of your BTC have you sold?

By this logic, any alternative currency (i.e. paypal) is impossible.
What you have described may be true, but not the whole story.
As businesses start to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, the word spreads, speculation increases price as the price lowers due to the interactions you described __and the chance of that business being able to buy its supplies in Bitcoin goes up__.
If that chance does not increase fast enough and speculation  becomes too low, then yes, Bitcoin will die.  Stated even simpler: if demand for Bitcoin drops to zero, so does its price (as its supply would then be plentiful).

They manage bitcoins (including 'your bitcoins') internally, off the block chain.
I.e. they _could_ keep all coins at the same address, and just have a spreadsheet internally that keeps track of how much each customer owns.  This is not too far off what actually occurs.

3. Overhead/fees
4. Return on investment (Bitcoin itself does this though)
5. Convenience and all other features

In general there is nothing stopping this, just as online sites will hold you coins like banks hold your dollars.
You would lose some benefits as a consumer, namely privacy.  To this point, a citizen of the USA does not need yet another credit card type (Visa, Paypal, etc.)
As a business/lender, you cannot cancel or issue charge backs as credit cards do today, so you carry more risk.  Now you could run your own network with/next to bitcoin (coinbase does this) and solve some issues, but that is not really anything new.
If bitcoin does take off, I'd expect many services that mirror what the first world financial institutions provide today, but congruent with bitcoin.  My hope is that these will be more optional than credit cards and bank accounts are today.

I do not think it can work as you cannot prove you destroyed a fiat note.  Also have the problem how to 'sign' new crypto currency coins in a way that cannot be replicated.
OR you trust all ATMs to do this, and then the ATM manufacturer is the central authority.
But yes, if you could prove destruction and only generate cryptocoins with fiat destruction...

Exactly - because of all the nice services on top of it.  You can even run your own email server securely without too much effort/understanding.
Bitcoin is not at that point yet, but will be soon.
Biggest difference, IMO, is that to transfer data between email and other apps (like MSWord) is fairly easy (though if you remember back, you couldn't always copy and paste an image into an email).  Getting bitcoin to/from cash is harder and has more legal implications than email data (though MP3s prove this is not always the case).

At the moment, not really.
And it is very easy to 'mix' bitcoins (i.e. I give you some, you give me some, repeat many times with many people) so at the end of it, everyone would have a few 'stolen' bitcoin.
Also, what constitutes stealing?  Just 'cause someone _says_ they are stolen, anyone could make that up too.
_TL:DR_: no, and there will never be a way to completely enforce this.

The opposite actually.
Today if a bank loans you $100k for your house, and you pay $1000/month.  30 years from now, your last $1000 payment is worth a fraction of what it when the loan was initiated due to inflation.  Interest makes up for this loss.
With Bitcoin, they could charge interest AND paying back the last 1000 BTC payment would be worth much more than the first 1000 BTC payment.

The reason the price is what is it is now is mostly speculation.  If everyone who is holding coin sells in one day (or even a month), that would be the end of Bitcoin.  But I (and I expect others) to slowly start to spend their investments after the prices rises and becomes stable due to the utility of the currency.  That is, when I spend my _invested_ Bitcoin, it would have a high chance of staying in the network and not going to an exchange to be traded instantly for USD.
P.S. I am ok with spending Bitcoin to places like Overstock and Tiger direct today, even though they exchange directly for fiat.

In general, once a private key is on a hot device (scanned, in memory, etc) you should spend all money at that address as it is no long cold storage.  And if your hot device is hacked, your funds may be ~~transfered~~ stolen before _you_ hit send.

Then I have to find TWO people I can trust (and the bank has to trust the third party too).
It is a fine idea, but that is one per person to pay a fee to for the transfer.  Also, the way coinbase base works, they do not have a pending bitcoin transfer on the network when you buy.  While they mark your transfer as 'pending' during ACH transfer, the bitcoin itself is available somewhat instantly.  So there is still time for me to send them money and for them to get all of their coins hacked.

I would NOT print it out at university/coffee shop - though you'd probably be ok, there is no guarantee.
Best practice: use an offline machine (i.e. Linux Live CD) to create your private keys.  Save screenshots or text files of private keys to your USB drive.
Then you should be ok as long as your USB drive is ok.  You can always copy your data to TWO USB drives.
To spend you money, you should connect your USB drive to another offline machine, generate a transaction, copy that transaction to yet another USB drive and input that transaction on a live machine.

If you have cash to spend, I'd recommend buying Bitcoin soon.  I have no idea if it will go below $500 or not.  I'd be surprised, but Bitcoin is surprising.  Long term, I think the price will only increase on average.

You could say the same about email way back when.
This is a true statement today, but companies and startups all over are working very hard on this problem.
Just as most people do not run their own email server, most will not want to run their own node, or even manage their own cold storage.  Bitcoin is a job creator.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:12:03
I disagree.  If it is encrypted (and encrypted offline) you should share your wallet to everyone on the net.  Then you'll never lose it.
But yes, never use an unencrypted wallet on an online-computer - not for your cold storage.  Only keep enough local/easy that you are ok with losing it if your PC/phone is hacked.

Crypto currency and paper don't really mix.  You can print your keys on paper (which you explicitly said is not what you are looking for), but those keys have value off of the paper - someone can easily take a picture of your paper and access your funds.
I'm not sure what _your paper_ does?  Presumably it would be well made and hard to counterfeit (like a USD $100 bill).  But then what are you exchanging it for?  You can already exchange a $100 bill for Bitcoin.
I'm very unsure of what you are looking for.

The 'official' Bitcoin source code is controlled by a small group of people.  You can learn more about them here: &lt;
Their 'power' come directly from Satoshi Nakamoto who handed them (Gavin Andresen to be specific, IIRC) the source code and keys to the website, etc.
So far, everyone has agreed to use their source code or at least the protocol outlined in their code.  The group also produces a bitcoin client along with the protocol.  Other clients have to update their code when the protocol changes.
If enough people disagree with the 'core developer's' latest code, they can/will stop using bitcoin, use the previous version or fork their own code.  This is similar to the altcoins that exist today (except for they are the minority at the moment).
__TL;DR__ Satoshi Nakamoto picked a guy, and the community is ok with it so far.

You would need to use a new address each time.  I.e. read your brain wallet at address A, spend some coin to address B and the rest to address C (which is protected by another one of your Brain Wallet keys).  Thus address A is empty and the rest of your money is at an address (C) whose private key has never been on a computer that is online.
EDIT: you could also create your transaction offline and insert it into the network after sneaker netting it back to an online PC.  I am unaware of any tool that allows you to do this.
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:36:47
Part of what you are asking is either impossible for insecure.
If you want many of your recipients to respond, they would need to do this in a standard way.  If there is a standard way, then anyone with the address you entered could/would respond.  I see what you mean by order number, but this may be hard to synchronize/standardize.
P.S. If you are just worried about typing in the wrong value, address (in Base58 - the most common format) have a checksum built in.  All wallets check to see that the address is valid before sending.

What you are doing does not sound safe for 'cold storage' (i.e. a lot of money).
I'm not too familiar with your setup, but what you can do is this for cold storage:
* Have an off-line computer, i.e. [Raspberry Pi]( or boot from a [Live CD]( - use truecrypt on it if you like
* Generate private keys _and_ spending transactions from that computer - you can use [BrainWallet.org]( offline.
* Only transfer away addresses and binary transactions from that computer.  Ideally never transfer anything to that computer (except BrainWallet scripts).
* On your online computer, you can send money to your cold storage addresses and submit your binary transactions - you can use [BrainWallet.org]( online.
Note that what I described is likely completely different than what you have.  I'd recommend keeping some money in your current solution - it should be pretty safe, but use a better cold storage solution for most of your coin.
At the end of the day, if you do not want to spend 10 minutes AT HOME every time you spend Bitcoin, you have to expose some of your money to viruses/hackers on your computer.
P.S. you could/should encrypt your private keys on your off-line machine and transfer them back to your online machine as backup, but never ever decrypt them on your online machine.

You can buy them without network support too!
I have used my Pi for offline Bitcoin work using [Javascript pages]( transfered over via USB stick.  A quick internet search turned up &lt; but I have not tested their product to actually recommend it.  On the surface Cold Pi seems cheap and easy.

Your coins are not gone until the transaction completes (is included in the blockchain).  If the network drops your transaction, you can make another.

@_date: 2014-03-25 15:46:34
Agreed.  I'm not sure this is likely though.
Presumably bitcoin is too small to warrant this type of attack today.  That is to say, it is expensive (billions of $) to pull off with little chance of return.  If a government (or corporation with lobbyists) really want to kill Bitcoin, regulation seems like a cheaper and easier method.
Eventually, Bitcoin will be very large and it will be very, very expensive for a single organization to pull off such an attack.  And again, the expense to pull one off is larger too.  Hopefully by the time Bitcoin is a threat, _most_ organizations will not be able to gain control.
Time will tell.  And yes, such an organization could be pulling this off right now appearing to be multiple smaller organizations.  I certainly do not have an answer, but __I'm hoping greed will win__ - such an organization (or just more likely, a small group of large organizations) will ride the line between control and profit while still providing a service the majority is ok with so as not to lose clientele.

Very similarly.  If someone writes a check in your name (forges your signature, etc), your money is pretty much gone.  Similarly if someone logs in as you and electronically transfers money.
Most banks are insured by the [FDIC]( so the government is the one backing your money in case the bank screws up (up to $150,000 or some similar number).  This is a bit stronger than the insurance Circle has, but I'm not sure about the details.
Going back to the 'if someone insured your cold storage', the analogy would be that a bank would not insure your wallet's cash if you got pick pocketed.

The amount of people using Bitcoin on a daily basis.  Say it hits 21 million _active_ users.  There will be 21 million Bitcoins.  That is enough for each person to have one.  Thus in order to support active trade volume, each person will need to occupy a few thousand dollars in Bitcoin.  And then add in the early adopters who will continue to hold/invest and you drive up the price even further.
By the time you hit 100 million users (of all sorts), I think $10k is very reasonable.
I back this by my belief that _a_ crypto currency (hopefully Bitcoin) is here for the long haul.  Also, the [Bank of America assessment]( seems like a reasonable lower bound at $1300/BTC.

I'd say it depends on how much money.
I just gave my daughter $20 in BTC and it is sitting in her piggy bank in a ziplock bag.  If/when the price of bitcoin goes up 10x to 100x, I'll likely move the money to a more secure location.
If I had given her $1000, I'd likely have kept multiple copies.  But this does beg the question - how to store your bitcoins long term.  A safety deposit box at the bank + a copy in a fireproof safe at home seem like the best choice to me, but that is somewhat expensive and only worth it when that overhead is much less than the amount stored.
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:37:27
As with everything, supply and demand.  Scarcity means a fixed supply.  Thus if demand goes up, so does the price.
Because so few people hold so much Bitcoin today, it will be quite scarce for the average user when it catches on.  They way the current holders/hoarders/investors spend (disperse) their Bitcoin will help shape the future.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:36:40
If you've invested more than you are comfortable losing, you should withdraw.
I am keeping the Bitcoin I bought yesterday.  The [Bank of America assement of Bitcoin]( seems like lower bound on its final price IMHO.  So I'd recommend keeping your Bitcoin in cold storage at least until it hits $1300.  But if you'll need your money before then, withdraw now.

This would be hard to do without making their product worthless as many of the encryption instructions are used by every application (most notably internet browsers).  Therefore this would not make business sense.


The protocol will refuse fake transactions - unless they are real transactions using keys processed on their silicon, but then again, that is a local issue and the processor must be built to do that - processors build before bitcoin surely would not be able to manage that.  Thus if processors started doing things like that it would be very clear.


This is way to general.  They cannot do _anything_ and most things would not make business sense.
Most arguments on this are similar to a 51% attack.  If you have the power to commit such attack, you would be more profitable to just work with the system.  Specifically Intel and AMD, they have a huge business that would take a hit if they release a malicious processor.  More exotic attacks, IMO, are more like viruses and can be handled with traditional approaches (identify attack vector and avoid the situation).
[Edit]: I'm more worried (personally) of a company like Trezor mounting a hardware attack.

Beware of two attacks:
(1) Forgetting your password (if you encrypt)
(2) Losing your unencrypted coins
I use a [Raspberry Pi]( to generate and encrypt my 'cold storage'.  The encrypted files are on my computer and gmail and backup service.  (I used a USB stick to transfer data)  If I die/get into a coma/forget, those coins are gone.  Side note: my RPi still has the unencrypted coins on it to protect against that temporarily.  Please do not break into my house.
The Linux Live CDs are a way to do this without having to buy another PC.
My long term goal (when I have more Bitcoins) is to keep an unencrypted paper wallet in a bank safety deposit box (my family can get the coins if I die or I can get them if I forget my password, but this costs money) and continue to keep an encrypted copy everywhere I can share it.
I consider properly encrypted offline and shared online to be equivalent to offline.
(3) You can also trust an online wallet.  Use a strong password, 2FA and pray the online wallet is honest and competent.  But this is clearly not offline.

If you are looking to spend soonish, Bitcoin does not help you too much today when compared to credit cards.  Some benefits:
* You are more anonymous
* Your bitcoin/credit card cannot be stolen by your merchant (but your CC company will reimburse you when this occurs)
    * But your Bitcoin funds can be stolen by hackers if you are keeping your wallet on your computer
* Get a few percent off your purchases at participating stores/merchants
If you are looking to invest in Bitcoin, you just sit on it until it becomes accepted 'everywhere'.  While you wait, look into securing your Bitcoin, including cold storage.  __Never invest more than you can afford to lose.__
Lastly, welcome.
[EDIT]: get someone else to 'join you' while you learn/play, if they are worried about losing money, offer them some bitcoin so they take no risk - though part of experience is actually buying/trading.  At a minimum you can give money to your buddy - cannot easily do this with credit cards.

Hindsight is 20/20, not that there were not a plethora of reasons leading up to the failure.  But I would be careful to automatically extend this view to all third parties.
Cold storage is hard and possibly expensive.  A trusted third party is often a better choice for many people, especially for an Average Joe.  Trust, of course, is the operative word.

I'd agree with [cbeast](  The good points [Alex Daley]( brings up against Bitcoin (which have been voiced numerous times) do need to be addressed in order for Average Joe to use Bitcoin effectively.
What is nice about Bitcoin, though, is you can run a bank on top of Bitcoin, charge you fees and provide that security and utility of which he spoke.  But one does not _need_ to use a bank to use Bitcoin.  Anyone can take these risks upon themselves.  Bitcoin allows for people to use banks and trade money with those who 'do it themselves' without any hassle.
This is why people like Marc Andreessen are putting money into Bitcoin companies.

I would say the point of bitcoin is to make the third party optional.
Trusted third parties offer very nice services and you should consider using them and all the risks involved not using them.
The risks involved with using a trusted third party as pretty simple: are they going to screw up?  Insurance helps you if they screw up in some ways, but not all.
__And remember, you are always trusting a party.__  Unless you design your own hardware, write your own OS and own bitcoin node, you are trusting other people.  (And if you attempted to do all of this yourself, even if you had the time, you'd likely make severe mistakes).

I agree with OP.
Bitcoin ATMs and smartphone apps appear to be the way to go.  This makes it easier than a credit card!

Whatever the answer is, I'd wager it pales in comparison to the amount of energy people use to climate control their homes or even what they use in their cars (or to ship/create/combine the products they purchase with crypto currency).
One number quoted "0.03%" of the total carbon footprint.  Which is in the noise today.  What it will be tomorrow could be a different story.
Also, how much energy does it take to use cash + support the credit card/banking networks today?  (Please include the energy used by all employees at these companies/governments).

Ignoring your request, I'll try to ELI5.
A blockchain is a history of events.  You know each new event^1 is authentic because it is signed.  It is hard to sign^2.  When you sign, you include the last signature^3.  Therefore, when you get a block chain, you can trust it (or verify it is incorrect).
So at the end of the day, a blockchain allows people who do not trust each other (or their communication channels) to agree on a sequence of events.
1. Take 'event' to mean block (w/rt bitcoin, this is a set of transactions)
1. Why mining requires many, many hashes/second
1. You can start at the beginning and verify all events easily
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:02:00
I'm not sure what you mean by control.
As a regulated business in the united states, they have to follow certain practices.  Presumably this means they only take/give money from your account when you authorize, though from a technical standpoint they have authorization to move money in/out of your account.  Presumably they keep this ability 'locked up' properly too.
__TL;DR:__ if they follow the rules, your account is safe.

To give some numbers:
* Pi's hash rate: 200 kH/s [1](
* Network hash rate: 250 PH/s [2](
* Your share of hash rate: 8 * 10^-13 [3](
* Money mined: $1.35 million / day [4](
* Your share of the money: $1.08 * 10^-6 / day [5](
* Pi's power consumption: 1 W [6](
* Pi's cost to run: $0.013 / day [7](
So you lose $0.013 cents per day mining with a pi
[Edit] while the pi is low power cost, it is also inefficient.  When it comes to mining, it only matters how good you are vs. the rest of the network.

While it is possible, bitcoin is a protocol with multiple implementation besides the core/reference code.

If he/she buys and holds it, he/she has effectively decreased the supply, thus driving up the price (as the demand otherwise says constant).
If he/she buys and then 'uses' it, things get complicated.  The simplest result is the bitcoin goes through a store that cashes out immediately, then the coin is back at the exchange and the net effect is near zero.

While all this appears to be true, shit happens (I.e. heartbleed).  Since there is a connection to your computer, it is not 100% safe.

It hits the network in seconds.  So near-everyone sees is instantly and can verify it as a valid transaction (proper fees, etc).  The sooner the merchant gives his/her goods/services, the more risk they take.
If you are selling coffee, you take little risk by accepting instantly.  If you are selling a car, you'd want to wait for a few blocks.  I am most worried about retail stores where people often buy $100+ of stuff.  Seems like a few confirmations would be required.
Credit cards and checks have their own drawbacks too.  A check is not 'confirmed' for days.  Credit Cards have chargebacks.   So the merchant takes risks there too.
__TL;DR__: There is risk in the current system, Bitcoin is no different, but allows merchants to manage it better in some circumstances.

Bitcoin solves a [large computer science problem](  A solution to such a longstanding problem is indicative of great potential.  Crypto is far from dead.

I agree.  But a beginner still cannot get this on day 1.  I look forward to a plethora of 'proven' devices.

Distributed, autonomous computing is very important.  Etherium seems to be the best player in this market, just as Bitcoin is the best player in the cryptocurrency market.
Having Etherium coexist with Bitcoin seems like a good thing to me today.  Etherium could fill the role of currency, but Bitcoin cannot provide distributed, autonomous computing.
Having said that, these are both new technologies, and predicting too far into the future is hard, as was predicting the utility and the needs of the internet.
I also see both technologies as an investment opportunity.  Even if you disagree with this motive (but agree that these technologies are important socially), you would be foolish not to invest in them as their value would necessarily rise as they are adopted.

At the moment, proper Bitcoin maintenance is hard.  For beginners, using a web-wallet has a lower risk than them trying to do it themselves.
Furthermore, without nice services like this, bitcoin will never catch on.  People would not use email if everyone had to run their own email server; sure you can do it, but it is not convenient.
What we need are more-trusted third parties.  This will take a while.  Having said that, the amazing part about bitcoin is _you_ don't have to use them.  But to think web wallets are hurting bitcoin, is a false statement IMO.

This program brute forces private keys until it finds one that has a  corresponding public key that starts with what you want.
The longer 'the part you want' is, the longer the algorithm runs.  Practically you are only limited to the first few characters.  To generate a whole address would involve looking at 2^160 attempts, which cannot be done with all the computers that will ever exist.

You must increase your transaction fee to get yours processed sooner.  Also, it is generally considered very safe to wait for 6 blocks to confirm a transaction (thus 1 hour).
If you are spending very little money (i.e. buying a cup of coffee), there is no need to wait for a transaction to verify.  Once it hits the network, it will be picked up eventually.  And even if it isn't, losing one cup of coffee is not much.
Fun fact - the receiver can spend that money, but that transaction will not verify until yours does.  This is how the [online Bitcoin gambling sites]( give you instant response (if your transaction fails, their payout would then fail too).
If you are buying a car, set a fairly large transaction fee, and wait one hour.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:48:58
This does not go against the neutrality of bitcoin, this is _exactly_ what bitcoin is about.
If a node does not like a transaction, it should refuse it.  If you disagree, that is fine.  The majority (or at least a substantial percentage) of nodes is enough to sway the network.
The hope is, that if X node is bad for the network, it will also be unpopular.  There are many cases in history where that is NOT the case.  We'll see if that becomes the ruin of bitcoin.

To me, it depends where you live.
__In the USA__: you give the 'private key' to your credit card every time you spend it.  There are consumer projections, but all-in-all, Bitcoin separates you from this bureaucracy.
__Country X whose currency is hyper inflated__: if your country's currency has not long term value, Bitcoin is an alternative.
__Country X with no banking__: Bitcoin itself is a basic bank.  It holds money, you can transfer it to others.  This can be done via cell phone/SMS.  See [mPesa in Kenya]( for an example.

I personally use both circle and coinbase - sometimes one is cheaper than the other.  Coinbase has a few more features, but their transactions fees generally mean fewer bitcoin per buy event.
LPT: if you have to send in a copy of your photo ID, place a watermark on that has the current date and who you are sending it to (i.e. circle.com and 2015-01-28) - this way if that image is ever leaked, you know who to blame (also delete it yourself from your computer).

Coins stored by third parties generally do not have an address you can see.  So anything he is watching likely is his own cold storage.  Now all you have to do is find his private keys.  If he was storing coins on third parties, I would reach out to them for recovery (though his beneficiaries might have to actually do the communicating).
To find his private keys, I would start looking through his emails and files on his computers, USB dongles and hard drives.  Keep an eye out for paper wallets too.
If you find encrypted files, you'll just have to guess at his passwords (but also keep an eye out for passwords as you filter through his stuff).
Good luck during this hard time.
In general, everyone with bitcoin should have a plan for your own (unexpected) death.  That is why I do not encrypt my cold storage.

My review:
1. Thank you for writing a blog about this, more discussion is this area is required, especially for 'the masses'
    * After reading, it is clear to me this article is focused on people wanting to become 'hard core' bitcoiners
1. "Wallets" section is very technical, possibly a turn-off to a reader
1. "Public Key Crypto" section continues the technical jargon
1. "Operating Systems" sections, IMO, should be replaced by "machine", and I would focus most on an 'offline' machine (which is achieved in a variety of ways)
1. "Passwords" section is written well for those with a technical background (though, I'd almost argue, most readers who get this far will learn nothing new)
1. "Backing up your hard drive" section is very nice, though I think some of the information should have come earlier in the article - especially 'always offline machine' discussion
1. Missing information - how to generate random addresses securely, other than trusting your hardware + OS/library used
__TL;DR:__ For those wanting a more technical explanation of security, this seems like a great article.  For those new to bitcoin, or who do not want to invest days of time to security, this it not the article for you.

If a certain, unlikely condition occurs, every node running a version of the bitcoin code with that bug will crash.  No bitcoins will be lost.  I am not sure if the nodes will crash again when they restart.
If the program crashes again when it restarts, the severity of this bug is very high, but nothing that isn't fixable.
To also be clear, there is nothing wrong with the protocol.  If someone wrote a separate bitcoin node from scratch, they likely would not have this bug.

Yes, the mechanics of switching everyone over would be easy - the protocol would just switch at a certain block number (well into the future).

That sounds fine for cold storage, but not for travel use\*.
\* I'm assuming you will not have your air-gapped netbook with you when you need to spend coins.  If so, your traveling comment seems like useless info.
If you need to spend while you travel, I would use a 2FA on an online account and only move over as much money as you need.  You could also place your coins on your phone (travel device) and encrypt them.  Here you are giving up some security in order to gain ease of access.
If you start using your encrypted keys online, they are no longer cold.

I have about half my bitcoin split between both Circle and Coinbase (with 2FA).  The rest is in cold storage.  I do not trust myself fully to do cold storage.  Also, it is a bit easier to get to my 'trusted third party' coins than my cold storage.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:02:12
My opinion is this: trust a third party until you learn more.  Circle and Coinbase both are insured and offer 2FA (two factor authentication).
No matter what, your coins are at risk.  If they are all at a third party, they are at risk of that party failing horribly or you sharing your password + 2FA device.  If they are on a piece of paper generated by you, they are at risk of fire, flood, lost in a box, seen by someone else or getting stolen because your keys were not random enough.  Also remember, Trezor is a third party too and you must trust their device to be good.
I personally have my coins stored in many ways, in case any single one fails.  As time goes on, hopefully good solutions will emerge.  People trust gmail for their email because it is easy and Google has proven to be a good steward.  Bitcoin companies (or open source projects) will eventually emerge that are trusted, but right now, there is no clear path forward, IMO.

His statements on risk and volatility are on point, but do not seem to bolster the argument of bitcoins long-term viability.

That is a 'major change' - to make that change, you'd need to get 'everyone' on board.  If it is a great idea, then yes.  What you really end up doing (technically) is have everyone agree that 'old bitcoin protocol' stops at a certain block and 'new bitcoin protocol' starts.
Another way to view this type of change is to create an altcoin that happens to have the same history of bitcoin.  You can do this yourself!
Practically, such a change is not likely to occur.  Same goes for extending the maximum number of coins (the 21 million).

The paper made it clear to me that stakeholders could more easily transfer/sell their power to undermine the system or profit.
As far as energy, you did point out it is better than a traditional bank.  It is also possible mining devices could reach commodity status - that is, you could buy a miner for roughly the same 'efficiency' as anyone else.  If this starts to occur, you could use miner to heat your house, etc.  This way, the energy is not completely wasted.  Though this is just once outcome and may not be likely.
PoS is a major change, outside the scope of Satoshi's white paper.  That alone forms my opinion that PoS will not happen, just as 21 million bitcoins is the limit.
I do not see PoW as a hurdle.  If anything, its biggest drawback is that power (influence) can be bought; i.e. Wal-Mart could buy a significant portion of miners and deny Target transactions, (or worse) and PoS does not appear to relieve problem like that.
p.s. this whole post is all opinion.

PSA: Never, ever give someone your password.
If an admin (or someone you think is an admin) requests it, do not send it.  If it is actually an admin, they can 'reset' your password if they need to access your account (which they shouldn't unless you lose your password).
[Edit]: clarification: your account password is not the same as a private key (or the password that encrypts a private key).  These cannot be reset by an admin.  The answer remains the same, do not give these to anyone.

To add to this: you run risk when you hold something valuable.
If you hold the private keys, you must keep them safe.  This is hard.  If you use a trusted third party, it is easy, but you have to trust them.
For beginners, I recommend using a trusted third party (coinbase or circle with 2FA) to start.

w/rt to randomness, you can always xor your own random value with another one.  If either are truly random, the output will be regardless of the value of the other.
I do not recommend using BIP38 (password protecting paper wallets) as you can forget the password (or die and not be able to pass on coins, etc).
Make sure you wipe that old computer (which is why most people recommend using a live CD).
And remember, you do not just _make it correctly_ you have to _store it correctly_ - do not let your house burn down with your paper inside of it.

I would say no.  Before they started their exchange, they could still throw their weight around, i.e. attempt to manipulate the market on other exchanges.  So I see this as a separate issue.
Now, they could use their money to entice people to trade on their exchange (i.e. put in their own offers that are better-than-market at a loss to them in order to gain market share).  But other exchanges could do this already.
So any issues that exist do not appear to me to be conflict of interest issues.

I'm assuming you are worried about the wallet.dat file that is generated by the reference bitcoin client.  I'll try to answer your questions, but I do not use the reference client for my wallet.
1) I don't know if the client will generate a wallet without syncing the block chain, you could check using a live CD.  100 unrelated private keys (thus 100 addresses) are generated.  2) I dunno.  3) Yes, you actually only need the private key.  4) if you securely spend from any single address offline, you can reuse it over and over.  If you spend from a single previously-offline-address-online, you should move all funds, but the other keys/addresses in your .dat file are fine\* since they are unrelated.  5) You'd need to do this manually, you can manually (with another wallet) create a large multi-input transaction.
\* If you use [BIP32]( as soon as you use a private key online, you should not use any decendents of that key.  BIP32 starts at one root address and can generate many other addresses from it (thus you only need to back up a single key).
Having said that, if you want to have an offline wallet, I would not use the reference bitcoin client to do it.

Your funds are already at your cold storage addresses.  There is no 'connect to receive.  There is only 'connect to spend'.
Your cold storage goal is to somehow to decrypt offline, but spend online.  Most wallets can only spend money if they are online, which makes this somewhat complicated.
But you can sign a transaction offline.  You just need to move all of the input data (address, previous hash, etc) to your offline computer.  Create the transaction (just a file) with your private key.  Copy that signed transaction file back to your online machine and spend it that way.
Alternatively, you could create `n` offline computers with more traditional wallets and every time you want to spend any money, you connect one of those computers to the net, spend some of its money and transfer the rest to another offline computer (now you have `n - 1` offline computers).  Then destroy/reformat the computer you just used.
__tl;dr__ find a wallet/system that allows you to have two parts: one on an online computer, one offline.  Use the offline computer to generate raw transaction data and sent it online.  Note that the offline computer doesn't actually know if there is any money at an address or not.

Short term yes, this is also because coins are being added and many miners do not just hold them, but sell them for USD to pay the costs of running/housing their machines.
Long term, assuming bitcoin catches on, everyone will start holding bitcoin to use it.  Just as you hold some cash in your pocket/checking account.  If everyone holds a little (i.e. hundreds to thousands of dollars), the price will increase and 'spending' bitcoin will naturally mean holding bitcoin because you will not need to hold USD.

What I'm confused about is your statement "I want my funds accessible (I travel a lot), so full cold storage is not for me."  To me, this implies you need to spend 'many' coins without access to an always-offline machine.
If this is the case, you have two options (IMO):
1. Use a third party with 2FA and hope they do not lose your coins
2. Keep coins on your device and hope you do not lose it or get hacked
Note this does not preclude your use of cold storage, it just means you need a third type of storage between cold storage and pocket money.  I'm in favor of choice 1 above.
With choice 1 above you:
* Store most of your coins in cold storage (very safe, hard to get to)
* Have a reasonable amount trusted to a third party that makes getting to them fairly easy, but safe via password + 2FA - and you only trust them when you travel
* Have a wallet on your phone that has enough money to buy lunch, trinkets, etc - if you lose it, it is not the end of the world
To be verbose, option 2 gives you cold storage + pocket money, except the amount of pocket money is so high it is a major life event if you lose it.

A core problem with this is that you may not have all that money up front to place in escrow - and if you did, you could remove it before payment (and if you could not remove it, you might as well just pay all up front).

I'd recommend using a trusted third party like Coinbase or Circle, which are insured.  Cold storage is hard and you run a chance of losing your coins due to one of any number of mistakes.  The way I look at it, you have risk storying your coins anywhere; your skills shape where that risk is highest.
I do not feel that I am a noob, but I have the same worries you do.  About half of my investment is at a third party, the rest in cold storage.

Check out [Bither Wallet](  This is not a software only solution, as you need an extra device, but it allows you to spend from a cold storage device.  It does not listen on an IP address, but uses QR codes to communicate - very transparent.  I'm looking into using it myself.
Trezor does this sort of thing too, but in a less obvious way.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:39:45
I would recommend diversifying where you store your bitcoin.  I would include trusted third parties (with 2FA).  Coinbase and Circle are both insured.
I would strongly look into cold storage, but this is hard.  There are a lot of things to get right.  Make sure you use good random numbers to generate keys/sign transactions.  Do not forget passwords.  Do not lose paper wallets to a house fire, etc.
Even as a computer engineer, I do not trust all of my bitcoins to my own cold storage; about half are with various third parties.
__TL;DR:__ there is always risk.  Your competence in cold storage should weigh strongly into where you store your funds.

There is always risk.  Depending on your skill, resources, trusting them to an insured exchange with 2FA (two factor authentication) may be the most secure.  Circle and Coinbase both fit the bill.
I would recommend diversifying your storage solutions, so if one goes down, you do not lose everything.
I personally have about half split between circle and coinbase, and the rest in cold storage.  But you have to be very, _very_ careful when doing your own cold storage.
[Edit]: remember, a Trezor is a trusted third party, just one you happen to hold in your hand.  Not owning one, I cannot recommend for/against it.  It seems nice, but pricy.

IMO, if you spend bitcoin around the price you buy it, no.  That is because you neither gain or lose anything in the transaction.
If you bought at $1, sell at $100 and buy a hamburger, you should: pay capital gains tax on the $99 you made and pay sales tax on the hamburger.  If you just bought at $1, it is now $100 and you buy a hamburger with BTC directly, you'd pay about 1/100th of the capitol gains tax + sales tax.

The maximum BTC I can buy is $2,500.00 per week.  The withdrawal limit is $5,000.00.
Transfers from my bank to bitcoin are instant (well, circle does not get the USD right away, but they give you the bitcoin anyway).  Coinbase just waits for the slow ACH transfer to go through (4 days).  If you withdraw, your bank should show it pending for a few days before marking it as final on either coinbase or circle.
Now, if you register a Visa credit card (not debit) with coinbase, they give you instant funds, even though they take it from your checking account.
As far as credit/debit cards and circle.  I have not used them.  But I think circle will charge you whatever fee your card charges and your card will also charge you a cash advance fee (and many cards will start charging interest on that transfer that day).
Having said all of that, in order to link a checking account to circle or coinbase, they send you two small amounts for verification, which take 2-3 days to show up.  You can use a credit card with circle right away.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:19:20
There is no easy answer.
Using an online service like Circle/Blockchain.info/Coinbase with 2FA is the safest _if that service does not go under_.
If you do not trust a third party, you have to be very careful.  The gist of it comes down two:
1. Generate a private key securely with no one watching
1. Keep that private key in a safe place
1. Make sure no one is watching when you securely spend from that key
There are dozens of footnotes on how to achieve those goals though.  Suffice to say, this, today, requires many hours of study, though the tools are free.  A device like a treazor can help, but this is a third party too (though, so is your operating system, c-compiler, etc).

There is a chance Coinbase will not give you that bitcoin when you ask, but as soon as you do move it, you are responsible for it (so there is still a chance of losing it if you make a mistake).  So you need to read up on how to properly store bitcoin yourself.  Hardware wallets are the easiest way to secure your bitcoin yourself.

You send your bitcoin back to an exchange (Coinbase), trade for fiat.
The benefit of holding on to it in the mean time is that if Coinbase 'goes down' between when you withdraw and deposit, you will know not to deposit.  If Coinbase would not 'go down' in that time, it is better (cheaper) to hold it there.

I agree this is needed, but segwit was contentious, so much so, it _needed_ a x2 block size increase to get that **compromise** (as indicated by the miners voting).  The reason the x2 part did not go through was not a coding problem (proof: Bitcoin Cash made x8 work just fine), but pure political - the core team got the segwit through under the BTC ticker, that was all they wanted.


I have, it used to be wonderful.  0-conf worked very well.  Bitcoin Cash works that way today.  It is interesting that people in this sub will say, "well then use Litecoin" but never say "well then use Bitcoin Cash".
Perhaps the core team is correct and Bitcoin cannot scale, but the tactics used to stear Bitcoin towards a second layer *without* having that layer ready in time is a failure of BTC.  We are still waiting, and it seems progress is being made, but it is also obvious BCH is scaling fine so far.  May the best coin win.
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:13:11
Either directly between customer and business if there is trust (no fee) or through a mutually trusted third party (for a fee).  The best part is it is the same interface.
Non-bitcoin example: you can buy stuff with a credit card, where you get some protection, but pay a fee or you can pay cash for no fee.  But in this example, the interface is much different.  Also, there are costs to using cash.

If you need to use another coin, Bitcoin is broken.  If nothing else, Bitcoin Cash is usable as a currency today until a second layer is ready.  Not having a transition plan in place was a mistake by the core team.  Not being allowed to have an open discussion on this sub is frustrating.

Bitcoin had needed a block size increase before lightning takes off too.  There is no (good) reason to have avoided the 2x of segwit2x.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:07:42
That is the transaction fee paid to the bitcoin miners for them to insert that transaction into the next block.  No third party is required, all you need to do is create a transaction (your bitcoin wallet can do this) and to put it into the bitcoin network.  Nodes will forward it through the network and a miner will include it.
@_date: 2019-02-19 01:33:42
This is the correct analysis.  If segwit should have been mandatory, it should have been done in a hard fork.  Obviously, you can boycott companies who don't use segwit, but the market will decide if it is a good change.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:58:45


That is one way.
But another way to hard fork would be to have new clients that refuse to accept old-rule blocks.  (i.e. it is a two way street, you can hard fork either way).

Without getting into a semantic argument, the miners are not considered third parties since their actions are transparent and the work they do to mine is verifiable.

said both "Segwit has doubled the space of a block" and "a 100% increase in block size was huge because it makes btc blockchain grow a lot faster [increasing centralization]".
But the segwit soft fork does increase the physical size of blocks (it just puts the extra data outside the part of the block that is counted for the 1MB limit).  I am calling out the conflict between 2MB being bad due to a 2x hard fork vs. 2MB blocks being fine withe the segwit soft fork.
Example: block [607968 has a size of ~1.5MB with ~70% of its transactions being segwit ones](

I disagree that the fee **market** is required.  I agree fees are required, and even even a nominal minimal fee.  But a fee market makes the fee estimate process **unpredictable**, which itself drives up fees.
And the only way a fee market exists is if blocks are full, which implies some transactions are left out, which again, is unpredictability - something you do not want in your money.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:55:15
What was ridiculous is that a minor block size was not implemented while other solutions were developed.  What is ridiculous is that _was_ the compromise, but once the segwit part was accepted, the x2 part was reneged upon (or at least major parties claimed that is what they would).

How was that a good thing?!  Fees were through the roof and the second layers were not ready (as they said they would be over 18 months before the congestion happened).
The next bubble certainly will congest the Bitcoin layer (blocks will be full) - the only question is will the second layer be up and running/adopted in time.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:35:43
You'd have to use the LN (or an alternative) to avoid the high fees.  At a minimum, though, you'd have to pay the high fees to open your own channel (presumably to a bank-like node that has a large amount of connections to other nodes, so you wouldn't have to open up too many channels).


If this is really how you feel, this is what the Bitcoin Cash fork aims to avoid.  Presumably the Segwit + LN fork also aims to avoid it too.

Agreed.  The proof of work is what makes the block chain you see verifiable.  You can see exactly how much work it takes to get there.  Without proof of work, there is not _distributed_ consensus.
To motivate people to 'work', they need to be rewarded.  Bitcoins (mined or transaction fee) are that reward.
A distributed blockchain with proof of work MUST be tied to a reward.

If the wallet you use allows it, it is very easy.  The motivation for RBF is say you submit a transaction when the fees are rising and the blocks are full.  Your transaction may be stuck 'pending' while many other with higher fees come in (and get priority over yours).
But if each transaction you send has the RBF bit set, you can always send another (presumably the exact same transaction, but higher fee).
These tricks are the downside of having full blocks.

@_date: 2015-04-13 21:16:00
If you pay in dollar _amount_ via bitcoin, it could be very similar to cash/paycheck.  The federal government only takes USD at the moment, so SS would need to be paid in USD (not sure the mechanics behind that - most small to medium sized businesses use a payroll company to do those logistics).
But paycheck, cash, bitcoin or direct deposit to you - they all are legal as long as the accounting is done in USD.
Separately, once you get paid in bitcoin, if the price changes, there are IRS consequences.  E.g. you get paid $100 in bitcoin today and the price jumps to $150 when you buy groceries, you owe taxes on the $50 you gained.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:23:38

If you want a full node, you need to receive on that port too.  If you do not accept any incoming connections, you only get data, you do not push any.  Thus you are being selfish and not contributing.

Yes.  As long as your private keys are never online (or on a computer that goes online).
Worst case is someone finds out which wallets are yours.  I.e. if you are holding $10m, you may be targeted for theft.
@_date: 2015-03-06 16:00:31
I'd recommend finding a wallet that supports [BIP32 (HD)]( and using it offline.
As far as the brain wallet is  concerned, I'd avoid it or use [Warp Wallet](
How to combine:
1. Generate a base key using Warp Wallet
2. Feed that as the base to the hierarchical deterministic wallet to get several child keys/addresses
3. Print
Overall, I think you are trying to reinvent the wheel, hopefully someone can recommend an existing wallet that pretty much does this for you.

That misses the point.  We do not just 'more nodes', we need many different people to run nodes.  If someone runs 10k malicious nodes (which is totally doable by the way) it does not help the network.

The person or group who invented Bitcoin (and solved the distributed consensus problem).  He/she/they wrote the initial code and the [whitepaper]( - which you should read if you have not.
Nobody knows the person behind those acts or that personality.
On a non-mentor-monday post, you should expect this to get downvoted.  Mostly because who Satoshi is does not matter much today in terms of the development of the protocol.  It is seen as wasting time.

You could do this, or just pre make some paper wallets, but make two copies of each.  Take one with you to leave tips.
If the funds are still there in a month, take the money back using your copy.  _You could even put a message in the 'take back' transaction to have the other paper wallet send you a signed message if they want their money back.  But this is quite complicated._
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:48:52
I do not think the difficulty is stored in the block itself, because it can be inferred by other data (namely timestamps of all blocks before it).
The number of leading zeros in the 'solution' also represents the difficulty, though additional leading zeros are ok.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:38:55
Kinda.  The fee goes to the miner who finds the next block.  It is the difference between all outputs and inputs.
You can pretend by constructing a transfer from i1 and i2 to o1 where i1 equals o1, thus leaving i2 as the fee.  There is no way to distinguish that the fee only came exclusively from i2 as it really comes from i1 + i2 - o1.
Alternatively, you could make two transactions.  e.g. t1 form i1 to o1 and t2 from i2 to no outputs.  Though these may not meet the minimum 'anti-spam' rules set by nodes and may be dropped.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:01:27
There is a chance mining hardware will become a commodity.  That is, you could buy hashing power at the same rate and efficiency as the 'big guys', but in smaller chunks.
If this becomes the case, everyone could start mining again.  Presumably you could use the heat from the miner to do other things, such as heat your house in the winter.
If all that happens, most nodes will be mining nodes again.

Having actual internet money is extremely useful.  There are minimal barriers to entry (both for end users and developers).  Anybody can develop services on top of it, just like the 'web' on top of 'http'.
Satoshi solved a key information-science problem (distributed group consensus) and bitcoin is only the first application.

I'm not sure what else is on your network (are you running this from a dorm room?).
At my house, I use my 'guest' network for an extra layer of security.  That way if my router is safe and my PC running my full node is compromised, my other computers are unaffected.  I also use that to rate limit so my streaming/gaming is not affected.

I'll try to ELI5 respond.


You cannot see them working, but you can see when the solve the problem.  Due to the difficulty of the problem, you can know about how much work is being done.
The easiest way to see is to watch &lt; the top table shows each new block.  If you click on [one]( you can see the `hashes` (with many leading zeros) - these zeros are important - finding inputs that create that many is hard.  The `nonce`(1287325491 in this case) is the random guess that finds all those zeros.


Yes.  The algorithms the mining equipment is doing can be done by hand.
Because of the difficulty of the problem, it takes about 194,171,310,000,000,000,000 guesses to find a block, which is found about every 10 minutes.  If you are quick, you could do about one guess in 10 minutes.
ELI15: you can see how these guesses work using excel, which is [explained in this video](

Mining does both.  And critically, it needs to do both (as well as get produce a reward).
When a block is mined, all included transactions and a reference to the last block are locked in.  Thus an ordered list of transactions is created.  Everyone can see this list and then agree that Alice did pay Bob 2.13 bitcoin on July 4th, 2014 (as an example).
Solving the hard math problem (SHA256 hash with many leading 0s to be exact) proves that 'a lot' of work was done to extend the list of transactions.  Without this, anyone could create their own list (Charlie could say that Alice actually paid _him_ 2.13 bitcoin on July 4th, 2014).
And the reward for mining encourages people to try and be honest - as you can make more money from mining 'honestly' than you can from trying to thwart the system.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:02:35
Yes.  You could set up a script to automatically pay from your 'checking bitcoin address' once a month to your utility companies address they have given you.  There is no way for the utility company to pull bitcoin money.  There are also potential issues how to communicate data, such as a bill that changes amount every month or if a different address should be used when you pay.
See [BIP70]( for more information.

My recommendation would be this: sign up for a Circle or Coinbase account, get a Mycelium wallet on your (Android) phone, buy some coins and transfer it to your phone, then find a place to spend them.  As you learn more, run a full node and work on a cold storage research/solution.

One thing you have to overcome is when do you take payment.  If you take it too soon, the customer may not get the product they want (i.e. broken) and they cannot get their money.  If you take the money after shipment, you may never get paid.
This concept was recognized by paypal and why they are a market leader this area.
Having said this, the silk road did things like this with Bitcoin and there are others.  Most allow the sale of illegal goods, thus giving the services a negative connotation.
I do not have a nice 'safe' market.
[EDIT]: if you are willing to handle some fraud and own your own website, you can start taking bitcoin directly.  This works best/cleanest with digital goods.  I.e. if you are a digital artist, you can exchange your art for bitcoin at one point in time.

As far as I know, there is no software that lets you do this manually.  But you can know you have a correct number if you have enough leading zeros.  The amount of zeros is the [difficulty]( which changes up/down about every two weeks (2016 blocks).  Right now the difficulty is 46,684,376,316.86, which is about 68 bits of 0.
Also some nice info here: &lt;
**TL;DR:** Convert your output to binary and count the leading zeros, if you have 68 or more, find a way to submit that transaction in less than 10 minutes to claim your $800,000 (approximate value).
P.S. chance of this occurring as very, very, very^very^very small.

I'm not a familiar with the term "Receiving Address".  Would you provide some context?
You can derive more public addresses from any other public hash (that is, using the same process you can derive the the corresponding private keys from the source's private key).  This is [BIP 32]( or "HD Wallets" which means hierarchical deterministic wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:48:32
Thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:56:28
I suggest you continue trust an insured, online third party that you log into with 2FA (two factor authentication).  Perhaps distribute that coin to multiple third parties.
Anything else means that you are storing the private key needed to spend those funds.  If you mismanage that private keys your funds are gone (either by theft or loss).
Having said all that, I encourage you to learn more about cold storage and computer security in general.  As you learn more, you can _then_ consider how to manage your private key(s) yourself.
I, personally, still store about half of my coins on trusted third parties because I do not trust myself.

If you trust a third party, you are trusting them with your coins.  Blockchain.info, itself, has had issues (some its fault: stolen coins, some were man-in-the-middle attacks that exploit some of their users).
Coinbase and Circle are both insured, which should count for something.
If you do your own cold storage, there are a million and a half ways to screw it up.  I'd advise heavily researching it before doing it yourself.  I have and I still keep half my coins at various third parties.
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:57:55
On top of this, I'd say this progress suggests it should get easier.
Circle has received venture capital just because of difficulty in this area.  Presumably if you still think you can do better, you could start your own company based on your plan (or if you wait, likely someone else will do this for you).

Well, fees could either comparable to bitcoin or subsidized.  The assumption is a government run cryptocurrency _could_ be as efficient as bitcoin (that is, much more efficient the Visa, ACH, etc).

@_date: 2015-02-25 17:34:04
Fees are ultimately decided by nodes on the network.  This is outside the protocol (other than fees are supported).
If a node does not like your transaction fee, it will drop it.  Each node can be different.  Today, however, most nodes run the same code, so they act the same in this respect; thus not really a free market.
When fees become important to a miner's revenue, you'll see the market adjust as needed, mostly defined by what the miners will accept, though transfer generators (i.e. you) can collectively choose to not include.  Presumably the free market picks what is best, but that is a large presumption.

If a miner mines a block without enough difficulty (with not enough leading zeros in the hash) others will ignore it (as it is invalid).  That is what is meant by 'the protocol'.

It has been explained, there just has not been evidence that small blocks work better since the second layer is not ready and/or has not been adopted.  Whereas big blocks are clearly working better now, but there is no evidence for when the really get big (e.g. average block size over 10 MB).
