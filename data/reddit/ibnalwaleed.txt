As a guy who had family in the UAE there's one main problem. Bitcoin infrastructure.  There's no local exchange that allows people to buy Bitcoins quickly and conveniently.

I'm iraqi and even if they accept Bitcoin it'll fail for multiple reasons. Firstly Internet in the region Is unreliable. 
Secondly they're going to have to exchange it for dollars / Fiat. Now they're going to have to do that via cash if they don't want to be traced otherwise their bank accounts will close down. Thirdly they won't use it as a state currency because of issues of people without phones etc. And also due to Islamic finance regulations on a state level will prevent banks from using it as an official currency. 
Fourthly it allows their finances to be traced making it easier for the US and it's allies to investigate and shut down its financial operations. Fifthly theft. They may be tech savvy but not tech savvy enough to fully secure their funds.
I'm building a Bitcoin exchange aimed at the Gulf States and North Africa. If Isis does accept Bitcoin it will face too many challenges it may as well launch its own cryptocurrency.

Get a paper wallet. Encrypt private key. Bury the wallet in a location known to you. Generate random password for the  encryption. Split pass into  4 segments give each to a different friend to bury somewhere different. Get them to write clues on a sheet. Bury clues with paper wallet.

Everyone who's been Goxed has learnt from their mistake. The fall of Mt.Gox also shows everyone that no one is too big to fall. I hope it's improved the security of other exchanges

Its the first fully sharia compliant digital currency. 
(i'm currently working on Building a Bitcoin Exchange for the Middle East) 
Bitcoin truly allows Saudi citizens to have complete autonomy with their funding. Especially for People born and raised in Saudi who aren't Saudi nationals it stops Banks from freezing their accounts due to Visa issues etc etc.

Yeah. You could have an Uber bitcoin wallet that you top up before hand and that Uber withdraws the bitcoins from. And if you haven't got enough they could take the rest from your bank card.

First heard of Bitcoin in the news around october dismissed it as a fad until i somehow stumbled onto 'What is Bitcoin?' on Youtube. Then soon after this Subreddit.
I'm annoyed at myself for not having known Bitcoin's existence for all these Years. what was i doing i wonder?
Here I am 8 Months and a few Bitcoins later Building a Bitcoin Exchange.
