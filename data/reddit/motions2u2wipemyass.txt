Yeah but why has the exact same "crash" happened at the exact same time (mid-January) for the last 4 years?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:53:13
Not to roast you here, but if you did a little research, or even just briefly looked at the market as a whole, you would have understood that this steep drop wasn't due to a problem with bitcoin, but the market as a whole.
If all coins drop by 50% at the exact same time, chances are everything will rebound as well.
Also, there were several posts on many crypto subreddits explaining that the market was acting this way because of the Chinese New Year, where tons of money is taking out of the market to pay for gifts and flights. They even showed graphs from the past 4 years all showing a steep mid-January dropoff at the exact same time. I found this out after about 5-10 minutes of looking into what was going on.
Lesson learned I guess, but it was certainly an avoidable one.

Be careful with who you take advice from on this sub, look at his post history, all he does is talk shit about bitcoin, literally no other posts. Also his name is "LyinCoin".... so who knows if he has ulterior motives. Do your own research and come to your own conclusion imo. You can take information from forums like this, but like I said, be careful who you're listening to.

Not knocking your shit, but 50% of all marriages end in divorce, just because you have a great marriage doesn't really mean anything, objectively speaking.

Yeah but people change over time, and people hide things about themselves that might only come out later on in the marriage. 
The best way I've heard marriage described is "I love you so much I want the government involved."
It's just unnecessary.

My theory on investing in crypto is to put in no more than you are willing to completely lose, and then hold it long term.
The way I see it there are two options, bitcoin goes to $0 or bitcoin goes really high. If you only put in what you're okay with losing, then you won't be stressed out, and will eventually make a good profit (imo).

You're selling just as we moved into a confident upward trend after a 2 year bear market? Bold play cotton.
Imo (and I could very well be wrong), it's much riskier to sell right now than it is to wait and see what happens. If the price drops 2k, you could consider selling because that would be a trend reversal. However, the potential upside far outweighs the potential downside right now.
Remember, bitcoin went from 10k to 19k in the span of like 3 weeks.

It could be FOMO, but really, the resistance over 8 or so MONTHS has been 3.8k-4k. The chances of the market turning around right now and dropping below 4k is very low, so it's not crazy risky to fomo in right now.
Having said that, crypto is absurdly volatile, so there's always a ton of risk, but there's also a ton of profit as well.

It might pull back a little later this week, but it might not. Crypto is unpredictable.
My recommendation is to follow overarching trends and not be too concerned with getting in on a red day. We seem to be at the end of an extremely long bear market, where the resistance set the price at 3.8k-4k. Now is as good a time as any to get in. Though it wouldn't be a terrible idea to wait a week or so to see if the trend solidifies, but it really just depends on how risk averse you are.
Two pieces of advice though: hold long term, and don't put in more than you're willing to lose.
Putting in more money than you are comfortable losing will make you do stupid and panicky things. Remember that this is an extremely volatile investment, meaning high risk *and* high reward (people tend to forget about the high risk part until there's a -20% day).
@_date: 2019-04-01 15:20:07
Ehhh. Very risky to sell right now.
The risk of missing out on a serious run far outweighs the risk of not taking a bit of profit.

I think its value right now is derived from its potential in the future. In my opinion bitcoin's two biggest uses are 1. keeping money away from corrupt governments that would steal it otherwise, and 2. allowing for first world banking practices anywhere in the world, all you would need is a basic internet connection.
These two things haven't really taken root yet, but I think once bitcoin buying/selling/storing becomes easier and more accessible, bitcoin could explode.
Basically right now everyone's saying "we think bitcoin will be worth a lot more in the future", and that's what gives it it's current evaluation.

You never know what will be the right or wrong decision in investing. Do what makes you happy, and what you can live with in the worst case scenario.
Withdraw an amount that you'll be content with if the rest goes to $0, have enough where you'll be content if it goes to $100,000
Doing this will stop you from making stupid decisions in a panicked state.

Trust is a big thing for me, and this generation as a whole I feel. I don't trust politicians, I don't trust the government, and I don't have faith in the banks.
