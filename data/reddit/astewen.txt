Since Bitcoin is not on the stock market, nobody. But, I see what you're saying... It's the same as "who controls the switch from dollars to cents?" Cents are just fractions of a dollar - Satoshis are just fractions of a Bitcoin.

Sure, here's a quick how-to...
[Creating a paper wallet](
And do like she says - disconnect from the wi-fi (or pull the wired connection) before you generate the private key.

I have a Trezor One for my "working" coins - those that I am actively trading. I have paper wallets for all the ones that I'm HODLing. The Trezor is pretty good. It handles the more popular coins (BTC, LTC, BCH, ETH) but alas, it's lacking support for some of my other fav's like THETA and VERI (though VERI can use ETH addresses).

Look for a downloadable software that you can install on your PC. Then, unplug the PC from the internet, generate the wallet and hand-write the address and key on a piece of paper. Don't even send it to a printer! Secure the paper in a safe, or really secure fire- &amp; water-proof location. Uninstall the program and then reconnect to the internet. Never generate a key when online and never send it 'across the network', even if it's a private one.

Not really. If you have $100 in Coinbase and it goes down, you're out $100 - you get nothing, you lose sir.  
However, if you have $100 in a paper wallet and Coinbase goes down, you STILL HAVE $100 to send to Mercatox, Bittrex, Kraken or some other trading platform.

Yes, you can. I'd advise you to transfer it to a paper wallet or one where you have the private keys. "Not in your possession, not your coins". If Coinbase falls, you'll lose your money. They are basically trading derivatives of the coins and that exposure means they could easily pull a "Mount Gox" and close their doors. Be safe, move them into your own possession until you're ready to sell, them move them back into the market at that time.

You can use the online private key generators (paper wallets), just disconnect before you generate the key (see video I link to in this thread), and close the generator page before you reconnect. The key is generated using a JavaScript app which runs local - you don't have to be connected to generate a key.
