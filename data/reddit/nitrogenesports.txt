It doesn't matter if the laptop fails as long as you wrote &amp; secured your seed

The only application of blockchain that's useful to people that we know of is money. 
Just because you're on a blockchain doesn't mean you're secure or that you're immutable. You need a tremendous amount of distributed hashing power to make a blockchain secure

You can always load it from an old PC with the network adapter removed &amp; print it. That's what I do

Wasabi wallet works great

Quantum computers may make it possible to brute-force a private key from a public key. But the ability of QC's to do this would be apparent to everyone and Bitcoin would update its signing to be quantum hard. Other than that there's no realistic threat we know of

There can only be 21,000,000 bitcoins. Currently there have been  17,780,525 BTC mined. The price for 1 bitcoin is around $11k.

Good point - should use an old printer with no wifi support via USB

If any alt-coin has an actual innovation that doesn't compromise Bitcoin's security model, it will be implemented into Bitcoin. So far we have seen zero innovations worth making it into Bitcoin Core from altcoins. 9 years and counting.

Pity the fools who take this garbage seriously

The stuff the smart guys were saying in 2017 is true... Fees will reduce by reducing the size of transaction with segwit/bech32 addresses &amp; for infinite scaling LN is the only practical solution.

True. Buterin from what I can see is a salesman masquerading as a scientist. Which explains his non-scientific quantum simulator nonsense he tried to sell before Ethereum.

Use Wasabi wallet and participate in a coinjoin. If you want to go further you can make an account on a trusted sportsbook using TOR, send in BTC and withdraw it. Many ways to make your btc fungibile

If you upgrade your RAM and HD (both cheap) it should solve the problem

The "journalists" covering finance need to figure how to explain how a "dead" asset is pumping
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:36:08
All of Peter's arguments are premised on the misguided belief that Bitcoin shares the same properties as All cryptocurrencies. Realizing that Bitcoin's properties cannot be reproduced invalidates all of his arguments against it

Props for this post... it's dead on.
Another key point is that Ethereum was designed to host decentralized turing complete applications which are immutable. There is zero market demand for decentralized turing complete code. It's far more efficient to run your code on a centralized system. Ethereum has around 5,000 daily active users on their dapps. Ethereum is worth something around $30B. Something is obviously wrong with that project.

It's impossible that someone with his intelligence can go 7-8 years without understanding the fundamentals of BTC... He's proven he's only interested in selling gold, even though gold has a 0.011% chance to make any meaningful change. True shame!

Finally an accurate crypto alt-coin website

Probably XMR is the best since they keep hardforking their PoW algo, reducing their hashpower and difficulty, making it easier for consumer hardware to make decent amounts of coin
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:58:15
Very cool but couldn't identical conclusions be reached by simply looking at price/avg(200day) ratio

Every hardware wallet is secure if you are the only one who has physical access to it. The vulnerabilities found in them always require physical access from what I've seen

if you want me to loose interest in a project just tell me they had a pre-mine

Never pay for cloud or any type of managed mining. Your payouts decrease over time, and eventually they kill your contract before you ever get profitable. If you want to mine using your PC you can't mine BTC directly unless you use ASICS - just mine XMR and convert it to BTC

Just buy what you can afford on a weekly or daily basis and do things you enjoy.

Bitcoin going lower is a good thing if you want to own more Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:39:19
If you want a free but very secure hardware wallet, you can use an old laptop, remove the network adapter and install the bitkey ([ OS on it.

DeFi is dumb, you have 100000x more lenders than borrowers, and the collateral needs to be 2x because it's a digital bearer asset.
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:47:02
Why would you do that when you can just write it on a piece of paper and store it safely?

Decentralized value transfer has been accomplished. Shillcoins will not acknowledge it

"Advanced attackers in possession of firmware signing keys"... good luck getting Trezor's keys

1200 would be great (assuming not due to an exploit)... I'd be able to collect a lot more btc
