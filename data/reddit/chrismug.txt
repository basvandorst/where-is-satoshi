If one wants to build a good product on crypto space they will do so, if they use funding as an excuse, they will also do so, but ultimately, doing something that you truly want to be become revolutionary, you do not need to raise billions. people out there scamming us. pathemata mathemata: learning through pain.

True, i did not say mPesa is like bitcoin, it is very different and expensive as well. was just using it to explain a point.

someone should start a reddit community for tracking how many times, Buffet says stuff about bitcoin.

You are right, the title is 'using bitcoin' in this sense was meant to convey as a facilitator/medium, like the way you'd use mPesa to buy groceries, but what we mean is that mPesa is used to facilitate that,

honestly i do not think it was that bad. any layman or even tv personality who does not understand bitcoin would say the same. Also late night shows have been making fun of bitcoin for a while now. Remember [John oliver?](
even in the past, late 90s, they were making similar predictions about how internet is complicated. 
the way i look at it is that these jokes could actually help more try to understand it, plus it will make a fun story a fews when we look back at old clips about how they trashed bitcoin.
