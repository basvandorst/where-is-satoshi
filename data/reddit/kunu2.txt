Yup I got 3 BTG and sold for more BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:29:29
Does it not work the same way the BCH fork did?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:35:12
Rise or change from base price? I.e., would -20% in a day be a circuit breaker too?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:38:59
That's funny because bitcoin/BTC prices and links are all over bitcoin.com. What a scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:10:19
You should still be able to get it. Transfer it to a coinomi wallet and add coins. Google it, pretty simple actually. Just did it a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:19:34
Yes but I got my BCH from my CB btc prior to their distribution. I had my bitcoin prior to hard fork date that was all that mattered. Didn't matter where the coin was at the time.

I believe those are volumes for contracts.
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:36:10
As much as I want bitcoin to succeed and rise in price, this comment is right. I'm still up over double, not sure if I should pull some out. The lack of volume and adoption is discouraging. I do think the addition of constant selling pressure due to Mt Gox trustee liquidating plays a part. It may not be the cause of downtrend, but it certainly contributes to it. 
However, I have no idea what will happen if bitcoin's price drops below production/electricity costs. Internet implodes?

That's the downside of deflationary currency.

What is segwit?
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:05:39
How liquid is BTC on a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano then? I'm holding long term, but if a short squeeze happens I would like to be able to sell and buy back again afterward.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:00:51
Why are you on this sub if you do not care for or use bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:41:58
EOY PT was 3k and 5k would have been incredible. So yeah, I'm still up 50% at this point and will never sell.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:03:17
Bitcoin isn't a stock. It's not going on the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:07:25
That's some good analysis right there. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:40
Hodl on... okay now you're permitted.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:17:55
That's not a crash. Not really even a dip for bitcoin, more of a fluctuation. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:34
True you're right. My mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:16:28
In your example, if the price falls, you would profit from the premium on the put contract. The buyer wouldn't exercise if the spot price is below strike price. They'd buy their own 1000 BTC at that point (if they were the size of investor that would exercises options).
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:57
That's also what she said.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:10
That's what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:08:58
Again I understand, but the commenter's logic is we are due for a global crisis because we surpassed 2008. Not because of anything logical that would cause a correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:55
Okay so when your grandmother comes to you with their Fidelity account open in internet explorer asking you to show them how to get bitcoin, what are you going to do? Route them to a futures exchange, GBTC, or Coinbase? I think it is important to clarify the distinction between stocks and cryptocurrency with newcomers to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:01:54
Yes but bitcoin is not on the stock exchange. You pay a massive premium to invest in GBTC, it's separated from the spot price of bitcoin.
They're not synonymous. You can trade futures on anything. Stocks, forex, oil, gold, beans, corn, etc. The stock market doesn't involve exchanging the latter four directly. Same for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:05:38
Why would '08 be considered the peak/ceiling of the stock market? It has to be passed at some point. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:58
I understand your reasons. But the comment above implies that we are due for a crash because we have surpassed 2008 index levels. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:56:04
The tinfoil hat is on tight for the guy you replied to...

A democratic government does not eliminate the opposition. There is a difference between a de jure democracy and a de facto democracy.

Okay. Go do something about it then. Try to change it. Arguing on the internet does not advance the change you wish to make.

I didn't say it was the primary reason, jackass. You think a tank won't mobilize quicker on paved roads versus blowing through forests and buildings?

You should know that the interstate highway system also serves a defensive purpose in terms of war. If the USA were ever to be invaded by the Soviets, ggwp if you can't mobilize by way of dirt roads and forest paths.

But that is the ideological basis and end goal of Bitcoin.

Can you tell me a country in the world that does not have taxation? Or would you prefer to return to feudalism for a privatized version of taxation?
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:36:01
My point is if you consider it theft, do something to change it. Don't comment on Reddit, go try to destabilize the 10,000 year old method of society.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:34:28
People congregated together to form societies, and a central authority made it easier to make decisions and organize the group. This required collective funding. I understand you don't want taxes but this idea goes back to the dawn of civilization. This system is in place to this day, but because you can identify different types of fallacies on an online forum in an delusional rant, it is then justified to change the basis of society because you disagree. 
Please go to your local elected representative or dictator and tell them your complaints. It will bring nothing by whining on Reddit. Get real.

I have recently come into some money. I own some bitcoin, but do not mine any. I'm somewhat interested in mining, now that I have the capital to invest in a rig. Anyone have any insight as if this would work for a rookie?
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:33:19
In the long run bitcoin's price is only to go up, that's what we all think if we're on this thread. Profit should increase too. FWIW, the money I have come into is a few hundred thousand USD.
