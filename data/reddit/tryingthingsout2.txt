People in Venezuela are purchasing USD, not bitcoins.

So instead of giving me an unbiased source for your ridiculous claim as I asked, you gave me MORE ridiculous claims?
If you can't, then what you say is false. All of it. Besides maybe the gold stuff but that's irrelevant. Much like bitcoin, almost no one cares about gold or uses it as a currency.

Bullshit. Not a single word of that is true. Including the part about you being a teenager. Teenagers don't care about bitcoins and they certainly don't run out and buy them en masse.
You sound like an adult trying to give false hope to your fellow delusional idiots.

"Bitcoin is not an environmental catastrophe! Here's why:"
*proceeds to list several reasons why bitcoin IS an environmental catastrophe*




Which is it? XD

Serious question for you "why isn't everyone using bitcoins yet?" people:
Imagine any sane person coming to this subreddit and seeing you guys defending truly evil people like Alex Jones, Ross "All he did was create a website!!" Ulbricht (you're not fooling anyone with that dumb argument) and Cody "Statutory rape is absolutely fine; age is just a number!!" Wilson.
Do you honestly think that that person would think, "Yes, these sound like fine, upstanding, moral folks and I definitely would like to be associated with them." If so, you're delusional.
(Most of) you people are incredibly, incredibly evil.

Unbiased source for this ridiculous claim?

Crypto is the most effective birth control in existence. ;)

lol, only bitcoiners judge the legitimacy of someone's argument by how old their Reddit account is. You guys are dumb as hell.
Nicely said, moron for life.

~~The Price of~~ Bitcoin is Meaningless
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:22:35
This one of the dumbest things I've ever read. Just because gold mining is a waste of energy doesn't mean that the amount of energy bitcoin uses isn't also a waste. Almost nobody uses gold as a currency either.


That's the *entire point* of the comparison. Bitcoin's energy usage is obscene and unacceptable *because it isn't a country yet it uses an entire country's worth of electricity.* What's so hard to understand about that?

As opposed to the totally non-misleading and unbiased information put out by r/bitcoin?

I should have specified that I was talking about the vast majority of business owners, not crazy libertarians who have an ideological investment in the whole thing.
And do you seriously not understand that businesses and their transactions are a hell of a lot easier to track than drugs? The government has no trouble finding out about under the table transactions. And IRS audits are a thing.

B-b-b-b-b-but... this can't happen to bitcoin! It's literally impossible! That's what everyone here says so it must be true!
Bitcoin is infallible! It cannot be attacked!

It won't be long before the government amends the law so that having a warrant canary that trips will count exactly the same as you having manually posted a warning, with the exact same penalty.
The government *really* doesn't like people who think they're clever by using a loophole to get around a law. Before long, people using warrant canaries are going to be FUCKED.

Government: "Any business that accepts bitcoins will be seized and its owners prosecuted with potential prison time."
Boom, stopped. Realistically, no business owner is going to risk that.

Like most bitcoiners, you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Nearly all of your points are wrong and the rest is pure baseless speculation.
I'll just point out your funniest mistake, which was to state that USD is only divisible to two decimal places.
False. USD is *infinitely* divisible. An example that any American would be familiar with is any gas station in the country. Have you seen a price like "$3.29 9/10"? They're charging $3.299 per gallon. That's three decimal places right there. Larger businesses often end up using over twenty decimal places for certain charges.
By contrast, bitcoin's eight decimal place divisibility is pathetic and laughable. Please make sure you know what you're talking about before writing articles.

No you're not. You're here for "lambos." You're not fooling anyone.


Hahahaha, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:30:10
lol if you believe a single word of that bullshit. None of that is even remotely true.
I swear bitcoiners are the most credulous people on the planet.
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:41:50
Yeah, I'm calling bullshit. There are waaaaaaay too many coincidences in your story. Then you end with "if you believe my story" and "its really not my address" as you ask people to send bitcoins? Please.
You "didnt want to take a picture of him or the taxi lisence in the car" because neither he nor it exists. This is a friend taking a photo of YOUR phone in YOUR car in an attempt to scam people into sending you bitcoins.
