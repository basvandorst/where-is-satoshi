It was just an example, I could make many more but it's not really worth delving into. Yeah you can make a statue out of butter, but you're probably better off using cement. Bitcoin accomplishes it's goals in the way it sees fit, but other goals may have better solutions. Maybe they aren't even better, they're just cheaper to develop and/or operate, or to maintain. This isn't a black and white thing. My overall point is that altcoins have a place, and you're welcome to disagree with that notion if you like, I just don't see it your way. I'm more of a "may the best technology win" kind of guy. And I don't even mean "win" as in "beat Bitcoin", I'm happy for all of the best tech projects to run side by side.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:44:14
Not all technology is alike, Bitcoin can't be the be-all-end-all. Different requirements and goals require different approaches. An example of that is Monero versus Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the ability to become a privacy coin technically, but it has political opposition to this concept -- primarily because privacy coins will more than likely face outlaw or extreme scrutiny as time goes on. My point is that there are technical reasons for altcoins to exist, and Bitcoin will never be the panacea. So again, the perspective of all altcoins being "money grabbers" or "shitcoins" is disingenuous.

I think what you are missing is that he thinks that about Libra, not Bitcoin.

It's denial at work. Trumps words indicate further troubles, they're cracking down on Libra hard (which is the only reason Trump bothered to post this Tweet) -- and so Bitcoin is going to face the same scrutiny now as a result. This is nothing but bad for Bitcoin, yeah yeah we got some publicity, but it's not going to outweigh the damage when Trump makes it much harder to buy/own/sell cryptocurrency and run a crypto business as a result of this. Moonboys will say that anything is good for Bitcoin.

How so? Regardless of whether it was converted to fiat or not, it still has that underlying fiat value. If he was to use the Bitcoin to buy goods he'd still get less than what he started with due to the market price drop. Sure he may skip some middleman fees, but the delays, price volatility and on-chain fees still resulted in a less than optimal transaction. Personally I think Bitcoin is a better digital gold than it is a transfer of value. Gold has a 7.8 trillion market cap, I see no reason Bitcoin can't match that and then exceed it due to it being digital and thus easier to obtain and store. Bitcoin doesn't need to serve the "transactional currency" use case to be successful.

You can relegate people to buying Bitcoin in back alleys and using cash trades because no exchanges can legally operate, but what would that do to adoption and the price? See you at $5.

@_date: 2019-08-07 03:17:38


Well you haven't looked hard enough or you need a refresher - there are projects with plenty of improvements over Bitcoin. I never saw Ethereum as close honestly. 


That's not very hard. Everyone asserts Bitcoin's decentralization, but it has a lot of problems - Bitcoin has a Chinese mining centralization and mining pool centralization problem with no end in sight. It's coin distribution isn't that great either, if that's one of your factors. I wouldn't say that coin distribution is a big problem, personally I don't mind a coin distribution disparity within reason, as all money has a natural tendency to form a pyramid - but I've seen others complain about it.


There are many variations of all of the consensus algorithms, so it's hard to know which one you are speaking of exactly - but if I am to refer to DPoS - to say that it's not as secure as PoW is false. There's little difference between having voting weight and having hash power from a general perspective. In one scenario, one has to control &gt;50% of the networks hash power, in the other scenario one has to control &gt;50% of the networks coin supply. If anything I'd say that owning half of the coins in circulation of a well circulated cryptocurrency is a much harder feat, and would be self defeating at that point - as to get to that position would require you to spend more money than you could possibly gain from an attack. Now, the caveat is obviously "well circulated" - not a problem for the projects I'm thinking of, but it _is_ a requirement that needs to be kept in mind. A PoS coin that wasn't distributed correctly or has a developer team with a really large ownership could be a threat to that system.
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:18:33
So fucking naive to actually believe that alts are "over". It boggles my mind that people can actually believe this sentiment. This is an ever evolving space, to assume that Bitcoin is the one and only for all eternity is ignorant as hell.

Because nobody uses the network. It's not special in any way. Like you said, DOGE beats Litecoin, but both are still boring old dated technology.
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:09:08


The same could be said about Bitcoin not long ago as well. Except for the fast and free part of course, because it's never had either of those properties. Not to mention that the good of "fast and free" is not restricted to having someone to transact with, it opens up a whole range of new money opportunities like service micropayments, arbitrage and settlement layers. Things not easily done with Bitcoin because it's slow and expensive.


For now... If you're playing cryptocurrency for short-term wins then you're in the wrong market. Patience is the deciding factor in most cases, including investing in Bitcoin.


You're missing the point and the big picture. It's not about cutting costs on your investment purchases, it's about replacing existing financial infrastructure. I thought that'd be obvious to a Bitcoiner... And don't tell me that fees aren't relevant, I remember paying $80 USD for a Bitcoin transaction during the last bubble - and that was mandatory if you wanted to be included in the next block.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:27:48
You have no idea what a payment channel is. Payment channels are not a solution to the scalability problem. They are for multiple transactions between same-party, not new transactions among new parties. Rattle off all of the buzzwords you like, it doesn’t mean you understand them. 
No idea why you’re talking about BCH either. Are you okay?
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:24:27
Or I could use a coin that isn't garbage.
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:56:37


I can't, as I'll get banned by the Bitcoin mods for "shilling". They're super light on the ban hammer if you don't appear to be a staunch Bitcoin maximalist. I actually own Bitcoin too purely for investment reasons, but that still won't stop me from getting banned for naming coins.


There's more than one way to skin a cat. In a highly scalable network there is no need for fee censorship resistance because there is no throughput bottleneck. Fees (read "rewards") are only a requirement if you have to outbid competitors to get your transactions validated, but if every transaction is getting validated then there's no reason to have rewards. Beyond that, it becomes a problem of spam - how can you prevent the network from having throughput bottlenecks if you have no fees? And the solution to that is dynamic proof of work. A highly scalable network with dynamic proof of work ends up serving the same goal of censorship resistance as fees does in a low throughput network, but it's different in perception for the consumer - with dynamic proof of work I don't need to adjust my coin balance to pay for my transaction, and I don't need a minimum amount of coin to perform a transaction. As such I find it's a much nicer solution to the problem in general as it is less of a blocker when using the network.
As for the identity being immaterial, I don't believe that to be the case - the reason I emphasized "Chinese" is because they're a close knit group of elite miners with the same nationality, and we know who they are - they're well known figureheads in the community. This has a much higher potential of collusion than truly unknown entities spread across the globe.


This is true, however there are solutions to this problem - one of them would be a fork with a blacklist until redelegation. It would be correct to say that a 51% attack in a PoW system (like Bitcoin) would be less of nuisance to the network than in the case of DPoS system, but personally I think the requirements of owning half the coin supply make it much less likely to happen to begin. Pros and cons on either side really.


One thing that I don't like about mining is that there is an economic incentive for using the largest mining pools. Not only is this a naturally centralizing force, but it means that in the case of bad actors, it's a struggle between "do I want to do what's best for the network" versus "do I want to do what's best for my pocket". They can choose to keep their hash power on a potentially dodgy mining pool and earn more consistent rewards, or they can take it elsewhere and risk not making bank. As far as I'm concerned this is a game theory weakness that shouldn't exist and is a result of misaligned incentives built into the system.
And on the note of privacy tokens, I don't actually think they're a good idea from an investment perspective - simply because they're going to face a lot of political opposition. I wish this wasn't the case and I wish all coins were truly private from a use-case and philosophical perspective, but I don't think it's something that Bitcoin or any other crypto trying to make a name for itself needs right now when they already face a mountain of hurdles as-is.

You might look at that chart and see negative, all I see is opportunity - and I can promise you I've made a fuckload more money in these markets than you have.
Anyway, back to the topic at hand hey? I'll reiterate my point that the market is ever-evolving, and to assume that Bitcoin is the be all end all is ignorant. Can you give me a _single_ solid reason as to why this isn't true? Or would you rather attempt to distract from my argument with lame personal attacks?

I think it'd be foolish for an exchange to ruin their reputation on such a feat. Not to mention that it'd require collusion among multiple exchanges as no single exchange is going to harbor 51% of the supply - and they'd all be ruining their reputations in the process, and potentially opening themselves up to legal prosecution. Still though, I understand your point and that is indeed a potential attack vector of PoS. It's worth factoring in for sure. 


Yeah, I'm very receptive to this approach. I say this to the people in the communities of the projects I follow, focus on building a large network first - worry about privacy techniques later. Perhaps Bitcoin is becoming old enough now to be able to slowly start adding more of these to the protocol.
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:17:54

@_date: 2019-08-20 02:16:11
Yeah, I didn't say Ethereum was good, just that it's more flexible for smart contracts. In saying that though, Bitcoin doesn't even remotely scale, so talking about Ethereum's scalability issues is a moot point. There are promising altcoins that are attempting to solve the scalability problems both from a currency perspective, and a smart contract perspective. Unfortunately for Bitcoin it's base layer is the issue, and I don't see that changing any time soon given the amount of power miners have. Sure you can slap bandaid solutions on the top as second layer protocols, but they're far from elegant and have a whole host of weaknesses. 
One day people will start to realize that second layer protocols are not the solution, the solution is to rebuild Bitcoin from the core up - the problem is that Bitcoin's consensus systems will never allow for this due to political pressure and it's game theory incentives. Speaking of which, there are altcoins that are attempting to solve that problem as well - in-built decentralized governance. Although the particular project I'm thinking of will also fail because it uses mining. 
Whenever you create a system that relies on external investment, those participants will fight to maintain their external investment. The only game theory incentive that a network should create is preserving the investment of the coins you hold, nothing else (such as preserving the investment of mining hardware). That way, the ONLY goal always remains the health of the system, it's not a struggle between the health of the system and preserving billions of dollars worth of mining hardware.

They could hide it on a piece of paper in their moms attic and it’d probably be as secure because nobody is going to think to look there. 
So nah, not really interested in reading their fiction book. Thanks though. It’s just a PR stunt. These two twins are self important trust fund babies and made most of their fortune by suing Zuckerberg over a platform that was only mildly similar to their vision, and probably would have failed under their direction.

Tell that to the public. It's about novice perception.

Not hard to call it if you're the one dumping all the coins.

\&gt;  It looks like the big difference with Hodl Hodl is that they're non-custodial and use multisig
This doesn't mean they can get away with it. They're a centralized exchange. They're playing with fire and they're either too stupid to realize this, or they're living in the Caymans and think they can get away with it for long enough. In either case it's not good.  
Anyway the biggest reason why they aren't as worried about this as LBTC is because they don't serve US customers. But they should still be worried.

Hey bud, I don’t care what fairytale they told you in a book you wasted your money on. If you believe any of it you’re a fool.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:07:51
Why would they remove cash trades? They're perfectly legal. Also, fuck off with all the advertisements in here. This isn't Facebook.

Uh, I just linked an aggregation of the volume of all the leading exchanges. Go look at Kraken's volume right now, then go look at Bitstamp. Then go look at Bitfinex. All of those exchanges are about half of the volume they were at the start of 2018. There'll be other examples too, but I'm not going to do all of the work for you, you're clearly too stupid to research this yourself -- even after I provided you with hard evidence.


We don't have any volatility right now genius, we have parabolic rise. Volatility is up and down movement, not just up movement. There's barely any buy volume but there's practically zero sell volume, hence why the price is easily climbing. Overall, low volume, but enough to cause this sort of price movement when there's no opposing resistance. Learn the basics before arguing please.


I'm doing fine, thanks for the concern.

Their platform is centralized, hosted on a single web-server controlled by them. It's not a peer-to-peer network like Bisq (or uTorrent for example). Don't argue about things you don't understand clown. They don't hold funds because they use multisig, but they're still a central target for authorities.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:58:13
\-- \^ This is the sentiment of your average user.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:21:57
That's because this is price manipulation. Look at the volume, there's barely any. Look at the transaction fee chart, the network is barely being used. The only reason the price is going up is because there's no sell orders. All it'll take is a large whale or two to get a big sell off going and this'll all burn to the ground. Compare the volume now to the last bubble which was able to sustain all of the selling. This is all artificial bullshit. Now, I'm not saying it can't go higher, it most certainly can. I'm just saying that when the manipulators decide to pull the plug it's going to crash HARD, so be prepared for the down turn when it strikes.
@_date: 2019-06-07 00:25:10
Yeah man, cause we want everyone to think that Bitcoin technology such as Bitcoin ATM's is so insecure that it'll randomly give your money away to people accidentally. Such a great ad!
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:03:54
An exchange that doesn't service the US because it's trying to circumvent KYC laws, hosted in the US. Genius!
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:12:35
I can't help it if you're this gullible. Nobody with money distances themselves from it by this degree, and I can say that from experience. Believe what you want, but I can promise you that this is fiction. So one of your 12 banks disappears (flood, natural disaster, whatever) and you can't restore any of your private keys and lose a billion dollars? Yeah, okay.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:45:38
Haha, people actually believe this nonsense? It's called misdirection, in reality they probably just keep their Bitcoin on a Trezor, but obviously they're going to make up some bullshit like this to make themselves sound "super secure" so that they don't get kidnapped for ransom or worse. Anyone with money needs the ability to off-load it in a hurry, especially something as volatile and risky as Bitcoin. You think they're going to fly to 12 stops across the country just to get access to their coins?
@_date: 2019-09-02 05:45:03
Yes it is. Bitcoin took 3 years to bubble last time with a higher market cap than all of that alts at the moment. Seriously man, you're clueless.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:17:32
Good, the cream will rise to the top. But there's a difference between "many" and "all", so OP is the drama queen not me.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:16:47
No, it would prove that Bitcoin is not any better than fiat money. That's like saying if MySpace fails then it proves all social media platforms are not useful. How are you people able to come up with such nonsensical logic? It's astounding.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:28:26
Do you know what "alt" means? It means alternative to Bitcoin... So yes, ETH is an alt by definition. The hell are you talkin about?
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:25:04
You'd have to be pretty stupid to think that altcoins won't have more big bubbles in their future. Is anyone actually buying this Bitcoin maximalist "altcoin season is never going to happen" hokum? The more you push this cancerous narrative the more evident it becomes to rational people that the maximalists have lost the plot. I understand that you're trying to protect your Bitcoin investment by dissuading people from buying alts, but it's very transparent and makes you look foolish.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:39:43
You're severely delusional, but whatever. Your loss.
@_date: 2019-09-03 07:06:58
Of course they do, they're following the law.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:33:17
The cult of Bitcoin in full effect. Newsflash: There is better tech out there than Bitcoin. It's severely losing the tech race, and the ONLY reason it's surviving is network effect. That's not something you bank your future on. If you were smart you'd look into the way this ecosystem is evolving instead of pinning all of your hopes and dreams on old stale technology. The invention of the lightbulb did not come from continuous development of the candle.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:58:57
The fact that you think looking at the charts for the last 19 months is evidence to you of your belief being correct is actually evidence of your delusion. You have no idea how any of this works, 19 months is peanuts. Get back to me when you've been here for 8 years like I have, then maybe you'll understand how the market cycles work.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:30:15
So you're arguing against yourself? What is it, the shit alts will never recover or the shit alts "float"? Make up your mind.
Garbage coins will not make it, end of story. There are plenty of promising cryptocurrencies though.
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:50:48
These guys need to stop spamming this subreddit, I see their advertisements here constantly and it’s really annoying.
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:21:37
I don't pump coins, I cycle accounts every 6months or so for privacy. My statement still stands though regardless of my account age. As someone who works in software, adding on complexity on complexity never ends well. If the system becomes spaghetti it's time for a rewrite and a hard evaluation and analysis of the core problems you're trying to solve to solve them from the ground up. With Bitcoin this is no easy task because you have to juggle consensus, and large modifications to the core require hard forks which always end up in political landscape -- but it's an unfortunate side effect we should be aware of.
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:18:32
More hacks on top of hacks. Bitcoin needs to be reworked from the ground up. Slapping on all of these complex messy layers on top doesn't do anyone any good.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:55:16
That's simply incorrect. But this isn't a discussion about other coins, and even if I wanted to discuss other coins it's not possible because mods will ban you for it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:06:16
I'm not saying not to use layers, I'm saying to use a purpose built foundation. The foundation needs to be built with the future layers in mind, otherwise it results in hacks. The core issue is that once hard rules have been introduced into the Bitcoin protocol they're almost impossible to change. It's kind of like building a car that always pulls to the right, and instead of fixing that issue by adjusting the weight distribution of the car you instead create software that artificially pulls to the car to the left to compensate. What if that system fails though? Then the car veers off the road. But in a car that was designed with the correct foundation, this problem would never exhibit itself. 
It boils down to the blockchain design itself. There are modifications that could be done to this architecture that solve the problems, but they won't happen because they'd require large consensus changes. It's an unfortunate reality -- due to the very thing that makes Bitcoin valuable (it's decentralised nature) it also makes it immensely difficult to improve. That's why it's a case of constant monkey patching and hacks on top of hacks -- because otherwise hard forks are required, and we all know how those go.
