True, but it's similar to how email and the internet become more difficult to use in certain regards. The amount of advertising and malware is greater than ten years ago. It grows with the size of the network. If Bitcoin wasn't valuable, nobody would spend money on an expensive attack like this.

You get a sort-of-Bitcoin that is always worth $1 when you turn it in. It automatically converts to the right number of Satoshis when you use it. 
For that you need a trusted price information source (the oracle) that everybody agrees on. Also it's a little cumbersome to do it with Bitcoin's scripting language.

It can be used as a store of value and as a currency. Nobody ever claimed that it is a perfect analogy. Ignoring asteroids (crazy, I know), Gold really is scarce, it is relatively easily divisible and fungible (even more so than Bitcoin).

The original point was about how OP could not transact with Bitstamp because he had to go through Chase, which refused to allow both parties to make a transaction. The first paragraph of the Bitcoin paper is:


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution.
The fact that the fiat side of exchanges can be attacked is the entire point of Bitcoin. Once you're in it, you're independent of third parties. If everybody used Bitcoin, there would be not Chase bank to approve transactions. You don't need wallet providers at all, you just need a client.

Let me explain again: We have relatively few exchanges, many operating under dodgy conditions in far-away countries because regulation makes it too difficult and risky to start an exchange in the US. Result: little competition, exchanges that are completely beyond the reach of US law enforcement. Solution: Obviously even more regulation!

here's the unminified version:


Looks like it tries to use a better (unfortunately non-standardized) random function first, after using a very questionable browser check, and falls back on Math.random() otherwise. 
What's worse is that these random values, which might not even be that bad, seem to  used to initialize the RC4 PRNG which is completely broken and inappropriate for any crypto. 
TL;DR stay the fuck away from brainwallet.org
EDIT: seems like we're just getting started here
`Math.random()` is never used at all, since the block is only ever executed when `rng_pool == null`, which is never the case, since js variables start out as `undefined`. This whole code block looks like inaptly ported C code.
You can easily test this by going to brainwallet.org, opening the developer console with ctrl-shift-j and type in `rng_pool` and see that it is completely initialized with zeros. If you click random a few times, it's initialized with the not-so-random current unix time.
Has nobody ever noticed that brainwallet.org starts out with the same "random value" every time you visit the site?
**TL;DR if your funds are stored on a "randomly generated" key generated by brainwallet.org, move your bitcoin IMMEDIATELY** 
---- 
EDIT2: correction: `undefined == null`  is true in JS because of type coercion, but rng_pool is still initialized with 0 for some other reason
EDIT3: by the way, this happens to your funds if you're unlucky enough and don't click the 'random' button at all: 
That's the default address. If you clicked it once, it can probably be brute-forced trivially, if you clicked it more often, it's *slightly* more difficult. 
---- 
EDIT4: The initial value is generated by the stupid default passphrase, not because of the uninitialized rng. My bad.

Neat stunt, however I don't think there's proof that this is not just a random file. Some thoughts on how to prove that it actually contains the SK:
1. Get a credible and trustworthy witness to testify that it is indeed the purported file. One could figure out a way in which the risk of theft is minimized if you don't want to trust the witness 100%. 
1. Withdraw the funds after a while and reveal the password. Better scream "stop sending me money" a while before doing that.
EDIT: one way to do (1) with minimal risk would be this:
1. owner and witness agree on a trustworthy computer
1. witness provides an inspectable program that outputs `correct` if the owner can decrypt the file that contains the private key.
1. owner enters password on trusted machine and runs inspected program, witness sees `correct` or `incorrect`

100% this. Quoting Christian Decker: 


reduce the fees that the miners may collect, it increases their reach
into transactions that they could not otherwise serve.


completely unfeasible in Bitcoin due to the high transaction fees. The
transaction fees are high because an on-chain payment requires a lot
of resources, i.e., storage, processing and bandwidth. These
applications suddenly become possible with L2 protocols, so this adds
to the reach of Bitcoin itself.


transactions will be settled in a certain timeframe, for its
security. Hence, Lightning will always attach higher than average fees
to the on-chain transactions for setup and settlement of its
channels. This is okay since coins on these channels may have been
transferred hundreds if not millions of times back and forth, so the
these high on-chain fees have been amortized over time, and we happily
pay them.


usual fees for setup and settlement, I'm absolutely convinced that
miners will have a net gain when Lightning rolls out. Lightning is not
cutting into the miner's profit, it opens up new possibilities.

No, please carefully watch it again. It explains how A opens a new "single funded channel" to B with what is called a "full push". You can find these terms explained here as well:

It is the same concept that you explained in your first step - somebody wants to pay a seller, and if there is no path between them, they have to establish a new channel. If you buy bitcoin from a friend or an exchange (you are the seller of fiat), they will create a new channel to you.

With low-value transactions happening off-chain, there be less competition for on-chain blockspace. This should lower fees. I don't see why it should be that expensive.


You will probably buy bitcoin that is already locked in a channel. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:03:49

Yeah fiat debt is awesome

Wait so if I buy $1000 of BTC from some exchange 'already in a channel' and that exchance goes bust or whatever, what happens to the BTC when I close the channel? I lose it?
No, you will always get your amount when closing a channel.


What if the other side closes the channel (either party can close at any time), how do I get my remaining BTC back?
Not sure what you mean with "remaining". If you buy 1000$ of BTC from an exchange, they will open an LN channel with capacity of maybe $2000 where $1000 is allocated to you. It behaves like any other LN channel, your $1000 is safe and cannot be taken by the counterparty.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:23:14
So new users to bitcoin will not necessarily have to create a new channel when they want to make their first bitcoin purchase, it is possible that they use the channel that is already established with the exchange, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:50:13




Why? If you withdraw bitcoin from an exchange, just give them your return address.


The creation of payment channels is described extensively, why does it matter if it's between you and a merchant or an exchange and you?


Edit: Maybe there is a misunderstanding: when a normal user buys bitcoin from somebody else, the sender will in all likelihood establish a LN payment channel to the recipient.

@_date: 2017-11-10 12:25:51
Sorry, are you disagreeing with me or Tadge here? 


Then a payment didn't happen, in which case you complain to the exchange. Exchanges can always refuse to pay out, we're seeing it every day. That's not a problem with LN.


You can spend it anywhere on the exchange is also connected to. 
Take a look at the lnd setup example: 
At the point where Alice creates a channel with Bob, he does not have any bitcoin. He receives it from Alice.

It is both. The Schroedinger metaphor does not apply since both properties are not mutually exclusive. 
Gold was used as a currency for many years, so it is less terrible than the alternatives.


If you argue that the depreciation of fiat makes it attractive to spend, it also means that it is unattractive to receive. This is why demand has to be created via legal tender laws.
A merchant has an incentive to give a discount for a deflationary asset (even bigger discount when there is no risk of fraudulent chargeback). You can argue that the consumption pattern of bitcoiners is different than that of non-bitcoiners, but they also have economic activity. 


Governments rarely act purely in the interest of the governed. If central-bank fiat money was clearly superior than alternatives, governments would allow free banking.

Few of them have the interesting properties bitcoin has, one of which is that it *also* be used as a form of payment (albeit with some difficulties)


It was killed off 


That may be "good for society" (also debatable), but it's not necessarily good for the individual economic actor.


You don't know how much money you have lost due to indirectly covering (fraudulent) chargebacks of other customers. 


If both have the same price, nobody. But if there is a discount, some will take the risk. 
Also you can have chargeback protection with bitcoin, using multsig escrow.

@_date: 2017-11-10 10:55:57




No, because if you fist buy a plain UTXO and establish a new channel later on, that is a higher fee. 
As a normal user buying bitcoin, you will already be connected to a network with your first purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:40:21
1. You are correct, people must choose to spend their Bitcoin to feed hungry people. In Venezuela some people mine Bitcoin to do exactly that. Given that many people are starving due to political sanctions (Yemen), Bitcoin is a great tool for helping them.
2. Everybody who buys Bitcoin is rewarded, not just early adopters.
3. Only a tiny minority will have seen these gains. It is hard to imagine the societal problems will be worse than the ones in the current financial system.
4. Bitcoin does not preclude traditional investments. You can choose to invest your Bitcoin in shares. Governments have very limited means to do anything about it. It is not align with the interests of Jamie diamond, but most people see this as a bonus.

A hardware wallet like a Trezor is an actual wallet that deserves the name.

I have a thing for bad criticism


Aren't banks almost as hated as cable companies in the US? What rebates is he talking about?


Apparently not. I wonder also if he stores his wealth in USD.


No, that's the whole point of Bitcoin. But if he admits that, his argument collapses, and deep down he knows it.


He needs to assert that people love and trust their banks, without numbers to back it up. The fact is that most don't have an alternative yet.


The fact that banks and government are mentioned as if they were the same is the root of the problem. They are not supposed to be.


As if there was no financial crisis and as if bail-in wasn't a possibility.


So because government monopolized these services, does them badly, it should do everything?
Does he think coinbase and it's customers is protected by the military and nukes? Glad he wasn't in charge when MtGox went down.
Exchange reputation is the main regulating factor.


He spent paragraph after paragraph explaining that nobody will use Bitcoin, but suddenly we need to make sure that it won't happen?

No amount of petition-signing and subreddit-shitstorming will stop companies and governments from doing this. 
These are the arguments why this is no reason to be worried:
* This is not a new idea
* The markets are not worried about it
* There will be technical solutions
* Bitcoin doesn't care if people are nice

You are incorrect in your assessment about the value of Bitcoin. There are many reasons for using it as a payment method besides novelty. More information in the sidebar.
As for the question of morality: There is no element of force or fraud in the bitcoin technology. Bitcoin is a tool. It facilitates voluntary transactions, which makes in moral in my opinion.
Some people think that the voluntary transactions between individuals are always of concern to outside parties, which I completely disagree with. These will have a problem with the morality of Bitcoin.

efficiently than government-backed, physical money.71 Currency serves three primary functions.
First, it serves as a medium of exchange.72 Second, it acts as a unit of account and a measure of
relative worth.73 Third, currency acts as a store of value of current earnings for future spending.74
Digital currencies like Bitcoin have the potential to perform each of these roles more efficiently than
traditional fiat currencies.

Because nobody in the right mind would describe the Bitcoin as a safe and stable investment. Not even a month ago, it was worth 30% less than today. 
Nobody knows if Bitcoin will have value years from now. Personally, I'm betting that it does, but I know that I might lose my investment.

Good article. Let me just add some suggestions, to give Bitcoin a public face and detach it from Silk Road. (Because convincing people that Silk Road is not bad is too hard)
1. Join or start a local meetup group
* Sell Bitcoin on  - I've met some people who just heard about Bitcoin and weren't tech savy enough to buy at an online exchange. I'm not even selling under a pseudonym, to increase trustworthiness. 
* Introduce Bitcoin to your friends - don't push it, nobody likes an evangelist. But gift them a QR code with a few bitcoins as a bonus birthday present. You can even include the birthday in the amount as a gag (like 0.19850204 BTC) 
* If you're in academics, especially computer science or economics, do your term paper, thesis, presentation about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:49:17
