I think that people should investigate by themselves (that's part of the fun) but there are so many posts that are repeating incorrect information that I want to help a little bit.
The following information is simplified and may contain errors, if you want the full technical details read the BIPs 
The Address: If an address starts with a 3 it only means it's using the BIP13 P2SH address format. The original purpose was to be able to send BTC to a redeemScript using a short address BIP16. One special case of a redeemScript is multisignature transactions. SegWit BIP141 also uses this format for P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH and P2WSH-nested-in-P2SH addresses. The only way to know which case it is, is by looking at the transactions from that address. 
There are no outgoing transactions from the current prize address but there is one from the previous one 3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8, in there you can see that the previous address was P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH. Although technically the new one could be different I think it's reasonable to assume is of the same type unless there is evidence of the contrary. To check transaction details you can go to  or better to  and paste the code in  
Private Key Generation: Now, to spend the BTC you need the private key related to the public key. Technically that is just a number and it could be generated in different ways but a strong possibility in this case is that it has to do with the BIP39 words in the picture, if it is using BIP39 that suggests that is also using BIP32 for generating HD wallets. 
Since HD wallets can have multiple levels, the BIP43 standarized a purpose level and BIP44 is a specific case of BIP43 with more levels. BIP49 is basically a copy of BIP44 but for P2WPH-nested-in-P2SH addresses so it has a different purpose number to be intentionally incompatible with BIP44 wallets. 
The site  also has a BIP141 tab, the BIP32 and BIP141 tabs generate the same private and public keys for the same derivation path, they just encode the addresses differently.
All of this is to say that you can't get the purpose number only from the address but BIP49 sounds promising.
Words: Assuming that the solution to the puzzle is a mnemonic sentence using BIP39 words, the sentence can have 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words. For every 3 words there is a bit of checksum so for 3 random BIP39 words you have a 1/2 chance that the sentence is valid, for 12 (4 bits of checksum) the chance is 1/16. If the sentence is valid it is converted (using a passphrase if present) to a seed which then can be used to generate the keys using BIP32 (or other methods). Assuming the sentence has 12 words, even if you know the words but not the order, those are around 12!/16 valid sentences (if you are not using the full BIP39 dictionary the number can be different depending on the distribution of the words).
Picture: 
* There are 116 BIP39 words in total and 50 inside the circle, always including capitalized words. 
* The frequency to size of the words match (mostly) if you use the version of the whitepaper in  convert it to text and split (add spaces to) some formulas.
* The font for most of the text is "Work Sans" and the lambda symbol uses "Apple SD Gothic Neo" but I don't know the font for the "FULLWIDTH EQUALS SIGN" and the .notdef glyph.
