No, they aren't doing exactly what he's worried about - "micro$oft log my every keystroke" - they collect the same telemetry data that every single major operating system (mobile, desktop, and server) and every single major website collects.

Do you use any Apple or Google products? Hell, where are you searching when you "open a browser", and what browser is it?

KYC/AML most certainly applies to registered Money Services Businesses... Which, again, BitInstant was, of their own volition.

Bitcoin wasn't money, it was an asset. The money that BTCking was paying for them was in fact money.
It would have been the same if Shrem was selling gold and helped someone get around KYC/AML (gold sellers also register as money services businesses)
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:51:33
That has very little to do with what we are talking about. If you register as an MSB there are rules you need to follow...
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:47:03
Did you even read the indictment? BitInstant registered as a money services business on **March 26th, 2012**, so AML/KYC obligations most certainly did apply to them...
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:17:45
Being a registered MSB puts one under certain legal obligations - failing to fulfill them is what Shrem has been arrested for.
I don't get why you find this so hard to understand.

I may have misspoken slightly... Transaction ID is still a unique identifier once it's in the block chain... It's only malleable before being included in a block.

@_date: 2014-01-27 23:03:26
BTCKing wasn't sending them bitcoins, he was sending them cash money.
As a registered money services business, they were obligated to follow the anti-money laundering and know your customer laws that apply to money services business, and they simply did not.
Its really not that complicated.

Two men are drinking in a bar at the top of the Empire State Building.
The first says to the other, "I discovered last week that if you jump from the top of this building, the winds whipping around the skyscrapers will stop your fall around the 10th floor and blow you into a window that is always open there."
"Yeah right," says the second guy, so the first guy goes over to the window, opens it and jumps out. The second guy rushes over and leans out the window, watching the first guy fall.
As he watches, he sees the first guy slow and then get blown sideways and into the window, just like he said he would. He turns to say something to the bartender, but the bartender just shakes his head and wipes out a glass.
After a minute, the first guy walks in from the elevator. "See? I told you it would work!"
The second guy says, "No way! It must have been a fluke! There's no way that could happen again." So the first guy goes back over to the window and jumps out again. Just like before, the wind slows him down and whips him into the 10th story window.
"That's unreal!" he says to the bartender, but the bartender just shakes his head again and keeps cleaning.
When the first guy gets back to the bar, the second guy finishes off his beer and says, "My turn!" Before anyone can stop him, he lunges out the window and passes right by the 10th story window and splatters on the sidewalk.
The bartender looks at the first guy and says, " You know what superman? You can be a real dick when you're drunk."

I don't consider it much of a crime either, but the stuff he did as admin of the silk road is far far more involved with criminal activity than what backpage does - it would be like if they took a cut of the actual prostitution instead of just by being paid to run ads for escorts and were actually pimping girls themselves on the site and beating up Johns who didn't pay...

@_date: 2015-04-03 18:10:44
1. Have the Secretary of the Treasure, Attorney General, and Secretary of State determined that Snowden did any of the things listed? No.
2. Did Snowden actually do anything that could be construed as "harming ... a computer or network of computers that support one or more entities in a critical infrastructure sector" (which is the main qualifier in section i)? No.
3. Was Snowden responsible for "the receipt or use for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain, or by a commercial entity, outside the United States of trade secrets misappropriated through cyber-enabled means" (which is the main qualifier in secion ii)? Also no.
So, in summary - No.

As the value of coins has gone up, the number of people mining has increased. This is evidence that there is a correlation between the two, but not necessarily causation.
An increase in value of bitcoins causes an increase in the value of mining, thus making it more attractive to more people.
As more people mine, the difficulty goes up.
Ergo, an increase in the value of bitcoins is likely to lead to an increase in difficulty.

The government can't decide one day to seize all your bitcoins over $100,000. They cannot arbitrarily print $100,000,000 more of them and devalue everybody else's. They can't stop allowing bitcoin transactions for things your government doesn't approve of.

IIRC when you import a private key, some wallets will use that as a change address, so you could end up with your change from a transaction going to a private key that you don't exclusively control...

They aren't really an exchange - you can't easily buy/sell BTC back and forth for USD. Funds from sales are deposited in your bank account and take a day or two to be accessible.
In my mind an exchange allows you to trade back and forth with the same funds.

It is running the entirety of what makes bitcoin useful in the first place. This includes verifying transactions, encrypting the entire system from attack, and ensuring transaction fees are paid. This is both computationally intensive and of huge value.
Consider how much power it takes to run Visas entire payment system. How much processing power Wells Fargo needs for their banking system.... Its orders of a magnitude more efficient I imagine.

You are kind of all over the place, could you stick to one subject?
Its without question that Mutum Singulum LLC (based in the US) failed to register as an MSB. If Gox "adheres to all the rules on their turf", why did their US subsidiary fail to adhere to all the rules on its turf?
It doesn't really matter what I think is an MSB - it matters what the government defines as an MSB, and what Mutum Singulum thinks is an MSB. If Mutum Singulum truly believes that they shouldn't have had to register as an MSB for reasons X,Y, and Z, they are entitled to make that argument to the courts.
Though I cannot see that argument holding much weight - they were pretty clearly acting as an MSB.

A bitcoin transaction is basically:
I am the owner of the bitcoins at [public key X], I wish to send them to [public key Y], signed [private key X]
Confirmations are miners confirming that the transaction is valid (i.e. public and private key signature match up) - to falsify a confirmation would be to have broken the public key cryptography used by the bitcoin network, which is mathematically unfeasible.

10,000 Jalapenos only adds up to 50 Thash (10,000 x 5,000 Mhash = 50,000,000 Mhash = 50 Thash)
Current Thash is 75, so 10,000 Jalapenos alone don't even double the hashrate.
The Red section is cumulative, it assumes 10,000 of each type of miner have shipped. Should I add BTC/day and USD/day to the Yellow group?

Of course not - one would have to know more information than has been released to figure out the value in USD at the time of transaction...
But it isn't unreasonable to say that the total value of their commission is currently $80 million and the current value of their total sales is $1.2 billion - that is what they would have if they kept it all in BTC.

I'm sorry but no. You should not be importing other people's private keys unless you and the payee know exactly what you are doing.
When you import a private key, some wallets will use that as a change address, so you could end up with your change from a transaction going to a private key that you don't exclusively control...

Because all a paper wallet really is is a paper version of the password that says "these are my coins" to an address on the blockchain. The coins don't really "live" on the paper wallet, just the authentication to spend them.

It is to prevent people from buying more than $3,000 worth in a day.

Thats all well and good - I hope that too. But bitcoin is designed specifically to be beyond the influence of our hopes and desires for the currency - or anyone else's, for that matter.
If bitcoin can't survive the scrutiny that comes from being associated with drugs today in its infancy, it will never be able to withstand the future scrutiny that would come from it actually playing some significant part in the international economy.
In addition - if some anonymous person is able to discredit bitcoins in the eye of the everyday person, that means that anyone could do so. Bitcoin (both as a protocol and as an idea) needs to be able to withstand these attacks head-on.

The government can't decide one day to seize all your bitcoins over $100,000. They cannot arbitrarily print $100,000,000 more of them and devalue everybody else's. They can't stop allowing bitcoin transactions for things your government doesn't approve of.
