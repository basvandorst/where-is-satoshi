Hmm another down vote. I'm noticing a trend

Sorry didn't realize this was a grammar issue and not an investment issue.

How do we get hospitals and schools without taxes? And what happens when theres a solar flare and the crypto data gets lost?

I totally agree about the government and irs.

Well that's just not true. I just don't understand how it's going to become the new currency. How do you tax untraceable money?
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:01:56
Lol, someone down voted... That's not a good argument. I want to know why I should put my money in this?

Idk, I just don't see this take over of government happening. If it comes close or gets to big resulting in loss of tax revenue, I think they'll shut it down. Label bitcoin as fraudulent currency and have the irs hunt people that use it.

Fair enough, but how will poor people adapt to this new system, 1 coin costs over 10k dollars, a price that a larger portion of our society can't really afford to invest in? How do they acquire it?
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:12:13
It does, it's called the dollar...
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:21:44
Thank you, that's what I'm starting to see.

No the people came up with it bud. I totally agree that we have to do something about the corruption of the banks, government, and crony capitalism tho.

The one that's always worked and is backed by all the world governments and companies... Dont get me wrong, I'd like to see some changes but I don't think throwing it away for internet coins is neccisarily the answer. How are these things going to retain value if more, different coins can be made? It looks like the trading car or beeny baby model to me. Why am I wrong.

Thanks for the honest advice.

I figure the best research would be found in a community of enthusiasts. I've looked at the peer to peer aspect and the privacy that comes with it and I just want to see other peoples opinion on why itll work out in our favor.
