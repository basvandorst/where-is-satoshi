Definitely. Paper wallets just means physical storage. Cryptosteel all the way!

This is my biggest beef with everyone praising these hardware wallets! Maybe I see it more than most being a programmer, but these things die/fry/break. I'll take paper wallets anyday for storing my coins.

Smart, makes total sense to do this. But you're still relying on some physical storage in the end. I think trezor and the like have a place in this world. But for bitcoin n00bs, I think paper wallets (not necessarily on paper) are a better practice and help you to understand the technology better. I could be wrong and I appear to be in the minority. Cryptosteel just makes me feel better.

Dividing a Bitcoin is more like taking a dollar and turning them into 100 pennies, not printing more dollars.

Any you suggest?

Possible collision? I'd transfer the money out of that address to a new one. You could leave the $20 in there for awhile if you're feeling nice.

Maybe if two people want to have some sort of "shared" bank account, then it could be used in practice. Think of your 12 word phrase activating a pointer to the bitcoin. You could have potentially infinite pointers to the same private key, but as soon as one of those pointers decides to use the bitcoin all the other pointers will just be pointing to an address with no bitcoin in it. (assuming they spent all the bitcoin) Not sure if I helped clear up your question

Vegas changes at such a fast pace that if the Bitcoin trend didn't pick up in the first month they implemented it, it becomes an afterthought or abandoned altogether. If it becomes more mainstream down the road they'll definitely pick it up. But they have enough lawyers figuring out their tax loopholes they probably didn't want another thing like cryptocurrency in the mix for the few that would want to use it.

I'll take that bet
