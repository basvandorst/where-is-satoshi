@_date: 2014-01-30 01:25:57
That's a pretty fucked way of looking at it.  I don't see how the price of BTC at any time is even relevant.  Just because the market says a BTC is worth this much doesn't mean that if someone owes me USD they can pay me with BTC instead, and vice versa.  If I accidentally gave you an apple by mistake, I can't demand you give me 30 cents -- I could give you the **option** to pay me for it, but first I would ask for the apple back.  If you refused, then I would have to go through a legal collection process and perhaps sue you.   But if I took it upon myself to not even tell you I made a mistake, then just took 30 cents out of your pocket without asking, that's WRONG.

Coinbase is next. They put on a good front but underneath the surface they're a bunch of Wall Street rats who do not give a flying fuck about individual customers. They care about their business and that's it. Their system integrity and accounting practices are a joke. Their customer service reps wear fake smiles and use cute language to cover their shady practices and bullshit lies.
In their terms of service you agree to hold them liable for NO DAMAGES whatsoever (so if their system loses your BTC, you have no recourse) -- how can you prove that they didn't steal your BTC when they claim you must have been hacked?  Answer:  you can't, and since this is unregulated, nobody will ever know.  
You also waive all rights to any class action lawsuit against them.  Bet you didn't bother to read those terms when you signed up.  And we're supposed to believe these guys are somehow good for bitcoin?

I would like to argue for a decoupling of smart phones from the "MUST DO EVERYTHING" imperative.  As technology gets smaller and more efficient, it is not necessary to put it on your phone.  You could wear it on your neck, on your finger, or put it on a key ring. 
I do not want my phone to be my wallet, ever.  I do not see wireless technology being terribly useful to pay for things either, when most people will ALWAYS want to see something physical at the point of sale.  They will need to see a receipt, a confirmation, give some kind of action.   The negates most of the usefulness of wireless.  However, I do agree that opening your phone, opening an app, scanning a QR code, is a very inefficient process as well.  I would prefer to swipe a card that holds my bitcoins.

I'm pretty sure there is no choice, that's how escrow works.  You don't get to just pay when you get your product... otherwise people would never pay for anything.  Similarly, the seller doesn't get to just keep your bitcoins without sending something first.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:36:46
There are fees to purchase bitcoins (1% via coinbase), and it also takes time and effort which is an additional cost to factor.  Then there is the time spent securing your bitcoins which *right now* means investing a lot of research and energy into understanding complicated technology, and is not worth it for most people.  This easily shadows the 3% fees that merchants charge to cover their credit card fees.
I'm not saying these things won't change but to say that all that needs to happen is merchants need to start accepting it and then people will start using bitcoin is in my opinion overly optimistic, if not disingenuous and naive.

Actually it doesn't really matter what he did with them if he's offering to give them back.  He wasn't given that opportunity until now it seems like -- probably only because Coinbase wants to make themselves look good in what has become a front page reddit post, not because they actually give a shit.

I know it's just a matter of semantics but it's not really a DDoS just because multiple nodes might be partaking.  DDoS is intended to describe situations where something like a botnet is leveraged to attack using the power granted by the number of nodes, that one node could not otherwise do on its own.  In this case, just one node is all that's needed (until it's blacklisted or something by other nodes), in which case another single node could be enlisted.

First post by livnxxl, 11 upvotes in under 20 seconds, hmm...  I wonder if Coinbase has a PR patrol for reddit that does shady shit like calls people who complain about legitimate issues liars.
Story seems pretty legit to me, and it doesn't matter what he did with the 20 BTC after they put it in his account really, since *he admits* he owes them 20 BTC - that's hardly being dishonest.   The issue is that Coinbase made a mistake and charged him for it rather than contacting him about what happened.  If Coinbase effed up, it's their responsibility to collect on the 20 BTC.  I'm pretty sure a lawyer would agree -- which might not be a bad idea if the charge dispute with your credit card doesn't go in your favor.  But I'd be surprised if it didn't.

The anonymity of the transaction should be left to the donor actually.  You can give them tips but would not recommend promising anonymity. The donor can be responsible for that part.  This is bad advice.
Edit: Downvotes really?  Let me explain why this is bad advice.  Publicly verifiable receiving addresses are a good thing because the donor can clearly see this is the real address to send btc to (after some time).  If you provide a fresh address there is much less certainty of ownership..  This allows a MITM attack to insert its own rogue address for interception of the btc, as just one risk example. 
  Stick with one public address... let the donor figure out how to  make their side of it anonymous.

I think by law they have to.  They never gave him an option to give back the bitcoins, or explained what happened, why it happened, and how it could be resolved, which would be what consumer law in California dictates.  Besides, how hard would it be to say 'We reversed the transaction, please send 20 BTC to this address within 48 hours' or something -- the blockchain is verifiable!  Why not use it?  They can at least use that as proof that he did or didn't pay up, and if he didn't, they could easily go after him with legal force.  But I don't think they want to.  I think they want their customers to bend over and take it in the ass, while they come onto reddit and act like they care.

 Both  would  make  you a  target.   Risk  is  not  binary,  however.   This tells  every  website  you  visit  you  have a  coinbase account ( if the plugin  is active ).   Visiting  bitcoin  sites tells only  your ISP  the  same thing,  but  every site  you  visit  doesn't  get  your  browsing history.
I  didn't say  your coinbase  wallet is at  risk  though.   But  perhaps  you  wish  to  move btc off  to a usb  wallet,  at which  point  you expose  the  coins  to  any  malware  you  may  have  on  your  machine.   You're  at a  much  higher  risk  of  having  btc  stealing  malware to  begin  with  if  you  place a target  on  your  back  that  websites can see.  There  are  no  storage  of  stories  on  here  of  targeted  theft  happening  like  this  so  it's  not FUD,  it's  about  being  aware of  what  your  browser  leaks,  that's  all

That makes no sense.  You can be paid in bitcoin.  People *are* already paid in bitcoin.  A central issuing authority is not a prerequisite unless I've been misinformed.  That's just the way it is, not the way it has to be.  You can clean someone's house for gum if you agree to it. But the reason no one asks to be paid in gum is 1) nobody has enough gum to pay you with and 2) it's not as useful as the USD.  Bitcoin however can easily succeed to satisfy both 1 and 2.

But again, who mediates?  You gloss over this like it's nothing but it's actually the only part of the problem that CAN'T be solved and is the show-stopper.  It will always boil down to giving a third party priveleged information.  How are people going to mutually agree on a mediator that will somehow remain impartial and not subject to bribes or extortion?  What's the incentive for the mediator being involved anyway?  Surely they will need to be paid, maybe they get a % of the sale?  but how can you expect someone to spend any real amount of time researching a dispute over a $30 item, how could a % of a $30 sale incentivize anyone but someone in a third world country who likely is looking for bribe opportunities to make more $$?  That means only big sales are worth mediating, and then the risk of fraud goes up with it.  What prevents an agent or informant from being one?
Fwiw, I don't think this problem is going to stop people from taking risks, I just hate when people act like black markets are fighting the good fight in the war on drugs.  If anything they are giving the govt a SHIT ton of data to further their war on drugs and improve their numbers.  They are literally giving them dots to connect at levels you can't even imagine.

So what stops someone from writing a trojan that installs an SQRL auth app that behind the scenes logs into bitcoin websites and steals users' money?  If all it needs is the user to click the website and the app button (which the trojan can do behind the scenes, without the actual user knowing or doing anything) then this is a significant vulnerability.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:03:40
Yes but  you need  to  create a receive address on coinbase  and use that,  not send to an address  you've received from that  originated on cb.   They  are  not  the  same.   When  you send  from cb,  it  comes  from a shared address.   When  you send to cb, you need to  send  it  a different address ,  one  of your unique receive addresses, or  it  will be auto refunded.

Actually, it would not make sense to make it illegal.  Because all you would do then is open up markets in other countries for foreigners who want to exchange money for bitcoins.  In other words, I send my USD to China, convert it to Yuan, buy BTC in Yuan, sell BTC in Yuan, convert Yuan back to USD.  They would have to make it illegal for me to convert currencies or make it cost prohibitive, which seems very unlikely if not absurd to even consider.
So this would not benefit the USD or the US in any way, and in fact it's a much less ideal solution than writing laws that would require businesses to register bitcoin wallet addresses and enforcing compliance with that.   
What I expect governments to do is help, not hurt, by making their countries MORE competitive in the bitcoin economy rather than less.  But given the level of corruption and incompetence in the US government right now, I'm not betting that we'll lead in this regard.

A better definition of spearphishing is that it involves *using* information related to the target(s) in the phishing attempt.  If you know the CEO's name and e-mail, and you address the e-mail to them, technically it's spearphishing.   But a better example might be that you know a group of people attended a meeting at 2:15pm today and the phisher sends an e-mail to the group shortly after it ends that says "Today's meeting notes attached." with a malicious .pdf.   So the definition comes from the specific act of customizing the phishing attack for the intended targets.

@_date: 2013-10-31 20:12:34
This  guy  is  blatantly dishonest.  Why?  
(assuming he understood the question and therefore should understand the importance of getting the answer right.) 




 Come  on, son.   We  all know btc  can  be  stolen,  and  unlike  credit  cards,  you  don't  get insured  for your losses.   But the good news is there is really no need to lie about the truth; doing so is harmful not helpful.   There  are numerous  ways  to protect  from being robbed, and even more is being developed on this front every day.  But how can people be expected to employ them  if they've been  lied to and told they *can't*  be  robbed.   
The reason he skirts this question, I'd assume, is that he  just doesn't  want  to  scare  anyone off.   But  what will be  worse for btc  is waves of adopters who have blind trust followed  by widespread reports of robbery due to being misinformed or uninformed.  I don't think we'll help bitcoin succeed by catering Q&amp;A's to the "heard it from one source so it must be true" demographic -- I'm going to risk sounding insensitive to suggest that perhaps this demographic would be most likely to get robbed and therefore might be less desirable adopters at this time?
That said, more self-reliance is a principle we have an opportunity to nurture and encourage with bitcoin, let's not waste it!  This is money we're talking about and people *naturally* feel a responsibility to understand how their money is being managed, and they do actually *want* to understand it (to the degree possible).  Money puts food on the table... everyone understands that!  Glossing over the details and saying you can't be robbed really should be seen as offensive.  
You don't need to explain how cryptography works, for example, but you must explain:  the ways and extent to which the money can be stolen, the amount of risk each type of wallet carries with it, and what options to protect their assets are available.  This is information people need to know and have the right to expect honesty around.
Mistrust is a  healthy thing when held in proportion  to  the truth,  so  people can assess the risk  and look  for ways to mitigate the  risks appropriately.   But mistrust  due to  being misled like this  is more difficult to recover  from.  With a healthy, clear understanding of risk, if by some chance they still get robbed, at least there's a chance they'll bear witness to any mistakes they might have made that contributed to it.  This turns a loss into a lesson rather than a rejection of btc entirely.

There is your intrinsic value.
And fwiw, this is a philosophical debate, one which a talking head is not going to have.
As an example:  Is gold worth anything to me?  Actually, not really.  Time = money, and dealing with gold would take a lot of time (or paying someone to deal with it). I know I could exchange it for USD, but it has very little relative intrinsic value to me, because I don't want it, and would not accept it as valuable.  So does absolute intrinsic value matter at all?  Actually, no it does not.  If it did, we would not have fiat currency.
The total intrinsic value of an object is the product of its average intrinsic value, average value intensity and value duration. It may be either an absolute or relative value. Relative intrinsic value is subjective, depending on individual and cultural views and/or the individual choice of life stance.

Because bitcoin is volatile.  Once you get cash for the miners, that cash doesn't fluctuate.  But if you spend 15 million dollars on miners and then btc crashes tomorrow, you're out 15 million dollars.  However, I wouldn't be surprised if they keep the miners in their hands and mine with them for some period of time while the price of btc is profittable.

Your money does not disappear when you put it into a house, sorry to say it.  You might lose half its value in a severe recession.  Bitcoin on the other hand could turn to nothing.  Or it could remain the same for years.

A single million dollar trade that can raise the price almost 10% is kind of a bad thing isn't it?  Shouldn't it be more collective buy volume that raises prices like that, i.e. 100 buys worth $1 million having more weight than a single transaction?  I mean, in the global economy, a million dollars is NOT a lot.  If some billionaire wanted to make a quick $100,000, he could just buy ~$1.2 million in btc apparently, and sell it immediately, or am I missing something?  
If big money starts to enter the btc arena we're looking at more volatility, which devalues btc fundamentally, right?

The more simple explanation would be someone dumps a lot of coins.  The market notices this and immediately looks for a potential reason, so that they can make a good decision if need be.  Meanwhile, others in the market don't bother looking for a reason because it doesn't matter to them, they just think it might be good time to get out just in case there IS a reason, knowing they can always buy back in.  Then you have people seeing the price moving down in waves and more want to exit without knowing what is going on really, and more people trying to find a reason.  
**Most likely the reason is just the market reacting to itself.**  People responding to the movement, not some news.  It doesn't take a lot of money to move the price of BTC by crazy amounts.  A couple million dollars and you can halve or double the market price.  One big player makes a move and everyone follows.  By the time the majority notice it, it's hard to see that it was one big sell that started it all.

Ah, but you and I both know it depended on when someone said to buy at $120.  I was referring to when it had dropped to $120 and hadn't gone higher after that, of course.
Either way, I don't have advice on whether to buy,to sell, or to hold.  I just think it's bullshit when people act like they know where the price is going.

It's not an important matter because it's not even resolved.  You came here to rant half way through the resolution process like everyone else, that's the annoying part.  You will get the BTC you bought at the price you ordered them at, your order may appear "cancelled" but once you straighten it out they'll whitelist you, it won't happen again, and you'll have your BTC.  A minor inconvenience.  
As an aside, this seemingly random trip-wire probably scares a lot of would-be fraudsters away.

Business accounts, by law, have to be separate from personal accounts.  Coinbase is a merchant business as well, so they're doing business with businesses at this point.  Wells Fargo is probably just making sure businesses that bank with them aren't skirting laws by using bitcoins to move money to/from personal accounts.  If you're using it for personal use, they will likely have nothing else to say to you and you'll never hear about it again.

Doubt it.  More likely, if they predict bitcoin has a future, they will try to capitalize on it as much as possible.
Or I could imagine the Federal Reserve attempting to create its own similar crypto-currency that was centralized, that they could control, and figuring out a way to market it to get a lot of it into circulation.  
If you want to know want the US government will do about anything, you have to consider 2 things:  1) will their actions be effective and 2) who would benefit from their actions.  If 1 is true, then 2 rests on the answer being their lobbyists and/or campaign funders.

False comparison.
Theft and robbery are crimes that are interrelated which makes people use these terms almost interchangeably. However, there are major differences in the two types of crimes that need to be highlighted. Both robbers and thieves make a claim over things that are not theirs. However, there is a difference in the mode in which a theft or a robbery is conducts that makes law categorize them as two different types of crimes.
**Theft** is an unlawful taking of another person’s property with the intention of not returning it. A thief conducts his operation in stealth when no one is around as he does not want to attract any attention. Therefore theft is simply taking something from someone without the intention of returning it back to the owner. Embezzlement is also a form of theft where an employee takes away money meant for the employer of other employees for his own use.
**Robbery** is also a form of theft as the robber has the intention to take away the property of someone else but in addition here he makes use of violence or intimidation. Thus robbery is a specific type of theft as there is not only theft but also violence or threat of violence. The most common examples of robbery are when a robber holds cashier and other personnel in a bank at gun point and robs money. Robbery is also conducted in homes when robber uses violence against inmates or threatens to use violence and takes away all the valuables.

@_date: 2013-10-04 19:29:40
I find you like many others looking at things from only the "good guys" point of view.  Let's consider an adversary for, whatever reason, wants bitcoin to fail.  Not hard to imagine right?  For example, the US Government, with practically unlimited money?  I'm not saying this is the case... this is just hypothetical ok?
Now let's say this adversary has a LOT of money and they invest a ton of money in miners and forcefully take more than 50% of the network.
What you're saying is that someone hoarding bitcoins is incentivized to spend a little to keep the value of their bitcoins up, or that someone approach 50% mark actually has incentive to back off.  But you have failed to include the possibility that their greatest incentive might be to see bitcoin fail.    To them, they gain more from bitcoin losing value than from it keeping it, see?  This is a very real possibility as there are always winners and losers in the global economy and banks have shown that they are ALWAYS the winners, even when they cause economic collapse... they still win.  
So this is flawed reasoning.

To accept reality and fundamentally change the way we treat drugs in society.

I think not having all your eggs in one basket might be the most overused cliche of all time when it comes to money... and I also think it would be wise to remember here.  
We should not idealize this world where there is only one way to pay... or only one currency.  That's too much power concentrated into a single instrument.  Diversification is the nature of life and what money should also seek to model.  It needs to evolve and fit where it makes sense to and not try to fit where it doesn't.  Bitcoin makes sense in certain contexts but not in all contexts, and that certainly doesn't infer that the latter is inferior.

Sorry but you're 100% wrong to say violence is caused by only one factor.  Also, violence doesn't really  happen at the end point delivery, because there is little reason for it to.  If violence ensues, it would typically be the BUYER trying to rob the dealer, not vice versa.  Dealers want their customers to come back.   But even this is hardly any more of a problem than people robbing gas stations.  Did it happen?  Yea, but maybe 1 out of 100,000 customers.  If you can show evidence that suggests even a fraction of a percent of end user drug buys end violently, I would understand you're point,  but you certainly can't.  You're making your point based on a myth / fantasy.
I don't disagree that illegality is the biggest PART of the problem, but to say that if you buy drugs knowing there is a chance that murder was involved at some point in getting that product to you, YOUR demand is a part of the problem too.  Of course, drug users nicely do not want to accept this so they buyer their heads in the sand and blame the laws, as if that don't have a choice to buy drugs.

The thing about 2FA people need to understand is it is designed to make it harder to steal accounts, it doesn't mean the business you deal with is securing your funds properly.
In other words, you get my username/password?  No problem, since Coinbazaar won't let you use it without my 2FA cellphone.  However, if Coinbazaar has a shitty security system where transfers can somehow be made without a 2FA token, e.g. their backend system can be fooled, turned off, or otherwise gotten around by hackers, then 2FA is not going to help.

Just because bitcoin could fall under a libertarian idea category does not make the bitcoin crowd libertarians. 
Even a liberal can clearly follow this guy's logic:  currency is an expression of value, and value becomes more and more subjective as complexity of the world increases;  thus it is completely natural that new forms of currency would begin to emerge especially if they are able to benefit both the consumer and producer more than pre-existing forms of currency.  Bitcoin is becoming the posterchild for this.
The funny part about this video is that the guy keeps talking about government controlling the money.  The Federal Reserve isn't the government though.  They are a cartel if anything.  So this privatization of currency has already been going on for a long time, and you better believe the banks are prepared to fight serious competing currencies tooth and nail, or else try to take control of them somehow.

Actually I think you've got it backwards.  On the street, it's pretty well known, but in the comfort of the burbs, or any place where it's never seen, talked about, it might be just as "bad" as marijuana to some young person's mind.   
You have to realize there are also a lot of drugs coming onto the market which the government can't even keep up with, and that will continue.  I can't remember what it was called but this was recent: some 'research chemical' had something like 5-10% of people having seizures, but there were enough people having fine experiences that it just kind of began to spread with some level of popularity anyway.  Maybe the whole story around a particular drug gets to the person before they ingest it, if they're lucky, or maybe it doesn't.  There is no "common knowledge" surrounding this at all, unlike heroin.  Then there is stuff that is impure or laced.  At least with pot you can tell if it's fake.  With some white substance, you have no clue, but that has not stopped millions of people from ingesting it anyway.  Nobody *prefers* the mystery and unknown risk, *but they'll still take it*, and what we can learn from that fact alone is part of what I believe is not acknowledged by authorities.  I also believe just hanging them out to dry with a "you did this to yourself!" attitude, without compassion, without understanding, and with disregard to what we could actually do to improve the situation realistically, is a pretty lame attempt to address the issues.

Why would anyone trust an entity or entities to hold their bitcoins when they are an anonymous entity?  I can understand how SR worked because if after 2 years or whatever the guy didn't run with peoples money, chances are it wouldn't happen.  But for a new site, maybe after 2 months they have 5,000 btc in their wallet pool.  Nothing stopping the owner from stealing all of it, ESPECIALLY if due diligence had been performed to keep their identity a secret.  
 It seems to me this would be more likely to happen than not, more likely than someone thinking they will never get caught.   The longer you run a site, the better the chances of you making a mistake, and the bigger the target on your head becomes.  I mean people just believe these sites are philanthropic and run by Good Guy Gregs?

All the Silk Road fan boys seem to be of the opinion that prohibition is 100% to blame for violence in the drug trade, when it is users that ultimately create the demand. Therefore you can just as truthfully say that DEMAND and PROHIBITION are equally to blame for the violence. Afterall, no demand = no money to be made = no violence. How convenient it must be to abdicate one of all moral accountability from their choices.

Look, there are no studies on this, but I would estimate 99% (conservatively, probably more like 99.5%) of people buying drugs (and I mean specifically those who aren't homeless crack heads, those who can actually display at least some coherence mentally) would rather buy them in a traditional manner than have them mailed to their house and risk not getting the drugs, getting counterfeit drugs, getting drugs cut with shit that they really have no recourse against since the drug dealers on Silk Road ran rackets that pumped fake reviews to bury any negative ones, or risk having conspiracy to traffic narcotics using the USPS charges filed against them, along with anything else the three-letter agencies deemed appropriate to make an example out of you, probably money laundering at the very least.
There is nothing spectacular about that.   The attitude towards the legal status is what is changing, not the attitude toward darkweb black markets.
And just to reiterate:
    Size of the illegal drug market in the U.S. is estimated to be anywhere from $200 to $750 Billion. Note: this is just in the US.
    Bitcoin market cap, about $3 Billion. For reference.
    Silk Road's market cap? Barely 15 million a year, and this is a global market. So for every dollar that is spent on drugs in the US, .0075 cents was spent on the Silk Road. If we guestimated that the US accounted for 75% of the market share, we'll say Silk Road accounted for $0.5625 for every $10,000.00 spent on drugs in the US.

Wrong you are.  We will continue to find a need for alternatives, as we always have.  Digital currencies have new properties compared to traditional ones, thanks to computing.  As technology advances, new forms of currency should continue to evolve out of old ones that offer new advantages.  
Credit cards are the most basic proof of this happening in the modern era -- as you actually hold multiple currencies due to the service nature of the credit economy.  They are not a currency in and by themselves but rather they serve as substitute for whichever currency you need at a given time.  So you begin to see how you think of currency actually changes, as technology begins to allow us to use currency in different ways never previously possible.  You can use your single Visa card to spend dollars, yen, pesos, etc..  without having to take your physical money to an exchange.  That is just one of the many previously impossible advantages of a credit card, achieved thanks to technological development of the private sector.

The most violence happens at the source like you said.  Supply demand is what feeds that violence.  If millions of people suddenly get access to things they hadn't had access to before, I believe it's intuitive that demand would rise for certain hard to get things.  Therefore, it's implicated in the rise of any associated violence.  Of course, nobody will take any responsibility, Americans don't care how their products are made or who dies to get it to them.

Future possibilities can only be realized if the cost of mining remains worth it, and it only is really worth mining if bitcoins retain value.  If it has any kind of relatively stable value, it will continue to functionally serve as currency.  Unless a better currency comes along, I see that as it's main function in terms of what the vast majority of people use it for and why they are interested in it.  Thus, above all else it's money.  Anything else is tertiary for now as far as I'm concerned.   Note: the emphasis on *above all else* ;)

They need to give a reasonable estimate of the date of delivery, and unless I'm mistaking, they did say probably by the end of June when I ordered.

1btc in  coinbase and send it to wallet B.  look at address  that btc  got  sent  from  to wallet B  and assume  that address  can  receive btc  for your  account, too.  WRONG.   you  have specific receive  addresses  and only  these addresses  can  be  used.

Correction, you'd like to *think* it's helping to end drug prohibition, but a simple look at the numbers paints the real picture:
* Size of the illegal drug market in the U.S. is estimated to be anywhere from $200 to $750 **Billion.**  Note: this is just in the US.
* Bitcoin market cap, about $3 **Billion.** For reference.
* Silk Road's market cap?  Barely 15 ***million*** a year, and this is a global market.  So for every dollar that is spent on drugs in the US, .0075 *cents*, not even 1% of a penny, was spent on the Silk Road.  If we guestimated that the US accounted for 75% of the market share, we'll say Silk Road accounted for $0.5625 for every $10,000.00 spent on drugs in the US.
OK?  So your "drug prohibition ending" fantasy, in comparison to the actual illegal drug market in the US, constitutes a pathetic .0075% share of the way drugs are bought/sold.   I'm sorry, I'm an avid legalization proponent but let's be realistic here.

Stocks are risky, probably just as risky at bitcoin in some cases without nearly the same potential for return.  I wouldn't bother with trying to play the stock market much.

Good interview but I think the 'intrinsic value' question could have been better, and it gets missed a lot because quite frankly, where to even begin?  ;)
Just stick to the fundamentals of bitcoin.  For example, it cannot be counterfeited, it cannot be inflated endlessly, and can be transported across the globe instantly for almost nothing.  These are HUGE points, not little nice-to-haves but seriously revolutionary features of a currency.   This leads nicely into the fact that it's an open source protocol meaning the algorithm is not a secret and can't be manipulated to take advantage of people (unlike what banks do, but you don't have to say that ;).  When people hear "it's an algorithm" and "people download software" I know what they are thinking: *it's probably way too complicated for me and I don't trust software ever since I got that virus that one time, I'll stick to what I know which is cash, credit cards, and paypal.*
It's also self-sustaining --  the money to invest in miners doesn't require taxing the public for the cost of printing and delivery of money to banks, ATMs, vaults, etc..  How about the fact that I can encrypt my wallet well, if I'm robbed my cash can't be stolen?  That's more than a debit card could offer generally -- while you may be insured, you still have to deal with all of that paperwork not to mention any physical/emotional harm that came from being robbed.  Grand theft auto has become almost non existent since cars became harder to drive off with -- this is a great achievement that money should be able to have, too.
To me, these are the things that give it the most intrinsic value, not where you can spend it... that is "what-comes-next" given all of the above criteria.  And even if you could spend it everywhere, that still wouldn't be what gave it the most intrinsic value.  It'd still be the features of the currency.

Except in the case of online wallets.  This is a source of confusion for users of Coinbase, localbitcoins, for example.  If you send coins, you'll notice the sending address isn't yours.  They're sent from a shared address.  If this confuses the user and he/she sends btc back to it, they will not receive the btc in their wallet, and it might be autorefunded (and lost if you're sending from another shared address.)

That doesn't apply where either party can lie about what they did with no real recourse.  "But reviews would create disincentives...."  What stops a seller from making fake sales to pump their own stats?  I'm curious if SR had anything to stop that from happening?  Maybe a seller only rips off 1 out of every N customers, increasing profits and buyers wont think anything of it because 90% are giving a green light, half of which might even be the seller posing as customers. 
 The whole idealization of a black market that I see people suggest just doesn't make sense.  It seems people are a little too blinded by the light so to speak, but perhaps I have too little faith in the honesty of anonymous people trading illegal wares on the internet &gt;.&gt;  I just don't think I could treat my money so carelessly.

True.  Maybe it's more like email than gold 2.0.  But if governments won't let people have innovation, we have a much more serious problem, in which case I would be running from the USD faster not slower.  The USD value, afterall, is speculative based on future economic growth essentially.  If we make policies that clearly damage that prospect, our own dollar loses value.  That is why I believe Ben Bernanke and the major banks have been smart not to come out swinging against Bitcoin, because to do so actually would be shooting themselves in the foot (or worse). If the world opines that Bitcoin is an economic positive and the US banks and the Fed take stances against Bitcoin, then they won't look very smart and the trust in the USD is damaged.  In this way, Bitcoin has a lot of advantage to succeed.

All the Silk Road fanboys seem to be of the opinion that prohibition is 100% to blame for violence in the drug trade, and that Silk Road is some kind of benefactor of peace in the world, when it is users that ultimately create the demand for drugs and without demand there would be no violence. Therefore you can just as truthfully say that DEMAND and PROHIBITION are equally to blame for the violence.  No demand = no violence.  How convenient it must be to abdicate one's self of all moral accountability from their choices. How cute it is to think that vendors get their drugs from 100% non-violent sources.  You're not going to wait around for prohibition to end... you've got to get high, AT ALL COSTS!
Nevermind that cocaine, as just one example, comes to the U.S. exclusively through drug cartels who would kill any of their smugglers' entire families in a heartbeat.  But your demand for it has nothing to do with those families murders... the only place blame lies is prohibition!  It's all their fault!  You're just a victim too!  You don't have any choice!  You have to buy cocaine!  You demand cocaine and are willing to buy it from anyone, no matter who might have been killed along the road in getting it to you (as long as it's not you)!  That's just a fact of life that others need to deal with, right?   It's not your problem.
