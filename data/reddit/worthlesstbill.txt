Lightening. Not new but making progress.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:53:25
Good question. I'm the wrong person to ask. Many of our laws make no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:18:35
I tend to agree. I love Crypto and Bitcoin is nice and all but from a payment perspective, what does it solve? Assuming you live in a developed country; It's not cheaper, It's not easier and you can barely buy a good or service.
How does that make it better than VISA. I do agree the network / protocals are the future and maybe Bitcoin wins, who knows. But to date, it just can't compete with the Visa network. I'm not sure currency ultimately wins in Crypto. The value is the network and until you can transfer 100s of thousands, if not millions of transactions per second at what feels like free, you can't beat these guys.
Without the points mentioned above, How does Bitcoin get real adoption? By real, I mean billions of users / monthly transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:00:39
A couple of things. I get, agree and believe in decentralization. However, for a functioning system there will always be some form or centralization like it or not. Especially when it comes to sending money. That’s not centralized in a bad way, but enough to keep it functioning. My point being if Bitcoin core walked out tomorrow, the core developers, it would fail. Their dev weight therefore carries an undiscussed and overlooked “centralization”. The same with ETH, LTC or any project. Granted, it’s not the same “centralization” as govt oversight or the banking system but it’s certainly there. This is a key point hardcore bitcoiners are missing IMO.
Bitcoin is anything but fast. Sorry. Every transfer I’ve done in the past year has taken at least 30 minutes at best. It’s actually so slow it causes me to miss some trade setups in other coins. And the fee you mentioned, awesome; but you can’t count fees that you got in 2013. I’m just speculating there. In the past 8 months, I’ve sent a few hundred to $1,000 or so to my own wallets. Not across the world and it takes 2, 4, 6 hours and I pay 15-$30 fees. These transactions are cheaper and faster on PayPal + 10 other platforms. Not to mention what can you buy? This is real life 2017-18. 
I hear all the great speed and low fee, but I’ve never witnessed it with my own eyes. I don’t believe it’s true now. Which means needed changes are being overlooked.
Places like Venezuela were what I called out (not by name) it my previous post. Yes, there is a a case for that type stuff.
To your point, I agree the space (crypto) is surviving and will survive. It’s not going away. The next greatest tech companies will be based on Blockchain and Crypto. But right now, I’m having trouble seeing how Bitcoin in its current state will be anything other than first to market? Maybe MySpace?
I’m not dogging bitcoin, but I’m not seeing apps built on top of it’s network. Just forks of the chain. What good is that doing other than market confusion and potentially a bunch of unnecessary coins? The network which provide real value for new applications and ecosystems will win in the end.
I’m open to being wrong and I looking for reasons to think the above is true, I’m not finding it though.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:52:47
I'm in total agreement there. I don't disagree. But, in that world how can those same people with limited to no funds and limited to no access afford to pay extremely high transaction fees? There are three reason Bitcoin as it is today can't be a currency. It's too slow, It's too volatile and it's too expensive. Those things can change and that's what the focus should be on fixing.
I'm not poopooing Bitcoin. It's a great tool, but it's lost it's way a bit and some of the other coins have focused on solving problems; not owning the name "Bitcoin".
Bitcoin could win. Who knows, too early. I think the value is in the technology and it's seemingly limitlessness. Not it being a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:57:14
I don’t take that as negative and congrats to the amounts you have.
Yes, Bitcoin has survived and I assume it will. It’s drawn more in and helped build a system.
What draws you back to Bitcoin? What makes you feel more save there than say Ethereum?
Personally, I’ve always like ETH better because of the options smart contracts provide and the platform. It seems BTC is catching on.
Explain to me what specifics of Bitcoin make it a store of value.
I understand essentially the decentralized, secure database. But, if it’s too expensive to use then where is the value? Again, assuming the payment network or channel is too slow and it requires a second coin (LTC) to really function.
These are not Nitpicks or me being a jerk. It’s what appear to be flaws that I’m trying to better understand from an investment point of view.

Totally agree on the govt funding the war and terrorism. The number one currency used to fund terrorism and drugs: the United States dollar. The number one funder of terrorism and drugs: the United States Federal Reserve. End of story.
Do you know why the United States is in Afghanistan? Because it’s the number one opioid producer in the world. Notice anything funny about this chart? 
When did the US show up in afghanistan? 2003 what’s happened to production of opium since? It’s doubled and almost tripled. 10 years after the fact, what does the US have? A heroine and opioid epidemic. That chart alone tells you all you need to know about why the US is in Afghanistan, and who is funding and facilitating the drug trade... but Bitcoin is for drug dealers and bad people. Oh please govt!
Enjoying the convo.

@_date: 2019-07-15 11:53:04
Not sure I agree on that. Yes incomes buy more today than in 1826.
But if you bought a $1 toothbrush then it would cost thousands today.
On the income side, you can see here [income conversion ]( 
That a 100,000 salary in 2018 was only 9,597 in 1970. So to have the same lifestyle you had to make 10 times as much money. Why? Inflation. If it took 10 the money to buy the same lifestyle (strictly measured on income) then the only thing that could happen is an extreme loss of purchasing power due to a flood of money.
The problem with what you mention is the gap between corporate profits and labor income.
[Corp profits]( 
Because the CBs around the world inflate money supply incomes have naturally risen. But post WW2 they have risen at a pace not keeping up with hidden inflation.
Your point does comply with Keynesian Economics but that is based on creation of debt to cover more debt and not sound money.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:15:34
Awesome. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:30:25
I agree. I can’t determine if at this point we are talking about the same thing.
But, you are right the inequality is an issue. Ray Dalio has plenty of phenomenal works on the topic and how it’s repeated over all of history for mankind.
What I’m saying is the reason this type of gap exists (inequality) and gets worse when not managed properly stems directly from monetary policy. Or, incorrect monetary policy and principles.
That’s where inflation, currency devaluation (intentional or intended) and lack of sound money principles directly create this problem.
The income inequality is the effect not the cause(problem). But, it’s being labeled as the cause.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:33:39
You’re exactly right. Most don’t see it because their dollar always says $1. But the first dollar was issued in roughly 1862 and adjusted, was worth about $2. That same dollar is now worth less than .10c.
That’s how much purchasing power has been lost. There are plenty of online calculators that will convert and show this loss throughout time.
It’s kind of sad more people don’t realize how bad this hurts.
Another example is a fitted New Era hat. In roughly 1993 it cost about $18-19. Today it’s about $35... same hat. Same material almost double the cost!
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:03:31
Any favorite channels?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:46:45
Yeah. The outright lies seem to be coming from both sides. I’m saying the name doesn’t matter, in that it shouldn’t. Meaning, the name alone will not do anything. The technology under the name is what does something. That’s where the focus should be. 
Both sides are slinging so much FUD, most people are just looking at the name. What I’m curious about is: if BTC is superior why does it need a second coin LTC to achieve peak functionality? If BCH is superior why all the focus on BTC, just go build. Right?
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:03:16
That is a good one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:59:17
I completely agree. That’s why I struggle with the “store of value”. Value in what? If the tech is broken, where is the value? I share your view.
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:43:30
I had signed up there a long time ago and came away feeling the exact same way. I thought I must be missing something. Thanks for the confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:36:17
I’m not exactly following your question. Who are you thinking? My point was the name doesn’t matter. Yes it has a means of brand recognition, but if community and supporters focused most on utility of the software and less on arguing / spreading FUD throughout the internet the best option would rise to the top by nature of solving  he most problems.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:25:52
That’s also something I’ve been thinking about. What is the “store of value” for Bitcoin? It’s not cheaper, it’s actually extremely slow, and you can’t really buy anything with it. This all of course when comparing it to a developed country. So, where is the “value”. I mean I understand the long term value of the network and Blockchain, but I don’t understand the anything in terms of value that gets it to 17,000. It seems that the consensus is just HODL and people are assigning value to this?
Is the value saying you are an owner of the underlying infrastructure that will one day dominate industries?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:39:04
Agreed. Given that it now requires two coins, LTC and BTC to achieve one goal; fast and cheap transactions - it has failed. Granted, it doesn’t have to stay that way.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:43:53
Around 10,000. Then around 9,300 and then roughly 7-8,000. After that all bets are off.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:21:01
I think you’re right and yes Reddit is the best source for understanding and finding out about these markets. Like the US elections and so many other recent things, the viral nature of the internet has also stymied growth. We are seeing the same messaging failure in BTC / BCH that we saw in Occupy Wall Street. It was a great cause but in it’s quick growth and media coverage, the core message was lost, tangled, confused and distorted to the point where people forgot why they were there. They fell in love with the term “occupy Wall Street” like crypto is falling in love with “HODL”. Once the attention and fight is about the message and it’s meaning and not the underlying reason people gathered in the first place it becomes lost and broken. That seems to be what we are seeing. In my view. Maybe I’m wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:15:49
I can agree with this for sure. However there is value in the underlying technology. It’s just too early to know who wins.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:41
Your last paragraph succinctly describes the real problem at hand. The real downfall is the bickering between the communities that does not drive adoption. It actually is driving more people to disbelieve because it’s just message board name calling and looks childish. The focus should be on the technology and making it easy enough for use and mass adoption, not focusing on how to control the name “Bitcoin”.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:57:24
Is this real?
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:29:25
Exactly my point... just like the US. Same design different geography.
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:50:28
Also a reason why most maximalists are a little off. They understand the development but not how money actually works at its core, maybe?
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:54:23
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:51:45
I view that as deceptive semantics. Both entities are attempting to do the same base function. Control economies to their desired outcomes. 
In your own sandbox that’s relatively easy. When your sandbox crosses other sandboxes, it gets hairy and people argue over who has the right and what part of the sand is who’s. 
The renminbi / yuan is mainland vs island, because Britain owned Hong Kong. So even though they were both “China” they weren’t actually until the late 90’s. Maybe sort of like Puerto Rico for the US?
The US will loan money at today’s rate but demand tomorrow that rate be different. So it’s the same in my mind.
The fixed rate is a means for China to fight back as its the only way they can feel less pain as the us manipulates the price of the dollar.
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:15:35
I was agreeing and making the case that it is semantics. Both are manipulating in reality.
Your second point I agree in a lot of ways but is a different conversation.
The last point I wasn’t making a case for at all. But, the unfortunate fact is the only currency that has lasted since the beginning of mankind is Gold. Every created currency not Gold based or backed has failed. It usually takes between 2 and 3 hundred years to play out. Which means Bitcoin could have a long runway and the USD is running out of time. Again, a different conversation though.
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:06:08
Can you extrapolate? It seems like China is doing exactly what the US has done for 80 years.
How is having a peg and breaking that peg any different than making sure you are the global reserve currency and devaluing your currency or letting it rally so other counties have to succumb to your desires?
The US manipulates the dollar and interest rates to gain advantages over other countries. It’s fact. So, how is this different?
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:36:12
There’s a massive amount of opioid being grown there. Take a look at hectares grown in Afghanistan when the US got there on 2003 and the explosion of growth into 2013... right around the beginning of the opioid crisis in the US. Wonder how that happened?!?!
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:30:23
I think you are giving much more credibility to the idea of a “free floating rate”. If economic data in the US weren’t manipulated then they would not strip out food and gas from inflation data. These are the two main cost of ones paycheck and matter the most, yet they are striped out so rates can be targeted in an easier manner.
Yes, the Yuan and US Dollar are shitcoins. But if you think one is not manipulated and the other is, I disagree. They both are and take different paths of doing so as one pretends not to and the other one openly does it.
The US realized the advantage of being the world’s reserve currency in the 30s and used the tactic as a means to defeat Germany in World War II by cutting off their access to dollars as their currency ran into inflation issues. Once the US established itself, after the war, as no longer the labor of the world and now the reserve currency of the world; all countries funneled financing through the US, effectively giving it complete control of global finances. Fine and dandy as long as powers aren’t abused... which they have been for the last few decades and now we are seeing the issues.
From that point forward if the US allowed the dollar to rally all other countries suffer because their debt is denominated in Dollars, so there interest cost rise. Without a reserve currency you have no way to combat this. Which is what China and others didn’t realize but came to hate.
China, has spent effectively since the 80s until now learning the ways of all US systems and policies and put in place the peg to combat this inability to control your own financial destiny without having a reserve currency. They’ve lobbied the IMF for the Renminbi to be one or at least create an SDR basket to level the playing field. The IMF has not agreed. 
Now, for the first time in a few hundred years there is an alternative fungible store of value. This has happened numerous times throughout civilization(s) and during the rise and fall of empires.
So, now China can allow the peg to break and capital to flow out and into another means — NOT —the USD. Now, that capital outflow also doesn’t have to go to a country with debt denominated in USD either.
So it gives China and others the freedom to circumvent the US... “the system” and get their financial freedoms back.
The US doesn’t like this because they are losing the control they’ve maintained for decades over other countries and this is why they are screaming foul or manipulation... even though the US has been doing it for close to 100 years.

Right. So, it was okay for China to manipulate their currency by buying Tsy’s as long as it worked favorably for the US. Now that they’ve stopped doing what was favorable and manipulate it in their favor its wrong? WTF???
The US doesn’t realize they allowed China to massively shorten their TSY exposure going from mainly 30yr to 10yr, post 2008 as a way to get interest expense relief in the US during the crash. China astutely returned that cash by buying US real estate. So they now have less financial exposure (tsy) and more control (real estate) along with a viable “reserve” currency in Crypto!
Kind of crazy but well played.

So manipulating the economy and rates knowing that it will lead to manipulation of currency is essentially a discrete way of being upfront and manipulating the exchange rate.
So they are the same thing. One does it in front of your face, China. And the other does it behind your back, the US.
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:01:07
If you do the math over time at a very basic level, based on how much purchasing power has actually been eroded, i.e. a dollar is not truly worth a dollar then inflation is around 9 or 10% or higher.
Example: price of McDonald’s hamburger / meal. Now around 6/$7 and was around 3/$4 in early 2000s.
Yet we say inflation has been relatively around 2% or lower.
