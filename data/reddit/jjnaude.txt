In the OP, I specifically addressed "not fixing what isn't broken" separately. Basically even if you believe Core is just fine as is (and I do, incidentally), you probably do not believe that the looming Core-XT civil war is just fine. So there clearly is something that we can agree should ideally be fixed. 
If we choose not to fix it by reaching some compromise agreement with "the other side" then we need VERY good reasons for not doing so. Any such reason should be equally valid as an argument for a limit decrease.

accept txns after the hard fork = fail to upgrade their software before the hard fork
Which is what I said. So if you roll out a hard fork today that becomes active tomorrow, merchants will lose money, because they haven't upgraded their clients yet. I can't be any clearer that that.

That comment was edited afterwards. So saying "It's in that comment" is a tad disingenious.
Two comments on your option c.
* Firstly, reducing the max block size would be a softfork. So "hardforking is costly" is not really a valid argument
* Secondly, even if a reduction was a hardfork the third option just comes down to "If it ain't broken don't fix it" which I discussed in the OP. It's not a valid argument because at this point you don't get to choose whether there will be a hardfork or not, you only get to choose whether the hardfork will be adversarial or not. So given that it appears that there will be a hardfork anyway, you might as well push for your preferred size.

Very interesting. Please expand. Do you not believe that XT will take any users away from Core? Or do you not believe that a network with fewer users is generally less valuable and less robust? 
If XT were to take some fraction, or even the majority, of the ecosystem with them (all indications I've seen are that major exchanges merchants etc. support XT) how exactly can you argue that that won't be harmful to Core?

Please clarify the other option(s). I may well have missed something.

Because all users and especially merchants and exchanges have to upgrade their software. If they fail to upgrade prior to the active date, they stand to lose money.
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:38:38
So it is worth the effort to argue against an increase, but not worth the effort to argue for a decrease? Where does the asymmetry come from?

Yeah, because the easy option is always the right one.

Given that Gavin and Mike seem dead set on taking the nuclear option with XT and that most exchanges, merchants and users appear to be on their side, I would claim that the best way of not fracturing the community would be to agree to some compromise position (8Mb? 4Mb?). 
Gavin has repeatedly asked for counterproposals, but none have been forthcoming (or those that have failed to garner significant support). 


This is a good approach, but do not forget that it will take several months at least to roll out a hardforking change in an orderly fashion. Waiting until a problem manifests itself is akin to going through a traffic light at top speed, thinking  "If there is someone coming from the other direction I'll stop when I see them."
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:37:44
No, there won't. But even from that point it would take ~1 year before the first bigger block is produced. Hard forks take time, because all users must upgrade their software. We can do it faster of course but at the risk of  lots of people making lots of noise because they (or whoever hosts their wallet) did not upgrade their software in time and they lost money due to being on the  wrong fork. Not great PR.

If that change were to be implemented and those mining against that changed protocol were to reach majority then those mining without "upgrading" would find that their blocks don't get additional confirmations.
You're just describing a soft fork here. Not sure what your point is. If it was only to point out that reducing the limit would be a soft fork, then Thank you, I was aware of that. If it had some deeper meaning that I missed, please expand.


If a reduction in block size limit does not benefit the economic majority and won't ever get adopted, then certainly an increase in block size does benefit the economic majority and will get adopted overwhelmingly. 
So you are saying that XT will become the de-facto bitcoin and Core will be reduced to an alt?

How do I "get to that point of sale from anywhere in the world"? Via a proxy? Incidentally, I am at .com and I do see the prices in USD. Just no bitcoin option at checkout.

Convert to USD and multiply by 200. So 9.66 SEK would be 1.18USD/share = 236USD per coin. :-)

hold your horses. The code being discussed here is a FUTURE version of XT. Installing the current version won't make any difference. I'm sure when it is available, there will a good walkthrough available for installation.
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:55:47
I would expect that many coins will allready be in exchanges prior to the fork, because people will anticipate this logjam. And I also expect that if the logjam that you describe does happen it will be the final nail in XBT's coffin. 
If I own 2 cryptocoins and one is operating just fine, while the other is effectively frozen, with transactions taking many hours to confirm, the last thing that I do is to sell the functioning coin for the broken one. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:02:51
This is effectively what happens in a fork, whether we want it to or not. So, the blocksize debate will ultimately get settled in the free market. Sell the bitcoin 1MB for bitcoin 20MB or vice versa depending on which you support. This is quite similar to a corporate spinoff, such as Agilent being spun off from HP and shareholders receiving shares in Agilent to compensate for the loss in equity in their HP shares. They are then free to sell either, none or both of the companies and the market determines the correct valuation split.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:27:26
I don't know. But we should know before the fork and Gavin and Mike are implying that the majority of major roleplayers have indicated in private discussions that they will support the XT version.
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:37:39
If we ever need to adjust the limit downwards, only a softfork will be needed. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:44:04
Of course they do. Unless you would like to enlighten us on how a coin survives when no-one is mining it OR no-one accepts it as payment (the large payment processors will effectively choosing on behalf of thousands of merchants which coin they will be accepting) OR none of the wallets that support it are being maintained. 
Naturally the split will never quite be 0/100, but the same logic applies for any sufficiently uneven split. If 80% of merchants side with XT, then Core becomes just another altcoin overnight. There are also short term effects that might push the split one way or another, such as the fact that Core will be far more susceptible to tx spam DoS attack, but in the long term the decision is made by all the players in the bitcoin ecosystem weighted by the coins they control.
If you still disagree, then please elucidate your alternative with more than a snarky one-liner.
  
@_date: 2015-05-30 06:33:00
Go read up on the difference between a hard and a soft fork. The only way I get to break protocol rules (as encoded in every full node) is to convince users to change their software to a version that does not enforce that rule. Absent that change, all the hashpower in the world will not allow  you to break any of the protocol  rules. Users follow the longest VALID chain, where validity is defined by the software they choose to run.

The stash in this address was worth about $13.5M at peak and is worth about $3.5M now. However, that does not imply that they spent $10M. Like the rest of us they have been hit by BTC depreciating against the dollar. Assuming that this address does indeed represent all the ethereum holdings and that withdrawals from it corresponds to "spending", they have "spent" around $5M so far.
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:41:05
The only one having a hissy fit is you. He is simply giving the miners/payment processors/wallet makers AND users a choice. If the free market agrees with you then the 20MB chain will be stillborn.
Why does others having a choice upset you so much? You are welcome to ignore the fork and just keep using the old version for as long as you want. No one is forcing anything on you.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:42:44
Not so sure about that. While you are correct about decentralised systems being more expensive in general, I suspect that it is dangerous as a blanket statement. Examples would be the UK Government, which has used bittorrent to distribute data. Facebook and Twitter are both using bittorrent to distribute updates to their servers, mainly for scalability reasons.  
Everytime someone moderately popular does a show here in South Africa, Computicket crashes spectacularly as soon as ticket sales open. The same thing happens when low-cost airlines run specials on tickets. A quick search suggests that this is not a unique problem. 
Now I don't want to imply that bitcoin as it stands currently can handle these kinds of loads. But if we ever get to VISA type transaction levels (and there's very good reasons to believe it can be done), selling a few thousand Lady Gaga tickets will be no more than a blip. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:44:13
"Bitcoin and Bittorrent share some letters in the name and some concepts but they are totally different animals."
I was responding to a blanket statement about decentralised systems being more expensive and less scalable than centralised ones. I provided a counterexample in the form of bittorrent, which is indeed a decentralised system. No further similarity to bitcoin was implied.
"...all the network is capable to to process between 3 and 7 transactions per seconds..."
Which part of "I don't want to imply that bitcoin as it stands currently can handle these kinds of loads." did you not get? Here's Gavin's roadmap for enabling much higher transaction levels:
Some of these changes are controversial, but that is really orthogonal to this discussion. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:28:29
I would assume that exchanges will specify which chain(s) they support prior to the fork. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:57:15
Oh, I see. I assume 
"Why wouldn't miners just decide to give themselves bigger rewards and tell the users to get fucked?" 
was sarcasm then. In a forum where some people genuine believe that statement, you would be well advised to tag it with a /s. Especially given that you were responding to me who was not arguing that miners have all the power either. 
If you don't state your position clearly, argue with people you are in agreement with, and use sarcasm pseudo-randomly, I suppose one or two misunderstandings are inevitable. Glad we could clear that one up.

Just wondering. What is the viacoin blocksize? Googled for that info way back but could never find it.
@_date: 2016-12-13 06:32:51
By the same logic then 640kB should be enough for anyone. Rather than simply adding more and more memory to machines we should have been focusing on how to do more with less memory. Time to go dig out that old XT. Analogies are fun, but they rarely prove anything.
The only sane approach is to follow BOTH approaches as far as possible. It is indeed possible that the current blocksize limit is already too large and a threat to decentralization, in which case we only have one viable route to pursue. However, those claiming this have been very vague in their claims as to the nature of the apocalypse lying on the other side (or indeed on this side) of 1MB. If someone could point me to an actual attack that becomes viable at 2MB, that would be the end of this discussion for me. Bitcoin allready has a massive centralization problem. Demonstrate that this could be alleviated (even just partly) by dropping the current blocksize limit and I'll be first in line for 512kB blocks. To hell with tx costs. Up to now though, I have only seen handwaving and vague comparisons to selfish mining. Perhaps not seeing the attack vector is a reflection of my own inferior intellectual abilities. But I do hold a number of degrees in EE and CS, so I feel like I should be able to get this, if it is real and explained clearly.

Quickly did a check over the previous 10 non-empty blocks. Average fee per block 0.444, which lines up well with my estimate of 0.1BTC per block. You are right wrt revenue vs profit.
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:17:21
Hardly. First order estimate, they lost out on roughly 0.1BTC per block over ~20 blocks. i.e. ~2 BTC over ~2 days. I'm sure that's peanuts to BTCC, but to say that it's not worth your time to make a 5 minute edit to a config file for 1 BTC/day for the foreseeable future is utterly ridiculous.

No, naturally it is not black and white. I thought his core sentiment: "They're creating initiatives to protect their cherished wall st investors instead of making them pay for their mistakes." had some merit, as the financial markets today clearly have a problem with moral hazard. Perhaps his analogy was flawed as there is no evidence that airbags make the situation worse, merely that they provide less benefit than one would naively expect. I am extremely sceptical of regulation and find it very plausible that regulation actually makes the markets less safe for responsible investors. It certainly makes markets less efficient, which enriches a few to the detriment of many.
As to the merit of trying to have a productive conversation with him, we are fully agreed.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:11:08
Actually there is pretty good evidence that people people do alter behaviour as a function of perceived risk, thus severely reducing (although not necessarily eliminating) the realised benefits from safety interventions. See :  for a long list of examples.

@_date: 2015-11-13 13:19:23
Yes! Portraying some as being in favour of centralisation is a strawman. What is more, even if you agree with the contentious point that more traffic will eliminate more miners and nodes than  it replaces, it is not clear that the resulting system my not in fact be less fragile due to the growth in userbase. 
Consider the following two hypothetical cryptocurrencies:
* Smallcoin with a multitude of independent miners and full nodes, but only a handful of users. Public perception is that it is used mostly for nefarious purposes. There is an element of truth to this. Only a few exchanges.
* Bigcoin has fewer independent miners and full nodes, but widely used by Joe Public as well as by the corporate world. So widely used in fact that while many exchanges exist, the coins normally get exchanged due to investment reasons rather than necessity. Still used for nefarious purposes, but not perceived by the general public as being "intended for" criminal conduct.
Now ask yourself, which of these two is less susceptible to interference by nation states?

That's pretty fast compared to the situation here in South Africa. This week we tried to make a payment to a supplier in India. Phoned the bank to find out the details of the process. They e-mailed us a 4 page document which we had to fill out and go submit, together with the invoice we are paying, at the bank branch. Got to the bank and the document was accepted without any ID checks (which raises  the question why we couldn't just e-mail it to them). Was told it would take ~5 business days and cost 22 USD. This is expensive, but pales into insignificance compared to the cost of the man-hours we have spent trying to do a simple payment.
Got an e-mail the next day to say that they have decided that the invoice we submitted is not acceptable because it needs to show all the details of both the company and the individual settling the invoice. So we would need to contact our supplier and get them to re-issue the invoice with a load of additional info.
Ended up just using a local supplier that is more expensive, but at least we can pay with a internet banking payment. 
Widespread bitcoin use cannot arrive soon enough.

If you really need the wrench right now, you have to pay the market rate. If you are willing to wait for a lull in wrench demand, you can get away much cheaper. You can buy wrenches in bulk from one of the big box stores, but the shelves in those stores tend to collapse under the weight. Also, their wrenches are shit. If on the other hand you establish connections with some other wrench enthusiasts, you will be able to obtain wrenches as and when you need them, without having to queue at the checkout, paying unpredictable rates or having big-wrench know all about your wrench buying habits.
