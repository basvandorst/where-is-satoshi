I'm having difficulty understanding how you can decrypt PGP if the sender has lost their key. Did I read that correctly?

Haha. Very cool man, thanks.

So are you saying that you can store the information that gives you access to your wallet in your head?

The criticism of free market economies in this thread is silly. Not only do most of the posts lack any sort of analytical criticism, but they also mock those who believe in free markets.
My political stance aside, the Dark Leaks auction is a poor reason to criticize "a trustless and free market system" as put it. Leaks of information happen within regulated and non-regulated markets. Scams happen within regulated and non-regulated markets. None of what is happening here is unique to a  specific economic system, if you can even say that it has anything to do with economics. 
Not to mention that it would be insane to criticize something such as Silk Road for having faults considering the circumstances under which it had to operate. 
Also, there's a lot of misinformation about how DNM work. Military grade encryption (PGP) is a MUST for many markets. Very few messages are ever sent through plain text, unless they are 100% inconspicuous. Not that this is relevant to the first part of my post, but I figured it's worth addressing. Serious users (those unlikely to fall under the script-kiddy title) use a healthy amount of resources to stay anonymous. Those who have there information leaked are just falling prey to DNM-Darwinism.

Say I was to invest 800 dollars into a rig. What are the chances that I would be able to profit?
I do have experience in generating online currencies for profit through MMORPGs which I figure will make the learning curve a little less steep.
