I don't know anything past the text of the email.

Yeah. I can't figure out how to do it. I can't even login, cloudflare throws a shit fit.

I think you bring up an important point that I must agree with. Because of the nature of bitcoin, a large percentage of its value is based on transferrability and its ability to be utilized. Currently there aren't enough businesses accepting bitcoin as payment to really justify high values.
However, I disagree with you that all of the businesses doing it are doing it just for simple self-promotion. I think that a lot of the businesses accepting bitcoin are doing it because the founders believe in bitcoin's viability. I suppose this crash will be an easy way to weed out those who are serious about implementing it from those who are not.
I don't think I'm trying to move the goalposts as much as I think that there's a lack of understanding of what and where the goalposts are. The sidebar calls it "the internet currency" but I don't really think that's 100% accurate.
In terms of "backing" and "storing nothing", well, the USD is backed with "faith in the US government" which is to say backed only by a concept. The value of bitcoin is backed by people's faith in bitcoin. The value of gold is backed only in people's faith in gold as a store of value. In the end, the value of something is only the value of people's faith in that entity, and bitcoin valuation is no different.
But in the end, you're correct, bitcoin will only succeed if more businesses and people start accepting it as payment.

Absolutely. Reddit tends to get very sensitive about topics its passionate about, regardless of the side. I think that name calling and insults is counterproductive. I think if we can both state the reasons we feel a certain way then we can both become better educated.
There is an army dedicated to the USD, and bitcoin doesn't have one. If the US declared bitcoin illegal and started rounding up the people in this subreddit with guns, then the bitcoin price chart would drop off pretty quickly. Doing so would be tantamount to doing what China just did, although I doubt it'd fly as well here.

Their website is of course totally down
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:10:02
Also where would you list it?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:49:10
The links were redirects because they send their emails out through a mail manager and that's how it tracks the clicks.

Did you guys see the JPMorgan patent for a tech to rival bitcoin? 
Makes me want to pull out my tinfoil hat.

Excellent explanation! I think that you explained it much better than I did.
