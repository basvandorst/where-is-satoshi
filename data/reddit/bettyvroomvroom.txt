No way this would even show up as a blip on their radar. They do insane volume.

Anyone care to give an estimated guess at which remittance-heavy countries would be friendly to this, as well as the percent likelihood? After googling, it looks like Robocoin so far is only in a select few fairly developed countries. What about Mexico? Philippines? Etc
@_date: 2014-05-04 07:48:53
I'm not calling you a liar, but why do I find no results for "megaeuros" or "gigaeuros" when I Google them? Can your show me an example? 
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:31:19
Where is this said?

UFC sponsorship would be ideal because Joe Rogan would absolutely use it as a talking point, far more than any other announcer in ANYTHING.  Joe has a decent understanding of it and is already quite pro-bitcoin.  That's like a free multiplier for the promotion. 
I'd certainly donate. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:37:27
I wasn't expecting minutes. But I think it interests him enough and would be notable enough for him to mention the "new, unique" sponsor and say something that is better than "well, I looked it up on the old Google machine...."
You're right I could be wrong though. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:52:33
Some people are attracted to it for different reasons. I.e. right here with lower fee remittances
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:36:02
Half of them weren't even paying attention and instead on their laptops. He got no reactions even at the more entertaining moments of his talk. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:50:50
Pronounced you-bit? 
Me gusta! 
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:19:41
It's simple marketing. I'm all for calling it "dark" too, in theory. Unfortunately marketing and the way things are presented have a huge impact on how the product is received. It's just the way it is and if you want the best public reaction, you have to play that game.

I'm not advocating actual use of the word millieuro. I'm just trying to demonstrate that people would be confused if millieuro was used. They would have to stop and think about it. 
There would be no confusion however if you said 10 000 meters. Sure, 10 km would be more appropriate, but nobody would have to ponder what you were talking about. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:31:57
Sorry, I didn't know that robo was charging that much. Then of course, at this point the fees are not lower. 
That said, there are still other reasons for people to be attracted to bitcoin than "being their own bank". I.e. less friction on transactions and/or privacy. Don't get me wrong, I'm totally against using banks, but that's not "the whole point"of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:11:34
The real problem is that it's called "bitcoin" in the first place. Don't blame the people advocating bit as if there were a more obvious choice. 
One could make the same arguments against the word "bitcoin". 
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:20:05
I don't know why you keep getting downvoted. SI prefixes are almost never used when dealing with currency. 
If they were they would confuse people. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:09:36
Not only that, but another thing happening right NOW is that I know 2 people that say they would buy some bitcoin, but want it to drop in value first because they don't like the idea of owning 0.4336 of something. 
It's purely a psychological barrier, but it has an undeniable impact nonetheless. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:56:06
No Akon in the bitcoin panel? Pfff what a waste. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:52:33
I agree. I think people have already settled their mind that the decimal places aren't the issue. 0.0089 bitcoin is not going to stay. We're talking about what to name it. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 07:51:47
They use the currency milliyen? Because I'm not trying to argue about using 4, 5, and 6 digit numbers. I'm arguing that using "milli" and "micro" prefixes for currencies is not common and not intuitive. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:32:45
It's exposure. 
Have you ever heard, "any news is good news"? Well this isn't good or bad news but by the same thought it puts bitcoin into people's radar, end of story. And the more awareness it receives, the more credible it becomes. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:33:03
Your totally right. Knew I was close! Haha
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:05:06
Just as a thought experiment: how do you think a normal person would react to hearing something priced as 3690 millieuros instead of 3.69 euros? 
My personal take its that it's not intuitive for currencies. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 01:40:34
Is there any support for moto instead of "bit" (taken from Nakamoto)
It remains relevant to bitcoin and is the best I could come up with. Just an idea. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:18:02
"Can you pay me back the 5000 millieuros from this morning? "
It's correct, but it would confuse the hell out of people. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:03:38
Hmm I could see that being possible too :/
@_date: 2014-05-03 01:19:40
If anyone had a better word suggestion than "bit", please share it. 
Since it seems there's a consensus on the decimal yet the vernacular is debated, this is the only issue we can improve. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:33:17
I didn't say they would have to ponder using kilometers. 
I said it's much more intuitive to know what 10 000 meters is if you told it to me. (When describing altitude you'd say something like 2 600 meters much more than you'd say 2.6 km)
I'm going to call b.s. on millieuros not being confusing. Try asking the nice young girl at the cafe about theprice for a coffee and saying, " so that's 2200 millieuros, right? " She'll get it, but aside from her thinking you're an ass, she's going to have to think about it for a moment. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 01:16:57
And think of all the humor it would open us up to
Honey, why am I paying so much for this gigabit internet? 
Well, it's the "gigabit" plan honey, what did you expect/? 
Badum tssss
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:57:29
It's a point of centralization where bitcoin is all about decentralization
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:23:57
Chill out man. You're arguing unrelated stuff now, at least compared to your initial response. 
It's not the Americans vs the world. Adopting "bit" has nothing inherently American about it. It's simply adopting new vernacular. 
And if the non-US population is so up on using SI, then why is .01 euro not the centieuro? That would make sense, right? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:27:37
Yes, it exists. But it's almost never used. It's more like a piece of trivia. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:39:13
Curious why do you feel MIT students picking it up to be so important? Is there anything outside of the obvious? Just curious. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:34:08
You could hear them at one later part of the talk. Also are audiences usually Mic'd? 
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:08:49
The real problem came when Satoshi named the network "Bitcoin". Bit is the most intuitive name for it, although it might not be perfect, but look what we have to work with! 
One could make the exact same arguments for why "bitcoin" isn't an ideal name. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 01:03:21
I don't think this well be as big of a problem as you think. Most people here are used to dollars our Euros where the conversations are similar (1.4:1 or whatever) but in many countries their currencies are already in the thousands.
For example, I'm in Costa Rica right now and it's 550 colones to a dollar. When I go to eat at a restaurant, a typical item will be priced 7500 or 22500. If I go to the electronics store a new tv will be 2 000 000.  You get the idea. 
This isn't unique either, have a look a lot of other countries' currencies and you'll find similar things. Chile, Colombia, Korea just off the top of my head.  And it works just fine :)
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:28:31
(from Nakamoto)
It's relevant to bitcoin and rolls off the tongue. 
I suggested it yesterday and more than a few people seemed to like it, so I'll put it out here again. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 09:00:28
Exactly. Most people don't use them, save a small subset in finance. 
Also, and this is getting off topic, but wouldn't the words be the same in other languages? Last time I was in France/Italy/Germany/wherever they were all using "euro", therefore "kiloeuro" etc should be standard? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:42:50
Thanks for the answer! 
It still looks like those use cases are pretty rare. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 23:46:43
I'm all for something different than "bit".  But what do you suppose it be called then? The choices of saying for example 0.00531 bitcoin or 5.31 millibitcoins or 5310 microbitcoins are not going to cut it. They may be correct, but they're ugly as hell. If we can come up with something better than bit, I'm all for it, but "nanobitcoins" will not fly on a practical level for the laymen.
