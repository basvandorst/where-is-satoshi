please by stuff from us in bitcoin :)

It's sort of silly thinking as well to look at the price of "one coin for $200" when you can buy fractions of a coin.
edit: Hmmm why the downvote?  If I'm in error I'd love to know why, I hate to propagate incorrect info.

So many thanks to [Coincafe.com]( for interviewing us! If anyone has any questions about yaupon I'm happy to answer them.  We've had a discount code for for awhile so I'll post it here again if anyone's interested in trying it out.  20% off with checkout code "@_date: 2015-12-30 08:03:30
I don't know enough about bitcoin to know what it's a problem either. Anyone ELI5?
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:39:48
There's no such thing as bad publicity :)

What would make an exchange more reputable than Coinbase?  Honest question.

I've bought into a poker game with 1oz silver coins...
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:19:23
Gold and silver are nice in that they're easily transportable.  You can currently buy 28 lbs of broccoli for the value of 1 gram of gold.

Buy our tea :p

How do we submit our products to Spendabit?  Merchant Suite?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:29:25
From what I understand you have your BCH in your offline wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:31:56
Do you have a source for this statement?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:50:35
Coinbase and OpenBazaar.  We don't offer any extra incentives via our website but we do sell out yaupon for cheaper via OpenBazaar.  On either platform orders are pretty rare but they've been very profitable since we've just been holding.

empty jar?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:16:59
This is what I wanted to hear.  Going to go do the same now on our Shopify site.
edit:  Done.  Looks good.  Took me 12 minutes from reading this news to having it setup.  Easy peasey.
So you can now buy yaupon tea (n. america's only native caffeinated plant!) with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum.  In the past we've only supported Bitcoin and litecoin, because those were the only gateways that works easily with Shopify.   ;)

Yeah but goats are trending up due to hipster hippies :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:17:53
Haha, we accept BTC. Care for some yaupon tea?  Yaupon is North America's only native caffeinated plant.  It's also high in theobromine, the stimulant in chocolate.  Oh, it's tasty too.  Makes great hot or iced tea. :P
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:16:37
You're getting a bad deal on goats.  I bought my wether for $50, but that was 10 years ago.

Also, 
Please and thank you Cool idea.  Going to install it today.

As a reputable business... all my income and expenses are already tracked, fucked, seized, etc. by the good 'ol banks &amp; IRS.  I could try and cheat them to hide some money, but the hassle and risk just isn't worth it.  This is welcome news for a lot of businesses and business adoption of Bitcoin is what it's going to take for Bitcoin to be worth anything.  Just my humble opinion.  Come buy some yaupon tea   :p

Does Coinbase give a reason for not batching?
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:08:44
Our company got an interview on the local news station about bitcoin.  &gt;crickets&lt;

Yup.  We've been taking bitcoin payments for about two years on our Shopify store.  Which is around the time bitcoin was worth $300.  In the last 2 years we've sold about $300 worth of yaupon in bitcoin on Shopify and OpenBazaar.  We've never sold the bitcoin so we're sitting on 0.3-something BTC.  Right at about $1800 :)
@_date: 2015-11-10 01:51:28
I see, thanks.

Seems like it could be illegal.

The high was 499.85, looks like people taking profits.

@_date: 2015-11-10 15:32:40
Please do :) We'd love to know what you think about it!
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:51:21
Pardon my ignorance but why would Coinbase care?
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:45:27
We sell our yaupon tea for bitcoin.  Yes it's based on the current USD exchange rate but we don't exchange our BTC into USD.  We HODL!

The great thing about this system is that dollar bills weight exactly 1 gram.  So your 2.572 kilobucks (might I suggest K$) would weight exactly 2.572 kilograms in paper dollars bills

Because the banks can get loans from the federal reserve for much cheaper than you or I can.  For every 1 dollar they have in deposits they're allowed to loan out 10 dollars.  Say they loan you $50,000 at 5% interest.  Well, they get that money from the Federal Reserve at a much cheaper interest rate and they make money as the middle man.
