We're going to have to outlaw the Euro. Sorry guys - it might compete with the US dollar. Oh, and the Yen, Canadian dollar, AUD, etc. Everyone on Earth (and anywhere else) that has created a currency that might compete with the US dollar.

The basic concept is great as a universal currency but price fluctuations make it challenging.  If you buy a currency you wake up the next day and the 40units you bought are still 40 units.  With bitcoin you could wake up and there are 37 units and you didn't spend it on anything.  That is very hard for the average consumer to accept.

It should also be noted that second market recently announced an open ended mutual fund that will invest in bitcoin

When you use a smaller bank to transact business internationally you will need to pay fees to many banks (only only directly pay your bank but many people get paid).
With bitcoin it is only the miners that get compensated.

I can't say it is good cause Ukrainian economics needs time to get up but on the other hand if btc would be the instrument which help them to get up when, I think, the govs would make it legit and it would be good btc

It's a big step towards decenralized economy

I think bitcoin could really devlop in some of the third world countries. Imagine if one of them fully adopts bitcoin because of their failing economy or currency? It could really drive and spread adoption when/if people see how well it's being implemented elsewhere.

Botangle is a really nice website.

BITCOIN IS DAD!

As someone mentioned in another post, they need a lot of working capital to cover daily cash out. If a merchant gets paid in bitcoin and wants payment in $, Bitpay doesn't go sell that bitcoin immediately and then pay the merchant, they pay the merchant then have to go sell the bitcoin. That mean working capital to cover the outflow.

Yeah this is great! Supporting Bitcoin ATMs is what community should do!
Very nice and kind!

"On Thursday, a collective of politically radical coders that calls itself unSystem plans to release the first version of Dark Wallet"
sounds good but seems like it will be until the first FBI visit. (I'd like to be wrong)

A bitcoin transaction needs 6 confirmations to be irreversible.

We have the authority because we passed laws hundreds of years ago. You must submit.

You can't hold a stock, or most of the contents of your bank account, or your pension or your bonds. People are accustomed to the idea of numbers on screens or paper adding up to real world benefits unless they're batty or ancient.

On one hand this can be seen as Cali being on the cutting edge of things but on the other, it could be statist Cali doing what they do best: legislating.

Bitcoin recently lost billions of dollars in revenue, when Putin kicked it out of Russia. So they are running scared to retain their remaining markets. Tactics like these might help them in the short term.

Does other universities have any similar projects?
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:02:29
I would argue that this is a very big step in the right direction to get bitcoin to start trading as an ETF. I would say that ETF trading would likely push up the price over the long term.

The IRS is a piece of shit, fully non-Constitutional, run from the UK/Zio everlasting debt cadre of lawyers, the scum of the Earth.  The 16th Amendment should be destroyed forever, along with the Non-American Internal Revenue Service and the BAR association, which should be broken up and its members made to spend the rest of their lives in labor camps doing real work like digging.

and what should I think about if i don't have $2,000 to invest in bitcoin at a loss?

Any sane person should prefer a currency backed by science over a currency backed by nothing

The more products and services we can - as a network and community - provide solely using bitcoin as the currency the faster adoption can happen.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:48:10
Agreed. Bitcoin is definitely going to evolve into something big!
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:45:22
I think only the major players are trustworthy. Bitstamp survived a hackers attack but i think the stolen amount was less than their daily turnover which means that common users have no reasons to fear for their savings.

I've sent you an email with some corrections. I hope it would be useful for your project. 
I also want to say that I highly appreciate the things you and Map Of Coins do for our cryptocommunity.
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:03:56
That's great that you’ve updated this project. It would be eager to communicate with you from now on. 
BTW I found few things missing. You need to add description of general specifications to NXT. The same goes for its forks.

I think Central Bank can regulate currencies within a country. No laws are necessary.
