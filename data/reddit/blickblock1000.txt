Yeah it’s the fault of these kids that want to go to big school and take huge loans out for half ass degrees. I went for 2 years don’t have any loans and already have a job in my industry. It’s like everyone I knew left town and went to “DEBT UNIVERSITY” and most of them are still in class and working part time jobs.

I guess it’s just hard to wrap my head around something not being “5$” and being a really small percentage of a bigger unit. I feel like I would mess up counting the decimal places and accidentally pay 150$ for a pizza. But someone smarter than me is working on this so we’ll see how it turns out.

I hate it when people write “how (____) feels like” it’s “how (____) feels” or “What (____) feels like”
