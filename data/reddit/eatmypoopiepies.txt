If you had $10, gave me $5 yesterday, and I gave you $1 today, you're not up, you're still down $4.

Yup.. I was one of the few who actually got their product. I had a few Jalapenos running at about 8gh/s, the green boards running around 10gh/s, and a powered USB hub full of the USB Block Erruptors running at 336mh/s... Those were interesting times.
Ended up selling all of them for 3x the price during the $1k bubble.

I've been mining since the Butterfly Labs scandals and always thought "I'll never buy with real money, I'll just mine.".
Then in August, it hit $4000 and I had some extra money laying around and thought, "This is probably a bad idea, but worse case I'm fueling someone elses spaceship.".
It has gone up 3x since then.

I feel that Coinbase is about to fall on hard times and can easily close shop without any warning or notice to its users (seems to be a common thing with them lately). Also, after being part of the Mt. Gox downfall, I would never suggest keeping any amount of crypto at an exchange that you can not afford or wish to lose.

You can believe in what ever version of Bitcoin you’d like, but this is going to hurt everyone who leaves their crypto there, no matter what side of the coin you choose. It’s times like this we stop the bcash/core war and stick together as believers in cryptocurrency.

I've been keeping my eye out for them, but they are all way over priced due to them being backordered, or they are shipping from France (I'm in the US) and that leads to high shipping costs. Guess I'll be waiting :(

Everyone commenting is putting you down for getting something that you truly enjoy. Isn't that the purpose of Bitcoin? To get enjoyment out of what you're doing? If these people were to die tomorrow, they can never say that they got any enjoyment out of hodling Bitcoin. They dream of their own moon and might see it one day, however if that day never comes, all they have done is bring misery to others by shaming them for selling. 
I hope you enjoy your watch, it's a beautiful piece.

Mine it.
Use Lolli for bitcoin-back on your purchases.
Mine shitcoins and trade them for bitcoin.
Buy it on coinbase or another exchange.
Ask your boss to pay you in bitcoin.
Sell items on craigslist/facebook for bitcoin.
Do random jobs for bitcoin.
Pretty much the same way you'd get fiat.

I had a farm of these (336mh/s if I remember correctly), ButterFlyLab Jalapenos (7-8gh/s), and those 10gh/s boards. When bitcoin went to $1k, I sold them on Craigslist within two hours for more than 4x the price. I would mine enough BTC to pay my cell phone bill each month and thought it was amazing...

Honestly, I feel there is no "best" antivirus software. They all use similar databases of known malware and the best thing is for the user to constantly keep them up to date and practice good security.
The reason I feel there are no "bests" is because if I was to create a piece of malware right now, it would have to spread and infect multiple machines before anti-virus providers would be able to identify it, at which point I would have already infected multiple computers. Even more, if the virus/malware does not communicate back to a server (where the antivirus could just null the DNS or IP query), and only identifies BTC addresses and changes them to the address of the hacker, it could be different.

If only there was some type of internet website similar to the card catalog at a library where you could type in words related to the problem you are having and it would put up a list of those informational web pages that are similar to what you are trying to locate. I bet the person who creates that would make millions of American currencies.

This car has been my dream car since I was younger. My father use to work for Porsche and always told me how nice they drove, how fun they are to drive, and how nice the interior is. I remember him stating that you don't need to move your elbow to do much and that everything is at the leisure of just moving your wrist to adjust things (shifting, radio, etc..).
I've always dreamed of owning one, but still can't afford it. Eh, maybe someday. I hope whoever buys it takes care of it and fully enjoys the car.

Ah yes.. Back in the days when Mt. Gox was a place everyone used and I was lucky enough to score a few Jalapenos from BFL before they started "falling behind". Took about three weeks for the delivery and I remember mining on Englius (sp?). Before that, I was using PiMP to mine scrypt and when Bitcoin hit 1k I thought that was the end of it and sold everything. I was selling 333m/h asic USB miners for $100 each to people who saw Bitcoin on the news and had no idea what they were buying. Dumped my BFL miners for more than triple the price, and sold everything... I look at some of my old transactions and think of how much of a fool I was, only to look at the price now in regret. 
While I regret selling, nothing teaches you better than first hand experience. HODL my fellow BTCers.
