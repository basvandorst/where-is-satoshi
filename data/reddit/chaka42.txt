The economy you live under has the biggest influence on your life. The way your money works dictates many aspects of society.  Only because you have lived under the same system all your life do you not notice. We can't even envision a different history under alternative circumstances. 
When they print money, the people who spend it first get the full value before the inflation has effected prices. It's called the Cantillon Effect. The inequality is built into the system. Money is being robbed from the poorest and handed to the wealthiest.

The ability to easily earn tokens from a decentralised network will bring people in. Lots of people are here because they could mine with their GPU. But when we have a few dozen successful dApps in full production there will be many other ways to earn. Every new technology has to cross the chasm into mainstream adoption. But you are not usually incentivised to do so with money. When it comes they are going to come in droves.

Bitcoin's value is in the security of the network. If another coin gains greater security in its consensus mechanism then OK, we can use that, but I don't see any sign of that in any other coin.
People think Bitcoin needs to be adopted as a means of exchange in order for it to be successful. This is putting the cart before the horse. Store of Value is the greatest utility of bitcoin. Separating political leaders from the money printing presses and preventing them from diluting your savings is a real use case. People in developing nations can store there own wealth for the first time without the expense and counter party risk of holding gold. When the world understands bitcoin is not a scam and see's the need for a global apolitical store of value, only then will the volatility subside and people choose to use it in transactions. Until then, merchants will use stable coins, that's fine, it doesn't detract from Bitcoin's real use.
If you slice a loaf a bread into smaller pieces you don't get any more bread. You can use Bitcoin in smaller denominations but there is still only 21 million bitcoins.

Of course people will be paid in bitcoin. Government shitcoin doesn't stand a chance. Good money chases out the bad money. What do you think happens when the next recession hits? Just bail out the banks again? Create even more public debt? They will default, or hyper-inflate from money printing. It's just a mathematical certainty.
After another reward halvening Bitcoin will be inherently deflationary because the inflation is lower than growth of global GDP.

What do you mean? It's money you just transact like fiat money. Customers pay with Bitcoin, workers are compensated in Bitcoin. The only difference is it's peer to peer so you don't have payment services in the middle taking their cut.

-Impossible to send conventional money/gold over the internet without a 3rd party payment processor and associated fees.
-It is possible to use BTC or a stable coin directly in a dApp and some may choose to. The idea is to capture the value of the service in the native token and not be exposed to external pricing factors.
-Sorry meant to say Proof-of-Stake.
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:32:57
Utility tokens have a specific use within a decentralized service. You can transfer value directly peer to peer instead of a company/customer model. If I want to rent out my CPU when I'm not using it, then someone can pay me for its use in Golem tokens for example. All handled by software without a middleman taking a cut. I could sell the tokens I've earned for Bitcoin or a stable coin. There is always demand as people renting CPU time need to buy them to use the service. 
When blockchains move to proof-of-work consensus they take very little electricity to run. When fiat money collapses we are left with Bitcoin, the greatest form of money humans have ever invented.

No more fiat is closer than you think. The central bank system was not designed to last forever, it was never designed to begin with. Fiat only has value if the banks and governments remain solvent. If you remember they were't solvent. We had to bail them out creating even more government debt. Since then they have been doing quantitative easing, literally money printing from thin air just to keep the ball rolling. These are temporary emergency measures just like the removal of gold backing was in 1971. This system will not last, you will see the end of fiat money in your life time. 
Most of the bitcoin has already been mined. The ledger of UTXOs that everyone running a full node is enforcing is not going anywhere unless you shut down the Internet.

People live paycheck to paycheck because the inflation gives them a high time preference for money. You are encouraged to spend today and take on debt as the inflation will reduce the burden of paying it back. Our whole culture is based on instant gratification as you may as well spend today because it will be worth less tomorrow. For the first time in your life you have access to a deflationary money. Those how make the correct economic decisions today will be rewarded tomorrow.

Size of the market? Everyone with an internet connection and a piggy bank. Bitcoin is a better version of gold, zero cost to hold. Just protect your private key. 
Currently inflation matters to about [half of the world's population]( Over a longer time frame it matters to everyone as no fiat money remains stable forever. We just lurch from one economic disaster to the next and all politicians do is print more money to pull themselves out of the mess they make. You may use a stable fiat currency for now, but you are part of a developed nation elite of about 1.5 Billion people. What about the rest of the world?
Anyone can benefit from holding Bitcoin no matter how little or how much money they have. People either buy Bitcoin before their national currency is devalued or after. They just get more if they buy before.

Bitcoin is the computer science breakthrough of digital scarcity. Before bitcoin, all data could be copied 100% perfectly for free at no cost, so had no inherent value. We used rare commodities as money because they are scarce. We used gold as money for thousands of years because it was expensive to mine so new supply inflation was low. Bitcoin is the first asset in human history that the supply is truly limited and a known quantity. 21 Million that's it. Only a small fraction of the planet's population can ever possibly own whole bitcoin.

Are you confident the banks and government remain solvent? A government that is 21 Trillion dollars in debt, and banks that needed to be bailed out just 10 years ago. What do you think happens in the next recession? Just keep bailing them out, increasing government debt, printing more money hyper-inflating all the value to Venezuela levels. Either that or defaulting on the debt. One or the other, but probably both if history is a good judge of outcomes.

Store of Value just means maintaining your purchasing power from when you earn money until you decide to spend money. Not everybody spends their wages as soon as they get them. Some people like to save and have long term savings. Putting it in a bank and earning 1% interest is no good when the price of goods and services are doubling every 10 years. You are still losing money, that's why people buy gold. This option of storing value over many years is now open to everyone regardless of how little or how much you start with. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. Supply is fixed, demand is unbounded so purchasing power will always increase in the long term. 
If you don't want the risk of investing in the stock market, and you want to have savings you use a Store of Value.

Everybody needs a store of value. That doesn't stop you from investing as well. Nobody should be 100% invested. You diversify and keep some in cash some in gold or real estate. Everything has some risk, historically gold is the least risky. But that will not be true forever. We may have technical advances in the mining process, we may go asteroid mining. All markets can crash. 
People need to find a way to de-risk from the inevitable collapse of the fiat money system. You don't bail out the banks and do quantitative easing in a functioning economy. These are temporary emergency measures to keep the ball rolling. Just like the removing of the backing of gold from the dollar was a temporary emergency measure. 
Do you even read my replies? We already covered that Bitcoin will be inherently deflationary after one more halvening.
Bitcoin needs to prove it's store of value property over time. Yes it is a risky venture today. It's a new tech, a new asset but it has to start somewhere. Maybe in 20 years your children will find it a useful Store of Value asset. For our generation it is pure speculation. Who gives a shit about what happens to the price over a 12 mouth period.

Some things will become decentralised in that time, but I believe in 100 years eventually private enterprise will be seen has the old way of doing things. Decentralised ownership of all businesses could one day be the norm.

I fairly certain it has always been possible. I just never seen any wallets implement a timelock. The Lightning network functions by using hashed timelocked contracts, so a simple way to lockup your Bitcoin until a certain block hight must be possible. 
This feature not being available really annoys me. It would be like storing gold in a timelocked vault. If you could set a 30 day withdrawal period on your cold wallet that would be a huge disincentive for the kidnapping attack.

Yes its clear the Bitcoins have been mixed using Wasabi. This is probably exactly what their email is referring to.
Gemini is based in New York and must comply with the New York Bitlicence. Some of the strictest regulation anywhere. Blockchain analytics products risks making some bitcoins tarnished and worth less than other bitcoins. If all Bitcoins are not fungible then Bitcoin cannot become a system of money. Companies using these products are harming Bitcoin in my view and I would boycott them as I want to see Bitcoin succeed.

Most people suffer from recency bias. They think if something has existed their entire lives it is a truth they can count on. Maybe you are living through an anomaly in history. The current US dollar has existed for 47 years since the gold backing was removed by Nixon. Today, your paper money is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. A government that is $22 Trillion in debt. That is not a credit I want my hard earned money relying on. 
The US dollar is the global reserve currency as after WWII, it was the only large economy to be left standing. WWII was a long time ago, and there is no reason in the modern day for it to remain so with the raise of equally large economies. 
History doesn't stand still for anyone. A money based on political will alone will not stand on its own feet when politics itself is an ever changing dynamic. We used gold as money for 5000 years as it was a social consensus that this asset had value because it was scarce and hard to acquire. Bitcoin is the first asset with a truly fixed supply. You can always mine more gold, but Bitcoin is the hardest asset ever seen. When the next recession throws it's punch, the dollar is already on its knees. I know what will become the real money.

Economics is not a science. It is something people are far from perfecting. I enjoy reading history and it is just a secession of lurching from one economic disaster to the next. The stable periods can sometimes last a while. But your theory is we will see perpetual stability forever. I've seen 3 recessions in my life and the fixes of the last one just created even bigger problems. Printing money inflates asset prices giving only perceived growth. The reality is the mother of all bubbles from fake money. Nobody can predict the future but preparing for the worst and hoping for the best is a better position than eternal optimism.

People will give out loans in a p2p model. Instead of giving your money to a bank and earning 2% ROI while they make 20% interest, you will see a greater return whist borrowers get a better deal. Wherever people have excess capital they will want to put a portion of that capital to work. 
The risk can also be offset with decentralized models. Look into what [Bloom]( are doing in this area. It's an experiment in credit scoring that may or may not workout. But new innovating ideas are being tried so we may need less reliance on all sorts of centralized institutions in the future.

Nobody needs a whole bitcoin. Holding just 0.28 BTC means no more than one percent of global population can possibly have more than you.

Because of the way markets usually work a bullish spike at this time actually means a longer bottoming period. Image if the opposite happens and we had a sharp capitulation spike down. This would mark a clear bottom and everyone would start buying up all the cheap bitcoin leading to an early up trend. Instead we are going to bounce of $6k and many expect a double bottom. Lots of people expecting lower prices again will be a self fulfilling prophesy leaving large institutions more time accumulating. 
So spending $100 M today will mean getting $1 Billion into BTC at lower prices over the year.

I give people the credit of having their own brain. They can listen to ideas and form their own opinion. Shall we all just keep quite and not talk about new technologies? Just live in our safe bubble and be passive to whatever the future brings? I choose to engage with a world of ideas. It's a very human trope to call something you don't understand a scam. It helps you avoid pitfalls when you don't have full information. But you have all the time in the world to learn and have access to all the worlds information at your fingertips. Don't listen to me, don't listen to anyone. Go and find out if this a really a scam, if so who's running it? Can't be the creator Satoshi, we can see his almost 1 Million BTC that were mined in the first year have never moved on the blockchain. If he had sold at the top he would have been the richest person on the planet, yet he didn't. He just disappeared and left his invention for the world to do with as they wish.
Nobody is going to persuade you to buy bitcoin. There is no marketing department pushing a product onto you. This is just really cool technology with massive implications greater than any other invention in my life. The Internet and Bitcoin are the two civilization altering technologies not seen since the Printing Press and double entry accounting 500 years ago, or writing and ledgers did 5000 years ago.

It's a growth currency. Just a collectible that could one day be used as money. People buy it speculating that it can succeed. If liquidity continues to grow as it has, then it proves itself as a good Store of Value. Then it can move to Medium of Exchange as the volatility settles down. Finally a Unit of Account as it becomes globally accepted and goods are priced in BTC.
This all takes time and there is nothing anyone can do to speed up the process. We are 10 years in and really ahead of schedule, as it's already the fastest, highest rise in value of any asset in human history. Take a long view and position accordingly.

You can't just hold your arms out and stop institutional investors. It is an inevitable step in the process of Bitcoin growing up. Bitcoin will only be useful as currency when it is seen as far more valuable by far more people. Until then it is a speculative asset open to everyone from Wall St to kids in Bangladesh. When we transition from a store of value to a medium of exchange it will only be when price stabilizes because the order books are deep and price has plateaued far higher then here. The money entering the market can only get us there quicker. Having possession of your own Bitcoin will be the only way to take part in the digital p2p economy that is being build. You do not need to worry about all the Bitcoin being bought up by institutions and becoming centralised. It is infinitely divisible. Small fractions of bitcoin can be uses to fuel trillions of dollars worth of economic activity.

Lindy Effect. Every year that bitcoin continues to exist and produce blocks, the technical risk lessens and people feel move comfortable holding more of their money in this asset.
Word of mouth. Over time more people hear about bitcoin and educate themselves on this new type of money. The narratives get refined and mainstream media take this more seriously. Going from less that 1% of people holding upwards.
Bitcoin halvening. Every four years the new issuance is cut in half decreasing the supply added to the market. Bitcoin is harder to acquire driving up the price leading to FOMO.
Doors opening up to institutional investors with licensed custodians and regulated exchanges.
More features becoming possible like smart contracts and privacy features. Taking market share back from the altcoins as people find that unless it uses Proof of Work Nakamoto consensus it is not a viable platform security wise.
Some fiat money systems around the world become less stable as we reach the end of the current cycle and people look for alternatives to the central banking system.

The price only has to double to counter the halvening. Ignore the bubbles they happen for other reasons. The price rose 80% 3 months before the 2016 event and rose 200% 4 months before the 2012 event. It was clear at the time this was the market pricing these events in.

Would you put every single asset to your name into dollars? All my money is already in Bitcoin as it is the safer asset and I have total confidence with it being there. All fiat money goes to zero. Average life of a fiat money is 27 years. Your money relies on the banks and governments remaining solvent. They are trillions of dollars in debt! We already bailed them out once! 
Bitcoin will be here for hundreds of years. As long as the Internet exists bitcoin will keep producing blocks. It will still be the same Bitcoin when it becomes the global reserve currency. The only thing that changes is your perception of it. Your perception can be controlled with gaining knowledge of the new thing.

It would cease being a speculative "investment" and be a stable form of money. Far more stable than national currencies as it is global and not subject to any single country's economy. It's deflationary rather than fiat money which is inflationary so your purchasing power will still increase over time. Some say it should closely match the rise on global GDP. So prices for things should fall about 3-4% a year as opposed to rising 2% in the current fiat system. This is all theory at this point as no one really knows. Nothing like Bitcoin has existed before. The new issuance and Bitcoin that is lost forever has some effect on available supply effecting the exact deflationary nature.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:57:21

What you do before mixing with Wasabi is irrelevant as the history is effectively erased. Use the Coinjoin feature in Wasabi. Once mixed, you have a bunch of 0.1 BTC outputs. Send each UTXO out to cold storage separately, each to their own address to preserve the privacy. So long as you don't just send them back to a wallet address you used before as that would be silly.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:59:19
It is reasonable as Bitcoin is just digital zeros and ones. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. As a deflationary currency greater and greater economic activity can be done on smaller and smaller fractions of a Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is around for hundreds of years whole countries economies can be run on sub-satoshies. If you manage to be one of the few million people who will ever hold whole bitcoin your descendants will remember you as a god.

Some miners did decide they want to control the network. And they ended up on a fork called Bitcoin Cash. I'm saying no attacker can gather enough hardware to control &gt;50% of the BTC network.

Do not trade unless you are already a day trader in other assets. It is something that takes hundreds of hours of learning otherwise the whales will just take all your money. Just buy and hold you will still make outstanding returns as Bitcoin is the best performing asset in history over multiple year time frame. We are still early and just getting started.
Spend your time learning everything you can about Bitcoin in order to feel comfortable holding a portion of your money in Bitcoin as it goes through the crazy volatility that is to be expected from having to start from zero and rise to a global store of value.

Sure Satoschi sees it BECOMING a peer-to-peer cash system. He didn't specify time frame for this to occur, and it wasn't worth anything for the first couple of years. We are 10 years in and today it is worth a bit more, but not nearly enough to be usable as cash yet. Just because you have arrived and want to use it today doesn't mean this process is going to accelerate. 
Time is a real thing in the real world and this new technology cannot be used for its intended purpose until the masses can see these zeros are ones are really worth something. Bitcoin doesn't care about your high time preference. Bitcoin is doing just fine and people will low time preference are going to continue to accumulate from people like you.

Time will tell who is right. You don't seem to realise just how early we still are. Only estimate around 40MM people hold crypto and all retail investors.

Bitcoin will not be used as currency until it reaches a MC of at lease $10 trillion. Paying a merchant with it today and they will imminently sell it for fiat putting selling pressure on the price. You could replace that bitcoin by buying it back but you are just being ridiculous. The only way bitcoin succeeds is if people are willing to hold Bitcoin, socking up supply and creating demand. Store of value must come before medium of exchange. You can't just put the cart before the horse. Bitcoin is not a payment network. It is the base settlement later of a system of sound money. Until it gains a monetary premium with deep order books and a stable price you are just wasting your time exchanging bitcoin for goods. Educate people and have patience. We are changing the money. That has only happened 5 times in 5000 years. This will take decades not months.

Bitcoin is not trying to be money today. It is a new technology that one day could possibly be used as money. For this to happen people have to first value it, and want to accept is as payment. We are changing the system of money. That will not happen in 1 year, 5 years or 10 years. But over that time you see it is becoming more valuable so progress is being made. As the price rises it becomes more liquid and order books get deeper. When it reaches about $1 Million then it will be stable in value and viable as a global settlement layer for a non government currency. Until then people are speculating on it's future value. 
If you think there is some small chance of it succeeding then the earlier you buy, the more Bitcoin you get, the wealthier you will be in the new money system. This incentive creates more demand over time increasing the price making it a self for-filling bootstrapping mechanism to go from zero to a global store of value.

Only the on/off ramps into fiat money are sketchy. This is a product of the banking regulations and not inherent to Bitcoin. This is the problem Bitcoin is here to solve.

You cannot live without spending. Bills must be paid. Maybe people will be incentivized to save for big ticket items and long term projects rather than discretionary consumerism and going into debt. 
Yes, soft money cannot live alongside hard money. National currencies will be subject to speculative attacks where it makes financial sense to borrow in the inflationary currency to buy the hard currency. This increases the supply of the inflationary money and raises the demand for the deflationary money. Over time making the soft money weaker and Bitcoin harder.
People buy Bitcoin before their national currency collapses or after. They just get more if they buy before.

No decentralized network is impervious to 51% attack. It is always a question of the security budget and logistics. This dictates how much economic activity can run on top of the network.

You can attempt to do what ever you want with Bitcoin. Fork the chain, inflate the amount, release competing node software. It is all irrelevant as the people decide what is a legitimate version of Bitcoin by holding it. Giving it value by buying it and setting the price in the market. Everyone can see your shit fork of Bitcoin and dump it on exchanges. Just look at Bitcoin Cash that has never been higher than 15% of Bitcoin's price. The people as a whole decide what Bitcoin is. So unless you do some mass mind control manipulation of people, Bitcoin will remain decentralized and outside any single entity's control.
