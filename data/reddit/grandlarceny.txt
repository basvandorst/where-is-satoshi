People whose house went up in value did not sell a chunk of their house they spent money.  In your analogy people would be selling a room of their house that went from being valued at 1% of their income up to 1000% of their income in the past few years in order to get more money which at best remained stable in value.
To oversimplify my point if there are 1000 people who currently own 50% of the total amount of Bitcoins then do they spend enough of their Bitcoins in the next 30 years on consumption and distribute their wealth so that the 27 million Bitcoins are distributed at least proportionally to the current world's wealth distribution?  I would see it as a incentive to not actually spend Bitcoins and just spend other forms of money while it continues to rise in value rapidly.

Why would they do this?  Are you thinking they would buy things with it because wouldn't that just put their wealth into other investments, property etc and keep wealth distribution uneven?

Yeah it is hard to really imagine the growth of systems over time and I suspect that you are right it would be a gradual trend up with spikes and crashes in price. Maybe I just underestimate how much people would view each price rise as being the final boom before the currency crashed and sell prematurely even if Bitcoins kept going up to a million a coin.
I am thinking however that I would not be selling my shares in a currency that continues to grow while other currencies devalue and I assume a lot of people are planning to hoard the same as me. I don;y think I am underestimating the current uneven distribution either as far less than 1% of the world's population currently owns more than 90% of the world's Bitcoin I would imagine.
Do mining companies have to sell their bitcoins or can they keep them?
