Where is the message used to sign these addresses ? Without this information, how do we check the signature validity and therefore the ownership of the private keys ? Does this message contain a block hash to prove  when the signature has been made ?
For a true crypto based proof of reserve, have a look at [airbex.net]( the merkle tree scheme is used to prove the liabilities, based on the idea on Greg Maxell. For more information about proper proof of reserve, read this [article]( written by Zak Wilcox.

What if the private keys are lost ? You can still see the balance but you won't be able to spend it.

Sorry but I can't see the message to sign the addresses on the page.

At [Airbex]( a new cryptocurrency exchange, we provide users with a real time proof of reserve, no need to wait months before a new audit. 
It is based on the idea of [Greg Maxwell’s/Peter Todd/Zak Wilcox]( and uses the javascript implementation by Olivier Lalonde.

The Huobi proof of reserve, like the recent OKCoin proof of reserve are sill trust based proof of reserve. Users of this exchange have to trust someone, even a respectable one. 
At [Airbex.net]( we are providing a crypto based proof of reserve (proof of liability + proof of assets), anyone can verify at any time the solvency of the exchange for all crypto and the repartition between hot and cold wallets, all this without waiting months for a new audit. 
Airbex.net implementation is based on the excellent work of Olivier Lalonde who has standardized the format of the [proof of reserve]( and [proof of liability]( Users can check by themselves the validity of the 
audit by using independent third party website like [syskall.com/proof-of-liabilities/]( and [syskall.com/proof-of-assets/](

Thanks, however, the message doesn't contain a blockhash to prove when the signatures was created. So the proof of assets could have been done month ago.
