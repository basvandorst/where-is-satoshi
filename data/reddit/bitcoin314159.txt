The comic makes it look like it was just one decision at one moment in time, when in reality it was a long and sometimes painful journey of microdecisions for both parties. 
Ann spent the last 6 years working and earning paychecks. She laughed off bitcoin as a ponzi scheme, a scam, a bubble, etc. She made fun of Bob and his 'fake internet money' any chance she could get. She never once considered researching the currency and the good it can have on the world. She decided it wasn't worth it to spend 30 minutes reading the 9-page whitepaper. She never put even a modest amount of money into it when it was worth pennies or dollars each, which would have net her the money Bob has. She also never put any money into it at $1500 (for example) which would have grown an order of magnitude by now. With each paycheck, she made the same decision to not buy bitcoin and instead buy pizzas or some shit with her disposable income. 
It goes the other way too. Bob mined in 2012. He rode it to dizzying highs multiplying his investment by 100 and yet decided not to sell. He decided not to sell at $10. He decided not to sell at $100 when he could buy a car with it. He decided not to sell at $1000 when he could buy a house with it. He decided not to sell during the long and seemingly endless down market. He decided not to sell at $10,000, etc. Remember that Ann could have bought in at any point. 
Yet LateStageCapitalism won't have any of it and instead prefers to ban anyone who says anything positive about bitcoin. As a far-leftist wacko I'm genuinely embarrassed right now.
