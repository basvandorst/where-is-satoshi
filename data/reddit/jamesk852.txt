Technically its just near the university not on the campus. Also the pricing is a good 10%, still looking for a reasonable place to exchange

I use to be with TPG which was on optus never had any problems in Melbourne except the Dandys. Brisbane is a different story though

This is a place were paying by cheque is normal and interbank transfers have fees. Plus there are not visa debits and paypass is only offered by like one or two banks....for some reason HK banks refuses to move foreward technology wise

Explanation: TPG is a mobile and internet service provider reseller, in Australia there are only two main telco providers Optus and Telstra, the rest are resellers. Generally Optus has pretty shit reputation. Dandy is short for Dandanong which is a mountainous area in the state of Victoria, Melbourne is a city Victoria and Brisbane is a city in the state of Queensland.

Ok this is seriously stupid. This happens in Australia too but seriously all you have to do is call the day before and arrange how ever much you would like to withdraw. Branches (which try not to hold a shit ton of money, for obvious reasons) limit what they can have in the tills, and obviously have to make rules so they have enough cash for everyone throughout the day and it's not unreasonable to expect someone to be organised enough to call ahead 24 hours to organise cash. Also if you really need it immediately this is only a branch restriction just go to another branch and withdraw more. Plus you still have atm withdraw, really this is looking for something to complain about and it's stupid

Your information isn't 100% accurate, a lot of verification for credit cards occur prior to the transaction. The part that takes awhile is the credit card merchants to process the transactions to your bank account. Depending on the merchent service you use sometimes it takes weeks, some process transactions at the end of every business day. Also if you use PayPal it's actually instant if your using direct debit or PayPal balance.

I hated Facebook due to privacy concerns.... I now have mixed emotions

This varies from bank to bank and only is worth it for large(ish) amounts as I think the fees are flat rate not based on how much. Hard to tell for sure, the only one you know of is the one charged by your bank but intermediary banks may charge their own fee.

Nice, I was thinking of getting mine without the logo....you know so people don't know what it's for lol.

I'm pretty sure no one invested in something they thought was a bubble. 
Nothing against BTC....just saying
@_date: 2013-08-25 10:59:55
With so many captive portals and existing payment methods already available for wrt devices wouldn't it be possible to modify one of these packages to accept bitcoin?

I was looking for a place to move my android wallet after my ASCII miner is starting to pay off. Looks like I'm giving this one a pass

I understand what you are saying but honestly I feel like bitcoin is coming out due to NEED not want which is why I'm tempted to think that this may not be a bubble. Full disclosure I currently have 3.4 bitcoins to my name I have literally NOTHING invested in this but as I've watched it develop from $20 &gt; 1 bitcoin (twice) I've learned that it might seem like fun and games for geeks at first but look what it can do:
1. It's universal
2. No centralized control (disregarding mining)
3. Your money is YOUR money the no one can take it from you (Government seizing/freezing your assets (Yes this is a grey area for illegal trades)
4. The Blockchain (nuff said)
Yes the obvious downside is the required internet connection but being completely honest if you're going to an area without a connection then obviously you will trade in other forms of currency.
I would also like to make one point very clear, in the original design of bitcoin was never planned to be 1 Bitcoin to $1 or even 1 to $100 type of deal. The maximum amount of bitcoins which can be mined is 21 million which in terms of currency is very small, but unlike currency which you and I have become accustomed to Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal points, Satoshi designed bitcoin to be of VERY high value and to be traded in very low denominations. 
I still think it will drop, something will happen to make it fall but eventually it will climb back up and be used as intended....and until then...I waits

Really? Because only a few weeks ago someone sold 2 million dollars worth of bitcoin the price was at $80 it dropped to $50 and recovered in a day

I like to think of them more as China's Yahoo if Google didn't exist....which is kinda misleading cause I know my grandmother and her friends use China Yahoo over Baidu  but anyway the point is they don't exist outside online services, where Google....we'll those guys are freaking everywhere

MTGox, trades in AUD but like others have said coinjar is probably your safest bet

FINALLY! Jeezus christ all this pushing for Bitcoin immediate global adoption, how many people here actually buy storage from dropbox to begin with? Do you really think the overhaul of a finance system and additional overhead associated the implementation of a crypto currency is on Dropbox's priority list at the moment? I like bitcoin I think it's a good idea but god damn some of these arrogant comments and this whole monthly push to get dropbox to implement bitcoin is getting rather embarrassing, just because it's big for us doesn't mean its big everywhere else. How about all the other features people want on a GLOBAL scale? Like client side encryption? Multi-folder sync support? Permissions? This thread every month is like a bunch of children that want the cereal from the supermarket just for the stupid toy. I really don't care if this gets downvoted to oblivion, the only reason I waited till now to post this is to set up bitcoin tip first cause I'm glad someone is able to see the bigger picture here instead of just bitching for a feature the majority here wouldn't even use.

I'm an international student studying in Australia....I am definitely paying my share
@_date: 2013-06-11 12:19:41
I don't understand generally the only way we (Australians) can transfer money to MtGox is through an international bank transfer. How much was the fee through dwolla? In the end it ended costing me 0.02% in bank fees

Neither do I my bitcoin friend....hold on

Care to elaborate? What do you mean gets "intercepted"? Are you using their ticketing system?
