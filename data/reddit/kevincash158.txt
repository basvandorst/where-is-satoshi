If you still see a ref. Link now then I've done something wrong. I removed it. 
And I do like being shamed by a username of "icumforyourbass."
Regardless, I agree with the sentiment on Davor. The referall link is removed.

So, not being a regulated market = who the hell knows.
All sorts of possibilities though.

I am a youtuber. Videos linking to youtube generally just piss people off.
But I'm also an academic-minded person so I like to sit down and write as well.
I really put effort into this and I would appreciate it greatly if you at least read the summary.
Otherwise I hope you enjoy the essay and please do give me feedback if you think I missed something, got something wrong or should include something in a future essay.
♠ I am going to make a podcast version later today for people who'd prefer to listen instead of reading.

I know this post has gotten hate. 
Look, I've never had something hold up this long before, and I get worried like anyone else would.
I know the unconfirmed transaction pool is massive right now, it just feels like "shit, my money is just gone"
I know many of you veterans are used to this. 
As of now, shit is still unconfirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:40:35
I guess that they resent it or something after 24 hours. I have no idea. It's a purse.io to bittrex transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:36:10
I am afraid to even transact any BTC right now. I am just going to transact in LTC until this shit clears up. I guess my 0.0133 BTC is just buried though. Sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:20:40
It goes down like 7% in a day and people are fucking losing their minds. 
If you bought bitcoin, just like I did, I got news for ya, it's called *speculation* for a reason.
I ain't sellin my 0.15 BTC I love my 0.15 BTC.

The culture of cryptocurrencies? I have no idea what you mean, I'm sorry.

I would tend to agree with you with the exception of the BTC futures. I interviewed a market maker on my youtube (go check it out). Trust me, they get it before you. 
With spot price the market being international and 24/7 means that Asia sees info before westerners

I cannot offer per-word because I don't know the word count.
Per hour $25-35 an hour with a $3 minimum IF you can accept litecoin or paypal.
I pay the best for Korean, Hindi and Ukrainian. 
So if you add captions in Ukrainian to 5 of my videos, totalling 1 hour of content, I will pay you $35 in Litecoin/Ethereum. 
BUT I will pay you another $10 if you tell me you will continue to work on translating my videos.
If you speak Hindi I will also offer the same offer as Ukrainian.
My e-mail is on the video description and you can get started whenever you want. Just comment or message me your desired currency address after you've finished your work, and I will pay you right away if I am at my computer

Did you watch the video and what I said? Please be honest with me. 
I also would like you to broaden your mind with what the word "investment" really means.
I know how you feel and I read every word of your comment.
But investment doesn't just mean "get rich quick." It also means adoption. That's because the broader the ownership base, the more merchants are likely to accept payment in Bitcoin, see what I mean?
I hear what you're saying and I hope that my comment eases your mind.
If there's anything else I can offer you, just ask.

Whatever man. You put more effort into typing than it would have taken to just listen to it. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:38:30
I agree with you 
I  just wish I could provide you something other than "a government regulator was bullish on crypto therefore MOON."
Because I want blockchain and distributed ledger to be more than that.
But my job as a freelance content creator isn't to dream but to reflect on how the world actually is.
And yes, we just moved up $100,000,000,000 in cryptocurrency on the sentiment of a regulator.
I only wish that statement were as disappointing to others as it is me.

This is a 1:20 summary of BTC's action in the past 24 hours.
I hope you enjoy! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:42:43
1. I am attracted to finances in general. I have been using crypto since I was 15 years old to make deposits and withdrawals from online poker (please don't rat me out!) I love the stock market, commodities, options and investment in general. I am also a bit of a compulsive gambler. So no one needed to get me excited about crypto, I loved the action from the start. 
2. The most exciting, per se? Adoption as the medium for the "internet-of-things." Autonomous machine-machine payments, private transactions that aren't under the prying eye of the government. 
The most realistic application that I can see? A method of trustless transaction validation for INTERNAL transfers. For example, a widely believed corrupt gov't official in Russia (or anywhere) would have a much harder time embezzling public funds if the government used a blockchain for its internal transactions. Basically, Department A could send Department B funds without those funds ever passing human hands, and those funds could be tracked on the public ledger. Blockchain could seriously reduce embezzlement issues by making internal transactions public and traceable. (Public meaning within the government). 
The same goes for large multinational companies. Some companies like Alphabet and Apple are so massive, that their different departments across the globe hardly communicate with one another. Embezzlement is a serious risk. A distributed ledger for internal transactions could make embezzlement from int'l companies much, much harder. Again, the same idea: a public ledger where addresses are tied to certain individuals/departments, and public transaction histories. You couldn't "sneak a few bucks out" here and there, every fraction of a penny could be tracked.
Plus blockchain tech will definitely be adopted for high-frequency trading algorithms on the futures/commodities markets. They could represent a whole new level in cheap and fast transactions for market makers looking for the fastest and most efficient tech around. 
Finally, I think East Asia, especially Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, are eager to adopt blockchain. The pace of life is very fast there, and transactions need to happen quickly for things to keep moving. Blockchain could provide the speed they need.

@_date: 2018-02-07 00:21:57
That's a good point. The only difference with today's movement is the massive volume. That's what sets this apart. 
But ultimately my ideas are just that, if you feel like it is going lower, don't invest yet. I think there's a good chance we touch $5,000; but, I also would take not if we close higher on the next 24 hour period, especially on yet again large volume.

I have no idea why patreon mobile app does that on a text post. 
I guess I won't be writing posts on Patreon mobile again... that seriously frustrates me.
I made my first ever video that didn't get downvoted to shit with hateful comments on top last night. 
So I make a post with a similar theme and... get fucked by Patreon.
