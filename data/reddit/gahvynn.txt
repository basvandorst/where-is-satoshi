At $800 I was waiting for a dip.
A buddy said he thought shorting at $1000 was a good idea.
I was sure it would fall at $2k so I could scoop some up.

Quite true, but he said this not long ago based on what happened in 2013.

Is that sub serious or is it just a place for people to shit post?  I don’t know anymore these days, I just assume a majority of Reddit is people messing around.

Quick question.  I won’t say I’m a crypto skeptic, but I am not quick a full convert either.
I see several opinions on what is going to happen with Bitcoin in the future.
It seems a contingent believe it is the future of the economy and that fiat currency will fail  and people will start demanding to be paid in bitcoin for their goods and services and that it will be a terrible transition but sometime down the road after the dust settles the world economy will be more stable, “fair”, and that people who had large amounts of bitcoin (today’s HODL crew) will be the new elite/rich class so they should avoid using bitcoin for transactions until the future happens.
Then there seems to be another group that also believes bitcoin will be the future of the world economy but the only way that it will happen is to use bitcoin for transactions.
Another subset seems to view it as *maybe* it’ll be the future, but it’s a good store of value and you should HODL until it hits a point where you can achieve your dreams.
Then another views it as a way to trade about and try to make quick fat money, not really overly concerned about future adoption.
I’m sure there are other people somewhere in between, but between the two “BTC is the future” crews, there seems to be a directly opposing agenda, that is one views the only way forward is to let the world economy collapse and the other is that actually using it as a medium of exchange to buy goods and services will spread adoption.  Am I missing something, I’m I not reading deeply enough into this?

Hyper inflation is a monster without doubt, and if/when that starts hitting the traditionally developed countries there will be chaos.  Typical inflation (2-4%) a year is just dealt with by companies doling out 1-3% raises per year.
Historically, before fiat money was a thing and gold (and silver) was king there were long periods of relative price stability, along with some inflation and deflationary time periods.  Either inflation or deflation can be very rough on a company/economy: if you agree to pay your workers a set wage annually and then the prices you can charge for a  good/service drops precipitously, it’s unlikely your worker will agree to a massive drop in pay to match.
Of course all of that is the past and I think it’s a bit dangerous to look to the past for guidance on the future beyond learning lessons, but I just think unless the value of BTC can stabilize it’ll be a tough road to adoption.

Isn’t the whole point of bitcoin is for it to be a viable currrency?  Holding it like actual gold until some near apocalypse just seems like it’s the opposite of the point.

As someone who has sipped the kool aide but not downed a whole jug, this is very important.  What is the point of having currency that is valued in the millions of dollars when the entire global economy has collapsed?  At that point wouldn't it be more valuable to have things like medicine, enough land to farm, and animals?

The believers of BTC aren't concerned with manipulation or short term price fluctuations.  For them BTC is the future and the system is set up in a way that over time it won't matter.
Or as said

Once the major depression caused by the rush to replace national currency ends and people are paid in bitcoin instead of dollars/pounds/YN, bitcoin will become as boring as any other currency.  Sure *maybe* whoever has tens or hundreds of bitcoins might be the new Bill Gates or whatever, but in order for a currency to become *the* world currency, governments and more importantly companies and especially consumers/end users are going to want *value stability*.
*All speculative, of course.*

Unless the amount each bitcoin (or decimal of a bitcoin) can buy  stays the same, then it will be inflation of some sort.  I guess what I'm getting at is I don't see how in the scenario you provide (massive market cap growth fueled by a decrease in world currency buying power) that the buying power per bitcoin will remain unchanged (worth more $$$ per coin but what the coin can buy stays the same).  If you have any sources that can shed some light on what you're saying it could be helpful.

Not sure many police would wait to find out if you had another weapon ready after you shot them once.
Can we not admit you can royally fuck up around the police and get killed and it doesn't have to be "fuck the police"?

What you are saying is that we are headed for a period of hyperinflation and that bitcoin is a way to weather that?  It's not too exciting when the $16 mil you point out would be more or less the same value in terms of what it can buy as (maybe, I'm not doing the math) as an ounce of gold today?
Can you point to any sources to show where you derived your numbers?
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:30:12
I'm not disagreeing with you.  The believers think the future isn't that bitcoin will be a way to store wealth while your national economy has problems but rather *the single world currency* as all others fall into waste.  "Hodl at all costs" is repeated often as early adopters profit off of the speculation and excitement.  And maybe it'll happen, but ask for proof or a credible source and you get none.

I can see this being a very unpopular opinion around here.

I made over 12% on my low purchases the other day (if I were to cash out which I’m not going to).  I laugh when my bank offers me a 0.5% APY savings account.

Don’t try to use logic.  These kinds of posts are for people to try and feel good about buying bitcoin near the all time high.  Nobody knows if it’ll ever recover, but the more you say it, and other people say it, the better some people feel.
