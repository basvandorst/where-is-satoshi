Not sure why you got downvoted there. I tell my friends the same that are interested. Hell it dipped below 10,000 two days ago. We all could be wrong but I believe it will dip below again before continuing up.

Not sure if this is a serious question. The earth is round and to portray it as flat you must “stretch” the top and bottom somewhat.

It appears to be a BCash car from the looks of it

$124,000 Dec 2020/Jan 2021.  End of 2021 I believe we will be moving out of this cycle/beginning a new one. $35000 I believe will be the base of that bear market. And then off to the next cycle. 
Of course we are all throwing darts here (and I’m not good at that either). I’m just paying attention to historical data.

And everyone knows the left nut holds the most value.  Only get like half for the right nut

Of course we will, the swings will just be much smaller. Unless a group of governments comes together fairly soon though (that won’t happen) expect at least another decade of volatility. 
Without any regulation we have achieved today. And we will continue to achieve tomorrow regardless of regulation.  In saying that, regulation will bring the masses for good or bad. And then we will have what crypto will be.  I still believe it will be glorious.

The company probably got sued by an idiot for Negligent and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. So they had to change the wording to be more ambiguous.

First I mistyped dates at the top. You are correct in thinking EOY 2021 as the APEX of this cycle. And $124,000 is still what I believe, based on historical data, will be the top (fairly large margin error here) but I believe it anyway. 
The following isn’t mine, just a good representation of what I believe to be true [BTC Halvening Chart](
Edit:  While I think the article is a good read, it’s the chart in the article that makes sense to me. The margin of error would be $80,000 up to $140,000. I believe we will see the high side

At what age range are we considered geezers? I’m probably on the edge of that now.  None of my kids are into crypto, but I love it

If you can use Coinbase they are separating them for you. Just transfer everything there 2 days before and back out afterwards

Fun story, I was all set to loose my virginity finally.  My girlfriend and I were all good, mood was set, it was going to be beautiful. I climbed on top of her and happened to touch her in a ticklish spot. She jerked her knee which caught me Square in the nuts. I didn’t lose my virginity that day. So I can confirm, knee-jerk reactions are seldom good.

Everyone that had a buy order placed around that price before it crashed. Just a guess, but I’m sticking with it :)
