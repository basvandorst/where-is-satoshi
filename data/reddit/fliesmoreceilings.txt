If you want to be safe, don't wait for that. In previous crashes there were a lot of people who played it that way and then found themselves unable to respond in time when it did crash. You may be asleep, or your exchange may be down or your transactions may not be confirmed in time.

There's a lot of passphrases that lead to new, valid wallets. Like I've done a bit of bruteforcing on this, and it pops out several of them per second

There's a lot more than that. I've been bruteforcing some combinations, and am coming across thousands of valid mnemonic sentences. Honestly, if the correct answer isn't in one of the first few keys, using one of the obvious paths, then it's just completely uncrackable. There's probably no way right now to confirm you actually have the right sentence if you can't find the answer

Yeah I've found a bunch of mnemonics based on clues, positions, etc. too. There's thousands if not millions  or billions in there that vaguely fit some of the hints. Unless it's an extremely obvious pattern, with no room for say misordered words, it's unlikely to lead to anything.

Could it be used to communicate reliably with people you only know through bitcoin/LN transactions? That'd be some advantage over other forms of communication.  Let's say someone donates anonymously to you, and you want to thank them for it

The rollercoaster effect is almost certainly amplified because there isn't enough time after a decent raise to build up a healthy buffer of new orders in the price range now passed. Making it require significantly less sales for the price to plummet as it would in ordinary situations. 
Normally you might need 5000 BTC (example figure) just to see the price move 1 dollar, but after a quick raise, suddenly every 50 BTC sold changes the price by 1 dollar. The same can happen if it breaches through a wall and there's suddenly barely any sell/buy orders remaining.
If you look at bitfinex on bitcoinity for example, you'll see that it takes (right now) 8388 BTC bought to hit $1300, but only 9827 BTC to hit $2720. If people don't adjust fast enough when it breaches such a wall, the price, which was already going nuts, will go insane when it hits such an area. Probably in both directions.

It's probably never going to have its scaling issues fully resolved. Requiring every transaction to be part of a global ledger reflected in all of the machines that contribute does that. There's always going to be a limit. Bitcoin simply won't be your day to day currency, you'd need a fundamentally different design. 
Perhaps some off-chain settling systems and lightning network esque systems will allow day to day purchase using a bitcoin-esque system, but that may end up just as disconnected from bitcoin as fiat is from gold and digital fiat is from fiat. 
That doesn't mean it won't be useful. But it's much more likely it ends up mostly as a way of settling huge amounts between banks and other off-chain transaction providers than as the thing you'll be purchasing coffee with.

As in a blockchain where the proof of work for a block is killing 1000 mobs?

Aspie here: a byte is 8 bits, it's not the other way around!
