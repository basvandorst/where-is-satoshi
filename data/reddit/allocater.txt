You at least have to trust the exchanges for the 2 weeks it takes to make the transaction, also for the government-photo-ID-passport you have to scan and send over the internet to them, and the utility-bills with your address on it and whatever else MtGox wanted to verify an account.

True that. 
They say bitcoin is instant and has low fees. The conventional banking system already is instant and has no fees (I buy shit on amazon and steam instant all the time without fees).

If they only buy bitcoins on exchanges and keep them there, they won't need the network. 
Then we could allow exchanges to display more bitcoin to their customers then they actually hold. Those freed up bitcoins could then be re-invested into the bitcoin economy. 
We just need to create laws that prevents everybody from withdrawing all their exchange-bitcoins at once, since they are not there and this would create an exchange-run.

But if the new bit coin system has the backing of something with real-world authority, like paypal, or a bank or a government, it could get people behind it, or even surpass bitcoins, because bitcoins lacks that.
Or instead of fighting the supremacy of *the* bitcoins. every little website, city, or browser game, could make their own little bitcoin-system. Sure it will not be bigger or more valuable than bitcoins, but would have it's own niche application. Maybe even the reddit community could start their own bitcoin system right now.

Nope, I can create as many orders for as many millions or billions as I want. The mtgox website does not prevent it, even if I have only $1 in the account. The account balance is not affected by the orders.

No, the business has no bitcoins at that point. It gave all 1k away to the builder to build the office, the employees to work for the business, the factory to produce stuff.
Then when the moment comes to pay back the loan, the business has to get 1k btc somehow somewhere and it will be much harder to get 1k btc when they are $145.
In summary, yes:

I.e: the company holds dollar, the consumer holds dollar and only for a small amount of time, it is converted to bitcoin, send, and converted back.

It's a matter of interpretation. Within the bitcoin system, yes, using computer power to find a certain hash is useful. But looking from the outside one can wonder, if this is really the best use for computer power. Finding a hash has no value in and of it self except being hard, and that is why Satoshi chose it, because something hard was needed. If you want to punish a prisoner, you also need something hard, like carrying stones in a circle, does not mean it is in and of itself meaningful. Now if in bitcoin 2.0 the computer power is used to do something hard AND meaningful. Now that would be even more awesome.

What if the time between blocks was so short that the second guy didn't know about the first block and included copies of transactions. The block is invalid even if he found a correct hash, tough luck I guess. 
How often are correct hashes found, but are invalid because the transactions in the block are wrong?

There is currently no easy way to get into bitcoin. I bet if there were the price would go up even higher!

For a cyber currency to have 2 options to buy them (meet real humans in the real world) or hand over all your private information to a website, is really bad. 
So the only good way to get into bitcoins is mining, I guess that is how it was intended by Satoshi. But now the mining power is so asic concentrated that the average CPU/GPU can't to that either.

The internet does not accept copyright laws from the real world, so it probably won't accept money laws from the real world.

Multibit seems faster and entry-friendlier. It's even second on the official site: 
Now for actually getting bitcoins, that is another question. Depends on where in the world he is (sad but true). Europeans have to send Passport-ID and mortgage papers to mtgox, which is a no-go fail. Americans can't use the European SEPA thingies. etc

The only question is in what order should the money be taken if a bank fails. My preferred order is:
* bond holder, shareholder
* golden parachutes, salaries, boni, claw backs
* debt holders (including derivative counter parties and all other financial bullshit)
* depositors
* tax-payers
I guess in this model it can never happen that tax-payers have to pay. Because there is no one tax-payers have to pay TO. Everybody was already wiped out before them. Which is good.
In the case of Cyprus, who did the depositors pay TO? Who was above them in the priority order? Or was the money already gone and they payed TO people in the past, who got money in the past?

You don't have to identify on bitstamp to cash out. So you send 1 btc from mtgox to bitstamp and cash out anonymously for $62 or identify at mtgox and get $75. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:23:46
The other address is the change-return-address, where all the change of the transaction is sent to. It's one of the more confusing 'features' of bitcoin, if you send 10 transactions, you eventually have 10 change-return-addresses, where different amounts of change accumulate. You can deactivate it, so that the change is sent to the original address, ...in some clients, ...somehow.

* What if a block needs to be supported by fees only? =&gt; Currently the fee would have to be $1 per transaction. But in the future when there will be 100 times the transactions, it will be 1cent =&gt; so ok.
* How does the costs develop in the future? =&gt; On one hand, technology gets better and cheaper and more efficient, so it will be cheaper. But the difficulty will increase, so it gets more expensive. =&gt; no idea

mtgox is an exclusive club, it is hard to get into. So you can't easily get bitcoins from there and sell them in the UK for a profit. Also it may be risky to stand somewhere and sell bitcoin to strangers, so the localbitcoin-sellers make the price higher to compensate for this.

@_date: 2013-06-02 10:15:56
Yes, but you can look at it as 2 components.
 
* The work
* The result
For bitcoin only the work is useful, the result is not useful for mankind or whatever. What OP is looking for is a bitcoin 2.0 were the work is still useful for bitcoin and the result is useful for mankind in another way. So in a sense bitcoin 1.0 right now is using the power to create useful work but useless results. Now a better way might not be possible but one can dream.

@_date: 2013-04-02 15:52:49
But if you cash out 1 million and mtgox withdrawal limit is $300 per day, you need to cash out over the next 3333 days, which is 9 years.
@_date: 2013-03-26 11:20:02
It's the whole point of bitcoin, to replace the old bullshit banking system and bring into easy internet instant user age. But right no mtgox is more government and pain than paypal or any bank.
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:39:23
Also why was I never required to do this at paypal?
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:46:18
So um, you put like $30,000 into bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:04:47
But actually it is 'crashing' -10% almost every day, that's the point to buy in. It will be at 0% shortly after and the +0% from that point on.
@_date: 2013-02-11 13:47:20
That's what I was thinking. The 51% can do in their corrupted blockchain what they want. Every individual user can just ignore it and continue and follow the uncorrupted blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:05:10
You think retailers made 30 million that day? Because that is the amount that is being cashed in.
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:14:20
Yes, even the (in)famous 51% attack does not work, because the honest 49% will just continue their marry way and ignore the 51% idiot who sends illegal transactions :-)

Damn and I thought Walter White claiming he paid 200k for a double-hit was unrealistically low.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:11:07
Nice! So:
55,665.88 GH/s * 650 Watt/GH = 36,182,882 Watt/s
(but what is Watt/s, electricity is confusing)
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:07:09
Everybody thinks the media hype peak has been reached, all thresholds have been reached, black friday is over etc, and since the value of bitcoin is tied to media hype it's sell time!

Yesterday there was a 'mob' in the chat of 20 people with missing SEPAs (5-15days)
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:35:57
Then why is it still showing trades there  ?
never mind now it stopped
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:32:40




@_date: 2013-04-12 18:39:34
I know one SEPA is missing since 27th
@_date: 2013-02-13 12:31:28
That's not much of a progress report. Did you invest your retirement and savings, or only the $30,000 loan? What are those numbers? At what prices did you buy how much? How many bitcoins do you have now? What is your investment worth now? etc pp.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:50:05
My wallets have 1KB to 26KB, so copy 50KB should be enough.
@_date: 2013-05-30 14:53:26
Do I need to send passport and mortgage papers to paypal? Somehow they can operate without this, strange.
@_date: 2013-09-07 16:55:22
Don't use mtgox, the price is higher there and you can not get your money out. (Also hard to get money in because of verification BS) 
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:49:19
The bank is bankrupt. Yes then the money disappears. Shocking in the age of bailout, I know.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:46:25
The entire bitcoin network: 1 transaction per second
Mtgox website: 35 transactions per second.
=&gt; one website right now handles 35 times more transactions than the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:12:47
title = wtf
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:25:15
Yeah, so why can't mtgox do it that way?
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:07:23


And in an oligarchy 1% of the rich get to rule 99% of the poor
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:50:27
bit is already taken.
@_date: 2013-06-02 09:03:46
Only thing I can think of is, they want to trick the market, so that they can buy cheap bitcoins now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:22:04
I cash out, if I can get a million dollars. That requires a price of 100k/coin ...
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:47:56
Since it can not be used as a fee-free (micro)-transaction system, I guess it will mainly be used as a storage of wealth for rich people.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:49:16


Technical concerns or government concerns?
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:19:33
2.5 TH gives you 2 btc per day. The thing costs 7 btc. Too good to be true.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:16:01
I was wondering who are the people who have sold bitcoins all the way from 30$ to 180$
@_date: 2013-02-19 14:06:07
So there are 2385 million Facebook stocks, but only 21 million bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:06:49
Sounds good to me, unless there are some hidden "derivative counter-parties" that get 100 cents on the dollar like Goldman Sachs in the AIG bankruptcy.
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:11:47
You sent a copy of your passport to mtgox? Talk about anonymous currency...
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:14:49
The communist regime of China is not allowing dollars-Yuan to be exchanged freely. You can not get dollars in there or Yuan out. That lock-down of the country is the reason Chinese buy bitcoin in the first place (to circumvent the controls)
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:22:44
You can not get your money out of mtgox, there are some guys waiting 6 months and more. So I guess it would work only once or twice per year.
For China, you can sell there, but you only get Yuan. Would will you do with that? You are also not allowed to move Yuan out of the country (the communist regime regulates money transfers (Thats why Chinese buy bitcoin in the first place, to get it out of the country))

At first I thought for $30,000 you can get an entire mini flash game / pay a programmer for 1 year, who would do that for a plugin, then I realized, at the time, it was $3000.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:43:32
I am just amazed that the software had all of this already programmed in. Or did they patch it in 2 weeks? Equally amazing me thinks.
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:54:07
I'd say before the first $30 spike.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:18:16
I am doing a pity upvote for the neglected currency/merchant part of bitcoin. It's all about investment/trade now.
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:37:24
Nothing works perfectly because you still need the bullshit authentication theater for mtgox (passport &amp; utility bills)
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:12:19
I want to know what is the market debt "down there"? I.E. how many money is lying around from $1 to $200? I can only see from $230 to $250 on this site: 
If we know that there is only 1 million dollar, it's bad, and it only takes little to crash, but if there are 100 million dollars, there is a giant buffer that will prevent a crash.
