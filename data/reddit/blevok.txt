That's a myth. Change addresses don't obfuscate you in any way. Your primary address can still be located with a few clicks. Change addresses also cause higher transaction fees for people who use them but don't understand them.

Actually, i think i had fees on my mind from another post, but in this case i meant to say higher confusion for noobs, not higher fees. And what i mean by confusion, is bitcoin getting spread out to multiple addresses due to sending, while also continuing to receive at the original address. The fees are the same since everything is transaction based, but i've seen many noobs in a panic because their address doesn't show their full balance, which in most cases turns out to be a result of change addresses, and people not knowing how they work.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:04:14
You can't really estimate sending bitcoins that you don't have, because it depends on how big the transaction is (in data size). If you receive 25 bitcoins, and then send 25 bitcoins, it will be cheap. But if you receive 1 bitcoin 25 times, and then send 25 bitcoins, there are more inputs, therefore more bytes of data, therefore more fees.

If you do a chargeback, you're taking the money from coinbase, and there's no effect on the person that stole the money. I would expect that their standard procedure for that situation would be to close the account and ban you. So you can either have the money back, or keep your coinbase account, but probably not both.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:04:34
Gdax is owned by coinbase. Same login info. After you deposit USD on coinbase, go to gdax. Go to the btc-usd market, click deposit, select the option to deposit from your coinbase account. The transfer is instant. Then buy btc with a post-only limit order. Then withdraw btc from gdax to your wallet. If you follow these steps, there are no fees. Do it any other way and there will be fees, which could be a not insignificant portion of a small purchase.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:10:11

Yeah there's other exchanges that you can use to withdraw to your bank. But i have no experience with cashing out.  
  
As for explaining to coinbase that a chargeback is necessary... Why would they be okay with you taking your money back if they can't get the coins back and it wasn't their fault? Just because someone stole from you, doesn't mean that you can steal from coinbase and everything will be okay. They're either going to make you pay, or stop doing business with you, or maybe both. I'd bet that if the chargeback goes through, the account will be closed regardless of whether or not coinbase tries to make you pay.

@_date: 2018-01-05 00:52:57
Well i don't think coinbase can reject the chargeback, that's probably up to your credit card company to determine if your fraud claim is legit. So if the chargeback happens, and coinbase does make you pay, then at least you'd have the 3k back to pay it, but of course you're still out 3k then. But who knows, maybe coinbase would just close the account and write off the loss.  
  
I think what you need to figure out is this, what's more important, the 3k or the coinbase account?  
If you cancel the chargeback before coinbase hears of it, then you have the account and are out 3k.  
If you do the charge back, then you probably lose the account, and may or may not be out 3k, depending on what coinbase does.  
If you just accept that the account is gone and care about the 3k, then doing the chargeback seems like the best option, since that at least has a chance of getting the money back. The only thing i would worry about is if the big exchanges have a shared blacklist, but i've never hear anything that would indicate that.

I'm not sure about the details, and there are probably facets that i'm not aware of, but i know one thing is that small blocks are fast to upload, so there's less risk for the miner that spent time on it.

Encryption  
  


  
As history progresses, thing change, and we must adapt  
  


  
Coins never leave the blockchain. Your wallet holds the encryption keys.  
  


  
It's not.  
  


  
They're only as secure as you make them. It all depends on how you maintain your computer, manage funds, and store keys.  
  


  
Thousands of people have secured their future thanks to crypto. Lambo sales are probably at an all time high.    
  


  
No, it's not a scam or a scheme, unless you think the stock markets are a pyramid scheme too. A simple understanding of how crypto works will prove exactly what it is and isn't.  
  


  
It's backed by math with provably fair procedures, which makes it more valuable than most other assets.  
  


  
See above  
  


  
It could be someday, but we're nowhere near that level of hype yet.  
  


  
Yes, that would only change it's price, not it's usefulness.  
  


  
Wasteful "features" like change addresses.  
  


  
Because of the global financial situation, decentralized and tamper-proof currency was desperately needed. If it's not this, it will be something else, but the status quo won't work much longer.

To put the keys into an encrypted file, you have to type or copy them in, so they're exposed to being stolen. Plus that file may not be as secure as you think.  
  
With a hardware wallet, the key is never exposed to your computer, it's viruses, the internet, etc. The wallet has circuitry that perform the signing right on the device.

You need to do some learning about wallets, private keys, security, and how bitcoin works.  
Basically, the coins are not really yours until you have them in a wallet where you control the private key. Otherwise they could be lost if those companies get hacked or go out of business, or just decide to take the money and run. All you have now is basically an I.O.U. from them, but that's no guarantee at all.  
But you do need to learn and understand what you're doing, and how to do it safely, or else you could end up losing them anyway by making a simple mistake.

Sorry to say it, but this really has nothing to do with coinbase. If you do get through to someone and explain the situation, they'll most likely say they have no responsibility, because your account was accessed and funds were transferred by legitimate means.  
You could maybe track down who has your phone if you had the necessary features setup, but even if they are caught and prosecuted, there's probably a 99.999% chance you'll never see those funds again.

Anything on the other side of the tunnel is accessible via localhost, so it would basically think it's running on the same machine.  
  
You'd be adding another point of failure though, since it would now be affected by a network disruption on either side, so you may need to add some additional error handling to your code to prevent unhandled exceptions, and restrict transactions during outages. Also you would need to use autossh so that it would re-connect after a disruption.  
  
But if the connection on both ends is very reliable, then it should work fine almost all the time.  
This is a pretty common way to use a dirt cheap low storage vps with a large set of data, or to "hide" the true location of the data.

SSH doesn't cause anything to happen, it's just a connection.  
You said walletnotify is triggered by bitcoind. So how does that happen? There must be a config file or something where you specify the path to your script. So you would tell it to use the path to the tunnel.  
The port that you are forwarding through the tunnel is just for the tunnel, it's not whatever bitcoind uses to sync, unless you want to proxy the sync through the vps.  
So if you setup the tunnel to forward port 7777, then you need to tell bitcoind that the path to your script is something like 
@_date: 2019-10-12 06:01:22
It has nothing to do with what apps you're running. The apps won't even be aware of the tunnel, and don't need to interact with the ssh process. It's just a matter of configuring ssh to route the correct port through the tunnel.  
  
I don't have experience with the specific thing you're trying to do or the software you're using, so i can't say exactly how to set it up for your use. I'm just saying that however the two apps are talking to each other in the test environment should still work the same because they will still think they are both running on the same machine.

Yes, paying with your main address will expose what you have. And i'm sure there are people that would stab you for it. Most crypto currency including bitcoin is not really anonymous, but there are ways to be anonymous if you want to. The blockchain is a big list of transactions, so you have to break the path back to your address somehow.  
You could use a tumbler to basically get new bitcoins at a new address, or you could buy some privacy based coins like monero and use a service like xmr.to to make bitcoin payments. And you can use shapeshift of something similar instead of an exchange. There's probably other ways too, but i haven't put too much thought into it since i haven't bought anything with bitcoin yet.

If you buy btc on coinbase with a bank account, you lock in the price you bought at, even though it takes days to show up in your account.  
However if you transfer usd to coinbase, then after it shows up in your account, you pay the btc price at the time that you buy the btc from your usd wallet.  
For question 2, transfers get submitted immediately, so it's basically just the time it takes for the transaction to get mined.

The last couple fake mining hyips stopped paying a few days after the first cycle. So you can possibly make a little money if you start in the first couple days. But some of them never pay out at all, so never risk too much. These sites need to have exponential growth of the user base to keep paying, so if they don't see that happening, they immediately stop paying. Anyone using these sites should be aware that most people that use them know the eventual outcome and choose to take the risk for a decent payout, so that means they are depositing very little actual money and compounding with new investors money. The more people that start taking profits instead of reinvesting, the quicker it will stop paying. And that starts to happen right after the first cycle completes. Not worth the risk in my opinion, but it's fun to watch it all unfold.

Trading is luck-based. You're just as likely to lose money as you are to make money. However, if you simply buy and hold, you're guaranteed to make money as long as bitcoin increases in value.

Bitconnect is the oddity, really the only one that almost seems sustainable if you really think about it. But even if it is sustainable, that doesn't mean the owner isn't a scammer that will eventually run.

The buy price on coinbase is always higher than the actual rate, and the sell price will always be lower. You can see the difference by switching between the buy/sell and dashboard tabs.

That depends on where you're trying to collect it from.  
  
If it's an exchange wallet, or any wallet that you don't own, then you either have to transfer enough in to meet the minimum withdrawal, and then transfer it all out, thus grabbing the dust too, or wait until the value goes up or the minimum withdrawal goes down (or some combination of both).  
  
If you have the private key, then you can sweep the wallet when fees are low. But even when fees are high, you can send a transaction for a very low fee and just wait for it to complete when conditions are better.  
  
So basically, if you don't care how long it will take, then just send the transaction with whatever fee is worth it to you, and then just wait.

What's the benefit of using Bitcoin through tails? If the Bitcoin that you send or receive through tails ends up touching your real identity, location, accounts, etc in any way, then you can easily be associated with all the transactions related to those addresses.

You can disable change addresses in electrum. The remainder of the spent transactions would go back to the address it was sent from. This would prevent your coins from getting spread out to multiple addresses.  
But you should understand what you're doing, and know when to sweep it, to prevent unspendable transaction outputs.

I'm not aware of any added security related to persistent storage in tails. It's just a time saver if you often use tails for the same purposes.  
  
As for protecting your ip address (presumably to hide your identity), that's going to be very difficult or even impossible if your dealing with any sort of currency/value. If you're just looking up "dangerous information" then maybe you can keep it private if you do it right (most people can't, even in tails), but transferring value to/from wallets in tails will expose your identity 99% of the time, and so will having goods delivered to you.  
  
I mean, if you're buying small amounts of drugs, probably nobody cares. But if you're buying AK's, the government's going to find out who you are through activity or value correlation, regardless of what coin you're using, how many times you tumble it, how many wallets it goes through, what your ip address is, what os you use, etc.  
  
But this is all kinda off-topic from your original point, which is to accelerate adoption. The thing is, no amount of education or usefulness is going to help with adoption. The only thing that matters is ease of use. And all the knowledge and security precautions that are currently necessary to safely use cryptocurrency are the opposite of that.  
  
We can look to the adoption of technology to get an idea of the requirements. For example, Microsoft had been pushing smartphones since the turn of the century, but they didn't catch on for nearly a decade because the average person just wasn't interested in learning anything new, no matter how useful it was. It took Apple dumbing it down to the lowest common denominator for the masses to get interested. They had to make it so that the only requirement is having hands, and the ability to read. And even then, they had to make deals with carriers to literally force the phones into people hands in order to finally get the masses on board.  
  
It's probably going to be exactly the same with crypto. If a virus or a typo can cause a permanent loss, then it's not ready. If you can't store it at the corner bank, then it's not ready. And if the average person can't learn to use it reliably in 10 seconds, it's too complicated.  
  
To put it in audio terms, crypto is currently akin to reel-to-reel. It works well, but it takes some learning and practice to ensure successful use, and even then, you can easily fail. It will likely permeate the world eventually, but we still have to get through 8 tracks, cassette tapes, and CD's before we get to the stage of just pressing a button and hearing music.

Private keys are private, they are not meant to ever be sold or transferred to another party. Doing so would defeat the whole purpose of the using a private key. If you sell coins to someone, you send them from your wallet to theirs. You can never get it back because you don't have their private key. Keeping the private key safe keeps the coins safe.  
There are people selling loaded wallets on ebay. They are all 100% a scam. The only reason to do it like that is to wait until people put more coins in the wallet, and then steal it all.

Pick a project you want to do, and learn what you need to accomplish it along the way. That way you can't just give up if something proves difficult, and you won't be struggling to remember something you read weeks ago but had no use for at the time. Instead you'll have motivation to figure out the issues and get back to making progress. After a few projects, you'll have experience with several languages, and enough experience troubleshooting to figure out any problem. A few months from now, you could be releasing a useful software suite, or applying for a position at a major development house.

That's the thing about banks and fiat, there's ways for those in control to control the money at any time without issue if the stakes are high enough to be worth it. He could have been using a stolen bank account, or the money could be involved in crime. Or who knows what else...  
  
Maybe i'm being paranoid, but i think once you participate in the movement of money through official channels, you can never totally escape the risks involved. So it's best to always be sure about the legitimacy of the people you transact with.

Bitcoins overall growth in market cap is not linear unless you only plot two points. It may go to 124k and higher eventually, or it may not, but no one knows for sure or when, and if someone happens to guess correctly, be it with TA or not, it will still have only been a crapshoot.

Bitcoin requires that inputs are spent entirely, so the remainder that you're not sending, also gets sent, but to the change address. If you disable change addresses, you can end up with many tiny amounts of BTC.  
So lets say you have a total of 0.001 BTC, but it's split up into 10 inputs that are each 0.0001 BTC, and the current fee is 0.00011, then you wouldn't be able to spend any of your BTC. The fee to send each input is more than the input contains.  
You can prevent this by sweeping the address, which is sending all unspent inputs to an address, which will arrive as a single input, thus combining all the small amounts into one larger input. So that prevents unspendable amounts, and reduces fees.  
Using change addresses prevents the problem, as it happens automatically every time.

I assume you're asking about the investment side of it. A lot of people that take a look at it instantly come back and say that it's a possible ponzi scheme. I was curious and looked into it, and i do see how it could work and be very profitable for the owner, enough to legitimately pay what they claim, as long as it's actually being used by enough people as a tumbler. But i do see the ponzi scheme possibility as well.  
They basically have to swap your coins about 318 times in the 6 week term to break even. Given that i've seen no advertising, and have literally only heard of it by people asking on reddit if it's a scam, i have to wonder if they currently have the volume to sustain the dividends.  
If people were to suddenly stop using it as a tumbler, they would have to stop paying dividends. But they could potentially use profits to continue current investments to term. OR, they could keep it going with new investments, making it a ponzi scheme.  
It's impossible to know what they'll do when/if they face that dilemma, but i would consider it a very high risk / fixed reward investment, with the potential to lose your entire investment if you're in at the wrong time. That doesn't really seem worth it considering a little research and intuition can yield at least the same results via conventional trading. And when you fail at trading, you generally aren't losing everything.

Are you sure it's asking for your login info and it's not a security feature you setup for your bank account? Or maybe it's actually prompting you to setup the security feature that you haven't setup yet?  
  
I do have a bank account on coinbase, and i have a security thing that my bank uses called "verified by visa". When i make a purchase on a site that uses it, i get asked for the password to confirm the transaction. It's definitely not my bank login info though, it's the password i chose to use to verify transactions.  
  
I don't really know what plaid is, but i'm guessing it's the same kind of security thing, and the only reason i can think of for it asking your bank login info, is if you mistakenly set the info to the same as your login info, which is a critical error that you should correct immediately. It's the same thing as using one password on more than one site, and almost as self destructive.  
  
Maybe i'm misunderstanding something here, but i stand by my original statement that they have no reason to ask for your actual bank login credentials.

Coinbase is like a safe deposit box at a bank. You can keep stuff there, but if the bank gets robbed, your stuff could be gone. If you want to insure that you are the only one that could move/spend/lose your stuff, you be your own bank, and keep it in your house.  
  
About your second topic, you can give people your public address to send you coins, but they cannot use that to rob you. Your private key allows you to send coins, so if someone gets their hands on it, they can rob you. And be aware that there are many ways that someone (mostly hackers) can get your private key without you even knowing. Viruses, browser extensions, fake websites, nigerian princes, etc.  
  
If you want to be the safest you can possibly be, get a hardware wallet, use it, and learn as much about crypto and personal computer security as you can.

Chew on this analogy, which i think is extremely apt in this situation.  
  
Back in the late 80's/early 90's, i loved computers and technology in general. I was certain it would quickly catch on and go mainstream, which i believed would make the mainstream population collectively smarter and more technically capable.  
  
But that didn't happen. It turned out the only way to take technology mainstream was to severely dumb it down. So that's what apple did. They made tech so user friendly that anyone could use it. Other companies followed suit, and the internet connected age was born.  
  
That's what crypto needs in order to go fully mainstream. It needs to be dumbed down so that anyone can use it without having to learn anything new. And it needs to be safe for them to use it like that. People like us will always be able to use it in a more advanced way, but if the normals are going to get on the train, then the train needs to stop at the station and have a welcoming entrance. Regular people aren't going to be jumping from a horse onto a moving train like us cowboys.

The easiest way to get your money back is to HODL. It's a risk of course, but a lot safer of a plan that to try and trade it back up. Plus you might win in the end. Just depends on how much 2500 is worth to you.

Nah they just want moon and lambo like the rest of us. The difference is just that their moon is a special one that we can't even see or comprehend. And their lambo is actually a truck full of lambos.
