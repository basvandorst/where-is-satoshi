With talks of potentially having banking customers interested in bitcoin mining and utilization of hardware components they already own, what would the implications of a large mainframe be on mining? I spoke with a few IBM'ers about how so many large customers have these mainframes from IBM and could potentially mine with them as testing. He didn't think a single mainframe could dominate the network, but that one single mainframe could mine a block every 2 hours or so, maybe be as powerful as a small pool. Multiple mainframes combined, which many companies own called an ensemble, could be very powerful however. 
Someone from our crypto currency consulting firm Coin NYC is speaking with a few IBMers about implementing mining and testing.
There's also an IBM whitepaper mentioning bitcoin: 
An IBM Patent on 'e-currency' methods to prevent double spending and track addresses:
And an IBM executive who has his own bitcoin blog:
It would be super cool to see if anything comes of this and if an innovating company like IBM who is concentrating more on high end servers with the sale of system x business to Lenovo today could positively impact the world of bitcoin!
