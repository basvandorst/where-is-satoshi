Antpool has been caught several times when they were not following profit, but using their power to sway the market. This might be similar. Transactions with less than 5sat/b fee just became less useful, because 28% of miners are not touching them..

avoiding mining will only make Bitmains profit larger, because there will be less competition. Do mine, but avoid Bitmain, that is the solution. And of course their Antpool and BCash, those all have one source and one purpose - manipulate the market.

@_date: 2018-01-16 10:36:18
there are about a billion threads about this, you should read at least one or two of them..
the fee has no relation to the amount of BTC you are sending. It is only based on the number of "inputs", which directly correlates to the "size" of the transaction as in data - bits, bytes, kilobytes.. so if you got your BTC piece by piece from 1000 tiny transactions and then you want to send the bulk somewhere, that fee will be pretty high. Also the fee depends on how many other people are just sending transactions - you are competing with them for a limited resource - the place in a block. See the current amount of transactions waiting in the "mempool" here:  - it goes up and down over time 
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:29:11

Oh oh, you really shouldn't be trading with that attitude. "The Market" is not a person, doesn't have a conscience, cannot be following your moral rules. It's technically fair because everybody deals with the same market. But your notion of "where the market is going", whether it's in"good" or "bad" condition is simply wrong. Market cannot "retaliate", cannot bounce "on purpose". Please realize there are people on the other end of the swing - somebody had to buy at the bottom and sell at the top, making probably shitloads in seconds. Otherwise who would the losers be selling to at the bottom? The line says that a trade happened between two parties.
Ticks like these are also usually caused by stoplosses getting blown, which increases the speed of the movement. Do you understand short squeeze? If not, don't trade, you are simply not ready for it. All that you are complaining about is totally normal and if you can't deal with it, stay away for your own sake.

Not to mention in the case of Bitcoin it could be considered as a cartel behavior because they are effectively preventing people from buying the product competing to their own.

Yes, you are correct, I just didn't want to use too much technical details, because OP seems to be non-technical. I didn't say preventing asicboost was the main reason to implement segwit, but it very likely was the main reason why BCH was created (no matter what they claimed). And yes, I should have said it made blocks larger, not smaller - basically allowing to fit more transactions into each block even without increasing the 1MB limit.

You should read up more. Yes, stuxnet targetted nuclear reactor computers that are not connected to internet, but it targetted them using USB sticks, because they still had to somehow get commands in and out of those computers. It's the old fashioned way viruses were working in the times of sneakernet. But you can have a raspberry pi for $35 and do the transactions using qr codes, so you don't even plug any USB stick there. So stuxnet would be useless. There is no virus that can spread through bitcoin transaction qr codes. And so far it seems it will never be, because the format of the transaction simply doesn't have any place where a virus could hide and wait for execution.

Hmm, I see you are not a big fan of Bitcoin overall, so why should you care? Just trolling? Bitcoin network handles transactions, and the network has an update to make transactions faster - Lightning. Exchanges on the other hand handle conversions between other currencies (by providing a meeting point for traders). So price of the token compared to fiat is in fact determined at the exchanges, not at the network. Therefore exchanges have a special position - when something important happens with price, suddenly they get hammered with transactions - and they know that. So it's at least weird that a node that knows it will be hammered by transactions refuses to upgrade their software to take advantage of something that makes transactions faster. That's the issue, and that's why I propose to urge the exchanges to use Segwit and Lightning.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:30:36
So tell me. If I send a LN transaction, to credit my account at the exchange, the exchange tells me to go through KYC either during the account creation, or before I make a trade, or before they let me withdraw... How is LN helping me to avoid that KYC? Again, KYC has nothing to do with the method you use to send money to exchange. KYC is a legal requirement for the exchange. It's either imposed by the administration or it isn't, but it doesn't influence the way you send money. They can just as well require KYC for LN deposits.
Besides, everybody is using HD wallets nowadays, where every transaction gets its own address, which provide the same kind of privacy you are talking about. And it still has nothing to do with KYC.

Some time ago, BTC protocol changed to include the "segwit", which is basically a technique to protect against one type of cheating miners and also it makes the blocks a bit smaller. It also allows second layer tech like Lightning network. But some people didn't like it, namely Bitmain, the manufacturer of mining devices, who were suspected of using that exact type of cheating. So they "forked" bitcoin blockchain, which basically means they didn't respect the change in protocol, added their own changes (8MB blocks) and called it Bitcoin Cash. It means these two coins have the same history until some day, after that day they are effectively incompatible. Since then the people around Bitmain, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, r/btc , bitcoin.com and others were shilling BCH everywhere, calling it the "real bitcoin" etc. They are trying to confuse beginners, so be very careful with the distinction, to be sure if somebody is talking about or selling BTC or BCH.

Bitcoin fees are not related to the amount of value you transfer, but to the amount of data it takes to construct the transaction.
Transactions compete for the space in the block. Before sending a transaction, always have a look at [ the current status of mempool (the waiting transactions) and estimate how much fee you have to add to get your transaction in the next couple of blocks (basically look at when was the last time the color in the graph associated with your chosen fee came bellow the dashed line). If you are willing to wait several days, it's usually ok to set 1 or 2 sat per byte, as these crowded surges usually last for couple of days and after that low fee transactions get through again (look at 1 week graph).
So yes, 16USD seems a lot. I'd wait. Exchanges usually set high fees because they want to guarantee you will be in the next block. Coinbase passes that fee on to you? Well, fuck Coinbase then, lol. For example Bitstamp doesn't.

The main two features you are looking for are security and usefulness. Security is given by how many miners are mining it, so the total network hashrate. And usefulness is given by how many people accept it for their goods and services. Bitcoin currently wins at both of those by large. Even if a new king comes, it will be much easier to switch, than say from USD to some other fiat. And it will not happen in a day, it will be long painful decline if it even happens. Plenty of time to recognize the new king.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:08:03
There is no way to make "pull" payments without some trust. You need to trust that the one initiating the pull will only do that when they are supposed to. In the normal world, this is guaranteed by laws, police and having the other party's ID. Bitcoin is trustless so it works specifically with no need for trusting anybody (first time ever). It could be done with some kind of escrow or smart contracts, but the customer would always need to first "charge their credit", then the payments would be taken from that credit by the algorithm.

No, you paid 15 dollars on a 225b transaction. The monetary value you wanted to transfer has no relation to the fee. You could have transfered 70milion dollars and paid 15dollar fee, beat that.

Even the fact that the fees required to get your transaction processed in the next hour or so fluctuate so much is a sign of immaturity. Users cannot know what will happen during the next 10 minutes before the next block. Not to mention most users just forget to check what's the current size of mempool and set inappropriate fees. Lightning is a solution to that, but for Lightning it needs the exchange to have a channel open.

Again a fallacy here. Anyone who wants to speculate on the future price of bitcoin has two options - buy it on an exchange, or mine it. If it's not profitable to mine, it means the price on the exchange is lower than the expenses to mine, so miners can simply turn off their machines and speculate on the future price by buying it on exchange.

Sure, they can label you a terrorist but as far as I can tell Bitcoin hasn't been labeled as terrorist. So if it's not recognized as illegal or restricted on the government level, why should a bank be able to add more arbitrary restrictions of their own? Again - what would happen if the bank decided to block people from buying a specific product? Lawsuit would happen. Based on the fact that bank cannot arbitrarily block people from using their money for legal things. If it was illegal to use bitcoin, then ok, but it's not.

This is actually a fallacy coming from our traditional businesses. It doesn't apply to crypto mining. Why pay for the extra consumed electricity on top of your fixed costs, when you can just pay the fixed costs? If you literally turn off the mining machines that are not profitable given their performance, electricity cost and BTC price, at the very second they drop below the profitability line, you will make more money. The only reason why miners might continue mining even at a "loss" (depending on your definition of loss) are their long term rent &amp; utility contracts and other fixed costs. But saving as much as possible of the variable costs, such as consumed electricity, will clearly make you more profit. It's thanks to the super high fluidity of the crypto market, where you don't have to deal with bankruptcy and brand and customers, SLAs, supply contracts... you can just turn it on and off whenever you want. Even turn it off for a year.

How do low fee transactions drive the fees up?
If I'm willing to pay 2 USD for my transaction, and they spam the network with a milion of 1 USD transactions, my transaction will still be processed first.
And if they spam with high fee transactions, then they start loosing big money, so why would they do it? They create a milion of 3 usd transactions, I will wait, the block will get mined by somebody else and they are screwed. Then my transaction gets in the next block, unless they are willing to loose more milions.. low gain, high loss, high risk.. why would they do it?

if you had your savings in bitcoin during the 2008 housing crash, you wouldn't loose a penny. On the contrary, bitcoins value would have probably jumped up. No bank would be able to just erase your pension fund because THEY made some mistakes and fraud. This was actually why Satoshi created bitcoin, see the message in genesis block.
If you were a citizen of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Greece, and your goverment started acting crazy, devaluing your currency and at the same time preventing you from escaping the colapse by buying a foreign currency, blocking banks from giving you your money through ATMs.. if you had bitcoin, your money would be safe in your own hands, no need to ask anyone for permission to use it. And even if you are not living in any of these countries, you can never know when something like that will happen in your country. Remember Roosevelt confiscated peoples gold stored in banks because of a financial crisis.. but nobody can confiscate your bitcoin if you own your keys

But with fixed costs you can always calculate them per item and then your cost to mine BTC is variable cost + the per-item portion of fixed cost. Each miner will have these costs different, but there will always be one specific price under which it's not profitable to mine, then it's reasonable to turn off all machines and speculate by buying, because continuing to mine would only incur more variable costs on top of it. That's what I meant by "depends on your definition of loss", because usually people say "at loss" when they only consider variable costs, but that's not what I'm talking about.

why "new" asset? Money was not new when bitcoin came. We have an asset, but adding blockchain adds new capabilities, like the trustless nature, immutability, global avilability. So any asset that needs those can benefit from blockchain, if you find a way to incentivize distributed mining, or "watching over", protecting the integrity of that blockchain. And that can be done, even without new coin and yet another ICO

Souns cool, but so far I can see one problem with the private city-company. All residents/citizens of the city should also get a share in the company, otherwise they are not protected from the company saying one day "sorry, sewage system price just doubled, you can live in your shit if you don't want to pay". If they have shares, then the increased income of the company would be redistributed back to the citizens, therefore no problem paying higher price for utilities.
Btw this is quite similar to how the Mennonite community lives and manages itself with the city-company "Fernheim Cooperative" in Paraguay's city Filadelfia.

They will reverse the transaction later - or the bank will reverse it because they found it came from a stolen credit card (no Bitcoin card). So you will receive 5000, send 3500 to them, the 5000 will be reversed, but your outgoing 3500 not.

HW wallets are order(s) of magnitude more secure and easier to set up securely than paper wallets. If you know what you are doing and pay attention to details, it is possible to have a secure paper wallet, good enough for a mid-term cold storage, as I mentioned. Not very long term, because paper degrades, may become unreadable. For long term I would suggest stainless steel. But HW wallets are definitely the best way to go if you store enough money on them to make their purchase price acceptable.

well maybe you \*should\* be concerned about the how, because that is what you are "not thinking of" which is what you wanted us to tell you.
For the other question - how to live with bitcoin when you are paid in bitcoin - well it's pretty obvious, you will have to find places to spend bitcoin for all your daily needs, or convert bitcoins back to dollars everytime you want to spend them somewhere else. Which is the case with a bitcoin debit card - most of them will actually convert bitcoins to dollars when you charge it, not when you spend from it, which makes the bitcoin part completely useless. So yes, as it currently stands, the best course of action is to just get the wage in dollars and convert it to bitcoins yourself on an exchange. That way you can even leave some in dollars to pay your immediate expenses that don't accept bitcoins, and you get the best exchange rate with minimal 3rd parties in the middle and the most flexibility. This advice might be not what you expected ("woooo yeess, do it, it will be great, all rosy, no problems, bitcoin ftw") but that is the reality. I hope you won't take this advice as "spanish inquisition". Removing bankers from your life is sadly not 100% possible yet, just be patient and it will come. Baby steps.

If they want to stop global warming, better close those coal power plants. Bitcoin economy will adjust perfectly, much better than any other industry, because bitcoins incentives and rewards for mining are directly corelated to the price of electricity, unlike big factories or banks.
Another view: saying bitcoin should be stopped because it consumes too much electricity is like saying agriculture should be stopped, because it produces most CO2. Which is true btw, but both are equaly stupid reasons to stop something.

yes, but nothing stops them from generating the last characters also.

You are forgetting the real reason for the 1MB limit - antispam. If the limit was higher, anybody could create millions of spam transactions, miners would be busy mining them, their bandwidth (cost) would get higher, but network wouldn't really gain any value from all that work. There needs to be some level of competition and scarcity in the block, so that any spam attack gets unprofitable very quickly. Spammers can either use higher fees (and get bankrupt) or they will simply be processed only after all the valid normal transactions, which in the event of congestion will be never. So we should prefer off-chain solutions as long as we have some. And lightning will be good enough for a loooong time. We don't even really have it yet, imagine when all small transactions are on lightning - there will be no congestion at all.

they are not really brute-forcing the public key.. they are just generating several million private-public key pairs and then just selecting the one that looks most "similar" to the attacked public key. And here "similar" may mean identical first 4 characters, or identical last 4 characters, or even something fancy like disregarding the upper/lower case, or similar looking characters/numbers.. it will lower the number of attempts and it might fool the user just as well.

it works like this:
\- we have an address that we want to attack - we want to generate an address looking so similar, that the user will not notice
1. generate a new private-public key pair
2. compare first X characters with the attacked address
   1. they match - great, pass the public key to the user, save the private key for us
   2. they didn't match - try again from step 1
do this as fast as you can on the available hardware. You'll get a match for 5 characters within seconds. Doesn't matter where those characters are, whether they are part of the checksum or not.

No, there is no death spiral, because lower difficulty doesn't make the price go lower. Price on the market (exchanges) is decoupled from the cost of producing (mining). Also, take into account that for miners (at least those that are in it for the long term) the decision is "mine or buy" - if mining is not profitable, that means price on market is low, that means good price to buy. That increases the demand and stops any death spiral.

waaaaait.. wait. You seem to be new here, so be careful.
Dropbit seems to be a custodial service so they keep your Bitcoin in "safe storage" just like banks keep your money. You don't really own those Bitcoins while they are in that storage. If you think leaving your money with some company is a good idea, then you probably should stick with ordinary banks and fiat money, because they have all the legal framework, insurance, bailouts etc, that Bitcoin doesn't have. The problem with custodial services is that they can take your money any time they want. Simply by saying it's not really "yours" anymore. With Bitcoin it's the first time in the history where we can have really our digital money, really in our hands and under our sole control. But that applies only to non-custodial wallets.
So try GreenBits, Mycelium, or this [Bitcoin Wallet]( make a backup of the private key and enjoy. Surrendering your bitcoins to a third party service for a lousy "share-by-sms" feature is a high price to pay.

Better approach: make binary predictions, that can only turn out to Yes or No. Make 100 accounts. Make 50 of them predict Yes, 50 predict No. Next prediction, 25 of those first 50 will predict Yes again, etc, splitting the whole 100 into 4 groups... continue doing that. In the end you will have one single account that successfully predicted 6 events in a row. Point to that successful history when offering to make private predictions in exchange for a small fee.
I'm pretty sure somebody is already doing that, the key is how to hide those 100 initial accounts making predictions all at once.

You are mixing two things together. 51% rule (the rule that nodes will always build on top of the longest chain they know about) is there to keep the network decentralised, no single ruler, everybody will eventually find the longest chain and that way they will all have the same history. The POW is there to ensure the blocks are created at regular intervals (on average) and to make that synchronization independent of any central database.

Well it was ATH at that time and was followed by 71% drop, so I'd say it qualifies. And calendar years don't matter.

deciding to follow a new rule is called a fork. So by "agreeing with other miners" (technically - miners + full nodes) you are just simply forking Bitcoin. And this possibility is actually one of the protections against a hostile takeover - if people choose to reject the attacker, they will simply fork Bitcoin and use the new fork instead. Maybe even deciding to call that "Bitcoin" and call the original one something else. Attacker will be left with a worthless coin.
But - 51% attack literally means you already have the agreement with 51% of the miners+full nodes.
And - seeing how people en masse accept our Google+Facebook+Amazon overlords, I'm worried they wouldn't really reject the attacker if the takeover was done slowly, gradually and peppered with cat pictures.

This flawed logic is getting repeated over and over, so I will try to explain it on a model scenario:
We have three users, Alice is willing to pay $5 fee, Bob put $4 and Cyril $3.
Miner Mike is only able to fit two of them in the block, so he decides for Alice and Bob, naturally.
Now how would this change if there was also spammer Steve, who created 1000 transaction with $1 fee?
Well, it wouldn't, Mike would still choose Alice and Bob, Cyrill would still wait until next round, and nobody needs to care about Steve.
"Flooding" the network with low fees doesn't actually flood anyone. It would become a problem if Steve set the fee to $10 and then used his secret Asic farm to mine it himself, so that he recovers his own fees, but at the same time forces everyone else to pay 10 or more.
Or if Steve had AsicBoost and every once in a while annoyed everyone by mining an empty block when everybody is desperately waiting for the mempool to drop.
Of course, there is another way - Steve could fill the mempool with $1 fee transactions, and then shout on reddit "Look the mempool is full", which might actually cause Alice to act irrational and increase her own fee to $6, but as you see, it's just fake news.
To be clear, I agree there are spam attacks, maybe even now, but nobody needs to be worried about low-fee spam attacks - they only work if people forget to count.

The point of DCA is not to get higher gains. You'll in effect be at the average price, and obviously average is higher than the lowest price.
The point of DCA is that you don't have to be lucky when you are disciplined. Instead of trying to correctly determine if this is the true bottom or just a trap and going all in, you just need to have a sense if this is the bear market or the bull market, which is so much easier. Plus the fact that you are not going all in, so the risk is much lower. With such low risk, having the average price is actually a pretty good risk/reward ratio.

Nobody said that lol, that's a big difference. LTC makes sense if you want to diversify (but not now when bitcoin dominance is rising), or if you have a use for that special feature of LTC (or another particular altcoin, such as monero, ripple, ethereum). Usually when BTC stagnates altcoins can have higher gains, so it might make sense for daytrading or mid-term. But for long term store of value, DCA, Hodling, or just promoting crypto in general, I'd stick with BTC, maybe with a bit of altcoins on the side.

I'm not so sure about that. If many participants leave that chain, the difficulty would drop to almost zero, making it very easy to mine very fast. But as I said, this scenario means the attacker first invested insane amounts of money to take over something, that immediately vanished in his hands. They know this, so why would they do it this way? Any serious attacks on Bitcoin will use some other method, maybe one we cannot even imagine now. But that slow gradual takeover is something tested many times in the history, it's basically politics, so big actors like governments, mafia, super rich 0.01%, they already know how to play this game. Sooner or later they will try it on Bitcoin. Because everything essentially is about people. We assume "the people" would correctly identify that an attack is actually happening, that might not be true. And a small minority that does may be silenced, put to the side, overpowered by social media bots, etc. Second, we assume that people will switch to the honest chain - what if they don't? What if the changes introduced by the attacker look like normal upgrades, bugfixes, features, each has something good and something bad, in the end people might be reluctant to give up the "good" things - the candy, the cat pictures, to avoid the bad things - like selling your privacy to marketers or foreign nations, or in this case giving up our financial sovereignty once again. We have some vivid examples of this happening today on many places.

That requires redefining the term "efficiency" to have a different base. Such as in this case you are "more than 100% efficient compared to an electric heater", but that's not the same as the physics term "efficiency". In physics you have to subtract the removed heat. Because the heat pump is moving heat, you will end up cooling the cool air outside and if you do that too much, you will end up not having any more heat to move inside, it will get harder and harder. You are relying on the outside air exchanging around your cool side of the heat pump, which works in practice, but does not change the "efficiency" of the system. So yeah, in marketing terms it's easy to say that you are getting "more than 100% efficiency\* for 40% discount\*" - when the asterisk says it's compared to some ridiculous base.

I'd love to see some hybrid between peertube and D.Tube - peertube is federated, anyone can create their own instance with their own rules, while still being part of the whole network, accessible from anywhere. The videos can be distributed over torrent. But D.Tube uses IPFS which is better than torrents because it automatically acts as a CDN, making it much more responsive and faster to load without overwhelming the server. Also D.Tube is easily monetized, which draws creators, which then draws viewers. But we can't create our own instance of D.Tube, can we?

You don't need to find the transaction - you are probably looking at it when you are reading the Txid, amount, recipient etc. You need the private key of the address that currently holds the USDT. It sounds like you made the withdrawal (because you found it in the Withdrawal history page) from your exchange account into a USDT wallet (the recipient). Are you sure your friend didn't scam you and tricked you into withdrawing your USDT into his wallet? If that's the case then only that "friend" is now able to move the money, you cannot "reverse" it. Take it up with them.

There are no "accounts" in bitcoin, that's the beauty of it. The private key is nothing more than a very large random number. Basically by generating the secret what you're doing is "I'm thinking of a number...". Of course blockexplorer will not be able to show your result. But that's ok because you can still use this number to "sign" a transaction and publish it. That's when blockexplorer will hear about your address (your public key - "share") and show some results there. But now that you typed the private key to a website, you should not use it anymore. You never know if somewhere on the way somebody was listening to that communication and copied your private key. Also, since you apparently don't know how to properly secure the internet access (saving the page to favourites and turning off wifi just for the moment is definitely not enough), I'd recommend you try Electrum and write the mnemonic seed onto a paper.

These ATMs are always made by a certain company that has a contract with the place it's in. So at least the person at the counter would be able to direct you to their official phone number to say "the fuck, man?" to the proper target. There aren't so many of these companies, because making a device that counts fiat money is not so easy. So these companies plan to stay in business longer. Scamming someone would not cover the expense of building that ATM, and would immediately lead to litigation, cancelled contract, bad publicity.
There are much much easier ways to scam someone online. Or with a traditional bank. Oversight is not really stopping them.

And no, it is not slow. If you are comparing bitcoin with stable currencies, at least do the same when talking about speed of international transfers. No bank ever will transfer any amount to any place on Earth in 1 hour. And no, it's not expensive - again, no bank ever will do such transfer for a fixed fee of couple of cents. And no, it's not a waste of energy - that myth has been debunked several times, it's just still circulating because many people found it believable.

If you pay with Coinbase, they have the power to shut you off. They are the same kind of gatekeeper as the banks that caused this crisis in Venezuela, and many other crises elsewhere. If you transact bitcoin directly, nobody can stop you.
Coinbase has previously demonstrated that they are exactly the kind of gatekeeper.
So just to make sure - this CoinbaseWallet - is it paired with a coinbase account? It shows the transaction amount in USD, not BTC, so who does the conversion and how? There are some extra steps before the payment - what are those? Normally the receiver can create a QR code request that already contains the requested amount, so the payer really needs to only open the app, click camera button, scan QR code and confirm with a button, nothing else. Extra steps are just more points where something can go wrong.

To get a fair estimate of bitcoin electricity consumption is not too difficult, because we know the difficulty, we know the hashrate required to get a block, we know how many blocks are produced and we know the power consumption per hashrate for the ASICs. The inacurracies are therefore only in the spectrum of devices used for mining and the spectrum of locations where miners are, therefore their various electricity sources. And it is this simplicity to reach a number what drives the journalists to create visual comparisons for readers. Versus the practical impossibility to estimate how much electricity is consumed in fiat banking. Calculating cooling costs and visualizing a Coca Cola bottle should be much easier, and I'm quite sure it will beat Denmark

Yeah.. so? I don't see any moral problem. Having a big pile of money to spare is a rare thing, and investing it literally means you give that money to somebody who needs money to run something (a business) - that person wants that money just temporarily, because without it he'd have to wait much longer before starting his business, could be outrun by competition or just never achieve that starting budget. But investing is also risky, the business might fail, then even the investor might end up without money, because it's effectively gone. Rarity and risk is rewarded with interest (technically just a higher buyback value), so why not?
Of course if the money is inherited, the person didn't really do anything to "deserve it" other than just being lucky to be born to the rich parent. That's the lottery of life. Hard to put morality rules on who gets born to whom. Still not parasitism though.
It's not "fair" in the literary point of view - that some people have it easy and they didn't really have to do anything for it, yet others have their lives miserable even when they didn't do anything bad. But life was never fair and never will be. This is pure randomness.

Ok, I stand corrected regarding the figure of 10x10 miles. I found various sources, from 20x20, up to 200x200 miles, but after all, the size of the solar panels wasn't really important for the point I wanted to make - that you can have bitcoin consuming as much energy as any country and still not be causing climate change at the same time.

@_date: 2018-11-10 10:03:46
Exactly. It's not the use of electricity that causes climate change, it's the source. We could power the whole US from a 10x10 miles square of solar panels somewhere in a desert (Edit: ok, more like 200x200, but that's not the point). Then make another square just for mining bitcoin. Voila, the electricity consumption of bitcoin would therefore be as big as US, yet no carbon emissions.

Maybe they shouldn't, but they have. In this inheritance case you could say God wanted it. There is no moral rule for that.


Oh absolutely. Once it becomes about dollars it means there is some corruption happening somewhere in the chain. And corruption does pretty clearly cause bad unfair outcomes. Corruption is bad for any system, including capitalism. Corruption is when somebody is hired to make decisions for the benefit of a group of people, but instead uses that position to make some decisions that are better for him alone, than for the group. Many kinds of corruption: it can be politician, or a receptionist. It can be money in a bag, or a favour in a beauty contest.


No, not really. The other people wouldn't be doing the work, if they were not satisfied with the salary conditions they were offered before taking the job (whoever takes a job while not being ok with the salary is creating their own problem). Btw, "money make money from other people's work" is a line from Karl Marx. The idea that only work should make money is very marxist (working class, proletariat, ...). Money does make money, that is quite easy economical process, as shown in one of my previous comments.


No. If you can pull it off, go for it. But it's not as easy as you may think.

there is no legal limit for owning bitcoin, the law is too slow to adjust to new tech. That said, your parents are imposing a kind of legal limit on you just by telling you to stop. You would be mining bitcoins with the electricity they pay for, so if you do that against their wish, you are stealing from them. In a country where electricity prices are "normal" you are effectively buying bitcoins in exchange for the dollars on your electricity bill. And your small mining operation wouldn't be profitable if you paid for the electricity yourself.

Stop this shit already. Bitcoin should find better symbols than drug dealers. Is that the "big contribution" you are talking about? If somebody runs the biggest online drug eshop and deals with assassins, then you are wrong calling them "idealistic entrepreneurs".
And yes, it's totally possible to get double life sentence for non-violent crime, just like it is possible to get shot for parking violation - if you are stupid in the process and for example fight the cops during arrest. Or in this case plead not guilty and don't cooperate with investigators when they have so vast amounts of proofs against you.

well there is a process that determines the length of the sentence. And you argued nothing about the process, only about the end result.

I noticed it too and I was actually thinking whether a big miner could exploit it for profit. Imagine this strategy:
1. you have a lot of miners, turn them off for a while, no profit but no expense
2. blocks will queue up because the network is weaker
3. some people put unreasonably high fees to make sure they are in the next block. Wait until there are enough of these people to fill the whole block
4. once there are, start your miners again, now you have a higher chance of finding a block filling it with only the higher paying transactions
you wouldn't actually exploit the bitcoin protocol or the reward, but you would just scoop the highest paying transactions, leaving the 1s/b to others
What do you think? Is this a viable strategy for a miner? Why or why not?

1. bitcoin ownership gets banned and prosecuted by all governments on Earth (quite unlikely, given they have never been able to agree on anything that globally - not even drugs, murders etc)
2. bitcoin gets silently overtaken - a power-seeking party will slowly, gradually get tiny pieces of influence, kinda in the same way how Russia influences US elections, and introduce small changes to the protocol, to the way people use, and understand Bitcoin. Until one day we will be all totally OK with having a central party overseeing critical points of bitcoin network (imagine if all miners had to get a license), but because everybody will be using Bitcoin, there would be no way to avoid going through that central party. People would simply accept the controlled Bitcoin, but the original idea of p2p money would be all but gone, no better than fiat money. It might even still be called Bitcoin.
3. P=NP, a critical flaw in cryptography will make all our current cryptography useless. Imagine quantum computers breaking hashes in seconds, no matter the cipher algorithm. We know about Shorr, but what if there is a way around it, and we just haven't found it yet? This would not be limited to Bitcoin of course, our whole world would basically collapse.
4. back to the stone age due to world war 3 (not necessarily a nuclear war, killing autonomous robots are bad enough). Internet would cease to be global, if it even exists, therefore nobody would accept internet money because they cannot exchange it for anything.

the difficulty drop is designed to be enough to keep people mining.

Now you are the one assuming something. Let's look closely at what I wrote and what I was reacting to, shall we?


When somebody talks about "argument to &lt;lowercasewordswithoutspaces&gt;" it is pretty reasonable to assume they are talking about command line, which, as it turns out, was in fact the case. Do you not agree? And "addresstype=legacy" was referred to merely as a "setting" but it actually meant a line in the config file, not command line but then again, not GUI. So my assumption in "So only on command line?" was correct.


It's 2019, Bitcoin Core is 10 years old, it's supposed to be trusted and somewhat the reference bitcoin client and full node. If a feature, which has its own GUI menu (signing a message) only works with legacy addresses, which have to be activated by config file or CLI argument, then that really isn't acceptable and should be considered a bug or at least a big UX omission. I'd really like to see the arguments if you want to disagree with this. So again, this part of my comment was justified.
Yet, I got heavily downvoted. You *assume* I included some berating in my comment, you are wrong. Yet you tell me I was wrongly assuming. I believe I got downvoted because people take any objections as an attack, which is however incorrect. We can't improve if we don't point out what can be improved.

Big big alarm on the exchanges then..
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:58:38
Man, this is scary.
The way I see it they couldn't have done it by emailing support - no way to synchronize two exchanges at the same time.
Also, having some virus on your computer, that can control your mouse and keyboard, or a compromised logmein/teamviewer/vnc shouldn't normally let them disable gauth 2fa. Exchanges *should* require some authentication, like a selfie with your passport, to disable 2fa via email, and it again takes time, no way to synchronize two exchanges. If the exchanges don't verify, then this is a big big alarm on their side.
For this to work as you described the attackers would also have to compromise your gauth and extract the initialization keys. With a rooted android phone this is possible, I'm not sure how it works on iPhone.
Any way, this is crazy, it means you yourself were specifically targeted by somebody really capable.

Agreed. However it would be a bit harsh to forever deny access to someone, who lost their 2fa device and didn't save the original pin or init key, when he still has all the documents proving his identity just like when he was passing the document verification when opening the account. The verification process when resetting 2fa *should* take days, it is actually a security measure.

Not really.. the virus works on the phone when it's decrypted. The only way to protect is for the exchanges to consider every support request to change 2fa as a potential attack and implement verification. The only other way would be to regularily disable and re-enable 2fa to get new init keys, but that is only a partial measure. Hardware 2fa would be a secure measure, if the exchange supports it.

If you say the moon is made of cheese you will be talking about a single global thing that everyone sees. Such statement may be wrong, but it cannot harm anyone. But it's still very different from saying "I made a great cheese in my house out of rainwater".
And I really don't see how he is making anyone loose their life savings. If he was selling the miners, I would understand. But he specifically declined to name his supplier, and the reason is obvious - the supplier probably went way low on the price and doesn't want everybody comming to them asking for the same discount.
Also, AFAIK nowhere did he say "Everybody should do what I'm doing, it's the best way to make money, follow me", instead he says "this worked for me, it wasn't easy"
I mean, I'm not arguing whether he is legit or not. I will honestly check him out in a year just out of curiosity. But the witchhunt is really stupid. If you don't believe him or you are not interested, simply ignore him. There is no harm.

Well thank you for your assessment of my understanding based on one comment.....
There are android exploits which can give root access to apps. In fact one of the most used rooting options depends on an exploit. Malicious app, outdated android system, or outdated browser while visiting a malicious website could all be a way to install a virus with root capabilities on android. The virus could automatically extract the gauth init keys and chceck if the user has accounts on crypto exchanges. The attackers could then flag that user for targetted attack and wait for the right moment.
Whereas with social engineering through exchange support you'd need to get a response from a person. With the current response times people are waiting for three weeks for a response. Arguably security tickets might be handled with priority, but there is still no way to expect response within minutes/hours. When support replies, the user is immediately notified and the old way of logging in stops working, so the user would notice next time he tries to log in. To do this successfully on two exchanges at the same time is almost impossible, you never know when will they reply and you never know when the user will try to login next. Plus there is still the issue with exchanges that *should* authenticate before changing the 2fa settings. Well yeah it could be an inside job at two exchanges at the same time, which is even more insane than this.
Now who doesn't understand?

Have a backup in another place. Always have a backup.

well then maybe we are not at the bottom yet. As the adoption grows the spikes both up and down will get less extreme. And also, as the adoption grows, the volatility will get lower. So, did the adoption grow?

I really don't understand all the fuzz about some guy maybe doing something somewhere. If he is actually in profit, good for him. If he is lying, who cares. Whoever gets motivated and starts their own operation without verifying the math is stupid. And if the math checks out then go for it, why not? So really.. what the fuzz?
He also mentioned that his plan is profitable only with the current prices. So yeah, that makes the plan very risky, but if he or anyone else is willing to take the risk, then again, who cares? His colapse might be just around the corner, but that doesn't make anything he said false. And he doesn't have any motivation to prove anything to anyone.. why would he? The only scenario where he would have the motivation to lie is if his goal was to become internet celebrity. Pretty lame goal. Whereas if he actually is making profit, and just doesn't feel like proving anything to the naysayers, then he can just ignore you and keep taking his profit and never share any idea with the comunity ever again. That would be my course of action if I actually had struck a gold mine and nobody believed me.

@_date: 2019-05-02 14:42:51
why would you count the cost of transaction based on the block reward? Block reward is in place because the bitcoin economy is not big enough to cover the miners expenses just from transaction fees alone. Read the Satoshi paper, it's all there. Block reward is like inflation - do you count inflation towards fiat money transaction fees? Or QE?
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:31:59


Yes, correct


Yes, the unprofitable ones - most effective market on the planet if you ask me.


But why? Don't change what's good. This is all for the good. Block rewards must slowly and gradually go away because 1.) they cannot go away all at once, that would prevent Bitcoin from starting in the first place, 2.) they have to go away eventually, because Bitcoin wants to be a deflationary economy with fixed amount of Bitcoins in existence. So in the end all miners expenses should be covered by fees, but that's still loooooong way from now. We are getting there and it's all as it's supposed to be.


Again, that's a good thing. Miners would definitely want to bend the rules in their favor, that's why miners are not in charge of the rules. Though the halving is pretty predictable, so any miner would calculate with that right from the start. As they of course do.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:06:32
Currently, the swings happen due to speculators - people who only buy to sell later at higher price. But when the economy grows, more and more subjects will use bitcoin for normal payments, rent, wages, lunch... these subjects don't intend to sell at higher price, they just want some goods, using bitcoin as the medium, not as the goal. They don't want to watch the price carefully all day. As more and more of these people appear in the bitcoin economy, it will become more stable, speculators will still exist, but it will be more difficult to move the price, because all the normal people will just tend to buy and sell and pay with the same rates, even having fixed long term contracts, negating the effect of speculators. Which will in turn make it less profitable for speculators as they suddenly cannot grab high profits after short time, so they will tend to leave.

It's like instead of trading Bitcoins, you trade papers with promises you'll get Bitcoins. The promises can come with some special rules, like regulation, or chargebacks, or insurance. This makes them more "safe" for the big players, who know how to work with the small print and who already trade similar promises on wall street. They don't want to pour money on the actual Bitcoin, because they don't have the legal frameworks around those, but these paper promises will probably be much more appealing for them, so they'd increase the overall money flowing into the Bitcoin world. BUT - these people using these instruments are very experienced in playing the market game both ways - up or down. So increased money supply don't mean the price will go up. It may just as well mean that they will set up high frequency trading systems that will short Bitcoins to their liking. It's like inviting big whales into Bitcoin, much bigger than what we've had so far. At least for me personally, even if ETFs come, I'm not touching them.

They could keep the money we pay today. They partially do, but taxes are also used for some expenses. I mean, the question whether taxes are "stealing" is a completely different topic, doesn't really relate to Bitcoin, and it's unfortunately heavily politically charged and full of tin-foil-hat conspiracies. So I don't want to discuss that. It doesn't change how Bitcoin works or how I will use it. Bitcoin taxes do however lower the chance that government will one day decide to criminalize the ownership of Bitcoin. Also it will get almost impossible to create the narrative that Bitcoin is only good for buying drugs and supporting terrorism. I will be more relieved that I'm not gonna be ostracized by men with guns for simply storing my life savings in Bitcoin, which is a risk with low adoption. Governments can continue doing what they are doing with fiat money today, stealing it, bribing with it, hiding it, whatever, I don't care. As long as nobody can know and confiscate my life savings because I will never tell them about my cold wallet.

Btw, this is not about developed/undeveloped country. Similar inflation problems happened in Greece when they were not able to devalue their currency because they had Euro. Government was falsifying economic stats, hiding the fact that they are wasting money on useless things, then banned people from withdrawing money from their banks and in the end took 20% of their account values to "compensate the economy". Again, this wouldn't happen with Bitcoin. And Greece stories were also popular on this sub at the time of the Greek crisis. Now we have also Turkey, but Venezuela is a much bigger disaster.

The problem is that hardware cannot be reprogrammed as easily as software, so it makes sense only if the cost of making the chip and the risk of not being able to change it is offset by the profits from the speed improvement.

yes you do. Seed phrase is nothing more than a mapping from a dictionary to numbers, then those numbers are used as the seed for random number generator for the private key. There are currently several wordlists, but who knows what wordlists will be created between now and the time you want to sweep your cold storage, more importantly, which wordlists will stop being preconfigured in wallet software.


you are trusting them


afaik some wallet software can be configured to not use the change address, send the change back to the originating wallet. But then again, this doesn't concern you if you sweep paper wallets completely, as mentioned previously.

AFAIK bitcoin is only truly illegal in Bolivia, Ecuador and a couple of African countries. Then a bunch of countries where legal status is not completely clear, anybody's opinion, no precedents etc... So if you are not in one of the countries, your employer is full of shit and you'd probably win a legal case against them.

1. seed phrase can represent a single non-HD wallet too, and paper wallet can represent a private key for HD wallet too.
2. this is a "feature" of the wallet software, not of the key. Decent paper wallets warn about this and paper wallets are used for cold storage, so you may add multiple times over long periods, but when you want to withdraw, you withdraw all of it at once. It doesn't take much research to find this
3. yeah it's easier to write, but only slightly and it still has the same problems about storage and keeping it safe from damage. Paper wallets usually have the keys printed multiple times in addition to a QR code, so the probability that all of them would get damaged at the same place is about the same as the probability that one word from your seed phrase is completely missing. And Electrum allows you to chose your wordlist, you still need to know which one was chosen for your seed phrase, and depend on the backwards compatibility of future versions of Electrum
4. you can do that with paper wallets too
Just to be clear, I'm not saying storing a seed phrase is bad and paper wallets are better. I'm saying that they are pretty much equivalent. To counter the argument raised previously that paper wallets are unsafe and seed phrase is safer... and many of the points in the wiki page are simply wrong.

Well blockchain as a technology is just the combination of cryptographically linking chunks of data into a long chronological chain, and making it very difficult to create a new block, but very easy to verify that it's correct once it's created - with PoW in this case. The fact that it's public allows anybody to verify any step, which makes it unbreakable. 
The reason we don't have that many other things running on blockchain is because it's not so easy to find them. Theoretically you could use the same mechanism for any ledger, not only money. Say a land register. Or tracking packages. But some people started putting the word "blockchain" in front of anything and that doesn't make any sense. Very often running it on a database is better in every way. You'd need to find a use case where you don't want a central authority, where the peers validate the blockchain themselves and you are ok with random peers popping up without any approval. Usually for packages the shipping company wants to be in charge and for land register the state. A ledger of money transactions is actually a perfect use case for that, but that doesn't rule out other uses.
Can Bitcoin (peer-to-peer electronic money) exist without blockchain? No. Can blockchain in some other form exist without Bitcoin? Quite possibly yes. Does that mean Bitcoin is a scam and will go to zero? No. Are many of the new companies with blockchain in their name just bullshit running on hype and buzzwords? Totally

It's not very trustless if you have to trust a proprietary "secure" chip from Intel, which has a history of including backdoors into similar proprietary "secure" chips.
Verifying that SHA256 from ASIC is the same SHA256 as defined can actually be done with a pencil on paper in the middle of desert, so I don't have to trust the ASIC vendor, I can verify.

the digital signatures, unlike a "pen-on-paper" signature, also guarantee the integrity of the message - the valid digital signature is different if you change the message - it is created by combining the private key and the message. If somebody changes the message without changing the signature, it becomes invalid and very easy to see. And since only the private key can generate a valid signature, nobody can change the message and attach a valid signature to it without having the private key.

there is one positive side even when the merchants are using intermediaries - the intermediary has to charge a premium, otherwise they don't have a business. Which means, if these fees become anything like the Visa/MasterCard fees, which can take a decent portion of margin, the merchant will be pushed to include that fee into the price of the product, like they are now with Visa. BUT - with bitcoin, they always have the very cheap alternative of running the BTCPay server themselves. Merchants don't want to raise the sticker prices and then give it to intermediaries - so they will be considering self-hosted solutions much more likely. As long as this alternative exists, the intermediaries will either have to keep the fees negligible, so that it's still lower than self-hosting, or there will be a lot of merchants switching. That's much much better situation, than when Visa/MasterCard is the intermediary, because there is no self-hosted solution for them.

I think it's pretty much guaranteed that they will try to collect Bitcoin and spend fiat for as long as possible, especially when they print as much fiat as they want. If they have any brains, that's the smart thing to do. The only thing we can do about it is push for laws that spend Bitcoin for example, or laws that dictate the immediate liquidation. But given how much politicians usually do what people want (not much) this is a wishful thinking. But again, that's not about Bitcoin, it's actually one of the main characteristics of Bitcoin that who owns it, can really control it. The important thing is that before, there wasn't any way for a normal guy like me to really control my money. Now I can do it too. The governments were doing it for ever. Yes there will be some insanely rich politicians along the way. But in the end, the price of Bitcoin will stabilize as the adoption grows. So then hoarding will make less of a sense than paying rent with it.

Dictators can do effectively anything, including taking over money, how they are distributed, when, who goes to jail, who doesn't even get a trial. Limiting supply of currency is the exact opposite of inflation. And yes, the Greek crisis was opposite in the nature, but people who had their savings in Bitcoin would be equally protected from the whims of the government - the savings would only lose purchasing power (how much food you can buy for how much currency) if the government was able to either cut the supply of food or increase the supply of currency. They can do the former, but not without direct evidence that they are purposefully creating famine not to mention artificially limiting the supply of food would hardly be justified solution to financial crisis. They can do the latter with fiat, not with Bitcoin.

Actually, there are already tools which pre-generate some addresses that have the same couple of first and last characters as your correct address. So this is actually a bad advice today. Randomly checking several characters from the middle is much better

Ok, i don't have example of a tool replacing the last characters, but technically it's no different than generating the vanity address with the characters at beginning. And as everybody will recommend checking first and last characters, it will be just a matter of time when a malware will adapt.
There was already a report of a malware that pre-generates thousands of addresses and then just chooses the most "similar" one, possibly by calculating a "distance". That could be matching in any part of the string. Thats why I recommended checking "randomly".
See here a similar recommendation with explanation

sorry, but few problems with your logic:
First rule of war is to picture the enemy as a despicable creature, inhuman. Doesn't matter if they speak the same language or were our neighbors couple years ago - in a war they will be pictured in the worst possible way and anybody saying "maybe they are not so bad" will be labeled as an enemy too. So those killed wouldn't be "Americans" or "our communities", they will be "those vicious rebels" or "criminals" or "terrorists". Both sides of every war ever did this everywhere in the world. Therefore no mass defection or noncompliance.
You seem to underestimate the budget of the US army - look it up, those are interesting numbers. Close to one whole Apple Inc. - PER YEAR. And growing. Not to mention, there is no need to confiscate all guns - they normally announce voluntary collection, then later criminalize possession, then send tanks for the rest. Again, that's how every country ever did it.
Would it happen tomorrow? Of course not. This needs some preparation, changes in justice system, propaganda etc, it would take some time. But if the US government ever had the need to wage war against some of their own citizens, they would have no problems achieving it. Couple of untrained people with handguns are irrelevant.

should be ok. I remember one instance where a vulnerability in one hardware wallet firmware was discovered, but the attacker still needed physical access to exploit it. That said, nobody knows what vulnerability will be discovered tomorrow. But with an air-gapped computer (which hardware wallets really are until you plug them in your USB), it should still be safe to leave it unplugged for long time without problem. You may consider establishing a yearly Christmas ritual of checking for firmware updates. And for checking balance you can just set up a watch-only address in any mobile phone wallet, that only tracks the address and shows you your balance, but doesn't allow moving the coins
