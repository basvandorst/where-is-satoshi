It's easy to look back positively on Cavirtex, and indeed they were a perfectly acceptable exchange for a time. However they did *literally* collapse prior to Coinsetter taking over, so the business was hardly in great shape even then.

Don't accept prepaid cards for Bitcoin. While it is possible for the buyer to empty the card before you get a chance to use it, you'll also wind up with dud cards that have been deactivated by the payment processor. Why? 90%+ of the prepaids you accept will be bought with stolen credit cards. Carders use the prepaids to cash out compromised cards, and want to turn them back into Bitcoin as soon as possible... It's a really, really bad idea. 
Wire transfers I'm less familiar with, but there are definitely still risks there. Don't touch it unless you understand keenly every possible way you could be scammed because you will be hit. 
Cash deposit is one of the safest payment methods, as long as you only accept deposits and not transfers between accounts (transfers are reversible, deposits are not). That said, no major bank in North America is willing to bank bitcoin sellers accepting cash deposit, so while you can get away with it for short bursts, your account WILL be closed. TD started closing bitcoin related accounts in 2013, so you're a bit behind the curve there. 
If you accept anything other than cash, you WILL be scammed in some capacity.

Virwox is the only "reputable" exchange platform that will take reversible forms of payment, and they surely have extraordinarily high fraud rates as a result. Of course their fees are going to be very high, they have to break even somehow. 
If you use Virwox rather than a normal exchange, you know full well what you're getting into and the costs are disclosed up front. If you can't do the math or use a legal exchange, then that's the price you pay.

Awesome! Indeed, it's hidden behind a paywall; they generally charge a monthly fee to access it. But I believe they make exceptions for some applications that are just looking to pull the current price, so hopefully they get back to you soon. 
Failing that, Vault of Satoshi would be a reasonable alternative; their API is open and much better over the Virtex API (so I'm told). I price my transactions off Virtex, but VoS moves close enough I could make it work.

If you have a friend in the US or Canada that you can ship it to and have them forward to you, sure. The extra shipping probably isn't worth it though, especially when you factor in most consoles are region locked (so you'll need US games too).

Buying local is great, but those guys have to get their bitcoin from somewhere too (the regular sellers, in any case). Guess what they do? They have BMO accounts and buy it from Virtex. In a perfect world that would be a real alternative, but for now you're just paying a premium to avoid maintaining that banking relationship (which, admittedly, is becoming more and more worth it). 
And even then, as the banks close more and more accounts, it cuts down on the number of people that can sell. I sell on Lbtc: I was the first in my region, and at the peak there were about 8 of us. I'm now the last one left, everyone else lost all their bank accounts (and even then, I'm down to my last one). If/when this last account gets shuttered, I'm closed for business too. 
People really underestimate the importance of banking when it comes to bitcoin. It's literally impossible to truly buy into bitcoin without someone having a bank account, and in Canada that's now the biggest hurdle.

"Cash deposit" on localbitcoins is done via branches, where you have to go in to a teller and give them someone else's account number, then cash. There's no way to send other people money via a regular ATM, your average corner store ATM isn't even going to take deposits (they tend to be withdraw only). 
If you're interested in trying a cash deposit transaction, message a reputable user (100+ transactions, 100% feedback) on Localbitcoins and they should be able to walk you through it. It's very easy, but you should probably also do more research on your own.
I think pretty much everything else was covered in your last thread: 
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:37:44
Exactly this. The machine can definitely handle it better, and I believe they now do, but the transaction was sent without a fee and stuck for &gt;24 hours without any confirmations. There's not much the machine or operator can do about it. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:55:01
Also worth noting this video is a little dated. It was uploaded in April, which is a relatively long time ago in the world of ATMs. Robocoin's software has been updated since then, other ATMs exist that didn't then that may (hopefully) do things better and bitcoin software has evolved since then. There's still plenty of room for improvement, but the technology is ever evolving.

I would really love to see cavirtex support for calculating rates! As it is there's no Canadian markets which makes pricing accurately impossible. More control over the price (eg. a formula system) would be great too, in the longer term.

There are 10 in the GTA (per CoinATMRadar), and all but certainly more coming.
* 7 BitAccess machines, all two-way (some are operating one-way)
* 1 Robocoin, two-way
* 2 Lamassu, one-way
Toronto's a pretty saturated market, at this point. 
More than that, don't underestimate the legal requirements and business side of operating a bitcoin ATM. Operating ATMs is a business and not something you should pursue without doing extensive research beforehand.

Sounds good, neat that a radio personality has taken interest in bitcoin. If your goal is to introduce bitcoin to the listeners that aren't at all familiar I'd have focused more on how bitcoin can be used and less on the fraud/security concerns, but it was good.

Right now, the market is such that you buy the ATM outright ($1,000-$15,000) and then operate it, or a few intermediaries exist where they'll pay for the machine up front in exchange for a percentage of transactions (you still have to provide a location and maintain it). If you have a location that you think would be good for an ATM, you can get one relatively easily either way. 
There's legal considerations, other business expenses and operations logistics to consider, so it's not quite (or shouldn't be) as easy as plugging a unit in. But if you're really interested in getting a Bitcoin ATM, it's totally doable. 
That said, an office is not a good location to install one at this point. Even if you work at a major tech company, there aren't going to be enough customers to use it. The ATMs can do well, but they really need to be in a specific sort of location; if not in a high traffic location, at least somewhere that's very accessible to the public. The best is somewhere that's easy to get to by transit &amp; car, open long hours and with an employee (store clerk, wait staff, etc.) nearby to keep an eye on things. As such, places like convenience stores, bars, restaurants and malls tend to be favourites so far. 
Even if you have co-workers spending/transacting in a couple thousand dollars a week, that's really not much compared to what they can do in a better location, and in an office setting you're dependant on those same people constantly buying/selling more.

There are [plenty of Lamassu machines out there]( it is a real product and if you order (and pay in full, unlike the guy that opted to forfeit half his money) they will deliver you a unit eventually. Taking payment in bitcoin or wire transfer is pretty par for the course; they're not exactly going to accept a credit card for a ~$10,000 purchase. 
That said, you should seriously look into what it takes to operate a bitcoin ATM. Buying the machine is the easy part; there are plenty of manufacturers that are shipping right now and can get you one in a few weeks. The harder part is operating the machine, both in terms of financial requirements (float &amp; banking) and legal hurdles (complying with regulation and registering as a money transmitter). The ATM is cheap; the rest not so much.
You mention you're in the US, which is why I get the impression you haven't considered some of this yet; installing an ATM can run $200,000+ in licensing alone. And the Lamassu has no KYC controls, which means it can't legally be operated in most states.  If you're just worried about sending a wire transfer for just the hardware, there's a lot more you have yet to consider.

It sounds like you might be thinking of a traditional ATM? Just to be clear, a **Bitcoin ATM** is completely different from a traditional ATM. They're not really ATMs, more like digital kiosks that accept cash and send Bitcoin. They're very specialized machines and there's only one or two in most cities at this point; they usually look [like this]( A regular ATM has nothing to do with Bitcoin and there is no way to buy Bitcoin through one. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:42:05
Another reason to move to a different paper wallet than the one the machine makes: they use thermal paper, which will fade over time (and relatively fast). Bitcoin ATM paper wallets are NOT meant for long term storage and should be transferred to another wallet as soon as possible.

The Bitcoin ATMs in the US have require more ID *because* they're in the US. Even if QuadricaCX had locations in the US, they'd be subject to the same local laws that the current US operators are subject to. Some states can get away with less (eg. Texas doesn't require ID provided the ATM doesn't connect to an exchange), but in general operators in the US are (or should be, given current laws) forced to comply with much more strict regulation than other regions, say Canada. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:35:41
No, not standard at all; the average rate for a Bitcoin ATM in the US [is 5.8%]( The lowest you'll find is generally 1-2%, highest 10%. It's not great, but it's not that bad either.

Probably [this video]( That's a different kind of machine, but far from the average user experience on any Bitcoin ATM.
In that case they sent the transaction to a Robocoin with no fee, so it took an eternity before the transaction got any confirmations. There's not much any ATM can do in that case, since it can't exactly pay out dollars until it confirms it gets the Bitcoin. It's more of a bitcoin/user (sorry Will &amp; Norm!) problem than anything wrong with the machine.
Go to that same ATM today and you'll get your cash in about 30 minutes for sell transactions and ~15 minutes for Bitcoin. The machine posted above can do the same in 0-15 minutes for sell transactions and 1-2 minutes for buy transactions (~10 minutes for &gt;$3000).

They're generally accepting of Bitcoin, offer cheap rent, are open longer hours and exist literally everywhere. It's also dramatically easier to negotiate the lease, since it's a small company instead of a national chain or big local player. If not a vape shop, bars, convenience stores, restaurants and Bitcoin-specific retail are also good fits. 
Basically, it has nothing to do with a connection to vaping itself; these businesses are just more accepting of Bitcoin ATMs than most.

For normal transactions, I believe they say 'no fee' so it's just a market price that works a bit in their favour. 1-2% difference off a major exchange at most that I've seen. If you can see a price without registering/verifying, that's probably the actual rate they'll use when you transact. 
For instant transactions, there was a bigger, explicit fee. But those transactions are capped at $10 and require a $200 hardware wallet, so I doubt most people will see that part of the system for now.

Link seems broken, so [here's Ars' article]( on the subject. Bitcoins mentioned. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:28:22
Yes, it is. All remaining Robocoins were shut down February 15, so that would be why this ATM isn't working. They shut down with 30 days notice, so that wasn't enough notice for all affected companies; presumably Coinme will be replacing it soon with a new ATM. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:48:53
The fee amount on its own doesn't matter, priority is determined by how much you pay per byte of the transaction. So if your transaction is small (simple), 0.0001 could have been sufficient to still get a high priority. 
@_date: 2012-02-11 18:37:03
Yep, assuming it's legit. Still, I don't get it.

It's a shame, it was a neat device. It just had some major flaws, the least of which being that it's a managed wallet service masquerading as a hardware wallet.

Yes, every location has its own rate. It's up to the company that owns the machine.

Yep, exactly this. Where available, government issued ID cards are also perfectly valid and should be supported by these Bitcoin companies. Most likely tend to specify drivers license and passport specifically just because those two are the most common.

Purchased. Verdict: I quite like it. It'd be even better if the current MH/s were listed on the Miner list view (for those of us that mine with more than one pool simultaneously), though. :) 
(Assuming it survives the week, support for solidcoin markets/pools would be awesome too, so that I only need one app to check everything. But I bet there aren't many, if anyone else, that would use such a feature.)

Have you tried restarting the computer?

General rule of thumb: the longer the transaction takes, the cheaper it will be. So yes, something like Coinbase is far cheaper than QuickBT.

Moonco.in was running a betting service along with their exchanges, while being hosted in the US. If they were indeed taken down, no doubt it was for that and not their use of bitcoins.

Probably not, but mentioning your country and payment system would give you a better chance at getting an actual answer.

Piling on, it was a good option for having someone record a business's phone menu (total cost was about $30). Wouldn't use it for much else.

Under most circumstances, [yes it does]( If you feel like you're operating in an MSB capacity, you should consult with your legal council about registering. 
Of course, the problem remains: 


This doesn't get any easier as an MSB and isn't going to go away any time soon. Banking is hard for any kind of Bitcoin businesses, but it's not impossible in Canada. You can't walk into a retail branch and expect an account, but if you have industry contacts, proper funding and a rock solid compliance program it is possible to bank in Canada.

Localbitcoins customers (and regular Bitcoin buyers in general) are very loyal, once they find a trader they like they won't switch unless they have to. It's not necessarily lack of demand so much as it is competition already in the market. 
That said, absolutely do something of the sort to test the market and start to build relationships with customers. It's not going to be 100% - people that use Lbtc don't use BTMs and people that use BTMs don't use Lbtc - but it'll still give you an idea of what to expect and the cash management required to keep everything running.

Complete opposite experience here, I started selling when no one else was and built up quite the following as a result. I stopped selling a year ago and I *still* get calls and texts from people all over the country looking to buy bitcoin because they have a friend that said to go to me.

That seems like a neat option. Do you know of any instructions on how someone that's a little less tech savvy could get that set up?

There is a Coinage Robocoin in Mountain View, but it's actually at Hacker Dojo; I think that site may be just a little out of date. It's actually here:
As mentioned by there's now a Lamassu at Westfield Valley Fair now too. 
On the other side, there's a Lamassu in San Mateo at Draper University, right at the door (home to BoostVC). 
And then there's one in SF proper, at Workshop Cafe.

The company is gone; bank accounts closed, assets sold at auction a few months ago. The corporate entity may technically still exist with a law firm for document retention purposes, but there's really no hope of seeing any return.

You should contact the company that owns the machine so that they can investigate and make sure you get your transfer. Was there a phone number or email posted on the ATM, or can you Google the company name? It shouldn't be too hard to track down, and they can check into the problem for you.

I haven't looked into it closely, but I do know that Florida is extremely stringent on enforcing their MSB regulations and does consider them to cover Bitcoin. You should absolutely consult a lawyer before going any further and don't expect to be able to install a Skyhook (you're going to need to be able to do ID verification &amp; strict transaction  limits, at minimum). 
Florida [has arrested Bitcoin traders in the past]( for flaunting the law, so tread carefully.

The user in question, I assume: 
I have no experience with them personally, but they have a ton of feedback on Localbitcoins and appear to be perfectly reputable. It appears they do in-person trades and operate Bitcoin ATMs. 
The Bitcoin ATMs appear to be under the banner [Coinucopia]( and they operate Lamaussu ATMs. Those are popular machines, perfectly reputable and function as indicated: you insert cash and they send you Bitcoin (give or take some identity verification to comply with local laws).
There are many other Bitcoin ATMs in California, as can be seen on [CoinATMRadar]( Anything listed should be pretty up to date and legitimate. Just make sure there's contact info posted or online for the machine's owner and you'll be just fine.

How long ago were you a customer? They had their third party email system compromised years ago (~2012?) that leaked a bunch of emails. I think those targeted emails were just sent to that list, they've been coming intermittently for ages. It wasn't a new thing four months ago and it really wasn't really the end of the world, just annoying.

It's very difficult to get a bank account as a Bitcoin company in Canada, and even if you do get one processing customer funds through the account is out of the question. Using Vogogo let companies side step that problem, Vogogo handled the banking instead.

Also stock the machine, which probably isn't too easy for someone who's main problem is they can't find a suitable way to buy bitcoins in the first place.

It is possible to mine on a Mac, as has been mentioned. However, it's simply not worth it anymore. There isn't a single Mac that has a graphics card worth running for mining (the Mac Pro only has a 5770); any and every system will cost more in electricity to run than what will be earned mining. 
But if you just want to play with it, then by all means.
