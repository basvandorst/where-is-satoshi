Would love for that to be a topic of conversation at dinner someday...

Morpheus is that you? Seriously though, mahalo for taking the time to write this. Your calm, calculated insight is a breath of fresh air for those of us who believe in the macro vision and want to dig deeper into the space, but are reticent due to all the... hmmm. I guess the word is noise? Any further insights appreciated. Aloha.

Nice work. My wife and I are planning something like this as well. Great vehicle for teaching them a whole host of lessons as they grow and financial landscape changes. We live in exciting times. I wonder if they'll someday ask us where we were during segwit, Bcash, etc...

They've been super unreliable. They were down for that giant drop this morning. No explanation.

One trend that gives me hope is that in my experience the average adopter seems to be more experienced recently. Education is the most positive thing that can happen to crypto. It turns one time speculators (like me) into hodlers, and perhaps more importantly- believers.

Saw that madness. However, pouring over all the current coverage... I'm wondering if we will have a significant dump (ala bitcoin in former times) without a VERY serious catalyst. I've recently experienced that regular folks are beginning to understand what bitcoin means macro vision... and I wonder if the demand now is at least somewhat made up of folks who "get it". Wondering if one time speculators are becoming informed and consequently becoming believers. Like 100 percent of opinions out there, this is simply spec- but It's fun to consider.

Well earned upvote.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:35:35
Agreed. Researching best options now. Any thoughts?

Thanks for posting. A lot of us stopped using twitter a long time ago. Crazy we're not getting emails. They used to be really exceptional w CS. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:06:18
Seriously. I was joking about a forced hodl at first, but with part of my stack used as trade... right now I want to break things.

Take my money del toro.

Congrats. You "get it" already. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:32:19
Wow. You're so cool. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:37:42
In past, they've been good about plenty of advance notice for outages. Not so with this one. Makes me wonder... 
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:04:41
Can confirm. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:20:36
Can confirm. Initial giant gains turned into losing half my stack. No more. Converted HODLER. I sleep more than 30 mins at a time now and have half a life again. Crypto is great and weird.

I couldn't pay cash based on some weird rule at the bank about transferring that amount of money between accounts or account limits on spending during a 24 hour period. I was a bit foggy on details honestly. I do not often spend large sums of money. I'm not one of those guys.
Bottom line: I wasn't allowed to use my own money the way I wanted to. Which is odd and wrong, isn't it? 
On a separate note, (not you bakers dozen) it's hilarious to me the clowns on here who waste time trolling their allies in crypto instead of grasping the big idea picture of the problems with fiat I'm illustrating via a personal experience. 
Probably the same dudes who I have to tell to settle down and zoom out. 
It's all good homies. Those panties are totally going to un-bunch themselves someday. ����

Right? Lol

I hope no one. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:36:18
That wasn't my argument at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:12:59
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:06:16
Same happened to me. No stress, the recover process works. Just takes about 24 hours. That was my experience.

If memory serves, They sent me an email, I had to verify a bunch of information with them, then I was able to access without Authy. Then reset everything once I had new phone. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:02:25
Nope. Zoom out. :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:03:57
Haha. Fair point. I believe charts in crypto are effective in the way that the money who believes in charts will vote with their money at that time. In the end... it's all BS right?

Clearly defined head and shoulders easily visible beginning July 19. Goldman might be right about buying opportunities around 1700... fingers crossed.
