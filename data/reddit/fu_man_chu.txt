Reduces the fees the Filipino community here in Hawaii usually encounters when sending money back home, for starters.
For my part, I find the fact that it grants me complete control over my finances (vs. letting a bank decide what happens to them) to be a big deal too.
For anyone who has ever lost money because a bank maneuvered their charges around at a pivotal moment to create overdraft, found some technicality to exploit, or simply held your resources due to a lawsuit (IE - any hard working or wealthy man who has gone through a rough divorce)  then this capability  alone should be reason enough to look at distributed ledgers as a viable option for storing wealth.

For my money delegated proof-of-stake is the best I've seen to date. The inefficiency and overall wastefulness of PoW coupled with it's narrow distribution system make it feel outdated. That of course doesn't mean it won't still be the most popular for our entire lifetimes but PoW seems to lack the elegance and manageability of DPoS.

Yet it would still be verified by the bitcoin mining network? Because if it's not, what's the point? If a sidechain needs it's own mining it would just be an altcoin with an entry in the bitcoin ledger... la dee daa.

It takes very little time to do so in my experience and we are likely seeing just the tail end of a long sell off (which would go a long ways towards explaining the price depression we've have for months now).
At the very least we should entertain the idea that what is likely to be the largest IPO in history is a strong factor.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:09:02
From what I can gather with my limited wherewithal his problem with PoS doesn't apply to DPoS, since it no longer suffers from the technical problem of having to park resources (IE - stake tokens) to validate blocks because your delegates handle your stake while still allowing you to use your tokens freely.

I have a small start up that is going to struggle with getting funding with these kinds of regulations hanging over our heads. I mean, we can come to market and we can meet all the compliance rules but they are just driving up costs more and more. My friends and I had enough to start up on our own but suddenly needing to pay the state a $10,000 fee plus the added costs of doing a complete legal survey of the new regulations and how they will apply to our business model... suffice to say it's slowed us up considerably.

I still can't get past the idea that PoW itself is not the technology I want to be supporting. Proof of Stake, in particular Delegated Proof of Stake, seems so much better to my eyes that I find it hard to take PoW models seriously. It all seems so... wasteful to have a security model that relies on so much damned electricity and infrastructure. 
Hopefully side chains fix that and perhaps even encourage an end to the arms race endlessly ramping up network difficulty... but I lack the wherewithal to say either way right now.

Haven't wrapped my head around how a Side Chain is different than Colored Coins from a platform like Coinprism.

I'm asserting that it changes the incentive structure. Now we can debate whether that's a good, bad, or neutral change but first you have to admit that there is a change.
I'm also not suggesting miners will no longer have an incentive but rather hamstringing on chain transactions while creating incentives to move transactions off-chain is a departure for how the system operates now.
So I get that you're all hopped up on segwit but you're going to need to improve your ability to on-board people because right now... it's not entirely convincing (as evidenced by the fact that signaling has been stuck at around 25% since Dec).
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:56:04
because it turns BTC into a settlement layer and pushes Txs off-chain thereby changing the dynamics and overall incentive architecuture of Bitcoin dramatically?
Is that not a good enough reason to not want to push SegWit through in your mind?
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:55:36
This sounds AWFULLY like trickle down economics but I'll forgive that for the moment.
Bitcoin, if it was the primary store of value and currency being used would almost certainly be more egalitarian than what we have today. However, it doesn't exist in a vacuum and I suspect the already wealthy will end up hoarding it all over again.

PS: I'm here because I run a business that is hurt by the artificial restriction on blocksize.

@_date: 2017-03-05 19:34:34
Well, you personally are advocating a pivot. No single person can force a pivot but when you lend your voice to a position you are playing a role (however small) in pushing the network in that direction. Bitcoin was designed to be a peer to peer cash network. Not a settlement layer and yet you are describing it as such.
I would argue that low fees are as essential to Bitcoin as there are to any other transaction model. This becomes especially true if, like me, you are hoping Bitcoin will help bank the unbanked of the world. Many of whom live off of 2 dollars or less a day (meaning the fees are too high by a VERY wide margin). 
Also, it sounds awfully like you are advocating for new companies to come in and act as trusted third parties for BTC transactions in order to get Tx fees lower. Am I hearing you correctly there? 
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:30:29
If you were an entrepreneur you'd understand that you have to take the most pragmatic route and solve problems you have today. Not invest energy in the problems of tomorrow. That's a really easy way to watch your company die.
And segwit seems to create far more technical debt than a linear blocksize increase would. So your assertion that you know for certain what needs to be done "correctly" is a bit presumptuous. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:13:51
suggesting that someone simply mentioning "engineers" makes it a technical question... why does it still amaze me that dullards exist?
The economics of the situation are speaking pretty loud and clear at the moment. Money talks (IE: money invested in hashing power) and bullshit that Adam Back says can walk.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:12:02
Except we are now advocating building layers on top of that final settlement. Is cash still as useful if you need to pass it through a bank before you can access it?
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:34:25
well for market purposes it will only create sell pressure if the person receiving it converts it into another currency. So that's a kind of important difference.
More to the point, normal consumption will likely not cancel out the high level of wealth stratification the system has. That would require a major shake-up of some sort.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:59:35
I'm suggesting that I have and I don't see any evidence to suggest that a currency with a capped supply (while preferable) is an agent for leveling wealth stratification or creating a more even distribution of said currency overall.
Gold tends to get hoarded by the wealthy, upper class. Bitcoin will likely go the same route (I just plan on going with it). 
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:39:33

@_date: 2017-03-20 07:50:04
This wasn't a technical discussion, nor was Adam Back making a technical assertion. He is discussing a pivot (a term used by entrepreneurs, not engineers) which is more about positioning the product or service for the best possible outcome... I'm asserting that he's not an entrepreneur or at the very least not a seasoned one.
I also disagree with his assertion that following Satoshi's original scaling plan pivots the network in anyway. His team, and by proxy his dubious backing from the legacy financial system, are actually the ones proposing to pivot Bitcoin by moving network scaling away from on-chain Tx's into something altogether new and unseen.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:38:20

@_date: 2017-03-04 17:43:00
Right but when the gold standard existed and/or before bank notes when trading actual gold was a thing... did it reduce wealth stratification?
That's the only example I can think of where we were using something with a capped supply as money but I don't recall ever hearing anything to suggest it reduces wealth stratification. So unless you have evidence to suggest it does, that's an awfully big assumption you are making.

I believe your math is off there. Last I checked the theoretical Tx limit per MB was ~10 Tx/s with the lower bound rate being a little over 5 Tx/s. 32mb should in theory give us closer to 160 to 320 Tx/s. 
Not an end game solution but would certainly help scale the system *today* vs creating a need for there to be new companies building new applications.
I'm not categorically against layer 2 scaling but it seems things are out of order. We need on-chain scaling today to buy us time to take a proper look at layer 2 technologies. I've already seen proposals for scaling methods that are arguably better than Segwit, yet we havn't even had a chance to discuss any of them because the network is in crisis mode. Routinely having an excessive amount of Txs stuck in the mempool has not been fun yet Segwit would not solve that problem (it opens up the *possibility* of solving it later instead).

Im suggesting that A) any viable currency with a capped supply gets hoarded, which in turn means B) consumption won't be high enough to combat wealth stratification.
They are different concepts but they are interelated, none the less.
A currency needs to have a more egalitarian distribution model in order to really combat wealth stratification is ultimately my larger assertion.

You... you really aren't listening. 
You keep confusing *distribution model* with *re-distribution of wealth*. I really can't help you if you can't wrap your head around the fact that those are two very different things...
Bitcoin has a distribution model. I explained it in my last post. What you THINK about it doesn't change that it has a very clear and very distinct distribution model. But please do not confuse that for the the socialist concept of "re-distribution of wealth".

Again, a greater user base would create more fees and greater overall gains long term for miners. So shooting yourself in the foot for short term gains by accepting a backlog is a bad business strategy.
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:13:15
Short term price gains do not indicate anything substantive. Price is up but are you 100% confident this is as high as it could be right now if we had wide-scale user adoption?
We are talking about the big prize, about getting BTC to rival the size of national economies. Something you will not be able to do without attracting large institutional investors. 
Also if you are hoping to get BTC to mirror SWIFT or WU you are again looking in the wrong direction. We want to replace those networks by being BETTER, not by repeating the mistakes of the past.
And again you are looking at short-term price adjustments as an indicator to answer a much larger more important question. That's a very amateurish move and something you should refrain from doing.
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:01:53
we hit the transaction limit numerous times in 2016, which has slowed BTCs user adoption rate which in turn impacts price... is it really that hard for you to understand that adoption is a good thing and that artificially keeping the amount of transactions we are willing to take on per block (IE: blocksize) limits adoption?
They even went so far as to have the main antagonist explain exactly this point in an episode of Mr. Robot....
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:17:14
...where to begin. Assets are a component of wealth but are not wealth per se. 
More important to our discussion, *all* economies have a distribution model. The US economy mostly uses the Fed banking window and the money multiplier to distribute wealth but it does distribute wealth on a very regular basis (just not to guys like you or me).
The Bitcoin blockchain distributes tokens (aka: digital assets) to miners at X per 10 minutes who then are free to do with it as they see fit. That's BTC's distribution model.
How you are confusing an economies distribution model (IE: any of the above) with the socialist concept of "re-distribution of wealth" is beyond me. Aside from the fact that they both use the word "distribution" they are rather far removed from one another.
Now, having said that a system that utilizes automated distribution of resources with no leader is something that is not only possible it is inevitable (I am being paid beaucoup bucks to build such a system, in fact). None of the above requires "force" or the need to re-distribute any existing assets or wealth, though.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:06:35
Money on a fixed inflation rate, via an immutable ledger, that also happens to be borderless while riding on a permissionless network is somewhat more than an irrelevant curiosity.
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:09:10
That is more a result of market forces, the legacy system, and national currencies own fluctuation than it is BTCs model. The inflation rate is still fixed and,as time goes on that will become more apparent.

Bitcoin has a distribution model but that is just one way of handling the incentive system. There are many others and we will continue to see more as the space develops.

You are confusing the distribution model of an asset with *re-distribution of wealth. They are not the same thing.
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:36:10
By thinking of new users as "cheap skates" you are entirely missing the point. Slowing the adoption rate of BTC reduces buy pressure which hampers it's marketcap growth. It also reduces the network effect which can in turn attract bigger, institutional players. 
You are missing the big prize in exchange for a piddling bump in transaction fees. 
A single institutional investor, lured by the dramatic adoption rate of the bitcoin network, alone could quadruple the marketcap of BTC without breaking a sweat... yet here you are arguing for that double digit BTC fee...
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:04:36

Just to play devil's advocate... the opposite side of this argument; the one suggesting r/bitcoin is being heavily censored, that there seems to be a strong push to create off-chain scaling so third parties can extract more fees, and that the AXA connection is troubling to say the least... does hold water from where Im sitting.
@_date: 2016-11-01 18:58:02
feel like they are getting ahead of the game by too much there. Transaction fees will surely be greater with a larger user base and keeping blocks small now has hampered adoption.

I can name of at least 6 instances in my personal activity over the course of a single month in which users were turned off by their transactions taking too long and claimed they wouldn't be using BTC anymore. I can name another 2 dozen in which I had to talk people down and explain that everything was fine during such periods, in the hopes of keeping them as clients.

When I say re-write the white paper I mean they intend to take the BTC network away from the declared use and design as layed out in the white paper. That's something everyone in blockstream and by proxy everyone in Core have been pushing for. They don't see full blocks as a problem, they don't see high Txs fees as a problem, and they are making design changes to the network which don't align with the white papers central focus (IE: BTC as peer to peer digital cash).
Is it any wonder there's a massive schism when the developers decide to suddenly shift the entire network in a new direction without on boarding the miners or end users?
PS: the hashrate signalling for bigger blocks is higher than the hashrate signalling for segwit. You can't declare the market for bigger blocks to be dead or small in the face of that data set.

@_date: 2017-04-24 17:31:14
Im okay with 2nd layer scaling... but not if we are hamstringing on chain scaling. Saying on-chain scaling "is impossible" is not a convincing argument, especially since we've been scaling on-chain this whole time. A moderate blocksize increase while we get 2nd layer options up and running is the most sensible way forward but everyone on team Blockstream has refused that approach with a casual air of dismissiveness for what the market and miners have been asking for this whole time.
That kind of blatant disregard for the people providing BTC's infrastructure is quite disconcerting. 
Also, only professional miners should be maintaining full mining nodes. That was how Satoshi laid out the network design in the first place. So, the same people who said Bitcoin couldn't be done are now re-writing the white paper... that too is disconcerting, to say the least.
And if they are hoping to avoid contentious hardforks then they should open their fucking ears because the market has been clamoring for a solution to the artificial blocksize limit. IF they refuse to offer what the market wants they are creating the conditions for a contentious hardfork.

Really? You think you're going to run the network without the miners? That piddly little GPU you got going to pick up the slack of 100s of millions of dollars in ASIC Hashing power?
And the miners create the infrastructure of the network. If that wasn't the case we wouldn't even be stuck at this impasse.
And short of getting the majority of the hashing power on your side, you're not changing anything. That's the whole point of Satoshi's vision but I guess you know better.

Proof that mining pools are not a "few data centers"? Do you seriously need me to hold your hand through that?
[We currently have roughly a dozen mining pools holding 5% hashrate or more]( None of which would be impacted by a blocksize increase and of those dozen pools each, in turn, is made up of hundreds of other smaller mining operations pushing their hashrate into a "pool" to increase their odds of success. They are NOT a single mining operation under one roof though and if anyone has told you that you've been sorely misled.

Right but it's still their network and a smart player would learn to negotiate with them in such a manner that everyone gets what they want. They signed the HK agreement which had very specific negotiating points which weren't honored by the core developers... kind of a non-starter in the business world and like it or not... it's still their network. They own the silica, they are paying the electricity bill and in fact the network was designed so that the MINERS create consensus. Without them all you've got is a fancy data base so, as evidenced by the fact that the core developers (for all their power and influence) can't get shit across the finish line without miner cooperation.
Then again maybe deadlock is the whole point. I can't think of any other reason to not include a straightforward blocksize increase (which Segwit definitely is not).
@_date: 2017-04-09 23:34:23

Changing PoW means you are creating an altcoin as far as most will be concerned. I'll support the alt but I won't call it Bitcoin because it won't meet the requirement of having the longest/most work chain via PoW.

He said "data centers", he didn't reference the exact style of silica the data centers would have but why would he need to do that in order for his point to stand? At some point all the mining was always meant to be done by larger scale professional miners which is exactly where we've arrived.
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:16:38
Except miners ARE users, power users in fact. So they get a very big say, in fact the FIRST and LAST say in the state of the network.
We as market participants can vacate by selling off our holdings but there are plenty of other participants who will want cheap tokens from the longest, most work chain (myself included). So you're still going to run into the problem of miners dictating the action.
@_date: 2017-04-24 08:43:56
14 cents here... still kicking myself over that one. My only comfort is that everyone has stories like that in this space.

and we are bound to their network. This idea that we can just take the network from them is absurd.
@_date: 2017-04-24 09:49:28
If they are keeping the network secure via their contribution of hashing power, then they are contributing to consensus.
And I still haven't seen core produce code that would provide a sensible solution to the need for on chain scaling nor heard a sensible answer as to why they are so resistant to a blocksize increase. So it's all a moot point from where I'm sitting.
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:27:22
That's the clincher though, because I know plenty of big players that will continue to trade on the longest PoW chain, no matter what. I may trade on both personally but Im definitely not giving up the one with the most hashing power since that is ultimately where BTC derives its value.
And yes, that is the invisible hand but it's actually invisible and you seem pretty confident you can see it anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:03:42
consensus is determined by hashing power creating the longest chain... am I seriously the only one here who read the white paper?
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:48:08
I have the easiest answer to that. I just HODL everything, no matter what happens. Chain split just means I have tokens on both chains for me.

Changing PoW is highly radical and will, at the very least, be fully opposed by the entire current mining infrastructure... in other words the entire network will opppose PoW changes for obvious reasons. The network is Bitcoin, Bitcoin is the network.

I strongly disagree that the entities that are securing the network currently are bad actors. They've been asking for the centrally planned development team over at core to raise the block size for years. The fact that they weren't given what they wanted when they clearly have the most invested and the most to lose is all you need to know to understand why we are at a deadlock.
You can't tell people who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into your infrastructure that you aren't going to take their input. If the core developers were entrepreneurs they'd understand that.

Any Proof of Stake system will have it's incentives set differently. The Bitshares Delegated Proof of Stake system (which is the most sophisticated solution I've been able to find) actually shares it's incentives with the entire network, instead of allowing miners to hoard tokens.
If you want other examples of blockchain usage that don't even utilize it for the typical cryptocurrency app look at Nasdaq's recent blockchain based token system and IBMs blockchain based internet of things. Both powerful uses of a blockchain that have nothing to do with Bitcoin, which I will remind everyone is simply one APPLICATION running on a blockchain. It may be the most popular, you can even argue that it's the best if you want, but what you shouldn't do is stick your head in the sand and pretend it's the ONLY one. I see a lot of BTC advocates take this dangerously myopic position and it seems silly in the face of the vast array of options available.
It'd be a bit like saying "you can't separate Netscape and the internet, they are both the same" when clearly that is not the case. We already have hundreds, if not thousands, of blockchain applications in existence. To say there is only one is, as I said, dangerously misguided.

Kind of a big point they seem to be overlooking...

because banks like JPmorgan get free money from the Fed Banking window, endlessly inflating the currency at our expense. If we decide not to play along anymore the money he gets from that window will have less and less purchasing power.
We are threatening their entire power base really.

I've been running an old version that has been really stable. Whether or not that opens me up to malware (or whether these old versions quite simply ARE malware) I am not qualified to say.

I made the switch... and then had to switch back. For some reason, no matter how hard I tried to configure it properly qB was dramatically slower than uT. It made no sense to me but sadly that's how it worked out in a side by side comparison.

You're conveniently leaving out both the intrinsic and economic value of a human life. Roughly 800,000 deaths multiplied by the intrinsic value (which is really incalculable but the court systems generally place it around the 2mil mark) plus a lifetime of economic output, PLUS the loss of productivity  and damages incurred by family members... even under the most cruel of calculus' one would have to conclude it's not even close...
This is before we even begin to discuss the sheer stupidity it takes to write something like that but then again... we are talking about the article which is ultimately playing into the authors hands.

You have no economy without a secure ledger and you can't secure a ledger without the miners. Holding any fork of BTC without the miners support makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:04:06
You've got that exactly backwards, as evidenced by both the design and history of Bitcoin.

sad but true

And also hardly accurate, relevant, or clever. It's just bad writing at the end of the day.

Failing to scale the network is a feature?
@_date: 2016-07-21 07:13:40
Well I'm not saying it's all bad, I'm simply suggesting that from an outsiders perspective (say someone who wants to invest in the space) watching the vitriol that surfaces from a discussion about scaling the network is somewhat less than confidence building.
I mean, we all know this market (at it's current stage) is not for the type of investor that is going to be bothered by that sort of thing... but it's simultaneously leaving a lot of money on the table for ANYONE holding BTC.
@_date: 2016-07-22 08:42:52
I agree that we will eventually scale but that doesn't mean there hasn't been a loud and contentious debate about scaling in a more timely fashion. When visible, well-respected players are publically exiting the market citing specifics related to the scaling issue, even if they are entirely wrong, it in turn creates bad optics... that's a flaw even if the technical solution is right around the corner.

Just to play devils advocate we should list the actual flaws the system currently has. 
For starters, bitcoin can only handle 7 transaction per second and any attempt to work on that is met with a pretty serious and daunting backlash.
