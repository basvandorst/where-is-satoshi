I love the standard retarded attack that if bitcoin was worth a million all miner would spend 12 million every 10 minutes to mine a block lol
I guess entrepreneurs build business, those who can’t write articles about how entrepreneurs are stupid.

I know, but as a wallet user it really helps to understand the costs of a transaction.
It helps to understand if it makes sense to send a 0.01 BTC at the moment. Absolute values aren’t as good for that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:13:41
Not saying that should be implied only that provide a user with that information helps an user, I should have made that clearer.
An user has to input the amount he wants to send and the fee level/amount. Some wallets calculate the FIAT equivalent for the amount being transferred, and well for the fee, to help the user. It would also help to see what’s the percentage amount of the fee so that a user can evaluate how much is spending in fees.

Search on GitHub and you will find a ton of projects. For what to contribute really depends on what languages you know (c++, JS, Python)

I think that’s a crime...

Pretty sure it’s the same, cash advance always got extra commissions.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:03:29
Not how that works.
In the case of a charge back:
* Customer requests a charge back - is refunded totally
* Issuer requests to VISA a charge back - looses operational costs (call center to receive customer call)
* VISA alters Merchant balance/perform a transfer reversal (automated process)
* Merchant looses money
Only if Merchant disputes the charge back then the issuer/customer may loose money. The Merchant is also liable for Chargebacks commissions if I’m not mistaken.
Cash advance has higher commissions because you can’t reverse a transaction. Coinbase seems to have move that path, not allowing charges backs so it gets more expensive.

Currently neither people or companies facilitate that because government is there.
No one wants to pay for anything so if there’s a government people just excuse themselves with, talk to the government official to fix that.
In a free market people would be more used to pay for “shared property” like a road. Even there would be more companies assisting managing those properties. 
You would call a company stating your issue with that private road and ask for mediation and management support. Since such company would be professional in such service they would more easily get a quote for the service in the road and convince your neighbor to chip in.
It’s not all roses but having a free market for those services will grow an industry around that.

Still, keep an eye on tax authority and parliament, they will change that for sure.

Just because I haven’t seen it mentioned but I don’t know any organizations by name.
You might want to support journalism projects made those who really want to do journalism and not partisan propaganda.
Journalism worldwide is not in good shape and some journalists are trying crowdfunding for their activities.

Any links to this guy/company work?
Seems an interesting approach to pricing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:02:19
It’s both, but keep in mind what futures contracts really offer - risk reduction.
I buyer wants to reduce the risk of bitcoin losing value - buys a contract to receive bitcoin in 3 months at 11k$ with a 1k$ premium. This will signal to the market that a seller, which is risking is own money, predicts that bitcoin will be lower than 12k€ in 3 months. 
Traders on BTC/USD will see that as an indicator that what expect price is and react.
Overtime, reaching to end of that contract, BTC/USD has moved up and down and now being closer to that date the future’s will know better if that contract might earn them a profit (because the market price is higher) or a loss and sell it at discount.
So yeah... both ways
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:29:41
So many bubble-coins coming out xD
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:50:10
That’s why they don’t play at future markets xD
The price will likely rise after a probable correction in 18th of December. Future contracts, sold on 18th of December, will price bitcoin at lower or equal value in 3 months which will scare must of amateur traders, which will scare distracted people. Even If they price it a small increase that might cause markets to drop on 18th of December.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:42:57
Bitcoin to serve its purpose must be valuable for must of the world, this helps to bring that recognition.
It changes the game and will bring down volatility since futures contracts provide also guide price expectations. Lower volatility will invite more conservative people into it.
This will help a lot.

Of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:07:21
You buy an BTC/USD future contract and you know you will receive an amount of dollars in 3 months corresponding to 10 BTCs. In 3 months you know you have the money to buy 10 BTCs if you want to.
Day 1 give USD to buy future BTC/USD
Day 90 receive 1 million USD
Day 90 buy 10 bitcoins
As long the USD/BTC has liquidity future contracts, even when settled in USD, will reduce risks of USD based companies when working with BTC.

The take of the article is to understand that unlike in the West, in China people are really used to use digital payment system.
You can imagine the same being true in the West but using Bitcoin.

[BIPS 0174]( seems very interesting to improve "hot wallets" security and even in the case of exchanges' wallets.

They’re taking about personal value risky and market capitalization risk. In both perspective vs FIAT hacking is a bigger risk than in crypto.
Imagine one of the three biggest getting hack. Just the headlines are enough to destroy a lot of value.

They were doing an implementation of bitcoin protocol in c# at the same time they were doing the stratis platform and coin.

Not really a question but don't you think you need more videos showing how to the BitPay Wallet?
(I'm trying it out and I can't find a single video of someone using the app.)
Also, what's your exchange rate on BitPay Card?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:43:52
No, just more people coming to bitcoin and buying them. Merchant adoption actually has decreased due to high fees. When we have off chain payments it will get better but not for now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:52:47
Bitcoin was born before the so called net neutrality, lived through its short life, and will keep on living.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:22:19


You're painting the scenario where ISPs were the danger, I think governments is a way bigger risk than ISPs.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:51:00
Remember your cry for government “help” when they go after bitcoin.

We have bitcoin nodes on satellites baby :p
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:43:14
Why do you thing we have bitcoin blockchain updates from satellites?
PS: NetNeutrality doesn’t stop any government from declaring bitcoin illegal and requiring ISPs to block it.

I would think dealers would much prefer cash to bitcoin.
