This problem wouldn't have arised if we used decentralised platform instead of centralised ones like these...
Time to adopt decentralised platforms and boycott centralised assholes...
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:59:47
Its already happening, BTC FUTURES, BTC ETF, ETH FUTURES....these will help in mass adoption...
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:56:36
Bitcoin is limited, it is a great investment asset, it is a great store of value, it is the father of all cryptos, its price will increase a lot with Mass adoption...Volatility will be there cuz it has limited supply...
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:22:11
It will get approved but not on Sep 30
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:44:28
Just deny the CBOE etf and crash the market...I wanna buy more....
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:37:03
Are you referring to Bitcoin or Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:12:34
We are still in early adoption considering the total market cap is around $0.2 trillion...
We can reach $2000 trillion dollars market cap in future...
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:34:08
They are from an entire different generation of paper money, they are looking at cryptos from a money making ponzi scheme and think it's a bubble, they don't have a clue that crypto has evolved to be the money of the internet, this is the money of the digital world...

The house always wins, I say we invest in exchanges from now...
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:00:26
Then you are dreaming...

Andreas Antonopoulos: "Your Keys, Your Bitcoin. Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin"
Never trust these Banks and their products...
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:29:04
I am sorry for your loss, I hope this will be a big lesson for everyone cuz in the end no matter how good trader you are, one simple mistake like this can ruin the whole wealth, I always cross check the receiving address 10 times before sending the assets even if the asset is saved in my wallet...
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:01:31
They are well established now than 50 years back, Bitcoin will be well established in future, lets become early adopters and not worry about already established services...
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:38:06
We can create our own exchange?
@_date: 2018-09-11 23:39:30
The poor performance in september for this year is the result of the upcoming etf, people believe that it will be denied and the market will crash, so they are waiting to buy back in October for the Bakkt hype
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:55:40
Oh ok, so they have developed a software which gives the same mining output without compromising CPU power for other tasks...it's good.
@_date: 2018-09-18 01:17:57
Or may be it is because the difficulty is increasing and u need to invest more to get more?
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:10:00
The main feature of blockchain is transparency
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:35:43
This is what happens when money is handled by greedy corporations...
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:39:36
They know the bottom is near...
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:35:51
What is Bitcoin core? Is it a new scam coin?
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:39:20
Please buy after ETF is denied on Sep 30, you get more BTC for $25000 than today
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:18:28
What will happen to Bitcoin if bitmain shuts down
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:35:14
Oh lol...he was referring to his first trade...
@_date: 2018-09-13 08:24:42
This is a very old video and are you trying to fud now???
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:40:37
I need to play a game to mine or just run the software
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:02:31
Every country will launch their own fiat stable digital coin and Bitcoin will trade against them in near future...
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:53:03
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:41:28
Please buy after Sep 30 when the ETF gets denied, You get more BTC for 20K than today
@_date: 2018-09-26 04:13:21
All these developments are needed, average human cannot handle and secure these assets, they need to find some big organisation to manage their funds...
If you say not your keys not your bitcoins then why are all these centralised exchanges still working and growing more and more...
Also it's a choice...bitcoin will be adopted more if big players join...
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:44:33
BTC 4k End of year, 2K in 2019. Thanks me later.
@_date: 2018-08-25 09:41:04
I think the MTGOX motherfuckers sold at 20K, bought back a lot at 6K and refunding in BTC
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:44:44
Yeah as if they will tell their secrets...
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:22:03
Invested 50K now it's 4K
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:20:04
Petro doesnt have limited supply?
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:08:38
The op is asking direct BTC purchases not Fiat...
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:34:08
Why would a potential game breaking opportunity DM Instagram users, they will be chasing rich people for investments. It's a total scam.
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:21:07
Bitcoin broke 19k long back, this is not surprising, come back with a post when it breaks 40k...
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:03:14
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:08:05
Yeah and at this pace looks like I will be hodling for my grand kids...cuz I will be too old by then to reap the benefits...pump it pleaseeeeee
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:38:20
From the past 9 years which expert has said anything accurately?
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:11:50
Why would anyone spend 2000 BTC now when the bull run is near...
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:27:46
Yes my biggest mistake was to HODL when the majority was selling it away.
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:58:14
Because BTC is an advanced version of GOLD thus BTC is Digital Gold. Also gold supply is not limited, BTC is.
Would you still use DOS or Windows 10.

Depression, Anxiety &amp; Panic Attacks
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:05:42
Yeah in India it's just $2 and we can get it without prescription cuz it doesn't work at least not on me. It is no wonder drug like it is advertised, Adderall , Ritalin are better I think cuz I can't get them here without prescription.
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:38:02
Started at that time and got burnt in alts.
@_date: 2018-08-12 19:28:10
I can buy modafinil 10 tabs at $2.
I tried it and it doesn't work as they say. It only gives headache.
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:42:32
The more they print the dollars the more they devalue their currency and the more BTC gets adopted. Venezuela is an example.
@_date: 2019-03-15 22:28:55
Fake volume, most of it is wash trading...
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:27:49
yes even i wanna know an app which can prevent losses.
@_date: 2018-10-12 06:35:45
Sorry not about stop losses, I wanted an app to use trailing profits
@_date: 2018-10-09 18:59:41
is this kind of spam?
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:00:00
Everytime a coin is listed on new exchange, the price goes up like 20 30 40 %, since we know Bakkt is gonna launch with BTC trading and futures options, we will see the price rise, so buy now
@_date: 2018-10-09 05:22:19
or it could be a massive bubble...
@_date: 2018-10-09 07:03:13
The tech is awsome, but the coin may not survive that long and will become a legacy...
We will move on to next generation coins and chains...
BTC will be obsolete and become history...
@_date: 2019-02-22 05:41:03
Dont worry, they waiting for a dump to 1K so that you can buy more BTC...
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:38:50
It's common sense, the reward is lowered so miners will put double effort which increases difficulty which increase production cost which increases price of BTC...
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:07:04
We need a bubble coin...
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:03:11
Guys no one uses Kotak Mahindra in India...
Major banks are HDFC, ICICI, Axis and they have no problem with crypto...
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:51:09
1 hour ago I bought BTC worth $1000, everything is working smooth and fine here, except the banks directly work with exchanges and also no one gives a shit about Kotak here...
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:31:00
As expected and in September it will be denied causing huge crash
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:38:55
Koinex has launched Loop P2P. I used it last week and it's better than trading.
Coindelta launched Flux P2P yesterday.
You can also buy BTC from localbitcoins.com/india
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:11:59
People would be paying more than 10900 for 1 BTC soon, so it doesn't matter, it's still cheap...
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:31:34
Obviously no.
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:17:05
SCAM ALERT GUYS
Do not send ur BTC to that exchange, they want to scam you
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:56:52
The biggest hint is the open advertising of this opportunity...if someone is already making huge profit then why would he reveal it to others and take a hit on his profits...
The only purpose to reveal this is to attract innocent traders and hack their BTC
The fact is you are also one of them
SCAM ALERT...
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:11:31
I have no idea how people who don't know anything about crypto are trying to buy BTC at this price...what made u interested in it and also you are so lucky to enter crypto at these prices...
I started buying only because it was making news and going up or else I would have never even come across crypto...
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:04:35
Market will reverse when Bakkt gets physical btc futures approval
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:44:04
Yes, it's a scam...they will hack your BTC once u send them to their exchange...
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:45:06
Yes, it's a scam website...
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:40:24
Guys noone shares such opportunity, the author looks like the admin of the website and he will scam us if we deposit BTC in that website...
Scam Alert...
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:02:03
They are down in $ value, but up in satoshi value...
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:45:06
So, till when they wanna block your account?
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:11:30
Funds are SAFU...
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:14:04
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:07:37
I hope the market stays low till 2021, cant afford to buy more BTC at 50K than at 3K
