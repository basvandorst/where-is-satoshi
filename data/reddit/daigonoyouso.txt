the lesson everyone like you should learn; there are ppl who make living by trading/lending money on these exchanges, it's quite IMPOSSIBLE to do so if they are sitting in an offline wallet, isn't it? comments like this really, really make me insane as it seems like you, dumb people, can't simply understand that

that video gave me cancer

how does the peer confirm that he received the EUR? what if he won't confirm and my money are lost ?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:11:19
try dipping it in a water every now and then

the online calculators are sort of accurate when mining with 100% luck, but only some of them count electricity cost as well, 100GH/s will make you about 7 cents a day if you have no maintenance fee and a little bit less every 2 weeks, unless the difficulty drops

just out of curiosity, I had ~11 BTC in there, open trade with liquidation @ ~566 (however this is not really correct, as at 566 it would be roughly 50% of my wallet amount) what does this really mean for me? were all positions closed at 18:00 UTC (~600$) or only some? am I ever gonna see some substitute for this (and in case my btc were stolen as well), or are my coins lost forever?

you might stop calling people dumb when you don't understand their reason behind this
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:49:35
I'd like to add that you actually do not receive anything to a wallet, but rather one of many addresses produced by that wallet seed
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:29:58
it's not only about exchange, it's about trading, they allowed margin trading and margin funding, that's where I lost all my coins
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:05:40
trading with leverage has been my main income for years now, so yeah, not gonna happen
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:51:10
I'd say it affects only BTC users
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:16:58
does it support ledger unplugged?
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:16:45
ETH/ETC/Alt holders didn't lose anything, did they? the hacker stole only BTC, other currencies were unaffected
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:51:42
I guess they'll be taking every BTC they have currently available (from all users) and spread it evenly based on % among everyone who lost their BTC
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:31:32
another one, mine went there :(

what if I want to use their platform for margin trading and/or margin funding? oh yes, you didn't think about this, did you? I'm getting sick of these posts, do you really think people are that stupid to use exchange as a wallet? that being said, I lost over 11 BTC (basically everything and more than an average yearly salary in my country) yesterday and I'm not even mad, the guy kind of deserved it for finding such a flaw in bitfinex system.. money come and go, it always has been like that and it always will be

isn't S5 like the second best miner out there? first one being S7 ofc, I haven't found a better miner (energy/GHs ratio) out there (that actually exists and is not in "pre-order while in development")
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:16:31
ye, I forgot this is about USB miners, had antminers in mind

I giggled

small miners die only if the price stops growing

as mentioned several times, bitcoin always had transaction fees and Visa, MC and other charge MUCH MUCH MUCH higher fees than bitcoin does and there are no third parties involved in any transaction... miners don't really handle the fees, they just receive it as a reward without knowing where that fee came from or what it was used to pay for... just for fun, this is the first big transaction I could catch at blockchain, it's almost 3000$ and the fee was 0.09$ ( now tell me, with which other payment option would you or customer pay only 9 cents while purchasing something for almost 3k? (0.00003 % fee!!!) the fees are absolutely negligibly... in the most recent block ( there were 2524 transactions with total of 1.4M$ worth of BTC sent, with total transaction fees of 250.73$... that is LITERALLY average of 0.00017484606478676754270428417489 % transaction fee per transaction, if this is too much for you then everything is and you should stop running any business

purely depends on btc price, also what doesn't cover energy bill might be thousands of $$ in few years
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:23:13
only to customers that buy in bulk, also it's advertised as 110TH/s, so I guess it won't be near the price of S7, therefore only miners that started long time ago will be able to get this
@_date: 2015-12-31 07:01:42


not sure about other wallets, but with electrum you can do just that... that's one of the ways I backed up my wallet - copied the file to an old USB that's now just sitting in a box somewhere, also encrypted and uploaded to some private online storages
@_date: 2015-12-19 11:54:40
it really doesn't matter if you're small or huge miner as long as you have proper equipment (even antminer s4 is fine with current price) and your electricity price is not insane
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:53:09
i'm kinda laughing at that dude claiming quantum computers will break bitcoin in 1-3 years (from now)
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:16:52
I used electrum, it's been almost 24 hours, it is "high priority" and is stuck unconfirmed since 15k txs
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:20:30
your best shot would be to visit your local legal office and ask them
@_date: 2016-12-29 07:23:55
be wary of bitcoin apps for phones, there's many phishing apps out there
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:29:37
isn't this the thing that predicted end of the world in 2012?
@_date: 2016-07-31 17:05:29
i'm using cex.io, I'm not sure why, I just found it one day when I was looking for a way to buy bitcoin and I've been using it ever since, didn't have problem with them so far
@_date: 2016-07-24 01:06:05
what exactly is the "advance" fee? whenever you deposit using CC they charge 3.5% fee + 25 cents, I'm not sure whether that is for all countries and all credit cards, but I'm from EU and using Visa, no other fees
