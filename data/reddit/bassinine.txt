there's really nothing to agree or disagree with. this is just basic linguistics, not an opinion. 
edit: 
slang: a type of language that consists of words and phrases that are regarded as very informal, are more common in speech than writing, and *are typically restricted to a particular context or group of people*.

i see now that you really just have no fucking idea how the english language works, i mean, you can't even comprehend how a word has multiple usage and that's about as basic as it gets.
so good luck, i'd suggest reading up on the subject instead of arguing about something that you have literally no understanding of.

no, you're wrong, and linguists really don't care what you personally think constitutes 'inventing' a word.  
i studied linguistics and shakespeare in college and have a degree in professional writing - i'd know.

nobody that knows anything about shakespeare thinks he personally made up thousands of words - he was just the first to utilize the lower class's slang words.
because his audience included everything from peasants to kings, now everyone knew these poor slang words instead of just poor people, which means they're not slang anymore if they're known and used by all speakers. 
that's what it means to have invented a word, bringing it from class/regional dialect to the official dictionary. 
also, shakespeare's vocab is estimated to be 65k, not 30k.

i know what your opinion is. i'm telling you that in the field of linguistics that's not really what inventing means.
without shakespeare that slang would have died out hundreds of years ago, instead he popularized the terms and carried them from middle to modern english - hence inventing them.
you're hung up on the word 'inventing' and incorrectly assuming that the word has only that one particular usage - this is something that studying linguistics could clear up for you. i enjoyed linguistics a ton actually, changes how you perceive language - and with 'the death of language' that's going on right now i can't recommend it enough.

simple google search shows invent usage includes 'be the originator of.' 
originator definition: a person who creates or initiates something.
shakespeare 'initiated' the process of those words changing from slang middle english words to official modern english words, by being the first to document them and share them with people of all classes and dialects (as opposed to only the low class). therefore, according to the dictionary, it is perfectly acceptable saying that he invented those words.
so yeah, you weren't trying hard enough.

if you really want to know the answer to these questions how about research it and study linguistics? and once you're an expert in the field you can propose changing how linguists classify words, and how they credit people inventing them. 
i don't like lawyer jargon, but i'm not a lawyer - therefore i'm not going to tell them to stop using those words in the way that they currently use them, because it's really not up to me.

eth is higher than usual right now, but still on average 10-20x smaller fees than btc - this will change in a few months i imagine when eth introduces plasma, which will allow up to 1 million transactions per second.

yeah, intrinsic means that something gives itself value without the need for people or outside forces to give it value. us currency has no intrinsic value, because without people believing it has value then it would be worthless. 
gold has intrinsic value in the sense that it's rare, does not corrode, and conducts heat and electricity well - it's own properties give it value, not people.

so if everything is going so well, why do you come across so bitter?
