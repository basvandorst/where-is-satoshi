Sure, I agree that we need to take the trading volume into account. Sorry, I made a mistake, I apologize. But it doesn’t change the point. 
At some point people will start realizing the gain they sort of made (made on paper). And it will happen much faster than the word wide acceptance of digital currency as a unique payment instrument (that is likely to happen at some point but not on these terms).
In fact I have trouble imagining a government to let this happen and to loose control over the money. And then why BTC? Why not LTC, not ETH, z cash or any other random XYZ? Why some piece of code is worth more than the other. 
It is only defined by popularity, nothing more. Popularity will end when appreciation stops and people start loosing money. And then it will all crash. It might even become cyclical. People tend to love effortless gains. Guilty, I’ve realized some gain too. Of course I’d love to realize more.

Well. From what I see you are far more into technology than into finance. I don’t see a point to continue the argument. Time will tell.

So what is price? Isn’t it money someone paid (inflow)? Oh are you implying that someone ended up with the money? Right, but he did pay smth before too? Dig currency Mcap is a savings account owned by millions of people, btc are just points for participation that grow in quantity far slower then the total money balance.
Appreciation slowing down will be obvious for anyone who follows price and I assume most that bought btc or other currency do.
I don’t have a good enough estimation for the peak price or Mcap and the timing to be able to successfully defend them, so I won’t share it not be booooed here even more.

What will happen when btc reaches the peak, 100k for instance? Or there is no peak?
6m was just a short time interval which will most likely change nothing in terms of btc everyday utility to compare to price jump from 3k to 15k in the last 4 months or so.

I agree it carries value. I agree it will find a place. It’s also true that the block chain technology can be used to solve various problems. 
But the value is much less than the price today. LTC or ETH or any other XYZ currency can be used by travelers and for payments, given the infrastructure. BTC is not a unique asset and can be replicated use vise indefinitely.
Re Ponzi - I’m not saying it was created with this intend in mind. I’m saying it’s where it’s heading to. And it will end up like Ponzi though it sound rough as of today.

Thank you for the reply!

Hm. I’ll just disregard the last sentence and respond to the rest. 
It looks like a stock but not quite. Company stock  appreciates and/or pays dividends (delivers gains for investor) when the company creates value in a form of profit or profit expectations. It looses value when no profit is made and there is no expectation.
Saving 2.5% fees can be compared to profit, but if you actually are using the transfer. 99.9% of people buy btc only to gain from appreciation, not to save 2.5% on transfers they don’t make. To make it easier to understand, imagine that there is no limit on the amount of btc and its only used to save 2.5% while transferring cash. It wouldn’t appreciate in price

I think that bitcoin story will be cyclical. So you’ll have your shot :) I’m with you in the hate department :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:27:04
Plz, explain how a value is created?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:01:27
Just wondering, have anyone thought what happens when new money stop coming in?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:00:06
Most of the people buy it to profit from price appreciation not to use as currency. That’s the biggest problem
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:17:56
Thank you for you question! Firstly, I hope you agree that no value is created. Bitcoin mcap is dollars against coins nothing more. And the whole growth is fueled by new money coming in as supply of coins is limited. 
Now, I hope you do agree also that 99.9% of people buy coins because it’s appreciating in price.  At some point in future the source of new money will start depleting. 
We need more than ~$200 bln of net inflow now for Bitcoin to double in price again. New money can’t come forever. The appreciation will slow down and eventually stop when inflows equal outflows. People need to spend most of the money, can’t save everything and saving forever is useless etc. 
What happens next? The vast majority will want to realize the gain they made on paper. In order to do so bitcoin needs to be sold or used to “buy the good”. 
And I’m sure that the “buy the good” will not work because there is only a tiny portion of things people want that are available now to be bought for bitcoin. The appreciation is too fast for the infrastructure to come online in time. 
As the result some of the investors will realize gains in dollars, others will be left with Bitcoins worth less by the amount of the gains realized divided by a number of coins available at the point.
And one more idea to think about - do you think that a government will just give away the control over such a powerful monetary mechanism as currency and just step aside? I doubt it

It’s a shame, that you are sure
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:33:16
- Everyone owns bitcoin because it appreciates. I’d even assume that you do too
- What did you use to buy your lunch yesterday? What do you pay for rent or mortgage? What about gas station? Do you think it’s going to change in the nearest 6m?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:06:36
Sure! Tell me about technical analysis. I’ll just listen in silence.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:14:53
Has someone estimated crypto market cap, at which it will crash? Obviously, new money needed to fuel the growth. The growth is the main reason for interest.
