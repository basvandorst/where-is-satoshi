As long as I can trade it out of Robinhood I’m sold.

This is better than EVE Online Drama!!

Another alias he uses is "schten" (as seen from the groups.yahoo.com link.

I'm sitting on a good chunk scattered across various wallets ATM. I use them to buy Humble Bundles, Amazon Gift Cards from GYFT, and Bottles of Wine from this company up in Delaware :)

Exactly. The Yahoo! comment was from 2004, and he's speaking in full proper grammar. It actually goes to show just how far this man went to protect his identity "after" he let go of BTC.

No one looks confused... not sure what you mean. Leah says it's him. The guy says it's not. That's the news.

Well, post your btc address and see if anyone is feeling generous.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:14:54
Probably pretty good considering it was their FIRST BTC customer. I'm sure I'd remember that important milestone in my business.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:43:55
I don't see it in his history...
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:45:00
Wait, how do you know my Gmail password?
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:15:47
Nope. Your wallet is only known to you. Your BTC address could be known to anyone and everyone. Remember Wallet != Address.

He had just returned home from the AP Interview when the post was made.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:38:44
Wowz. I feel sad thinking back when I used to bet 5 btc at once with SatoshiDice. lol
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:25:07
Of course he's denying it. If he wanted the spotlight, he would have spoken up years ago.
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:55:58
Please only discuss BTC in this subreddit.  Thank you 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:07:06
Except history. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:14
Really sad I gambled away my 8 BTC back in 2009. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:29:42
Didn't he hire an undercover cop as a hitman? Yeah. Totally justified. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:39:05
So not convicted. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:24:47
I should note that a wallet and a bitcoin address are two completely different things. A wallet is simply a private key that only you know. You can set up the same wallet on multiple computers using that private key.
A bitcoin address points to a particular wallet and can be thrown away or kept at your discretion. Meaning: Addresses can be a one-time use thing or you can use the same address for a long period of time.
Hope that makes sense.

The OP probably used the same computer to send funds to himself from a stolen account. The Fraud department didn't just arbitrarily close his account... they did their research and determined that he was using stolen credit cards to pass money around... He got what he deserved IMO.

btcguild.com is selling these now for 1 btc, which at today's exchange rate is only $102. So it costs almost 3x LESS than an AMD GPU now... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:08:38
Placed the order before reading the comments... so I missed out on the discount. Boo.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:12:47
At today's market price of $260... he lost $390,000.
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:31:53
They do cost 1 btc now, btw.
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:13:53
With the current difficulty of over 100 million, running 1,000 Mh/s will net you about 0.005 btc a day... (about 50 cents). So if your computer is only hitting 45 Mh/s, you're looking at about 2.5 cents a day.
Factor in your electricity costs keeping your GPU on all day long, you're probably not making any money. I assume you're using a GPU and not a Block Erupter (USB Miner).
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:30:34
You can buy them from btcguild.com starting tomorrow evening for 1 btc each.
