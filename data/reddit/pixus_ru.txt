Concealed carry reciprocity bill should fix that.  
California still will make high-capacity bitcoin wallets illegal anyway. And DOJ roster of safe cryptos.

Bank transfers (USD -&gt; JPY or CAD -&gt; USD) are monitored, controllable and taxable. So it is not money laundering.  
For casual consumer in the US, fees connected to such transfer would be unacceptable.

I suppose it is not so silly, since the mass opinion defines what way the price will go.
So, so far, here, most of the people think it will go up soon after opening (with some significant correction first).

In Russia, the operator is obligated by law to collect customer ID.
But in fact, small retail points would sell you SIM card without bother with ID, they put some stranger's ID instead yours.
