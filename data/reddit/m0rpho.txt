maybe that's what this is aiming at?

many to many. one person can have multiple addresses and one address can hold bitcoins of multiple persons (onlineserices etc)

I'm passionate about bitcoin. As much as I want to dedicate a big amount of my time to it. I believe it's the future.. my ideas so far were a lottery, a kickstarter like page for private projects like college education, microlending, elearning. But there are so many areas bitcoin could come handy and I'd like to know you guys preference. Where do you see the biggest need?

Very unlikely it's him. It's staged. Someone wants us to believe it's him. Probably to give bitcoin more trust. Good marketing but the guy is not convincing. The way he "accidently" mentions that he studied in England, the way the questions were asked about his role in the bitcoin community, the whole thing looks like bad acting.

That's why I'm here.. ;) Is there anything annoying you regarding bitcoin or services built around it?
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:58:35
Ok, thanks for your opinion. For me it still looks like a giant pump&amp;dump or some really big entity controlling bitcoin's price.

It used to be possible with  but that's deprecated already.
Another possibility would be the send dialog, but it's very limited in customizing options  
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:21:33
Great ideas! That way exactly what I was looking for! These are some pretty nice ideas!

In my opinion it's a marketing campaign. And I agree with you, it's coordinated at high level, like goverment level... My bet is on Edelman/bitfury and generally "five eyes" goverments trying to push bitcoin into mainstream. Im guessing that some goverments are already in posession of large bitcoin amounts.. That way they would eventually sit on a lot of value and finally get rid of debt, which would then give them alot of advantage compared to other countries like china or russia. Bitcoin is the last resort in a world where all traditonal currencies get devaluated...

I really like your ideas! Thanks for sharing them! Instead of "missing pet" a general lost&amp;found plattform with bitcoin bounties could work well too. I think I'm going to build that.. You could even integrate your lost item in the blockchain, like attaching the serial number/animal-tag-id/etc so people could instantly get a feedback if the item they found is the one you are looking for. Maybe you could even generate a private key out of it somehow..
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:27:45
That way you could later "proof" that you are nakamoto
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:18:13
Yea maybe, but still, it feels so staged. Like they are reading a script..
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:29:59
i guess someone wants wright to look credible.. i wonder whats the bigger plan behind all this...
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:10:18
it's just bitcoin marketing. bitcoin would never catch on with big investors if there are uncertainties about nakamoto or the remaining coins allegedly under his control. so they have to give nakamoto a face and make him look good and reliable. but to pull off something like that you need quite alot of ressources and a good pr agency, like Edelman
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:03:58
I think so too. But in my opinion you can raise the biggest awareness by creating something people actually really like using and not by news or marketing. But I like your suggestions! Thanks for that!
@_date: 2015-12-18 08:41:51
Check out this thread, there are some really nice answers 
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:24:59
Because they don't want to reveal their automatic downvoting for people who disagree when publishing news like "Wright is nakamoto".

Just an idea: Is it possible to control the price by making millions of transactions with yourself? How much money would you need to pay for transaction fees in order to lift the price of Bitcoin to the current level from lets say 10usd? Do you think it's possible for any govermental or private entity to control the price? Do you think it's possible that these fake transactions just stopped in 2014 and from then on the price of bitcoin was actually based on real supply and demand?

This is just plainly wrong. The wallet you are referring to has a donation button included. So its just like that: Increasing utility means more wallet users. More wallet users mean more donations. As simple as that.

good way to put it!

There are some gov operations that have quite competent people. there are thinktanks that include people from agencys from multiple govs like gchq and nsa (and others)..

Think one step further: Someone wants us to believe that Gavin wants us to believe that Craig is Satoshi..
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:40:10


Please think one step ahead. Whoever did this PR stunt was sure that eventually somebody would find out that the signatures are false. So they knew in advance it would discredit Gavin in the end.. It's really an attack against Gavin and big blocks..

Poor Gavin got fooled. Someone really knows to play the game.. They are big and they are definetly against Gavin and bigger blocks and they do everything to destroy his credibility...
