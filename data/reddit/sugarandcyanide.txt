Disclosure: I work for OB1, the company building OpenBazaar, and we know search is weak in the current version. In 2.0, out in the next few months, it will be better! In the mean time though, check out third party search apps like duosear.ch, entropy.market, mubiz.com or bazaarbay.org

Totally understandable, it's frustrating to us too. I work with OB1, the development team, and we're working on ways to explain this better to make it more understandable and accessible.
Right now there are 3rd parties that do a great job providing search functions such as  and  as this is a completely different animal within vs. outside of the app itself. Within the app is a decentralized structure and search requires some centralization. For the obvious example, Google produces search by crawling the data and indexing it on their own servers and then users ask Google directly for it instead of having to ask the source each time. OpenBazaar is a network of "having to ask the source each time." There are major changes coming in 2.0 but that doesn't mean we just hang out until then.
Not working as expected is a barrier to excitement for sure...do you think there's a way we could better set those expectations for this new type of network to make the experience more fluid?

Agreed on both points, this IS a great list &amp; that OpenBazaar is another marketplace where one can earn Bitcoins!

OpenBazaar is just an open source software. The development is being led by a company called OB1 (whom I work for) but anyone can contribute.   
It's really easy to use if you want to buy or sell goods or services with Bitcoin. I am biased, sure, but I did choose to work with this team because the work is good and the idea for this simple decentralized marketplace is important.

It's a little confusing, [openbazaar.com]( is just a simple browse-only site the dev team stood up for now and [openbazaar.org]( is the official website for the software itself. Still have to download to purchase but at least you can browse easily via web now!

The full release was just put out today, now out of beta testing! You can read more about it here, quick and easy to set up and have a look around if you're still unsure:

These are great ideas! Digital products that can be delivered automatically within the OpenBazaar app are coming soon.

OpenBazaar is a newer network and it is still growing its reach but it has an active community of people who are oriented to and willing to use cryptocurrencies to purchase items. 
2 simple benefits of OpenBazaar are that it's very easy to set up, especially compared to other marketplaces and payment processor plugin models, and there is an active community surrounding it. If you set up a website without a community from which to draw interest you will invest more initial setup time and then are completely on your own for marketing and driving traffic to your own website with little possibility of picking up traffic from people browsing within a marketplace.
Ultimately, if you're looking to get started quickly and be a part of a group of people working on new technology while you earn bitcoin, then OpenBazaar is a great choice!

How so? Interested to hear, accessibility for buyers only is a great point of discussion
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:23:52
It's true! Not on its own blockchain like this article &amp; discussion covered but it is a fully decentralized marketplace built on Bitcoin.

You enter your BTC address per each sale, it's part of the order fulfillment process!
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:32:22
Yes, when someone starts the sale process for an item you can enter it as you are checking them out.
