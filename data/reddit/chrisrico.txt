I don't understand, can you explain what that has to do with the NSA using broken SHA-256 to spend bitcoins they didn't previously have private keys for? 
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:33:35
They'd need more than a SHA-256 exploit, they'd need to be able to a private key based on the public key's hash. Actually, most bitcoin today are held in multi signature wallets where the only thing known in advance is the hash of the *script* that can redeem the coins, so it's even more impossible.

They don't offer the same level of security because you need a secure offline computer to generate and spend paper wallets. If you don't take those extra steps, it's little better than storing the keys on your computer directly.

It's not the result that determines if it's artificial, but the cause. You've got it all backwards.
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:37:43
You neglect to mention that when you want to spend your coins, you have to...
* Construct the unsigned transaction, with any change going to *a new securely generated address*
* Import the private key on an offline computer
* Move the unsigned transaction to the offline computer on a non-infectable medium, sign it (after verifying amounts and change address)
* Move it back to an online computer and broadcast
If you import the key onto an online computer, you risk having malware sweep it before you can.
Also, you better not forgot your BIP38 password or all your coins are gone.

I think the confusion comes from this math:
$1,000 / 10% = $10,000, minus the $1,000 deposit = $9,000 created

I filed a support request through Steam Support already, but I doubt it will go to the right people.
There's a somewhat minor issue with Bitpay's checkout inside of Steam. When you click the "Open in wallet" link, Steam doesn't know how to handle the bitcoin URI and goes to an error page. This causes the cart to get stuck in limbo.
Maybe you can either forward this to the Steam payments team, or disable the link for the Steam user agent?

I meant loans, not liabilities.


That's not correct. If the bank has $1,000 of deposits, it can loan up to $900, keeping 10% ($100) of the deposits as reserve.

Currently, the entire network topology is broadcast through the nodes. There are proposals to improved methods of pathfinding that don't rely on a global shared state, but they won't be ready at first. The benefit is that Lightning isn't a consensus layer like Bitcoin, changes to routing can be rolled out slowly over time, it doesn't have to be nearly as coordinated as a consensus fork.

You just pass an empty array of inputs to `createrawtransaction` then call `fundrawtransaction` afterward. I thought `addwitnessaddress` didn't work on `getrawchangeaddress` because it wasn't considered part of the wallet, and witness addresses can only be added to wallet addresses.

Channel factories are different. They allow participants to open a channel without an on chain transaction, basically acting as a proxy between the blockchain and Lightning (moving it from layer 2 to 3).

I don't think we'll ever see a solely mine based soft fork again. It's more likely that miners will be able to signal to speed up the deployment process, but there will be a fallback block number that the soft fork takes effect regardless.

Ideally, never. You can also close one channel and open another with a single transaction, which saves on fees. That's on top of SegWit savings, since LN requires non-malleable transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:21:01
SegWit (the only deployed transaction malleability fix) is a *requirement* for Lightning as currently specified. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:12:23

You're not even asking the question "is perversely incentivized artificial growth a good thing?"
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:01:19


Because that's how Lightning works.
A channel has two participants, each of which have a balance in the channel. In a channel A&lt;-&gt;B containing 1 BTC, if the entire balance is owned by B, it's impossible for A to forward a payment to B because they don't own any funds in the channel.
@_date: 2016-04-20 22:47:48


That has never been the case and will almost certainly never be the case.
If this is truly what is necessary for Bitcoin to continue being a permissionless ledger, then you might as well give up now.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:41:37
Considering those don't offer the same security guarantees as a blockchain, absolutely. In fact, Lightning might even be better.

You can open any number of channels in one single transaction. Funding is simply sending to a 2-of-2 P2WSH output.
In the same vein, if you're closing a channel and opening another, you can do both in the same on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:53:29


I don't think so, but I'm not certain. Today you can add P2SH-P2WKH addresses to your wallet using `bitcoin-cli addwitnessaddress $(bitcoin-cli getnewaddress)`, but change is always sent to a legacy address.


P2SH-P2WKH, which is a pay to witness key hash script wrapped in a pay to script hash script (address starts with 3). However if you send to a native SegWit (bech32) address, it will generate the same type of output as change to increase privacy.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:44:39
You can use it, very easily. That's the entire point of Lightning. In addition to being able to use it, you can collect fees for routing payments using your open channels. All without any trusted third party!

BIP9 said "If 90% of blocks don't signal for SegWit after X height, cancel the redeployment". BIP8 says "if 90% of blocks don't signal after X height, activate the deployment".
BIP9 delegates the entire ability to activate the upgrade to miners, which is a mistake. BIP8 merely gives miners the opportunity to activate an upgrade early by signalling they are technically capable of enforcing the new rules. The intent of signalling was never to give I one group ultimate veto power against changes. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:41:34


I don't think that's correct. I'm pretty sure your node entirely determines the route in advance. Onion routed payments couldn't work the way you describe.

I think entering it via stdin over SSH is fine.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:10:46


Not currently. It's not clear to me if it would be possible in the future.
If the issue is just that your channel is unbalanced (the other side owns almost all the value of the channel), then there's another solution though. Change your routing fees (for transactions flowing TO you in the channel) to 0 or lower (negative). This will provide an incentive for payments to be routed through your channel, which will rebalance it automatically.

With BIP8 it **will** activate on or before (of miner threshold is reached) the deadline. Anyone who doesn't upgrade by the deadline will fork from those who have, once the new rules are in effect and your node breaks them (being unaware).
If only 10% of the network supports a change, what do you care? Just ignore it and carry on.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:24:42
No, in the example above, you'd give the exchange fiat, and they would send you a LN transaction routed through that channel, which would re-allocate that amount to your side of the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:35:21
Lightning starts with a deposit into a 2-of-2 multisig address. That is the funding transaction, and it is recorded in the blockchain. From there, channel partners exchange *real* bitcoin transactions which derive from the funding transaction. The first is the commitment transaction, which establishes each party's balance in the channel. Every state update including the commitment transaction is a *real* bitcoin transaction which could be broadcast to the blockchain, but in the ideal case is not.
The only two ways the protocol allows for things to go badly are:
* Your channel partner becomes unresponsive, in which case you perform a unilateral close by publishing the latest state transaction. There's a locktime involved in this, so you'll have to wait a while.
* Your channel partner tries to cheat by publishing an old state transaction. Doing so publishes the revocation key for that transaction which allows you (if you're online) to broadcast a punishment transaction, claiming the entire channel balance for yourself. It's possible to outsource the monitoring for cheating in a way that is both private and secure (the third party knows nothing about the channel and can *only* publish the punishment transaction).

Yes, but it also simplifies the threat model. If you *only* spend, you don't need to monitor for cheating.


All you need is a connection, not an incoming connection. It works fine if you connect to your channel partners when you start up your node.

As someone who's been using the RPC interface for my business, 0.15.1 provides no good way to send change to SegWit addresses. You can use the raw transactions API, but you'll have to generate change addresses yourself from the main pool of keys, which changes how some things are displayed. It's not ideal and 0.16 will be a huge improvement.

Don't accept incoming connections. Make outgoing connections to your peers.
Or require a digital signature on handshake. There are many options.


I don't think this is accurate. A network connection between two nodes is implied by their channel. You only need to know which public keys share channels and their respective balances to find a route.


I think you're confused. [Onion routing]( is the only routing, and it's what's used today. The [gossip protocol]( is how nodes discover other nodes and public channels.

Do you have open channels with the capacity to receive bitcoin? Are you connected to the rest of the Lightning network through those channels?

No it's not.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:55:31
I'm not sure if the current client code supports it, but there's no protocol reason you couldn't. If you look at a funding transaction, it's just a P2SH wrapped P2WSH output (2-of-2 multisig). The Lightning contracts all reference this output, by txid and output index. So you could presumably open as many channels as you can create outputs in one transaction.

@_date: 2018-01-17 18:45:39
It doesn't matter for your question, but each channel has two balances, one for each party. To get a full picture of this scenario, you'd need to know B's balance in each the A&lt;-&gt;B and B&lt;-&gt;C channels.
But assuming A(5)&lt;-&gt;B(0), B(1)&lt;-&gt;C(0), the maximum that A could send to C through B is 1 BTC^[1]. If A has other channels open, they may be able to find other routes to C and split the payment up into multiple parts.
*[1]* To be entirely accurate, not *quite* 1 BTC as it's not likely a channel partner will cooperatively allow you to decrease your channel balance past a certain threshold. This is to prevent you from decreasing your balance to zero and then attempting to broadcast an old state. If your balance was zero, there would be no downside to attempting to cheat. You can always settle to the Bitcoin blockchain at any time, with their cooperation instantly, or without their cooperation after a wait period.

No, with BIP8 there is an activation date way in the future, like 52,560 blocks (1 year). The upgrade would activate in one year or when 90% of miners signaled support. There is *no* way for miners to block the upgrade, just delay it until the activation block height.
It still requires a vast majority of the community support the upgrade by running the software though, like with BIP148. Otherwise those that upgraded will just be on their own chain when the upgrade is activated.
This method can be used with any soft fork upgrade.

No, your understanding is incorrect.
A channel becomes unusable *in one direction* when it's fully unbalanced. You can still receive payments, or route payments through the channel in the other direction. In fact, one way you can rebalance the channel is to offer low, zero, or negative fees to route payments in that direction.
You *can* close the channel and open a new one (in the same transaction, even), but you don't *have* to and it *definitely* doesn't happen automatically.
In fact, I would venture to say that most channels will begin unbalanced, with only one party contributing funds.

No, but if the only transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain are those which are at risk of being censored, those who use it are at much higher risk of being targeted by governments. If instead their transactions hide in the noise of millions of innocuous ones, it becomes much more difficult to pick them out.

No, actually it's wrong and is right. A fractional reserve ratio of 10% means that banks must hold 10% of their *deposits* as reserves, not 10% of their *loans*. So they *must* hold $100 of that $1,000 as reserves, but they can loan out the remaining $900.

The maximum per-spec Lightning channel size is 0.042 BTC. A channel you open with the recipient only has value if your node is always online and you have other desirable channels with outgoing capacity. It makes more sense for large value transactions to just send the amount on-chain.

If you've got 8 open channels, then anyone who has channels with any of those nodes, or any of *their* nodes (etc) can pay through you to any of your other nodes, or *their* nodes (etc).
As the number of hops increase, the possibility that one of those nodes is offline or otherwise not responding increases, which decreases the chance of a successful payment. However, when a payment is unsuccessful, my understanding is that after a timeout the funds are returned to your channel balance.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:46:24
What centralisation issue? Lightning finally creates an incentive to run a full node, as doing so (and owning bitcoin) gives you the opportunity to lock funds into channels and collect fees. As Andreas has said, Lightning is like proof of stake for Bitcoin. The barrier to entry is small,  the benefits are high. Even if some governments try to regulate channel operators as money transmitters, there's no reason to open channels with known entities in your jurisdiction, since attempted cheating is punished through smart contracts, but the legal system.

Alice and Bob are performing a submarine swap. Alice has funded outgoing channels but wants channels with incoming capacity. Bob has on-chain BTC but wants a) a fee b) outgoing capacity or both.
Bob constructs a transaction with an output that requires Alice's signature AND the preimage of a given hash *OR* is spendable by Bob after a timelock. He provides inputs and signs the transaction, generates a Lightning invoice using the same preimage and hash, then provides both the invoice and the transaction to Alice.
Alice knows that if she can provide the preimage for the given hash, she can spend this transaction. She also knows that if she pays Bob's invoice, then he will *have* to give her the hash preimage in order to satisfy the Lightning payment. So she attempts to pay the invoice, and one of two things happen:
1. Bob responds with the hash preimage before the hashlock expires, in which case Alice spends the transaction he gave her
2. Bob does not respond, Alice cannot spend the transaction, however the LN payment is never settled and expires, leaving them both where they started

There's really no such thing as a hub in Lightning, it's just a term people use for a well connected node with many channels. To answer your question, the minimum you can lock up in a channel is the amount that is currently feasible to send on the blockchain, since to open a channel requires an on-chain transaction.

Yes, you can run a Lightning node alongside your full node. A laptop probably isn't the best option because it needs to be online to route payments, and if your node is offline often it probably won't be chosen for the route.
Yes, you'll need to lock some bitcoins into a multisig smart contract in order to collect fees. You'll set your desired fee, which your node will advertise, and any time a payment is routed through one of your channels, you'll keep that portion of the payment. Due to the incentives, it's likely that Lightning fees will be a very small fixed fee plus a fraction of a percent of the transaction value. Much more suited to payments than Bitcoin's fee per byte for blockchain transactions.
You don't *have* to charge a fee. In fact, if one of your channels becomes unbalanced and thus unusable, you'd normally have to close it and open another. What you could instead do is charge a negative fee, give people a discount on their payment in order to incentivize them to rebalance your channel for you.
There is very little risk to tying up funds in a channel. The only thing the other party can do is publish an old version of the channel state to the blockchain. However, that transaction cannot be confirmed for some number of hours, and in doing so they reveal the information you need to take *all* of the channel's funds. You need to be online to observe this and publish the punishment transaction, but it's possible to outsource this to a third party in a completely trustless way.

Because selling is a taxable event that triggers capital gains. Donating an asset to a 501(c)(3) bypasses capital gains; there's no tax liability for the donor and the recipient, but they get the current value as a deduction, and the recipient gets the full value of the asset. Essentially you donate up to 20% more.

Think of a channel as a mini ledger between you and the other node. At the beginning, you both have an equal balance (let's say 1000 bits). If you make a payment to them, or *through* them, then your balance decreases and theirs increases. If someone makes a payment *through* you, it can either decrease or increase your balance depending on which direction it's going. If your balance ever becomes 0 (and theirs is 2000 bits now), then you can no longer send or route payments in that direction. However, you can still receive or route payments in the other direction. You can incentivize others to do so by paying them a small fee (essentially giving them a discount on their payment).

You then open a LN channel to my node and route a payment of 0.05 BTC to me using the hash lock in my transaction as the payment hash. In order to claim the LN payment, I must reveal to you the preimage, which you can use to unlock (spend) transaction.
At no point can either one of us steal from the other, and at the end of the process you have 0.0499 BTC of incoming capacity.

I don't understand what you're proposing.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin's scaling solution isn't "make blocks bigger".
Let me be more specific. The next block halving occurs in ~2.5 years. The reward will then be 6.25 BTC. 12 years later, the reward will be only 0.78 BTC. Without transaction fees, the security of the Bitcoin network will be drastically compromised by near future subsidy halvings.

The article does not actually say that. It says employees, not necessarily employees of the retail locations. Consider that anyone along the supply chain can potentially can potentially bulk copy the secret information on the cards (scratch off PIN is not a secure protection).

I can open a channel to you in any amount up to the maximum and **I provide the funds**.
Right now all channels are funded by one party only. In the future there will be an optional negotiation process on channel opening for both parties to provide inputs and outputs.
A submarine swap is a smart contract that atomically trades on-chain BTC for incoming lightning capacity. You open a channel with me and push a payment for 0.05 BTC, and I'll atomically pay you on-chain 0.0499 BTC. The on-chain payment is only valid if the LN patient was completed. Now anyone who has a channel to me can pay you.

Let me clarify, I mean without transaction fees *at or exceeding the current rate*.
There are only two options for total fees to make up for the subsidy halving: current fee rates stay the same and total number of transactions doubles, or total number of transactions stays the same and fee rates double. Other than SegWit, an increase in in-block transaction capacity isn't currently scheduled, so in 2020 either miners begin their exodus from Bitcoin or fees increase.
Also, I want to go back to your original statement:


Well, they don't. The amount *does not* scale with total hashrate, only with fee per transaction and total number of transactions. Both of which are independent of the total hashrate.

Bitcoin isn't measurably deflationary, the supply is increasing for now but will eventually reach a steady state (minus losses, which cannot be quantified). Being in widespread use would mean that the purchasing power of Bitcoin would only increase at the rate that the economy becomes more productive.
People would spend Bitcoin because they value the goods and services purchased now greater than expected future purchasing power. Some things people need, like food, housing, and health care. Other things people merely desire.
While it is true that economic rationality dictates spending inflationary money before deflationary, if we're talking about a future where Bitcoin is nearly ubiquitous, then inflationary fiat is already dead.

No they're not. If they mine normally, they will find 51% of blocks. Sometimes they will find 10 in a row, sometimes they will miss 10  in a row.
If they try the attack you mentioned, only mining on their own chain, ignoring a longer chain if it exists, they will *likely* over a long period of time have the longest chain. Remember, this is all probability. Even with 1% you can still get lucky and find a string of blocks, however unlikely. So, if Ghash is unlucky while attacking, they will get behind and have to start over. They don't immediately control the network with 51%.

So, the dragging and dropping, that's only for the serverless mode. It can also be used with a central server to coordinate everything.
I think what you're missing is that this fundamentally uses the blockchain in a clever way to do assurance contracts without requiring any of the participants to trust *anyone but the recipient of the funds*. Even if you're using a server, the server at no point has control of any of the funds. It is impossible to use this with any sort of fiat currency, the technology allows only crypto currencies.

Headers-first, as described in the post (and as I had heard before) is only for the initial sync of the blockchain. What vqpas is suggesting is that miners could broadcast to the network the block header only before the full transaction list, and other miners would build off that. Eventually, presumably, they would require the full transaction list to continue building.
I think miners might want to validate the entire transaction set to ensure they aren't building off a block that won't be accepted by the rest of the network. It could contain a double spend or otherwise invalid transaction, but you wouldn't know that from the header alone. You have to validate all transactions and then compare to the merkle root.
Perhaps it's not such a big deal though, if miners only wait a short time (in the range of say 5-30 seconds) before forgetting the header if they don't receive the transactions.

If you use a passphrase to encrypt your Trezor, he is correct, losing the passphrase means your bitcoins are gone forever. You need the seed + passphrase to recover. Even as an advanced user, that sounds horrible to me.

No you don't. You're just routing a payment through them from one of your channels (with only outbound capacity) to another (with only inbound capacity).


I don't understand why you think that. Can you give me a few examples of how people would use the ability to trade channel balances?


They can't, and I never claimed they could.
You are aware that *you* don't have to open a channel in order to have a usable channel, right? There has to be *a* on-chain transaction, but either channel partner can fund the channel. For instance, you buy your first bitcoin on the exchange and want to withdraw via Lightning but don't have any channels. You'd give the exchange your public key and they'd open a channel with you pushing the withdrawal to your side. Now you have a channel from which you can pay, and you didn't need to perform an on-chain transaction.

So do payment requests though, if you use any sort of complex transaction type. Presumably one would only use PS2H for complex transactions, but perhaps you're comparing it to the case of using P2SH for even simple transactions.
As for extensibility, I agree that the payment protocol is superior, P2SH was originally designed to fit multi signature and other complex transactions into existing address infrastructure, which will hopefully become phased out for commercial transactions soon.

I purchased two Bitmain Antminer S3s because I had heard good things about them. I received my miners about a month later, well within the estimated window.

I'm not promising that they're not going to turn into another BFL or KNC, but my personal experience backs up the generally positive things I had heard, and I'm still happy with my purchase. Granted, I am not doing this mainly for profit, but to contribute to P2Pool and Bitcoin.

I think this is an example of an [X/Y problem]( where what you specifically ask is not really feasible, but your desired result can be accomplished in better ways.


You can already do that. Say you have two channels, one where you own the entire balance and one where your peer does. Rather than two asymmetrical channels you'd rather have two symmetrical channels. So you find a route between your two channels and make a payment from one to the other, rebalancing both.
There's also something called splicing or reanchoring that will allow you to add or subtract balance to a channel with a single on-chain transaction, without closing it.
I don't think anything will make the transfer of channels secure though, it amounts to sharing a bitcoin private key.

Not necessarily. A lot of overdoses (I'd argue most of them, for various reasons) are the fault of prohibition policies.

Micro payment channels.
You tell Uber where you're going and the maximum you'll pay to get there. Your phone constructs a time locked transaction with enough unspent inputs to cover the maximum fare, and an output for you and Uber. At first, the entire value is assigned to your output. Every 1/10 mile driven, your phone automatically constructs a new transaction with the appropriate fee added to the Uber output. This new transaction supersedes the previous one. This can happen even many times per second if necessary. At any point, Uber can broadcast a transaction and receive the amount spent to their output.
What does that mean for you? By the time you get to your destination, you've already paid.

The onus to prove a thing is on the one that makes the claim, not the one that disputes it.
The claim is that the bible is an accurate representation of history. The dispute is that there is no evidence for this claim. The disputant does not have any duty to prove anything, nor would it generally be possible.

This is the same fallacy used to justify central bank's monetary inflation. Granted, truly decentralized cryptos will always be better as the creation of money isn't politicized.
There is no need to incentivize the spending of money, people should be able to save for their future without risking their money in the stock market. Anyway, people will spend their savings (what you call hoarding) on the things that they need or want when the desire overcomes the desire to save. Let's say that both Bitcoin and Dogecoin become widely accepted, do you really think anyone would hold doge, when they could instead hold bitcoin? No, they'd hold bitcoin and *maybe* convert to doge to spend, but why even do that if you can just spend bitcoin directly?

Your plan is silly. 500 is an arbitrary number, not fundamentally different than 505 or 523.71. Instead what you should do is purchase (for instance) 1 bitcoin every week for 50 weeks. This will spread the risk out over a longer period of time.

The cartel is the arrangement *between* competing firms. Unless you're arguing that banks don't compete with each other? Prior to the creation of the central bank, one of the aspects of competition for banks was their reserve levels. Banks that had too few reserves would have a run on them and go bankrupt. This kept their use of fractional reserve banking in check. With the creation of the federal reserve, banks no longer had to compete on this aspect, and also gained a monopoly on the creation of money.

That's really interesting! Bitcoin transactions are rather small data structures, so it should be fairly easy to transmit them this way. Similarly, clients that don't store the entire blockchain (**S**imple **P**ayment **V**erification) only need the 80kb block headers and transactions relevant to them...

The actual costs to run miners are low, the main expense is the hardware. Where are you getting this 95% figure from? If a miner doesn't expect to recoup their hardware costs before the next halving, they won't buy new equipment.
Anyway, let's say you're right and mining is no longer profitable for half of the miners, and they stop mining. Everyone else gets to split that revenue between them, after the difficulty adjusts downward.

Not exactly. You can start mining on your own private chain, but you're not orphaning anything until your chain overtakes the public one. Which, unless your computing power absolutely dwarfs the rest of the network's, will take an extremely long time for anything other than a very recent block.

What Mike wants to implement is a system by which a transaction's fee can be paid by the transaction that spends it. He is correct that the sender doesn't really care if or when their transaction confirms, but the receiver does.
Let's say I'm shopping at your store and pay using a bitcoin transaction that has no attached fee. It will stay unconfirmed for a long time, and there's nothing you can do about it. You can't send it back to me and make me pay again, neither you and I can attach a fee to it. It's in limbo.
With his proposal, you could create a child transaction spending the unconfirmed one and include a fee. The miners would resolve this dependency and include both transactions in the next block.

I think you misunderstand how a warrant canary works. It's not a one time statement that you have never been issued a warrant for user information. It's a continuous statement, updated every so often that says "as of this date, we have never been issued a warrant".

There is no "from" address. Transactions have one or more inputs and one (technically zero, but not relevant here) or more outputs. It is not necessarily true that your customer controls the private key related to the inputs (hosted wallets, CoinJoin, etc).

As if there are no other costs than the terminal and the server...

* A credit/debit card transaction isn't fully confirmed for months (when a chargeback can no longer occur)
* Bitpay and Coinbase offer conversion from bitcoin to USD with a maximum of 1% fee
* Scanning a QR code is faster than entering your credit card information
* Transaction fees are currently (and as long as block size increases with transaction volume, will be) miniscule
I'm not sure how you'd come to that conclusion.
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:18:55
It's not necessary that miners are incentivized purely by transaction fees. If there is not enough mining necessary to secure the network, merchants and payment processors (Coinbase, Bitpay) would have an incentive to pay miners directly to include their transactions.
One other optimization would be for merchants to pay the transaction fee, since they are the ones that benefit from having the transaction buried in the blockchain. This could be accomplished by the sender including no fee, and the merchant spending this unconfirmed transaction back to themselves, including a fee. The mining software would have to just resolve these transaction dependency chains and include the whole thing in a block to collect the fees.

I don't think you understand how the mining process works. They would have to redo as much work as the entire rest of the network for a month, in a much shorter time period.

Go fuck yourself, you cunt. I shouldn't even bother responding after that comment, but...
If a business doesn't want to accept bitcoin because they think it's more work for their employees, they're not going to want to take the risk of exchange rate volatility/exchange fraud that comes with selling their own bitcoin. They're also not going to want to spend money implementing a technical solution for selling automatically. Payment processors completely mitigate these risks, allowing otherwise risk adverse businesses to get their foot in the door.

The whole point of the Trezor is that you don't have to trust the host computer in any way. The Ledger relies on the assumptions that...

Without some huge breakthrough, receiving physical bitcoins (private keys) is completely insecure, because you have no way of knowing if the other party also has a copy of the key.

Micro payment channels. You agree on a maximum amount for the time period, say a day. Your employer creates a transaction spending that amount to their own address (A) and none to yours (B). Let's say every minute (but there's no limit to how often) they calculate the value of your labor since the last calculation, and increase the value of the B output by that amount. They sign the transaction and give it to you. At any point, you can broadcast the transaction to the network and claim your pay for the day so far. All of this except that broadcast take place off the bitcoin network.

What? No. I'm saying that most businesses don't want to take on the risk of currency fluctuations by keeping mostly/all bitcoins on their balance sheets. In other words, they don't want to convert all of their USD revenue into bitcoin. This has nothing to do with individuals buying or selling.
Chargebacks are not irrelevant, as at the root of this discussion someone said "if there are chargebacks they can just sell BTC for fiat". That's a horrible idea, because if the price of bitcoin goes down, not only did they lose out on the sale, but they also LOST money on the conversion both ways and the price going down.

So there's one big flaw with local bitcoins escrow that led me to not use it very often, maybe you can address this in your system.
When the buyer contacted the seller, the price was locked in immediately, instead of being locked in when the escrow was funded. This was really annoying if you were having a discussion over the course of a day or two before funding the escrow and the price was fluctuating. You had to cancel the contract and have then create a new one to proceed.

I think the term side chain is explicitly used to differentiate it from a completely separate merged mined chain. If I understand correctly, there is no mining on a side chain, coins are created by provably making them unspendable in bitcoin. Sort of like a proof of burn. This is called one way pegging.
The Bitcoin blockchain is used as a secure trustless time stamping system, securing the side chain, which can have their own transaction rules.
If bitcoin is modified to allow it, a side chain can provide a proof that coins were made unspendable in it, freeing up the "burned" coins in the bitcoin block chain. This is referred as two way pegging.

I'm pretty sure not, because the days that it's signed isn't the input, but (almost) the entire transaction. If what you say it's correct, then there would be multiple identical signatures attached to a same-key-multiple-input transaction, when only one would suffice.

I think it would be more in the spirit of the regulation if it was 2 of 2, so Lawsky had final say over every transaction in the system.

Even **if** the completely unproven claims of attempted murder for hire are true...
If it were not for the War on Drugs, the threat of releasing identities of buyers and sellers would be a non issue. If it were not for the War on Drugs, DPR would have other forms of recourse if he was being blackmailed. The threat of bringing to bear government violence against innocent people merely engaged in free trade of mind altering substances is itself an aggressive act, and potentially warrants the use of violence to prevent it.
But then, all of these claims are completely unproven at this point, so there's that...

The closest thing I'm aware of is Counterparty. It's at more of a low level though, you'd have to create and validate the tickets from the tokens you issue yourself.
There's a mobile client called IndieSquare that seems to work well (though it doesn't quite a have a noob-friendly UI). I'm setting up a "gift card" system for a local business right now. You can issue tokens that are not divisible, which should work for tickets. Tokens are automatically transferable which is a nice feature. To "validate" a token, you just have them send it back to your IndieSquare wallet.
IndieSquare does have an API. I haven't looked at it in depth, but you could hide the crypto features behind a simple "ticketing" interface and using the API to do the actual transfer of tokens.

What if your wallet falls out of your pocket while you're eating dinner? Someone else notices and takes the cash out of it. This is more analogous to most of the ways someone is going to get a copy of your private key. People don't often "drop" and then forget about them.

Well, that's *a* point. Having trust doesn't make them useless, it's still a nice way to pay for a metered resource (like time). The advantage is that you can choose when to cash out your time and have money in your wallet, you don't have to wait for temporal checkpoints.

They might as well include legit transactions now, but they don't. I'm not convinced miners are making smaller, 0 transaction blocks due to decreased propagation times, I think there is something else going on.

Except the Ethereum fork fundamentally changed the rules of the system so that some people wouldn't lost money. The equivalent would have been a hard fork to restore MtGox coins.
Unless you're saying that small blockers would maintain a hard fork out of principle/spite after a hard fork to change the block size, there won't be a persistent fork in this case.

That's absolutely false. Miners are dependent on selling their coins to users in order to pay their bills. As a scorched earth measure, users could also switch to a new hashing algorithm and make all the miners' hardware investments worthless.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:01:32
Yes, I know how blockchains work. As far as I know, miners generally sell the bitcoin they mine as soon as they mine it. So miners aren't going to be sitting on a large cache of pre-split coins.

When wallet software has well designed user interfaces for multi-signature transactions, that won't be necessary. I can have my bitcoins protected by a 2-of-3 key scheme, where I have one key, an online service that does risk checking of transactions has another, and the third is in my safety deposit box. At no point can the service steal my funds, and a hacker would have to penetrate both my computer and the service to defeat the risk checks.
There are many other similar schemes that can be used. The great thing about bitcoin is that (with the proper tools), you have granular control over the security and ease of use spectrum.

Well, that would be difficult to do, and even then it would compromise privacy. They'd have to know which outputs belong to you, which means they'd either need your root public key, or at least the public keys which currently have unspent outputs. The Trezor doesn't store those because it would need the whole block chain to validate those outputs, so it only stores keys and performs signatures. You'd either have to carry your public keys around separately or the Trezor would need a way to provide the public keys on request (confirmed by the screen). Then the merchant software would have to scan the entire blockchain for unspent outputs and build the transaction for you to sign. Not impossible, but I find it to be an awkward solution.

You think the developers, the ones who are most intimately familiar with the technical aspects of bitcoin, are not suitable to make decisions, but the community at large who mostly know very little about it are? I don't understand this at all.

~~I think your understanding of the payment protocol's payment receipt is incorrect. After submitting payment to the merchant, you are given a payment acknowledgement signed by their certificate. This absolutely proves that you made the payment to the script given in their payment request, which could not have been changed by an attacker.~~

Luckily, despite lots of talk to the contrary, bitcoin isn't a democracy and it doesn't really rely on a majority. Yes, the blockchain state is determined by consensus, but when there is a split consensus, one chain doesn't force the other to get in line, there become two chains which may coexist for all time.

Currently each bitcoin can be split into 10^8 parts, but it's not feasible to transaction in individual satoshis (again, currently). There's no reason why the protocol couldn't be changed to have higher resolution, but your claim is not true of Bitcoin as it exists today.

When you spend them, do you import the private key your every day computer? If so, you are putting yourself at risk of malware sweeping the key faster than you. To safely spend paper wallets you need to...
* Generate and print them from an offline computer
* Gather the unspent outputs and create the unsigned transaction on your normal computer, **making sure** that change goes to a **new** paper wallet (don't reuse a paper wallet)
* Import the private key on an offline computer
* Transfer the unsigned transaction to the offline computer, **verify it**, sign it, transfer it back, and broadcast it (using USB for this step is risky since malware on your computer can rewrite the firmware on the USB drive to infect your offline computer)
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:26:07

The fee to get into the next block is currently $0.36 for a standard transaction. A $36 transaction fee is more than a wire transfer, and means bitcoin will be useless. Your vision of what bitcoin should be is moronic. Bitcoin must be a good medium of exchange in order to be a good store of value.

There are a couple of reasons...
If ECDSA is ever broken (private keys can be computed from public keys), normal addresses aren't susceptible since they only contain a public key hash. But the moment you spend, your public key is known.
Once you import your private key onto a computer, the chances of a copy being made increase, so it is prudent to not use any paper wallet more than once.

@_date: 2016-03-21 20:16:51
You make so many assumptions it's difficult to know where to even start.
* Increasing the max block size will increase the median block size
* The current ratio of users to full nodes is the upper bound of what is optimal
* There is no overlap between the groups of miners/transaction-makers and full node operators
* 2 MB is the largest max block size that is affordable to full node operators
* Increasing the number of possible transaction-makers will not increase the number of full nodes
* Miners would, if unchecked, alter the subsidy schedule (effectively destroying bitcoin)
* Fewer full nodes is actually a problem (Satoshi did not seem bothered by a possible future where full nodes were hosted in data centers)

Actually, it's the opposite. It means you have *much more* say, since you can immediately cease paying any organization that operates in a way you disagree with. With a state, all you can do is vote, and voting is incredibly ineffective, which I think is pretty self evident given the current state of the U.S. (the bastion of "democracy"), the levels of voter turnout, and the ratio of unelected bureaucratic positions to elected ones.

Instead of doing it all at once, you should consider selling off more bitcoin than you need to subsist and slowly build your savings through cash deposits.

A bitcoin transaction can only have 684 signatures on it, so that is the maximum number of pledges for a Lighthouse project. The minimum pledge is equal to RequestedValue / 684. In the future, it may be smart enough to divided the remaining value needed by the remaining signatures available, so if there are large donors, they will drive down the minimum pledge.

No, in the U.S. the police practice (and the courts have upheld) a ridiculous process called "civil asset forfeiture". If the police *suspect* you of a crime, they may take certain types of property (mainly cash). In order to get your property back, you must *prove* that you obtained it through legal channels. They don't even have to *charge* you with a crime in order to do this, never mind convict you.

Lighthouse doesn't have support for nested projects, no. However, in the future the minimum pledge amount could be adjusted with the following formula:

Sorry if that wasn't clear. I was saying that a satoshi is the smallest addressable unit of bitcoin, and there are 100 per bit (micro bitcoin). The intent was showing what happens if you treat a bit as the "base" unit (rather than bitcoin), so that there are the same number of decimal places as fiat currencies. Which is that there are more of those usable units in the bitcoin system than currently exist in fiat currency. That number is 21,000,000 * 1,000,000 = 21,000,000,000,000 (21 trillion) bits.

Since this conversation is about "Individual tech nerds", thank you for validating my point.
Devices like the Trezor will make securing bitcoins easy for *everybody*, because it comes down to securing a physical object (the paper backup with the seed on it).
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:10:20


Except you have to enter your password on your computer in order to use the Trezor. If you're assuming someone can get physical access to your Trezor, open it, and mess with the circuits in order to brute force the PIN, then it seems safe to assume someone can plant a keylogger on your computer.

I believe that most people who knowingly infringe on copyrights, myself included, would happily pay a reasonable sum for the works if they are of high quality, and if the money went to the actual creators, not some obsolete middle men.

The memory utilization [mentioned by Gavin]( was the size of the UXTO set, which has nothing to do with the mining algorithm. This is something that all full nodes need to keep in memory or other low latency storage in order to minimize the amount of time required to verify that transactions are valid. The other worry is that large blocks will not propagate well through the network, which again has nothing to do with algorithm used to find a valid block.

BIP 70 (payment protocol) support is planned, so the Trezor *will* be able to protect against MITM attacks for sites that make use of it (which should be all of them).


Once you receive the Trezor, you can download the signed firmware from SatoshiLabs and flash it yourself. I think you're somewhat confused though, it sounds like you're talking about BadUSB, which isn't an issue with the Trezor because it only* accepts signed firmware.

The capacity increase from SegWit only happens once essentially every piece of wallet software in the entire ecosystem upgrades.
And it also effectively quadruples the max_block_size. Centralization!
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:01:02
It's like Kickstarter (all or nothing fundraising), but without a central party to hold your money until the project is funded.
It does this using something called an "assurance contract" (the general term for the all or nothing model). The person who wants money creates a bitcoin transaction with an output to an address they control, and no inputs. This means the transaction is invalid. Anyone who wants to give them money attaches an input to the transaction and signs it. When they collect enough inputs to cover the value of the output, then the transaction is valid and it can be broadcast over the bitcoin network, transferring them to the person raising funds.

You can, but every transaction you do leaks information from the two factor card. Eventually smart malware would be able to bypass it completely.
When they launch their second factor phone app, it should be better, if you trust that your phone isn't also compromised.

The bootloader is locked from the factory, it cannot be changed to accept non-signed firmware. Well, perhaps it can, but not while keeping the Trezor intact.
I'm sure you'll say that an attacker could intercept your package and replace it with a perfect replica of a Trezor with malicious bootloader/firmware to make it appear as if it was a real Trezor. Yes, this is possible, but if it were a real concern SatoshiLabs could add more physical protections against this.

I think one order of magnitude is readily explainable by users who never wanted to run full nodes switching to light clients when the option was available.

Also, we are currently at 5599 nodes, down only 6% from 5863 in July. This to me is evidence that the increasing block sizes isn't really a problem, or if it is, not for very many users.

Thank you, I don't understand why you couldn't have done that in the first place.
I'm not seeing where this validates your 2 MB claim though. SegWit still allows for only 1 MB of normal bitcoin transactions. If *every* transaction in a block is SegWit (which I don't think will happen for a very long time), then (4 MB - 80 B) of transactions can fit. This is not the same as a 2 MB block size (hence why I said I thought you were being disingenuous), and I'm still not understanding where that number came from.
As an aside, do you support SegWit since it increases the maximum amount of block data (with all SegWit transactions) to 4 MB?

Because of two related reasons:

2. Tools that counted nodes counted those wallets whether or not they properly forwarded ports (and actually acted like a full node) or not, and whether they were up a significant amount of time or not.
Basically, we were counting the nodes wrong before. The only thing that should count as a node is one that has a good uptime, and allows incoming connections.

There are some good reasons to use an address only once, but it's not critical that you do that all the time. The main drawback from a security standpoint is that the full public key is in the blockchain after you spend from an address. This means that a quantum computer could potentially calculate your private key from the public key. Not really a big worry for the near future.

I want the price to go up too, but I think that unless bitcoin is an excellent medium of exchange, it will never be a good store of value.

It still needs peer review. Unless you think running untested code in production is a good thing? In which case you will *love* BU.

Nodes keep a map of all of the public channels they know about. You can dump the entire set using a command like `lncli describegraph`.


Yes, but that measurement isn't what you think it is, `channel_update` messages. Instead that is just their feed (and count) of not just updated, but newly created and (probably) closed channels. Look at their [Last Updated Channels list]( to see that it's mostly brand new channels.

What's far more important than the actual amount of inflation is how the inflation rate is decided and how it's determined.

A transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs. Each output has a value, and each input references a *prior* output.
The way miners ensure you have enough bitcoin is that the sum of all your outputs is less than or equal to the sum of all your inputs (previous output values).
The way they ensure the transaction is valid is that it doesn't use as inputs any output that has already been used as input to another transaction. Also that you provided the proof of ownership required to spend your inputs.

Anarchy: An (not) + archos (authority/ruler)
Anarchy does not preclude cooperation, rules, or leadership. It only means a social structure over which there is no ultimate authority. Nation states exist in a state of anarchy with respect to each other because there is no ultimate authority over all nation states. Anarchists merely believe that the *size* of organizational units existing in a state of anarchy should be decreased down to the individual.
Bitcoin has rules, but it has no ruler. So yes, it is an example of an functional anarchic system.

No, your position is infinitely dumber.
The reality is that most merchants aren't ready to accept bitcoin, and certainly in no position (even if they wanted) to demand their suppliers accept it or their employees receive it as pay.
While instant exchange on payment is a crutch for sure, it's a necessary one and it should be embraced, not vilified. Without it, far fewer merchants would be willing to accept bitcoin at all.
You need to remember that bitcoin is both a unit of account **and** a payment network. You don't need to drink the kool-aid on bitcoin replacing fiat currency in order to benefit from the usefulness of the payment network. Using it only as a payment network can actually *lead* to adoption as a unit of account as well. So arguing out such use is pure unadulterated stupidity.
Your point that fiat has volatility, not bitcoin is even more asinine. Businesses care about volatility on time scales of minutes to months, not decades. Fiat volatility is a slow, constant downward trend that can easily be anticipated in almost all situations by businesses. Crypto volatility is wild and unpredictable on a minute to minute basis.
In short, go fuck off with this gatekeeping attitude. Crypto is useful for everyone, no matter how they use it. Trying to limit it to "true believers" is just shooting yourself in the foot and killing adoption.

False. Changing bitcoin's divisibility does not have a negative event on savings. It is in no way equivalent to inflation.

In order for me to provide a counterargument, you would have done something other than make baseless assertions in the first place.


No it's not, bitcoin is in a long transition from an inflationary currency to a steady-state one. A deflationary currency is one where the supply decreases over time. The only one I'm aware of that attempted anything like this is Freicoin, which used demurrage (negative interest rate on account balances) to pay miners. Unsurprisingly it failed to reach popularity.
I understand why you'd say that though, as bitcoin approaches steady-state, increases in productivity lead to lower prices. But that does make bitcoin a deflationary currency.


Not at all, but I'm open to you providing evidence to support this assertion. Gas is priced in tenths of a cent, even though there are no tenth cents. Other things too, where you buy large quantities at a time. What is the price of a grain of rice, in dollars? You can't hold those tiny fractions of a dollar in your hand or bank account, but that doesn't limit the value of a dollar in any way.


Again you're absolutely wrong, an impressive 0 for 3 record.
Debasement was essentially inflation of hard currency, invented thousands of years before fiat currency. It was the process by which a royal mint would reduce the amount of precious metal in a coin under its face value. This is in no way similar to increasing the divisibility of a digital currency.

Interference with lightning doesn't affect the bitcoin.
Even if a hub is shut down, user funds won't be lost since they are in hashed timelocked contracts.
Hubs also need to be full nodes, so lower hardware requirements help them, but the capital tied up in the channels probably significantly outweighs that of the node's hardware. I'm sure there will be AML/KYC regulated hubs and those run on the darknet.

Every time you receive Bitcoin, you get one or more outputs. You can think of these like individual bank notes or coins. When you want to spend Bitcoin, you gather up your outputs and use them as inputs in the transaction. You have to reference each output and provide a signature  for it, which takes up space. So if you receive 1 BTC in one output, it will cost less to spend than 1 BTC in 100 outputs.
Back to the coin analogy, it costs less postage to mail a single dollar coin than 100 pennies.

Currently, SegWit outputs are wrapped in a P2SH script, so they are indistinguishable from any other P2SH output until they are redeemed, at which point they attach their witness to the input.
In the future, there will be support for native SegWit outputs, both P2WPKH and P2WSH. There will also be a new address format called bech32 that is superior to the current format in many ways. This is the address format that will encode native SegWit outputs.

So buy a different hardware wallet then.


Trezor tried that model when they first launched, but wallet developers were slow to implement support. So they made their own wallet. Over the years as new coins were supported, it didn't make any sense to have hardware but no wallet support, so they added it to their wallet. I imagine it progressed similarly for Ledger.
Further, you know that if there's an issue with the wallet that causes a loss of funds, the hardware device manufacturer is going to be blamed. At least if they have their own support, it's not implicit endorsement for third party services.

They are sufficient from a financial standpoint. I would argue that they are far superior in fact. You are correct that you lose any notes about transactions but that is far secondary to having access to funds.

For the record, I think taxation of any kind is morally equivalent to theft. I think both taxes and geographical monopolies on the use of force (governments) are both immoral and a net negative on humanity.
I think there are ways of organizing society and funding public works that are both more ethical **and** more efficient.
So, I disagree with your argument that governments **can't** operate without income taxation. But even if you are correct, I'm fine with that because I don't think governments should exist at all.
If you want to understand how such a society could *possibly* work, that's a different discussion altogether and I'd urge you to take the initiative and try to learn about it yourself. I can provide some jumping off points if you're interested.

Do fees based on the size of the transaction in bytes make more sense? To a new user no, but it makes total sense when you realize what you're paying for, which is full node bandwidth, memory, and disk storage.
Those are not concerns with Lightning. What is of concern is keeping balanced channels which requires tying up capital. The larger your payment, the more capital which is used, so it makes perfect sense for fees to be based on value. This is a *great* thing in fact because it means no use-case is ever priced out by fees.
If you're worried about percentage fees being too high, I wouldn't since the barrier to entry into the channel market is *extremely* low. Basically all you need is some bitcoin and a well connected node.

[Assurance contracts]( which are something that can be done natively with bitcoin script.

You pass this around, people add their inputs to the transaction and partial signature (if you can convince them to pay), and if you are able to collect 25 BTC worth of inputs, the transaction becomes valid.

That's now how Nakamoto consensus works. It only determines which of a number of *valid* chains have the most proof of work. Since SegWit2x is planning on making itself incompatible with Bitcoin, it will no longer be considered as valid chain by the majority of nodes.

When SegWit outputs are spent, only 25% of their size counts toward the 1 MB limit. This makes SegWit transactions cheaper since they are smaller. It also leaves more room in the 1 MB block space for other transactions.
Fees probably will be the same for a while then slowly decrease as SegWit is used more. Transactions which have many inputs will have significantly lower fees. These include multisig contracts and those which consume many small outputs.

Looking at the entire blockchain is what's disingenuous, since BCH shares BTC's history up until the fork. What you should look at is post-fork stats.
Since the fork, 64,250 new BCH have been created, compared to 44,237.5 BTC. That is a 1.5x inflation since the fork.
However, if you look at only the period since BCH mining became profitable, the inflation rate is 5-7x higher than BTC.

A hard fork is a consensus rule change that is incompatible with existing software. Removing rules or changing existing rules requires a hard fork. Non upgraded nodes get split off onto their own chain.
A soft fork is a consensus rule change that is compatible with existing software. Soft forks can generally only add new rules. Non upgraded nodes may not be able to validate the new rules, but they can continue operating on the same chain.

If users don't want a hard fork, and miners mine their own chain, then users have two options. Upgrade for the hard fork they don't want, or hard fork the proof of work algorithm. Both equally disruptive forks, but one is way worse for miners.

When speaking of hard forks, yes. Soft forks add additional consensus rules in a way that tricks older software into thinking it understands, but it doesn't. You have no way of continuing on with using bitcoin as you did before. With a hard fork, the network may split but nobody can force you onto their chain fork.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:57:44

What are you talking about? 1 MB wasn't specified in the white paper, that is true. I would argue that Satoshi's implementation is more important than the white paper since it did not describe the system in full detail. Before Satoshi implemented the *explicit* 1 MB max block size as a consensus rule, there was an *implicit* consensus rule of a 32 MB block size.
What consensus rule means if that if you break that rule, you become your own blockchain. Just like Bitcoin Cash.

This is just wrong.
BIP141 - SegWit is **not** locked in *or* activated
BIP91 - SegWit2x is activated - this is the activation mechanism for SegWit, it triggers miners running BIP91 code to orphan non-BIP141 signalling blocks

There are private keys and public keys. Private keys are used to digitally sign transactions, public keys are derived from private keys. An address can be derived from a public key.
Private keys can be created randomly or deterministically. The former means that each key is independent of the rest, the latter means that each key is derived from some root key. Deterministic is better because you can back up the root key once and never have to worry about losing any keys.
With a hardware wallet or any software which uses a mnemonic (seed words, backup phrase), the root key is encoded into a series of words, which makes it very easy to write down or possibly even memorize.
This is why hardware wallets are so great. After you just back up the mnemonic during setup, the keys never leave the device. Compared to a paper wallet, spending is easier and safer. You can use multiple passphrases for deniability ("password" leads to a wallet with 1 BTC while "strong password" leads to a wallet with 100 BTC).

What you should do is use a walker with Coin Control (such as Electrum) to spend each of your unspent outputs to a new SegWit address in its own transaction. This way you maintain the same level of privacy.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:19:49
Minor correction. Its dependent on the number of transactions in the mempool with a fee per byte *equal to or greater* than yours. Transactions paying less have little to no impact.
However, up until BCH's EDA kicked in, the hash rate and thus block timing were relatively consistent. So almost all times were "when blocks are fast, hashpower is high".
@_date: 2018-10-06 19:46:32

There is fundamentally no difference between selling your coins for fiat and purchasing something, versus purchasing something directly with bitcoin. Yes there are companies like Overstock that hodl and pay their employees with it, but 99.9% of all Bitcoin accepting businesses use a merchant processor like Copay or Coinbase, and they sell received coins on the market.
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:32:54
I'm 90% sure that just by spending a SegWit output you get the fee reduction. It's up to the wallet to correctly calculate the lower fee, which Trezor Wallet does (using vsize rather than size).
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:12:44
Then it's not an off chain transaction. And anyone who accesses your safety deposit box can steal all your bitcoin. It's strictly worse than a BIP38 paper wallet in this case.

No, 2MB is *best* case until there is a massive shift toward larger multi-sig contracts. Hopefully by that time we'll be using Schnorr signatures, which take up less signature space, so that extra space is lost.

The same cost as doing a single transaction, and you can do much more than a single transaction over a Lightning channel. In fact you can even close and open a channel with one transaction, meaning the total overhead for using Lightning could be just *one* transaction on the blockchain.

To elaborate, *multipath payments* allow your wallet to automatically break up a large payment into a number of smaller payments that can be sent out over multiple channels. The key point is that they're *atomic* though, which means that either the payment succeeds or fails as a whole, it cannot be stuck partially paid.

Yes, in order to get the benefit immediately, you must *use SegWit transactions*.

SegWit gives us 3 MB of extra space to use for witness data. Of course not all of that will be available at first, but as less witness data is allocated to the other 1 MB, it frees up space for more non-witness data or normal transactions.
The 2x hard fork multiplies *this* by two, so it allows for 6 MB of witness data and 2 MB of non-witness data. I think this is too big *right now*.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:20:09

@_date: 2017-08-11 06:09:49


That's a false dichotomy. Core's [scaling roadmap]( has always called for a hard fork base block size increase, *once we can be more sure it is safe*. The ways we do that are by making better use of the current block size while fixing some outstanding issues that cause bottlenecks. New features like SPV fraud proofs offset the increased costs of running a full node with increased security of an SPV node. All this serves to decrease the amount of uncertainty about the effects of larger blocks.


@_date: 2017-08-25 14:11:31
Yes, that's correct. One nice thing about SegWit is that you only have to pay for 25% of a SegWit input's signature data. So if all of your outputs are SegWit, you'll pay far less in fees to combine them.

* A tipping bot allows you to tip people who don't even have a bitcoin wallet yet
* Tipping can happen off-chain, perhaps in the future through the lightning network
Actually now that I think of it, social media tipping is an excellent use case for LN. With ChangeTip you deposited funds into their centralized wallet, so an open LN channel to ChangeTip is a strictly better implementation.

That transactions are anonymous. There is of course no identity data on the blockchain, but if you buy something physical or provide your identity to an exchange, that links you to a transaction on the blockchain. From there, analysis may result in linking other, unrelated transactions to your identity.
So be careful. Never reuse addresses. Never mix coins from different pseudonymous identities. Don't give out your ID unless you need to. Practice coin control.

You don't open a channel to make a purchase, that makes no sense and uses more on-chain capacity than just making the purchase directly.

If the miners decide to change the consensus rules and implement 2x, they will fork from all the other nodes not running 2x rules anyway. This change just makes it so the network topology doesn't change suddenly at the time of the fork, but at the time Core nodes are upgraded to 0.15.0.

Lightning transactions are real bitcoin. They're just locked into a smart contract that acts as a mini ledger. This ledger can be updated as often as you want (billions of times per second) and then settled to the bitcoin blockchain at any time.

You can close one channel and open another in a single transaction. So theoretically there is a one time transaction fee overhead per channel.

I would recommend, if you don't already, use a wallet that lets you set custom fees (and Replace By Fee). If you can wait hours for your transaction to be confirmed, set a low fee, like 50 satoshis per byte. I've had transactions as low as 2.6 satoshis per byte confirm eventually. If it's taking too long to confirm, replace the transaction with a slightly higher fee version.
Obviously the limited block space is the primary cause of higher fees, but wallet fee estimation is just broken and that's another big part of it.

The Bitcoin blockchain will never again be usable for microtransactions. For that you'll have to use a second layer system.

And actually, I think your definition of hard fork is *slightly* incorrect. By definition, blocks that are valid *after* the fork and not valid to old nodes. However, old style blocks aren't *necessarily* invalid. For instance raising the max block size (or weight, with SegWit) is a hard fork. Yet blocks that have a lower size or weight are valid for an upgraded node.
The term "chain split" is generally used to refer to long-lived splits, like BCH or ETH. I've not heard that term used in reference to normal 1 or 2 blocks orphans.

That was the original proposal, and it's not saying there *cannot be* a hard fork, it's saying *their* hard fork will only occur if SegWit activates.
The actual agreement is [here]( and *all* that the signatories agreed to do was:
* Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4
* Activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months
That's it. Nothing else. That's *all* they *agreed* to do.

You should back up your opinion with facts.
Bitcoin worked perfectly well when they're wasn't a persistent pool of unconfirmed pending transactions. The 1MB limit was never intended as an economic policy.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:18:24
No, he's saying don't use SegWit transactions because the "extra" block space we got from SegWit can only be used by segregated witness data. So if blocks are full of SegWit transactions, there will be more of them and their witness data will increase the *actual* block size larger than 1 MB. What most consider to be a soft forked gradual capacity increase, Luke considers to be a step "backwards" to larger blocks.

Your version is ready for SegWit even though it's not active. I haven't used Core as a wallet in a long time so I'm not sure how receiving works. You're right it's about the outputs, but I just user tx as a shorthand.
As far as I'm aware the new P2WPKH (pay to witness public key hash) address type isn't implemented yet, so SegWit outputs will be to a P2SH (pay to script hash) for now. I'm not sure how you generate SegWit addresses, check the release notes maybe.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:38:03
Yes, in fact there are &gt;40k LTC worth almost $2M sitting in a [Litecoin SegWit output]( You can only tell a transaction is SegWit once it's spent, so this is the only one I *know*.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:12:19
That's not what was meant. There may be a config setting that is preventing miners from mining SegWit blocks having a total size greater than 1 MB, which is now allowed under the SegWit rules.

They already are, you just have to catch them! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:14:58
I don't mean that transaction volume doesn't warrant a larger size, but that I'm not convinced a larger size is safe. I think we're at the point now that demand for block space will always outpace supply, so taking demand into account without considering how raising supply affects the system as a whole is a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:56:22
* The blockchain goes through regular periods when it is unusable (no blocks for hours)
* With much faster average block times, it will hit the next halving early (maybe years?), cutting profitability by 50% until Bitcoin's halving
* There's already talk of a hard fork to remove/change EDA, which will make it permanently unprofitable unless the prices goes higher than Bitcoin

That's because it's not active yet. Also, non-SegWit transactions can't use the new space (down side of a soft fork). However when SegWit transactions are spent, they leave more room for non-SegWit transactions.

First, you vastly overestimate the adoption rate of new versions of Bitcoin Core.
Second, you've got the entire thing perfectly backwards. People are using Bitcoin Core because they *trust* the judgement of the developers of that software. The same judgement that leads them to not supporting 2x.
So yes, if Core merged 2x people would run it, *because they trust the Core developers*. But Core isn't going to, so most people won't, again because they trust the Core developers.

Not really. When we started we matched the rate of Localbitcoins sellers, which was about 10%. They are our main competition; services like Coinbase and Circle are serving a different market from us for the most part.
Since then we've lowered our fees because we determined that we could and still remain profitable. Going lower would be extremely difficult since we are only able to reach a limited market without expending further capital. We've also got costs that neither Localbitcoins sellers (who often aren't compliant with AML regulations) and online services (who have no physical presence) have to deal with.
We've been seeing increasing volumes for the past 6 months, and that's volume of users as well as USD. If you think you can offer the service we do for less than 7%, I encourage you to do it! My goal is to driven out of business by the ubiquity of bitcoin and nobody needing to buy or sell it for fiat anymore. But until that time I plan on making a decent living making it as easy as possible to buy bitcoin.

You're clearly antagonistic to the very idea of a society not built on theft (taxation) or geographic monopolies on violence (government). So no, I'm not going to hold your hand and walk you through it while you constantly vomit whataboutisms at me. I've had that discussion far too many times already. If you're honestly interested in learning though, I will give you some starting points.
I think we could probably both agree that the most fundamental services governments provide are a system of law and law enforcement. I really like David Friedman's thoughts on how a polycentric legal system could work. That's a legal system with no central authority defining or enforcing the laws. I believe this would be a much more adaptive and fair legal system than anything a government has ever provided.
**[Read]( or [watch](

Sure, but...


It's not the most secure wallet at least not from a key management standpoint, because it uses randomly generated keys stored on disk. A hardware wallet would be far more secure because its keys never leave the device and the entire thing can be backed up by writing 24 words on paper one time.
If you're worried about bitcoin rule validation, unfortunately Core isn't compatible with hardware wallets, and I'm not sure it will ever be. You could use Copay or Electrum and run your own server on top of Core, but indexing the blockchain about doubles the disk usage.

It's actually pretty clever. They look and see if encrypted network traffic spikes around the same time as new blocks being found. If there are frequent spikes around the time blocks are found, it probably means the encrypted traffic is going to a bitcoin node.

If all you want is 2 MB blocks, then you'll love with SegWit. It has 3 MB of extra space for witness data. Once transactions start using that space (by spending SegWit outputs), it frees up space in blocks for more transactions. SegWit2x increases the base size to 2 MB and the witness data size to 6 MB. Those are potentially very big blocks.
SegWit could have been implemented *without* any block size increase at all. There would be no witness discount and thus no additional space for witness data. But it wasn't, because SegWit is already a compromise. SegWit2x was *intended* to keep the community whole, but it after BCH it is already fractured. The only reason to continue forward with it is to fracture the community further.
By all means, we'll need to increase the block size further in the future. I do think we should wait until we have a long period of time for testing and adoption, though. I'd also like to see further efficiency improvements first, to offset the increased costs that larger blocks bring. SPV proofs would be another great feature to have before a hard fork, so that security is improved even when not running a full node.

If we assume this happens immediately after a difficulty adjustment, the normally two week long period will take 140 days. Afterward, the difficulty will get decreased by a factor of 4, which means the next period will take 35 days. After that we will be back at equilibrium.

I'm not at all convinced by the argument that gold is money because of the high stock to flow ratio. After all, gold doesn't act as money today, and do we know what the stock to flow ratio was hundreds to thousands of years ago?
Instead it makes way more sense to look at the chemical properties of different elements. If you do so, you'll find that there are only a few candidates for money. Everything else is either difficult to handle, radioactive, corrosive, reacts with oxygen, or otherwise unsuitable for money.
You end up with 5 precious metals that meet the criteria for money: platinum, palladium, rhodium, silver, and gold. Of those, we've only known about and had the technology to smelt silver and gold until recently. Silver tarnishes over time, leaving gold as the only remaining element capable of serving as money at the time the world standardized on it.

No, a 51% attack guarantees that given a long enough period of time, the attacker chooses which blocks are included.

Nope. The only parties that even know of a routed payment are the sender, receiver, and the nodes along the route. But those nodes only know that the amount, the prior hop, and the next hop.

Previously, you could only use lnd's built in pathfinding algorithm. Now you can create your own, or manually find a route, then specify that route using the sendtoroute command. Notably this allows you to find a route from one of your channels to another, which opens up the possibility of rebalancing your own channels.
Suppose you have two channels, A can receive but not send (you have no balance), B can send but not receive (you have the entire balance). With this you can do something like send half your B balance to the A channel, so that they **both** can send *and* receive.

If you're only spending, never receiving, then it's actually more secure. Lightning transactions are instantaneously irreversible, whereas on-chain transactions need to be confirmed before they are secure. Keep in mind that there's nothing stopping a miner from including the a double spend instead of the original transaction in a block.


The way you stated the question leads me to believe you don't really understand the mempool. It doesn't matter how many transactions are in the backlog, it *only* matters how many bytes of transactions pay a higher fee than I'm willing to pay.
Lightning channels need to be confirmed, obviously. It's no worse than on-chain transactions in that scenario.

The signature that `OP_CHECKSIG` consumes contains a byte called SIGHASH. This value determines (for each input/signature in a transaction) which inputs and outputs the signature covers.
* `SIGHASH_ALL` all inputs and outputs
 * Default, nobody can change your transactions
* `SIGHASH_NONE` all inputs but no outputs
 * Anyone can change your outputs (redirect to their own address)
* `SIGHASH_SINGLE` only the output with same index as this input
 * Anyone can change all inputs and outputs except one pair
`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` is special, it's a modifier that makes those other types behave differently, by only covering the single input:
* `SIGHASH_ALL | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` only this input, all outputs
 * Useful for smart contracts, allows anyone to add or remove other inputs, but not change outputs
* `SIGHASH_NONE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` only this input, no outputs
* `SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` only this input, and the output with the same index

Yes, a backlog that was caused almost entirely by the *final* EDA handout to miners by Bitcoin Cash, and the minor hysteria which followed that. Thanks to their hard fork, that won't ever happen again, since it will always adjust quickly to increases in hashpower.
Right now you can get a normal transaction confirmed in the next few blocks with a 30 satoshi/byte fee. That works out to about $0.40 for a 2 standard input 2 output transaction. Yet there's still this narrative (primarily on that standard Bitcoin fees are $10+.

Schnorr doesn't help here, because that only lets you combine signatures, not inputs. It would make the proof much smaller though.

I think the better metric is `sum([len(tx.outputs) - 1 for tx in daily_transactions])`
So basically, for every transaction take the number of outputs minus one (for likely change), those are likely all Individual payments. Sum this number and it's the total payments per day. This takes into account batch transactions like exchanges use, where one transaction may pay hundreds of individual users.

I'm not at all convinced that's a relative metric. Consider that anyone could trivially send out tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions pay 1 satoshi/byte (100,000 txs * 250 bytes * 1 satoshi/byte = 0.25 BTC). With functional fee estimation algorithms, these transactions should not increase fees for anyone paying more than 1 satoshi/byte.
I think the best metric is the [number of bytes of transactions]( (or more precisely, weight) at each fee level in the mempool. So yes there are currently ~5k unconfirmed transactions which totals 5 MB, but there's less than 1 MB of transactions paying more than 2 satoshis/byte.
@_date: 2019-02-16 13:24:21
It already does. What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:03:02
The best way I've found is to take a look at the [mempool]( You can filter out the large volume of really low fee transactions by clicking on the ranges in the legend. By doing that you can see that transactions paying 30-40 satoshis/byte are getting included in blocks, so it should be safe to set your fee to that level. Maybe make the transaction replaceable in case there's an influx of higher fee paying transactions.

Closing a channel consumes an unspent output and creates one or more outputs. Opening a channel creates an output. Nowhere does it say that it has to be a whole transaction.
The idea is that if you're already doing an on chain transaction, you can use that opportunity to piggyback transaction openings, closings, or other operations into that transaction. This is beneficial because transactions have a fixed overhead, adding inputs and outputs is relatively inexpensive.

Number of nodes has been declining steadily for a long time. There was a time when even "full" nodes that weren't accepting incoming connections were counted, and now they are not. It's also not an easy thing to run a full node, either you have to have a computer that is always on with internet connection (as I do, a media server), or you have to rent a cloud host.
There's also the *fact* that bandwidth has been growing too. My ~$50/month Charter plan recently got upgraded to 100 MBps download (still like 5-10 upload, but I'll take what I can get).
The end result is that the majority of users who do not run nodes do so because of other technical reasons, not because the blockchain could eventually grow at 160 GB per year instead of 20 GB per year (current rate).

Can you clarify here? If demand is greater than the supply of block space, then there is *no* fee estimation algorithm that leads to every transaction getting into the next block.


You assume every transaction needs to get into the next block. More accurate fee estimation prevents runaway estimators like those I've seen recently paying 2000+ satoshis/byte which drive up prices for everyone. It also allows those who have low priority transactions to accurately predict a low fee which will eventually get confirmed, which *frees up* next block space for those who do have high priority transactions.

I agree though, having additional protections on the seed would be great. I'm a huge fan of built-in shamir's secret sharing. So you write down N sets of seed words instead of just one, and you need M of them to reconstruct the seed. Then you can hide one in a safety deposit box, one in a safe, a few (&lt;M) to trusted friends, bury some, etc.

I don't like that definition. An inflationary currency is one that increases in number. This describes bitcoin right now. The difference is that the inflation is known and agreed to in advance. No economic changes or political pressure can change the rate of inflation (short of a hard fork, but that's arguably not Bitcoin).
A deflationary currency is one that decreases in number over time. Something like Freicoin which uses demurrage (negative interest rate on balances) as an economic tool. You could potentially argue that Bitcoin is deflationary because coins are lost over time but I find that pretty weak. If dollars are destroyed by fire that doesn't make the dollar deflationary. And besides those coins still exist, they could be "recovered" by brute forcing the search through the private key space (think quantum computers) or calculating the private key from a re-used signature.
A stable currency is one that neither increases nor decreases in number over time. Bitcoin is tending toward this model via halvings of the block reward.
Now, a stable currency in a growing economy *appears* deflationary, because its purchasing power increases over time as the economy becomes more efficient. But to say that this makes the currency inflationary is to make the same mistake as to point at increasing prices and call that monetary inflation (which is the cause, not the effect).

"Working" yes, but *constantly* increasing the supply of money. If the supply of a thing is increasing and the demand remains constant, what happens to the value of the thing?
What the Federal Reserve did at its inception was to institutionalize what is essentially fraudulent business practices. Prior to the central bank, operating under fractional reserve was risky, because of the risk of a bank run. Now bank runs are less frequent but the entire financial system is built upon this house of cards.
What happens if something causes U.S. citizens to suddenly doubt that the central bank can effectively shore up against a widespread series of bank runs? It will accelerate the bank runs (making things worse) or possibly just lead to a transfer of wealth into crypto.

Yes, Bitpay/Copay wallets use private keys only on the device, with mnemonic or file backup, and also supports multi-sig.

P2Pool uses a share chain, which is like the blockchain, but with a lower difficulty. The miner who finds the valid block has no choice but to include proportional payouts based on shares in the share chain in the coinbase transaction of the block.

What would be cooler is buying ownership of the 210,000th block's coinbase output. There could be a service that auctioned off coinbases, and supplied pools with the winning public key, such that the pools then would use that public key for the coinbase output instead of their own. Participating pools could offer their users a higher rate of return, as coinbase outputs could potentially be worth more than their face value due to their lack of history. For significant blocks such as these, they could be worth significantly more.

The whole point of this is that you don't really care what the machine's rate is, because you never fill or empty it with cash or bitcoins, but you make a small fee on every trade. Sometimes the rate will differ wildly from the "real" exchange rate, but that's ok.
In your scenario, after the sale of bitcoin, the machine now has a larger cash than bitcoin balance. It will try to correct this by offering a discount for customers selling bitcoin to the machine, and adding a markup for buying. The longer or greater the imbalance, the greater the discount and markup.
I think this would only work in an area where bitcoin use is more  widespread than it is in most places today. There have to be enough machines and enough people trading that they can execute arbitrage across machines. So for example, another machine across town just had a bunch of bitcoins sold to it, so it's buying price is lower to attract cash. Someone could buy bitcoins at that machine, sell them to the other machine and make a profit, balancing out both machines' balances.

It doesn't have to be a single computer. A far fetched, but possible scenario is an attacker that doesn't care about financial gain (or even does) spending a significant amount of money fabbing a bunch of specialized ASIC miners. They would potentially be significantly more energy and space efficient than traditional miners, at least until the technology leaked (I'm confident it would) at which point their advantage would deteriorate.

If the developers ever made a bad rule mandatory, a software fork could be created that disregards the rule. This would trigger a permanent block chain fork, but I'm not so sure that would be a horrible thing. There would from that point exist Bitcoin1 and Bitcoin2 which shared some history but increasingly less over time.
I'm not sure if that's even a concern in this case. The receiver is the one that creates the address, and thus the payment script. The sender doesn't even know what the payment rules are, they only know that the receiver will redeem the transaction with a script whose hash matches that in the address.

When bitcoin enthusiasts talk about inflation, what they're generally talking about is monetary inflation, that is an increase in the supply of money. This causes price inflation, because more money is chasing the same number of goods. However, it's not so clear cut the other way around. Bitcoin is also inflationary, but the rate of inflation is known in advance by all parties. This rate tends toward zero, but calling it deflationary is misleading and demonstrates to me a lack of understanding of the applicable concepts.

I find that almost all arguments for government would have applied just as well to the practice of slavery in a time before it fell out of favor. You know, the Greeks, even in their visions of utopia, could not imagine a world without slavery? In the same way, most people cannot even imagine a world without the coercive central authority we call government.


Not true. Without coercively funded, monopolistic police forces, the market would realize the demand for protection. I can't imagine how a competitive market would supply an inferior service than a monopoly. However, you could still choose to protect yourself if that is your preference, and I think many would do that as well.

In that case, you could cut MtGox out of the picture and use something like Armory's offline wallet feature. The nice thing about this method is that Armory uses a special deterministic wallet, that can be split into a public and private part. The public part can generate addresses without keeping the private part (through some elliptic curve crypto magic). So you keep the public part on your online computer, dole out addresses, and watch for payments. When you need to send funds, you create the unsigned transaction on the online computer, put it on a usb drive (or something), transfer it to the offline computer (sneakernet), sign, transfer back, and broadcast.
Though, I just realized that I don't think Armory has an API so you can't generate addresses programatically...

Theoretically, if you operated a large number of nodes, you could record the time at which you receive each block from every IP address. Then, you look for the IPs that transmit blocks to you first more often than average. I think. If that worked, you could potentially do the same with transactions.
However, this could easily be bypassed by using a VPN (which accepts Bitcoins, like Mullvad), or even just by connecting to trusted nodes instead of the network as a whole.

Not really, it takes on average about 10 minutes to get one confirmation. With the amount of resources necessary to rewrite even one block's worth of history, it's not likely that someone would do so for such a small amount.
You don't even necessarily need to wait for a single confirmation for very small amounts, or revocable goods or services. As long as you don't detect a double spent attempt within a few seconds of receiving the payment, it's unlikely that (unless the attacker has a mined block ready - a Finney Attack), a double spend will not occur.

Here's your confusion... with "intellectual property", making a copy of something does not harm the person from whom you made the copy.

For small amounts, waiting for confirmations is not necessary. This is because of the nature of the Bitcoin network. A node will only forward a transaction if it does not double spend a previously seen transaction's inputs. Let's say that each node forwards a transaction to eight of its peers, and this process happens every second.
Alice broadcasts a transaction for the specified amount to the address displayed on the vending machine (**tx1**). Three seconds later, she broadcasts a double spend of the inputs of the previous transaction to herself (**tx2**). If the double spend transaction makes it into the block, she will have gotten a free candy bar. Let's take a look at each transaction's propagation through the Bitcoin network.
           Nodes reached
    Time | tx1   | tx2
       0 | 0     | 0
       1 | 8     | 0
       2 | 64    | 0
       3 | 512   | 0
       4 | 4096  | 8
       5 | 32768 | 64
Keep in mind, that any node that has seen tx1 will ignore tx2. It is extremely unlikely that under these conditions, a double spend initiated after 3 seconds would make it into a block without the attacker preparing a block in advance, or controlling significant hashing power. Just like waiting for 6 confirmations means that the block containing the transaction is mathematically unlikely to be rewritten, waiting a few seconds can give you confidence that the transaction is mathematically unlikely to be double spent without the attacker using resources. If the cost of the item is less than the cost of the necessary resources to make such an attack worthwhile, then you don't need to wait for confirmations.

If you're using the Satoshi client, you only need to back up once your most recent backup is older than the oldest unused key. That sounds complicated, but there's an easy way to automate this. Just run the getinfo command against bitcoind or bitcoin-qt -server, and look at the "keypoololdest" field. This is a unix timestamp of the oldest key in the key pool. When this is newer than your most recent backup, you need to perform a backup.
I'd recommend looking into Armory though. It uses a deterministic wallet so you only need to back up once, and you can do so to paper. It's awesome.

It doesn't, this process would most likely take place at a payment processor of sorts that operated a large number of listening nodes and connected to a large number of miners. You would relay the transaction directly to them, they would listen for a sort time and tell you whether or not it is safe to accept the transaction. They'd probably guarantee that you get paid and have double spend insurance or something.


It's possible, but I find it unlikely for a number of reasons.
* Fees are very small compared to the block subsidy. 
* The rogue miners could not reliably accept those transactions into blocks unless they had a significant percentage of the hashing power.
* The rogue miners could potentially be shunned by the rest of the network.

You say your software is so useful that people will go out of their way to get bitcoins to purchase it, but I'm rather skeptical about that. What you could do instead is mark up the price, and then give a discount for Bitcoin users. This way you still sell to the people too lazy to buy bitcoins and some people buy bitcoins to take advantage of the discount.

Nodes won't accept a received transaction into memory if it is a double spend of one they received earlier. Thus, if you wait 10 seconds, it's far less likely that an attacker is doing a simple double spend. You also pass the transaction to a miner (or better, as many miners as possible) before you wait 10s, so that you ensure there's as little chance as possible that the attacker would do the same thing (pass his double spend directly to a miner).

Not exactly.


If someone acquires 51% of the computing power of the entire network (an amount more than the entirety of the interconnected, honest network) then the other 49% of the network will still find valid blocks and sometimes have the longest chain. That means that even a 51% attacker will only create roughly 51% of the blocks which make up the valid chain. These blocks must also still be considered valid by the rest of the network, or else they will reject them and no 51% attack occurs at all. So, they must still have the corresponding private key in order to create a valid spend transaction. **Someone controlling 51% of the network cannot create counterfeit transactions**. In fact, I would say the phrase "counterfeit transaction" is nonsensical.
Just to give you an idea, the difficulty is currently 1,508,589.67, with an estimated hash rate of 11,998.78 GH/s. Power consumption (based on 650 W/GH) is 187.18 megawatt hours. At 15 cents per kilowatt hour that's $28,077.15 per hour, or $20,889,399.60 per month. That gives you 50% of the network. In order to more effectively attack the network, say someone acquires 90% of network power. That's $188,004,596.40 per month.  Yes, I suppose a government could pay for that, but... I find it very unlikely. They're not that smart, they'll just make it illegal, and it will continue on with perhaps slightly fewer users.

This indicates a flawed understanding of the production of a bitcoin. Yes, no human labor is involved, but the work done by the miner is in fact useful. The bitcoins that are created through the mining process serve two purposes: initial distribution of bitcoins, and incentivizing the protection of the network. This subsidy gets cut in half roughly every four years, meaning that eventually there will be no more creation, and mining will be done by those with a vested interest in the network's security, or those who wish to collect transaction fees.

You are absolutely correct. This is why I cannot tolerate a system which legitimizes the rule of many by few. Those who tend toward "uncalled-for rude behavior and violence" flock to positions of power. Are not "dirty politician" jokes universally funny?


There is a demand for security, and thus the market will meet this demand. This is clear because the longer demand remains unmet, the higher the potential profit for a provider. Private security agencies would flourish in the absence of state monopoly. Look at any truly privatized sector of a former government monopoly and you will see the same thing over and over.


Oh? Really? In what size land mass? For how many individuals? One entity in the whole world? Or each neighborhood? If not the whole world, does it have to be geographically contiguous, or could it be a dispersed membership? Should those entities force certain individuals under threat of violence to provide payment, or should individuals choose which entity should "govern" them?
Anyway, stable? Do you truly consider this world-wide system of nation-states to be stable?


Well, states often settle their conflicts with acts of aggression. What's the difference between a state and a private defense agency? A state is perceived as legitimate when it coerces its citizens into funding its wars and conscripts them to fight their wars. Private defense agencies would have to justify to their members and shareholders the costs of war, which would be relatively tremendous. Any number of disputing defense agencies have a much stronger incentive to peacefully resolve the situation than do states.

If the level of saving in an asset leads to demand being greater than supply, then the price will go up. As the price rises, it will encourage some or all of those saving to sell some or all of their savings. This cycle repeats until supply meets demand, as it is a negative feedback loop, meaning that it is a stable system. As the price increases, the impetus to sell increases, which slows the rising price.
Humans value money as a means, not an end, as much as some people like to think so. That is why, even though electronic devices become ever powerful and cheap, people buy them today, because the utility of the device today is greater than the utility of the device tomorrow. It is infinitely greater than the utility of the device never.

This is not in response to you, I'm just using what you said as an interesting example.
This is exactly why early adopters "deserve" to profit greatly if Bitcoin becomes widespread. If they didn't take the early risks (time and fiat opportunity costs), then it will never succeed. Because they do, it might, and for that I think they "deserve" any potential profits.

"Intrinsic value" - not what the author thinks it means.
Gold only has value as money because of the same reason that Bitcoin has value as money:
1. It has properties that make it suitable for that purpose 
2. Some people (a lot in the case of gold) accept it in exchange for goods and services
The industrial uses of gold (in my opinion) have zero to do with its value as money.

Well, not quite. The difficulty can only go up or down by a factor of 4 every 2016 blocks. 1000 is about 1024, or 4^5, so it would take 5 difficulty adjustments (10,080 blocks) before the difficulty caught up. I don't think it's very likely that one person alone would have such technology, nor that it would be 1000x better than the current top end hashing equipment.

I think what they're saying is that banks without institutionalized fractional reserve banking look a lot different than they do today. In order to give a loan in bitcoin, you have to *actually* give away the bitcoin. There is a *real* risk and lost time value, meaning the cost of loans would be much higher.
Luckily, with a stable supply currency, you don't need an interest bearing account to save for the future. Naturally the cost of goods will decrease as the economy increases efficiency and productivity, increasing the purchasing power of your savings.
To me, this is why widespread bitcoin use will kill banks *as we know them*.

Maybe, but this is just speculation. Even if the allowed block chain size was doubled or tripled, I don't think most people running full nodes would even notice.


How do you come to this conclusion?
A larger block size means more room for transactions, which means more fees for miners. It's not a matter of how "full" the blocks are, but how many transactions and thus how many fees can be collected for each block.

Yes, but let's say I enter into a contract with you; you agree to upvote my comments, and I agree to pay you in Kentucky gold coins. Now let's say that you upvote my comments but I don't pay you, so you take me to court. The court will say, "chrisrico, you must pay GOETTA. GOETTA, you must accept federal reserve notes from chrisrico." Even though our original contract specified that I will pay you in gold, the court will force you to accept federal reserve notes (legal tender) if you want to be paid at all.
That's what "legal tender" means, that you *have* to accept it for the repayment of debts. Even if states pass their own legal tender laws, it still means that FRNs are legal tender as well. A better course of action would be to revoke all such laws and force debts to be paid in whatever denomination the contract specified.

Just to clarify, it's best practice to use an address only once, but it's often the case than an address will own multiple outputs.
Something the other poster didn't mention too, and the key reason why change is required... When a transaction spends an output (by using it as an input), it *must* be fully spent. If you had 1 BTC and spent 0.5 BTC but didn't include a change output, the remainder is added to the transaction fee. That's calculated as `sum(inputs) - sum(outputs)`.

Are you in the U.S.? Are you and your family member aware that operating a Bitcoin ATM makes you a exchanger of virtual currency according to FinCEN, and thus a money services business? Depending on the state, you may be required to register as a money transmitter and put up a cash bond ($10,000+ in some states).
Because you're a MSB dealing in bitcoin and cash, prepare for most banks to laugh in your face. I'd expect to call about 50 before you find any willing to even sit down with you. Those that do will expect you to have an AML/KYC policy created by a competent lawyer or regulatory compliance firm. I'd budget about $5000 for that.
You'll also want an exchange account, but most exchanges don't deal with MSBs, so expect to shop around there as well.
Once you have both a bank account and an exchange, you can start looking at machines. GeneralBytes are some of the cheapest, but be aware they don't have a great reputation with operators.
While it's being shipped, you can set up your hot wallets. You should keep about one day's worth of funds in the hot wallet, so you'll need to budget maybe $10,000 for a hot wallet and some reserve. The last thing you want is to run out of crypto when you're establishing yourself.
Once you install your machine, you'll now be legally obligated to implement your AML/KYC policy and report to FinCEN any suspicious or unusual activity. You'll need to undergo periodic audits of your policies and procedures in order to verify that they are sufficient and you are following them. They expect this to occur every year or two, and you can expect this to cost as least $5000. Also, don't fuck this up or you can be liable for huge fines and/or jail time.
In short, $5000 isn't enough to start a Bitcoin ATM business in the United States, and the fact that you're doing this on behalf of someone else is going to be a huge red flag. I don't think you realize just how much work you've committed yourself to, and you will not be successful in the end.

Every block must have at least one transaction in order to be valid. This is a special transaction called the coinbase, and it's always the first transaction in a block.

If someone tries to double spend using RBF, there's a clever technique a merchant could use called Scorched Earth. Dependent transactions are considered when calculating fees for replacement, so when a merchant software sees a transaction replaced in the mempool, they
1. Cancel the order, if possible
2. Spend the *replaced* transaction, but with no valued outputs (can't have 0 outputs but you can have a single OP_RETURN)
This means that the dependent transaction's funds go *entirely* to miners' fees, increasing the total fees of the combined pair of transactions and preventing any further replacement by the attacker.
I don't think this is at all used today, most merchants just wait for RBF to confirm. If it were used though, just the threat of it would deter double spending attempts using RBF. There's still no way to prevent a miner from colluding with the double spender though, so 0 conf will never be *safe*.

I've only used blockchain.info's mixing service, but here are the issues I ran into.
* You can only enter a single address for a proxy address. It would be nice to enter multiple addresses for the mixed coins to be distributed among, so that it is easier to split up a large unmixed output into smaller, separate amounts.
* The delay is random. One day, I started receiving my coins immediately after sending, the next there is a day long lag (which made me very worried). A date and time by which you are guaranteed to receive your mixed coins would be nice.
Of course, the biggest issue is trust, but I'm not sure how any centralized service would solve that issue.

The base layer of the system doesn't require watchtowers. Only if you want to operate a Lightning node without a Bitcoin full node do watchtowers come into play. Essentially they allow users of non-full nodes to outsource watching the blockchain for cheating transactions to third parties. The idea being that if the other party attempts to publish a revoked channel state, the watchtower could automatically publish the punishment transaction, which awards the entire channel balance to the non-cheating party. Last I read, the way they will be implemented, the watchtower cannot learn much or anything about the user, and may only be able to unlock the punishment script *after* seeing the revoked state.

Only transactions flagged as RBF can be replaced through the protocol, so a merchant merely doesn't accept RBF transactions until confirmed.
RBF has its uses though. For instance a Bitcoin ATM operator could use it to pay their customers. Instead of a transaction remaining unconfirmed or requiring a higher fee dependent transaction, its fee can instead be increased through RBF.
Lightning is the solution to time sensitive payments. I can pay a merchant via Lightning instantly, with no ability to reverse the transaction.

Not necessarily. If the wallet had rudimentary support for the protocol, it could allow a user to pre-authorize signing for a specific template. For instance, "sign anything offered as long as it has *this* input and *that* output".

If you know the current block height, you can calculate the maximum number of bitcoins that could possibly exist.

If Bitcoin becomes widely accepted, and fees alone will not provide an adequate level of security for the network, then I feel pretty confident that Bitcoin businesses (exchanges, payment processors, etc) will pick up the mining slack, even if doing so does not directly profit them. They don't even have to do so competitively at that point, they can do it independently or cooperatively. Maybe they don't even do it directly, but create transactions with deliberately high fees to encourage mining.

Absolutely false. Your reading of the code is wrong. All operators of bitcoin exchanges (whether virtual or physical) are MSBs and must register as such.

As far as I'm aware, the current thinking on this is to find a way for full nodes to provide cryptographic proof of a block breaking consensus rules.

Because it's false. Blockstream doesn't have their own full node satellites in space. They have a contract with a current satellite operator and they send data to the satellite which the satellite then rebroadcasts.

That's not actually accurate.
The cheating transaction gets recorded into the blockchain, but the outputs it creates cannot be spent for some number of blocks. When the node or watchtower sees the cheating transaction, it can then publish the related punishment transaction which takes the entire balance of the channel with *no* locktime. So both get recorded into the blockchain, but the punishment transaction takes the funds before the cheating transaction can spend them.

Most of your volume is going to be people putting cash into the machine. You need a low cost, reliable way to turn that cash back into bitcoin. That means sending USD to an exchange.

There are two broad use-cases for this.
1. Redundancy. You have an existing internet connection, so you can compare the data you get from other nodes to the blockstream data. You'll be aware if someone attempts to sybil attack you, and you have a backup block source if your IP blocks Bitcoin.
2. Remote installation. If you don't have an internet connection, having a possibly censored satellite connection is still better than no internet connection at all.
Remember, it's not like like an ISP where they can single out a receiver to target with different data. All receivers collecting signals from a satellite receive the same data.

I think this is a silly argument. Of course most aren't going to keep Bitcoin for now. They can't use it to pay their expenses and the tax implications of selling later are a hassle.
By your logic, most miners don't accept Bitcoin since they sell for fiat to cover their expenses.
Merchant adoption via gateways like Bitpay is an important step. It gives them an easy way to get started with no risk and gives holders an economic outlet. It's also a good onramp to what you consider real merchant adoption. Once they see the price increase over a long period of time and get more comfortable handling it, they're more likely to hold instead of sell.

You should spend more time in They want blocks to *always* be bigger than transaction demand. If 5 billion people did 10 transactions per day, at 250 bytes per transaction, that's ~87 GB blocks. *But* they also want to do microtransactions and machine-machine transactions on the blockchain, **and** have spare capacity for peak times.
Considering their current utilization is ~70KB/block and they're increasing their block size to 32MB this spring, that means (assuming similar ratio of sustained to peak capacity) they'd have to have ~40 TB blocks (or 750 GB blocks based on the current 8MB block size).

To be perfectly clear, Bitpay is only passing on the cost of moving the paid Bitcoin from the one-time-use payment address to their main wallet/exchange/whatever they do with it after. I agree that calling it "network fee" is confusing but I can also see why they call it that, since the amount is based on current network fees.
I think people are making way too big a deal about this. When our customers sell Bitcoin to our ATM, we also charge a fixed fee based on the cost for us to move the funds to our main wallet.

If you had read the terms and conditions, you probably would have been aware of that.
Unfortunately the state of the current laws and regulations in the U.S. means that if a bitcoin exchanger doesn't want to go to jail or have massive fines levied up on them, they have **no choice** but to perform AML/KYC.

How do you know that? Can you point to some analysis of the traditional banking system's resource consumption per transaction?
You realize that bitcoin's mining power consumption is almost completely tied to the block, not transaction, right? So more transactions per block lowers the cost per transaction.
Not to mention that each block secures not only the transaction it contains, but every transaction that has come before (or since the last widely accepted checkpoint).

Don't restore an outdated backup, or ask your peers for the latest state. I think there is work being done to make restoring more robust, being able to restore to the latest state with a seed backup alone.

Two independent sets of keys? I'd say it's more secure than giving your mobile node full access to the value of funds in your always-on node. You also don't have to worry about losing channel state on mobile. You can always just ask your always-on node for the latest state.

True, but you can do a [submarine swap](
1. Open a channel with the node from which you want incoming capacity
1. Have them generate a Lightning invoice, give them your Bitcoin address
1. They create a transaction that is spendable by your key *if* you can also supply the invoice's preimage
1. You pay their invoice, in return for which you receive the hash preimage, allowing you to move the funds to your wallet
Now you have a channel with a remote_balance and bitcoin back in your wallet (minus the swapper's fee). The exchange is atomic, so the only trust required is that the node will route payments to you once the swap is complete.

I had been using the Satoshi (reference, original) client up until a few months ago. I kept my wallets separate by encrypting them with my public key (GPG) and then using a bash script to select and decrypt a wallet. It worked, but it was troublesome and not very secure in the case of a keylogger.
I finally decided to switch to Armory. On an offline computer booted from a LiveCD, I generated a deterministic wallet, printed a backup, and exported the public portion. On my desktop, I imported the public portion, which lets me watch the balance and create spending transactions. In order to finalize the spend, I have to take the created transaction and import it onto my offline computer, sign it, and then import it back and broadcast it. It's a fair amount of work, but it's essentially unhackable, and I keep an online wallet for day to day purchases.
The only downsides to armory are its memory usage, and that you have to have the Satoshi client running alongside it (just the daemon, not the UI).

A dual funded channel? Not implemented yet but you could simulate by setting local_amt and push_amt to the same value in channel open.
Your always-on node would have a number of semi-balanced channels, listen for blocks from a local bitcoind and watch for cheating transactions.
Your mobile node would have only one channel, a "dual funded" (balanced) channel with your always on node. It couldn't route other nodes' payments but it only needs to come online to send or receive.
On your always-on node, you would set the policy for *that* channel to have no routing fees.
Since the only channel on the mobile is with your own node which you fully trust, it's not necessary for it to monitor the blockchain for cheating.
A mobile wallet could do most of this automatically, by just scanning your always-on node's URI (public key and IP).

Your analogy doesn't take into account difficulty changes. In the mud pie example, you create more factories and it doesn't change the total global mud pie output, just the portion you produce.
Adding hash power has diminishing returns. Doubling your resource usage will double your income *for a short period of time*, but then it will start to fall as others do the same and drive up the difficulty. This effect is not seen in the mud pie factory.
Miner income is driven more by the price of bitcoin, which has as *one* of its inputs miner costs (though not a significant one, I'd argue). And as more halving periods elapse, that effect decreases because miners supply less and less of the Bitcoin for sale in the markets.

It's not about nodes being private, it's about channels.
You might want to do this if you had a large organization with lots of channels and wanted to mitigate routing fees. You'd have an internal private network that connected to a single (for instance) "border" node. All of your internal channels would be private and propagated through some other means. They would be able to find a route to the border node, which would have public channels with the rest of the public LN.

Not true at all. They can spend Lightning funds or collect fees for routing payments. It's entirely unlike an IOU.
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:20:46
As far as I'm aware, that's the best way currently. Perhaps one day Bitcoin Core will have abstracted its wallet enough to support hardware wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:41:48


Because Lightning channels are *dependent* on having a funding transaction secured in the blockchain. All following transactions are secure without needing the blockchain, due to using 2-of-2 multisig and other scripting features.


Lightning is for spending money. For the same reason you shouldn't have all of your bitcoin in an unencrypted wallet on your hard drive, you probably shouldn't have all of your bitcoin in payment channels (unless you're spending them or routing payments).
Again, things you would know if you spent the tiniest amount of effort trying to understand Lightning instead of ignorantly spreading FUD.

Just the one so far. I had to open a direct channel. The current network seems to be spotty due to nodes going offline frequently. In the future I think nodes will prefer to open channels with other nodes that have high availability to prevent that.

Sure, but Bitpay could merely not accept P2P broadcast transactions and *only* accept BIP70 transactions.

Where did you get this number? 
As we include more payments per block with increased SegWit use, Lightning taking payments off chain, and eventually increased block size, the energy consumed by mining for each transaction will decrease. The subsidy halvings will also force miners to be more efficient as transactions start paying closer to their full cost.
You also have to consider the non-energy inefficiencies of fiat currency. Is there a better way to achieve the same security model of Bitcoin without proof of work? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:09:03
The diagram doesn't say whether or not Coinbase charges a fee for bitcoin withdrawals.
@_date: 2012-10-13 06:34:21

@_date: 2019-01-31 14:16:25


But it's not. They produce a fixed amount of electricity. If it's not used, it's wasted. If it wasn't for the miners, that portion wouldn't be used. Period.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:42:22
It sounds like not only do you not understand how Lightning works, but you don't even understand how bitcoin works. You don't spend transactions, you spend outputs. LN transactions create outputs *to you*. So yes, you can spend them, exactly like any other unconfirmed transaction (but without worrying about double spends).


So I guess mempool transactions aren't "real", even though they are valid and signed? Seriously, this is the dumbest argument ever. Go back to you moron.

Anyone can buy them. Some manufacturers ask you to prove that you are properly licensed if your jurisdiction requires one. It's been a while since I've bought one though. The difficult thing isn't getting the machine, it's having a reliable way to convert cash into Bitcoin and following the regulations so you don't go to jail.
There are two ways you can fund them... either have a bunch of fiat on an exchange and purchase the bitcoin you're selling on-demand, or have your own stock of coins that you replenish. The former method may be more heavily regulated in some states.

If you're going to make backups they should be automated and occur after every channel update.
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:58:25
There are two ways to close a channel, cooperatively and uncooperatively.
Cooperative closes are the best, because they are smaller (in bytes) and faster. They require both nodes to be online in order for one of the nodes to initiate a cooperative close.
Uncooperative closes are worse, because they are larger and the funds are locked up for some period of time (to give time for a punishment transaction to occur if the other party is cheating).
So if you decide not to cooperate, they can still close the channel anyway. If you try to cheat, they can punish you and take the *entire* channel balance (not just their portion).
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:25:42
No, these layer 2 applications are about scaling bitcoin without making it easier for governments to attack. Lightning transactions are just unbroadcast bitcoin transactions. Sure they may shut down some Lightning nodes, but doing so won't affect Bitcoin in any way. Even if one of your channels gets shut down, you can still withdraw your funds.

Yes I would, their addresses would be P2SH if they were multisig. It's a P2PKH so they're not.


It works for both.


I'm not super well versed in Ethereum, but I'm fairly certain that Ethereum addresses are meant to be used over and over, whereas Bitcoin addresses are not.


Which ones do this *now*? I'm not aware of any. That some did it in the past is no argument for continuing to do it that way. There is **no reason** to hold such large balances in a *single* address, and to re-use that address over and over again. There are **many** reasons *not* to do that.

The original intent of 2x was as a compromise to prevent a split of the community. That ship has sailed, and now 2x just threatens to split the community *again*. I think most of the signers to NYA will withdraw and the fork will never happen, or maybe miners will fork but it will fizzle out quickly.

Go talk to some merchants. Out of the few that are willing to accept bitcoin in payment, how many of those want to hold bitcoin on their books? The answer, I've found, is almost zero.
* They can't pay their bills with it.
* They'd have to manually manage an exchange amount to convert to dollars.
* The price is volatile and can drop.
* If it goes up, they now have additional tax liability and the hassle of calculating their cost basis and gains.
* Their bank might close their account for being associated with a bitcoin exchange.
* Integration into existing POS systems are poor.
If a merchant accepts bitcoin to their own wallet and then immediately sell on an exchange, would you consider them to be accepting bitcoin? Because it's functionally no different than using Bitpay.

Putting a string in your coinbase is meaningless. The only thing that matters is will miners forego higher profits mining Bitcoin than SegWit2x if the market prices Bitcoin higher.

It's likely that most in-person merchants on more or less a faith-based system. Most of the ones I've experienced do anyway. They just take your word that you paid or watch you send the transaction, which could easily be faked.


This isn't something the merchant should be doing, this is something their software should do.

That's not true, if I'm understanding you correctly. Your phrasing "add funds to the network" is a bit confusing.
Let's say you start off with two channels, one with A where you own 1 BTC  and another with B where they own 1 BTC. You make and route a few payments leaving you with 0 BTC in channel A and 0.5 BTC in channel B.
You could close channel A and reopen it (in a single transaction), sure. But there are other options.
* Lower your A-&gt;B routing fees to incentivize rebalancing your channel with A
* Pay yourself on your A channel from your B channel
* Purchase from an exchange, paying out to your A channel
As you can see, none of those require an on-chain transaction.

To me, if the vast majority agrees with calling the forked chain "Bitcoin", then it's Bitcoin. 
I agree with you that the vast majority *do not support* SegWit2x. This is different than the vast majority *opposing* it, but functionally the same in a hard fork scenario.

Yes, that's how it works. One reason why most brick and mortar retail businesses don't accept bitcoin.
It's actually like 0+ minutes, maybe 5 minutes on average. Blocks are found *on average* every 10 minutes, but that doesn't mean it's 10 minutes from when you send a transaction.
Lightning payments will solve the issue though, as they are actually instant and irreversible.

It literally just changes the max block weight from 4000 to 8000. Perhaps you can explain what tech improvements you think it brings?
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:21:10
SegWit changed the limit from 1 MB to 4000 "weight". Weight is a unitless measurement equal to the combined virtual size of the contained transactions. A carefully crafted block, full of transactions which consisted mostly of witness data, would have a weight of 4000 and a real size of almost 4 MB. An average block using only SegWit transactions could be around 2 MB.
2x merely multiplies these numbers by two, but that also increases the worst case scenario to almost 8 MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:31:12

No, noting you said is correct. Your understanding of how the system works and should work is fucking backwards. If miners mine the Bitcoin chain instead of SegWit2x it's because it's more profitable to do so and this what the community wants.

Well, your interpretation is counter to tax agencies and IRS statements, so... yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:29:03
The two are equivalent. Lightning allows more efficient use of whatever space is available in blocks. This allows more economic activity per block. It's possible something like Channel Factories could make the Lightning multiplier even larger.
How do you propose we scale to probably 3 or 4 orders of magnitude more people?

If they pay you bitcoin every paycheck they'll know how much they've paid you in total.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:12:40
You keep saying 2 MB but you know that's not accurate, right? 2x changes the maximum weight to 8000 from 4000 (SegWit). This means maximum block size consisting of mostly witness data is almost 8 MB. Under normal usage, closer to 4 MB. Assuming the best case scenario and no malicious actors is a common mistake I see 2x and Cash advocates make.
Also, if you're so concerned about on chain scaling, why is ShapeShift not yet using SegWit?

False. There are a number of different methods to do this with little to no trust. Here are a couple.

Ok? They're paid out of the penalty your channel partner pays for cheating.


Jokes on you, you can use any number of Watchtowers and they'll be competing to broadcast the penalty transactions first so they can get paid.

@_date: 2017-10-24 14:59:15
Not automatically, but anybody could take that transaction and broadcast it on the SegWit2x network and it would also get included in that blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:27:32


I mean, it's not an easy problem.
It's obvious to me that there is some threshold of consensus at which a fork carries the name "Bitcoin". We've had presumably unanimous hard forks in the past. If 1% hold out on the original chain is it still Bitcoin? 10%? 49%? Do you measure that by individuals (how?), wealth, hash power, token value? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:30:19
I don't understand what you're talking about. How would the privacy hole be fixed? If you transferred all your BCH to an exchange account using your real identity, no change to the tax code will prevent you from having tied all of your bitcoin to your identity.

It's not *quite* that easy. Nodes will not relay a double spend, so you'd have to send it directly to a miner that refuses the first seen transaction and includes yours instead. Not impossible by any means, but not as simple as you say.

You misunderstand what's occurring.

Whomever is able to create an ETF first will have a nearly insurmountable market advantage. I don't feel comfortable with the fine print of the ETF allowing whomever controls it the ability to choose which chain fork is Bitcoin.

I don't think this is true. Unless you're spending at a merchant that keeps their bitcoin rather than converting it, there's an equal sell pressure.

Everything you just said is patently false.
Miners enforce the rules, they don't choose them. "We" is the economic majority. All full nodes validate every transaction, and they absolutely could change the mining algorithm, making current miners with hardware useless for bitcoin mining.
If the system really were as you say, it would useless and require total trust in miners.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:12:19
No, it's not 2MB. It increases the max block weight parameter to 8000, which means an average block could be 4MB and a specially crafted block full of witness data (DoS attack) could be close to 8MB.
I get the skepticism of Blockstream, I used to feel the same way. But if you're concerned about a corporate takeover, Digital Currency Group, which ~~owns most~~ *invests in half* of the 2x signers and is also trying to start a Bitcoin ETF should worry you much more.

I didn't realize they were talking about the Android version. It's send only because a mobile wallet won't be connected and watching the blockchain all the time. In order to protect against the channel's other node cheating, it has to watch the blockchain. There is a planned extension called "Watchtower" that allows you to outsource this blockchain watching with little to no trust. Once that is developed, we'll probably see mobile Lightning wallets allow receiving.
You don't need to worry about cheating when you're *only* sending because each channel state is more advantageous to the other node, and they'll never try to cheat by settling an old channel state.

I don't think so. Mining likely resembles a pareto distribution at worst, with 80% of hashpower concentrated into the hands of 20% of miners. Thus even if that largest 20% of miners burned down, block times would still average 50 minutes. Burning down the other 80% of the miners to take out the remaining 20% (now 100%) of hash power would be much more unlikely/difficult.
In order to get down to an average of 1 day per block, it would require 99.3% of all miners to be turned off/destroyed.
Worst case scenario with a severe drop of hashpower, we could fork to something like Bitcoin Cash's retargeting algorithm.

The only thing that matters is how many SegWit outputs are *being spent*. That's because the extra block space comes from SegWit witness data being accounted for separately.

The thing is, in the initial flood of sales, you're seeing people who would probably never make a purchase from you otherwise. I made quite a few purchases from Wholly Hemp when you first started accepting. I tried most of your products that interested me and I found them acceptable*, but I eventually found bar soaps that I liked better. After a while, your accepting bitcoin didn't make up for me liking other products better, and I stopped buying. I imagine there are more people like me, and even more that tried you once solely because you accepted bitcoin and weren't enough of a fan to keep buying.
Your overall point stands though, bitcoiners are quick to suggest/demand that a business accept bitcoin, and often treat it like a novelty. It's best to approach businesses of which you are already a frequent customer and will continue to be in the future, in order to mitigate the potential downsides for merchants.
*except your deodorant which I loved, but then started giving me rashes in later batches, which wasn't solved when you halved the quantity of essential oils
~~p.s. Did why did you stop accepting bitcoin in your store?~~
edit... never mind, after searching for it, I found it hidden behind the "All payment options" text (which doesn't even look like a link). Do you think this may be affecting your bitcoin sales? What is your current Paypal volume? Do you have a hypothesis as to why removing a pominent bitcoin option boosted your sales? I can't imagine very many people really hate bitcoin enough to not buy from a merchant that prominently accepts it. Perhaps it's more of a confusion due to too many options (I thought that was the ultimate conclusion of the Mozilla study).

Can't gift cards be revoked? I imagine the window between double spend and revocation would be rather short, so I think people would learn not to buy second hand gift cards.

You'll have equal numbers of Bitcoin tokens and S2X tokens. Theoretically, when you send a transaction on the S2X blockchain it is separate from the Bitcoin blockchain, but because S2X is technically deficient, transactions from one blockchain are replayable on the other. So you'll have to take special care when sending one to prevent someone else from making the exact same transaction on the other chain.

Without the EDA no blocks would ever have been found. Perhaps they manually adjusted the difficulty during the fork. Well, then the first time it became profitable, the difficulty would skyrocket (like it has multiple times now), but they'd have to wait the entire 2016 block period for the difficulty to adjust downward.
The only thing that could have prevented this would have been either for EDA to be symmetrical (allow fast upward changes of difficulty as well as downward) or to replace the entire difficulty adjustment algorithm with something more adaptive. That seems to be the direction they're going, but I think
1. It's too late
2. They're going to find out how difficult a smooth transition is with contentious hard fork

Not really, as evidenced by Segwit2x. Even if miners change the rules of the system, all they're doing is creating a new fork with a majority of the hashrate.

Think about it this way: at least they didn't change their Bitpay risk setting to low, then you'd have to wait 6 confirmations.

I thought there was the possibility that Bitpay might take that risk for zero confirms too, but they don't.
From the merchant order settings page:


Medium risk is 1 confirmation, so they don't guarantee against double spends for anything other than 6 confirmations (low speed).
It still seems unnecessary on the part of Gyft. Performing a credit card chargeback is easier than a double spend, and I imagine that when purchasing a gift card using a credit card is nearly instant (though I've never done it), though the risk of chargeback looms for months.

What an arrogant non-answer.
If you want to make a product for actual businesses to use, it helps to not dismiss their concerns or use cases. I love BTCPayServer, but most businesses that may be interested in accepting Bitcoin don't want to deal with the various issues with doing so, namely custody, tax implications, and volatility. 
Linking an exchange account to sell the crypto at the time of receipt mostly deals with these issues, though slightly less well than Bitpay's service where the merchant never owns the crypto at all.

That is an option, but also they use Bitpay and Coinbase to process transactions. Do they take the risk of double spends, or do merchants? I can't find anything about it on either of their websites, that would be something good to clarify.

I don't think LN has the same issues Bitcoin has with upgrades, for the very simple reason that LN has no consensus of its own, it relies on Bitcoin. Without having to worry about consensus disagreements fracturing the network, maybe permanently, there's little problem with an incompatible upgrade being partially adopted and fragmenting the network. There will be private channels and subnetworks that don't interact outside with those outside, and that's perfectly fine. Incompatible versions are just another example of that.

I'm one of your customers. You need to revisit the huge gap between the personal and business plans. I'd love to have more than one API key but I'm not paying $900 more per year to have it.
For merchants, your service makes even less sense. Bitpay offers up to $30,000 per month of free transaction processing (30 transactions per month, up to $1,000 per day is free). Your business plan equates to at *least* a 1% fee (again, without conversion to fiat) on up to $8,900 per month. It's only after a merchant passes that threshold does your service even *begin* to make financial sense.
The services you offer are good, but without fiat conversion I think it's disingenuous to marker yourself as a Bitpay alternative. I hope you take this as constructive criticism and look into adjusting your pricing tiers.

Yes, I believe that to be the case. I don't think deflation is fundamentally a worry, but it could be if there were literally not enough units of the money to go around. That would make small purchases impossible. I don't think Bitcoin has this problem due to the 8 decimals places.

Once the transaction is in the block, the old client sees it as valid. And your statement is only true for certain protocol rules. If newer clients allowed a transaction with invalid signature into a block, the old client would consider the entire block invalid.
Anyway, this is a moot point, my understanding of the OP was flawed. A transaction merely wouldn't be included in a block larger than X, and any block which included a transaction breaking that rule would be considered invalid. However, this is not backwards compatible since older clients without this "feature" would consider it valid. Hard fork.

@_date: 2011-05-20 19:43:54
1) The Bitcoin client only uses your CPU to do hashing, and probably does betwen 1 and 20 million hashes per second. That sounds like a lot, but you need something like a quadrillion hashes on average to solve a block. Napkin math, that's about 538 days, and that number will only increase as difficulty increases.
2) Any of the mining pools will do. Some don't require you to register, you just use your address as the username. Those might be considered easier but they normally take a bigger cut.
3) You can have any number of addresses stored in your wallet. An address is just a hash of a public key, which is itself derived from the private key. If you go to "Addresses" and generate a new one, or select an existing one, it will change the address displayed in the main window. The client will sometimes create a new address automatically and store it there as well.
To be honest, unless you have a decent video card (ATI Radeon 5850 or newer), you will never receive a significant amount of bitcoin from mining. That's ok! You never receive any money from the federal reserve printing money, in fact your money decreases in value when they do. The easiest way to acquire coins is to sell a good or service in exchange for them, or exchange fiat currency (US dollars, etc) for them on one of the many exchanges.

The difference is that it's easier for a government to essentially ban the holding of gold than bitcoins. It's true that the history of free banking -&gt; fractional reserve banking -&gt; central banking could play out with bitcoins as the backing instead of gold, but I think it's highly unlikely. Bitcoins have many advantages over gold, especially in the internet age, and I doubt once people have adopted their use that they would be willing to go back to paper and fiat virtual money.

Not only that, but as bitcoins are lost, the supply decreases which provides an upward pressure on the price. As the price increases, the incentive to safeguard bitcoins (both from theft and loss) increases. The "problem" is self correcting as bitcoins are valued higher.

Seriously? A block contains transactions. An address is an identifier that can be used to send money to you.
In what way do you see these concepts being de-emphasized? I don't think there are any references to blocks in the main client, and addresses are pretty central to the usage of bitcoin.

Block size is still determined by fully validating miners (mainly mining pools) in your system. They could restrict block sizes to increase fees and prevent automatic increases.

Read it more carefully. In order to lose anonymity, your address must be publicly known. Additionally in most circumstances (not including totalitarian state), a honeypot or compromised merchant is required to prove your identity.
If you are careful of the information you reveal (only publish addresses from a separate "dirty" wallet, use Tor, etc) you shouldn't need to launder Bitcoin.
If it is necessary though, you can chain ewallets. Send your BTC to MyBitcoin, then some other service. Repeat as necessary.

A couple of counter points...
Part of his argument is that *users* have an incentive to change the rules as well, though I disagree. I certainly don't want my coins taxed via indefinite/controlled inflation.
It's much easier for difficulty to increase than decrease. When computing power is added to the network, the 2016 blocks before difficulty recalculation are generated more quickly. When power is removed from the network, the 2016 blocks are generated more slowly. 
Additionally, the difficulty can only go up or down by a factor of 4. Say 90% of the miners left the main chain for this alternate chain. It will now take 20 weeks to generate 2016 blocks. The difficulty will go down by a factor of 4, meaning it will take 5 weeks for the next adjustment, and the difficulty is stabilized. That's 25 weeks where there is more than 10 minutes between blocks on average.
Anyway, I disagree with Tim B. Lee, but I do think he has some valid points.

No. If the 20% that own 80% want to change bitcoin's rules, they're only creating their own bitcoin spinoff that only they use. They cannot force the 80% to change their rules as well.
With fiat currency, government and banks control both the price and the system. With bitcoin, the worst that can be done is price manipulation, they don't have control over the system itself. And price manipulation isn't guaranteed to be successful, it could just as easily result in those trying to manipulate losing value.

There are a few reason "useless" hashes were used as opposed to some sort of distributed computing project.
1. Any work done must be *difficult* to perform, but *very easy* to verify is correct. Distributed computing projects are by necessity, *easy* to perform, but *difficult* to verify.
2. The work done must be uniform. All hashes take about the same amount of time and use the same algorithm. This isn't the case for all distributed computing calculations.
3. The work **must** be otherwise useless. Otherwise, the value of a bitcoin would be tied to some other measure.

Ideally, I would only have to pay for the services my business needs. As an ATM operator I have no use for nyms, vouchers, or any of the merchant services. 
Instead of offering bundled tiers of features, offer features a la carte at different tiers. Instead of choosing between $9 per month and $89, I could choose to get X API keys, with Y calls to the API endpoints I use, and Z bitcoin transactions per day.  X, Y, Z and the price for that tier of service would be determined by how expensive it is for you to provision and support. Some API calls are more expensive than others, some features require more customer service. The end result would be me getting the most value out of your service and you extracting all the revenue possible from me.

I'm aware of the deflationary spiral, but I believe it to be nothing but a myth. There are two factors which make such a scenario extremely unlikely in my view.
1. Human beings have a general time preference of *now*. That means that all else being equal, we prefer to have the things we want or need now instead of later.
2. It cannot be known if the purchasing power of money will continue to increase.
Think about it this way... can deflation continue indefinitely? What would that mean? Prices would approach zero and money's purchasing power would approach infinite. Do you really think people would continue withholding from purchases? I don't. When they *do* start to make purchases with their super valued money, it will cause an increase in the supply of available money and the purchasing power will decrease. Negative feedback loop.
On the other hand, a constantly inflating fiat money depends on constant inflation. Positive feedback loop.

Bitcoins are divisible to eight decimal places, so another way to look at it is that there are 2.1 * 10^18 individual units, or as a more fair comparison with today's currencies which practically allow for two decimal places of precision, 2.1 * 10^16.

Not necessarily, there is still a link back to the previous transaction and thus your old wallet. If your wallet is dirty, you'll need to send your coins to a service that will effectively mix your coins with others. MyBitcoin works for this since it maintains a single wallet and keeps user balances stored in a database. If you send your dirty balance to MyBitcoin over a period of time in small pieces (new address each time), and then send that balance to your new wallet, again over a period of time in small pieces (differing sizes, and new addresses), then your new wallet will be reasonably clean.
You can also add a second step, where you send the balance from MyBitcoin to a separate mixing service. Then, *both* mixing services must be compromised in order to break your anonymity.

It depends on what you want out of Bitcoin. The exchange rate only matters until individuals can purchase the necessities of life with the currency, and businesses can purchase their raw materials.
If you want to help promote the Bitcoin economy even more, you could keep the proceeds from your sales denominated in Bitcoin. This would make you a speculator (which is a good thing, IMO), and you could purchase supplies with Bitcoin whenever possible.
If you merely want to use Bitcoin as a payment mechanism, you have a few options. You can accept BTC and manually exchange for USD whenever is convenient. You can set up an account at an exchange (like Mt Gox), and every time you accept payment, place a sell order on the exchange at the clearing price for that amount. You would have to keep a small balance of BTC on account while waiting for the payments to receive confirmations, but otherwise you would be converting all of your sales into USD.
Of course, you could also keep *some* of yours sales denominated in BTC, as a way to further manage risk.

The current implementation of Bitcoin is coded to slow the creation of coins over time, approaching a total of 21 million BTC.
Any programmer could change the few lines of code that control this, and make it so the number of coins increases forever. However, this change would make the software incompatible with the rest of the network. In order to make a difference, the change must be widely adopted.
So you see, huge changes to Bitcoin can be made, but they must be adopted by a majority of the users in order to make any difference.

You could, but the chance of that happening is very, VERY small.
Most people today do block generation with high end video cards, which are hundreds of times faster than CPUs. You could turn on generation in the main client, and you may get 15 million hashes per second. Based on the current difficulty, this is the probability that you will find a block:
    Probability      Time
    Average          521 days, 17 hours, 18 minutes
    50%	             361 days, 15 hours, 6 minutes

Is your premise that in order to act as a monetary store of value, a commodity (I posit that Bitcoin is a digital commodity, among other things) must have a non-monetary use?
If so, why is that the case?
Gold bars are only useful if you are *already* using gold as a store of value.
Jewelry is perhaps the one of the original reasons that people valued gold, but it is not the reason it acts as a store of value today.
In my opinion, the only real difference between Bitcoins and gold when it comes to acting as a store of value, is that gold has been used far longer than Bitcoins, and is thus a much more predictable store of value. If, however, we were able to transmute any type of matter into gold it would no longer function as a store of value. Similarly, if Bitcoins cryptography is broken, then Bitcoins could no longer act as a store of value.

Let say that 1 GPU = 100 mhash/s and 1 CPUs = 1 mhash/s. To achieve 1000 mhash/s (and earn an equal profit for the pool), which needs more pool server resources, 10 computers with GPUs or 1000 with CPUs?


This is incorrect. You need to check for new work with the same frequency either way in case the current block hash changes.


I've found no indication that botnets are using GPUs for mining, only CPUs.

That's a good point, though when I say inflation, I mean increase in supply of money (which IS happening with bitcoin). What I should have said is "unknown rate of inflation".

Another method of solving this problem, one that Mike Hearn (the developer of BitcoinJ) either proposed or champions...
If I'm sending you money, it doesn't make a lot of sense for me to pay a transaction fee (to get it into a block), since I know I'm trustworthy. However, you as the recipient have an incentive to do so if you don't trust me. So, I send you a transaction which is merely broadcast, not included in a block because I have attached no fee. You then create a transaction using mine as the input and attach a fee to it, sending it to miners you know about, or an organization which specializes in delivering transactions to miners.

Actually, the probability is that you will find a valid *block* in that time. Finding a valid block awards you 50 BTC, not 1.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:44:00
The interesting thing is that RBF might make 0 conf *more* secure, due to similar game theory as Lightning anti-cheating penalty, called scorched earth.
First you need to know that RBF calculations take into account dependent txs' fees as well when determining if a tx chain has a higher fee. An attacker sends a replaceable tx to Gyft with a low fee. Gyft delivers the gift card. The attacker replaces the tx with one paying a higher fee. Gyft notices this, and invalidates the gift card. They take the original tx and spend its output in a new tx with a single OP_RETURN output with a value of 0. The entire tx amount becomes a miner fee. This tx chain has a higher fee so the double spend is replaced. The attacker cannot replace it again as there is no higher fee that can be paid (without them losing even more).
The strong possibility of losing the funds would deter such an attack from taking place if scorched earth was a widely used policy.

IMO, you've got three options.
* Join a pool
* Invest serious money into hardware
* Purchase a "mining contract"
* Forget generating Bitcoin altogether
Joining a pool will decrease the variability of reward. Mining on your own, you'll get 50 BTC on average every ~4 years. If you join a pool, you will average out to the same 50 BTC over the same time period, but you get paid a small amount every time the pool finds a block.
If you want to purchase hardware to increase your generating capacity, cram a computer with as many Radeon 5970s as you can. Out of the box, you can probably install two per motherboard, maybe three. With some custom fiddling, you can get four working properly.
You could also purchase a contract from someone that has a large mining farm. This guarantees you a set hash rate for a set period of time, for a set amount of money. The only variables left are generation difficulty and exchange rate.
That said, I'd recommend the last option, forget about it altogether. The Bitcoin economy is growing, and that means increasing specialization. I don't think it will be too long before the only people left mining are doing so professionally. Keep in mind that the 50 BTC reward for finding a block is only temporary, and I think it's better described as a *subsidy*. Eventually, there will be no subsidy (halves every ~4 years), and the whole incentive to generate blocks will come from collecting transaction fees.
So, where does that leave you? With two options, as far as I am concerned. You can either exchange (some of) your existing money for BTCand/or you can offer goods or services in exchange for BTC.

There is actually talk of something preliminarily called "BitDNS". It would use Bitcoin's biggest breakthrough - the block chain - in a slightly different way. Rather than transactions containing representing amounts of Bitcoin, they could represent IP/domain name key pairs. Off the top of my head, the domain name would be static, the user could fill it with data at the time of generation, but after that only the IP could change. You could sign this keypair over to a new person similarly to a transaction, and then the new owner could modify the IP. The DNS lookup tables could be stored on everyone's computer, or there could be any number of servers if you didn't want the hassle.

It's not quite that simple. [Here]( is a transaction I picked pseudo randomly. Every transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs. Each input links back to a prior output, and this path can be followed back to a coinbase transaction (created when generating a block).

My first outgoing transaction, I sent you a few bitcoin.
I made my first exchange today, using something called MoneyPak. Not sure if it's outside of the US, but you can buy them at Walgreen's, CVS, etc. MoneyPaks are redeemable to refill Green Dot prepaid cards or to a PayPal account. The guy I traded with gave me his public key, I encrypted and signed the MoneyPak code, then sent it to him (he has a reputation, I do not). He transfered the funds into his PayPal account, verified the amount, and then sent my bitcoin. Really smooth transaction.
The only down side is that in order for a seller to transfer more than $250/year into the Paypal account, they have to give a bit of information to Green Dot, like name &amp; SSN. Aside from that though, this could be a really convenient way of paying, if you're willing to pay the extra $4.95 for the MoneyPak card.

Bitcoin gives you the ability to control your own money. Currently, it's a limited ability and doesn't itself have much security. There are ways that with even a small amount of technical knowledge, you can vastly improve security with the default client. There are also ways you can move the security from the digital realm to the physical.
If Bruce and others had taken the modest effort to secure their own money, rather than relying on unknown (yet trusted) third parties. I am not blaming the victim; I believe thieves and frauds should be held accountable. I also believe that compensating those who took such risks with money from those who did not create a clear moral hazard.

It's obvious that the interface was built by developers. There are alternatives available and there will be more as demand for such increases.


That's not a problem with bitcoin, but with the current payment processing system for fiat currencies. One easy way that gets easier with more widespread adoption is in person trades for cash. Next is using a system like Bitcoin-OTC, a trade channel on IRC with an order book and Web of Trust. If you're in the U.S. you can use Dwolla to withdraw money from your bank account and then deposit that into MtGox. It's really not as difficult to acquire as you make it out to be.

That doesn't really solve the problem when there is a *hard* maximum of ~5.4 transactions per second right now. This number comes from...
A 1 megabyte (1,048,576 byte) block can fit 3,256 322 byte transactions (two inputs, two outputs). Divide this by the average number of seconds to find a block (600) to arrive at 5.4 transactions per second.
Fees just determine *which* of those 5.4 transactions per second get included in the block, it doesn't allow for more.
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:54:44
There's been lots of talk of centralized payment processes, and as a big fan of decentralization, I think they may have their place. However, there are other methods as well. If a merchant is connected to many nodes, they can accept a small transaction without confirmation if they listen for a few seconds for a double spend attempt. At that point if one is not seen, it is unlikely that the double spend transaction would beat the real transaction, and it is "safe" to accept the payment (for small amounts).

It's all probability. If everybody switched from pooled mining to solo mining, the network would be just as secure, and everybody would make the same amount of money *over a long period of time*. But yes, you are correct, most people would probably not make as much during the time period that the network is under attack (though some would necessarily make *more*, by finding a valid block and gaining 50 BTC).
Keep in mind, that if your pool goes down, you're mining at 0 Mhash/s, and your chances of winning anything are lower than if you were solo mining.

Let's say Alice makes a contract with Bob that she will receive some widgets and pay for them with gold. Alice receives the widgets, but when time comes to pay, she says that she doesn't want to pay with gold, but with federal reserve notes. Bob, seeing the falling value of the dollar and the rising value of gold insists on payment as per the contract. Alice continue to refuse, so Bob takes her to court. The court will find that Bob must accept payment in federal reserve notes from Alice, even though they *agreed* upon payment in gold. That is what legal tender laws do - preempt agreements.

I prefer to have a currency with a **fixed supply**. It is only deflationary in the sense that...

2. the market for goods and services in exchange for bitcoin is expanding, leading to lower prices
If Bitcoin had been created with a constant generation rate (50 BTC/block forever), I probably would still be using it. However, it is not fair to the people who have already bought in to the current system as a fixed supply currency to change that fact.
The correct thing to do is start an alternate block chain that is inflationary forever, perhaps one that is able to share block hashing with Bitcoin.

Figured I'd cross post this here since I have a bit more history on reddit (there was recently a wallet backup app posted that stole wallets). I've been fiddling with a small application to manage multiple wallets on both fixed and removable drives. It's to the point that I think other people can use it, but it could use some polish.
Currently, you can create new encrypted wallets, but in order to import your current wallets, you'll have to encrypt them with gpg yourself first. The command will look something like this
    gpg -e -r your -o walletname.gpg wallet.dat
Then add a new wallet named walletname and choose the folder where you want to keep the encrypted file. I'll change this so that you just choose a file, it just occurred to me that it would be much simpler. I'll also make it so that it will encrypt a wallet for you automatically.
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Gotcha. I'm not saying I don't think the price of bitcoins will decrease drastically, it's certainly a likely scenario. I just think that they will bounce back rather quickly, unlike housing prices in the housing bubble, and (a lot of) tech stocks in the .com bubble. To me, a bubble implies unsustainable growth, and I think bitcoin could eventually be priced (sustainably) much higher than it is now.
If you do want a put, you can probably find someone on  to deal with. Make sure to use the web of trust to minimize your counterparty risk. Alternatively, GLBSE (the bitcoin stock exchange) will be offering option contracts in the future.

Deflation has been discussed ad nauseum in the Bitcoin community. My view is that the "deflationary spiral" is merely a myth propagated by those who wish to constantly inflate the money supply for their own gain.
If deflation really caused a decrease in spending, wouldn't pretty much anything technology related never sell? Every 18 months you can get about twice the computer for your money. Why buy one now when it's going to be obsolete in one or two cycles? Because money is just a means to an end not an end itself.

First, some basics. A hash is produced by taking the block header and a nonce, and hashing those values together in a specific way. A winning hash is one that is below the target, a small number starting with a lot of zeroes. The target is inversely proportional to the difficulty. A share is a "winning hash" for the lowest difficulty, one. Pools use shares as mini proofs of work.
There are a few different models of pool payments.
**Pay per share**
You get a fixed payment for each share you generate. This payment is calculated to give the pool operator some profit, from what I've seen in the 5-10% range. This method is the riskiest for pool operators, and least risky for pool users.
**Direct shares**
Once a block is found, your payout is equal to... (your shares / total number of shares * 50) - pool operator fee. The risk pretty fairly balanced between operator and users.
**Score system**
Similar to direct shares, except that newer shares are "worth" more than older shares. This protects the operator and users from attempts of others to gain an advantage by hopping between pools.

Think of your wallet as a keychain with as many keys as you want, and the block chain as a bunch of completed transactions, all locked. When someone sends you money, you give them enough information to create a lock to fit a key you own. Then, when you want to spend that money, you look for the lock that fits your key, unlock it, and lock it with a lock that someone else's key can unlock.

You send some coins, they send the same amount back, ensuring that you don't get your own coins back.

Calling what is happening now deflation is rather confusion. Currently, the supply of bitcoins is *inflating* at a rate of ~7200/day. The falling prices we see are caused by the demand for bitcoins exceeding the supply. So I think your statement that not that many people are buying is false.

An escape from the use of fiscal fantasy to impoverish the many at the benefit of the few. Bitcoin has the monetary properties of gold with few of the drawbacks, and are transferred through a digital, decentralized network. What it lacks is the popular acceptance of gold, but I believe support will only grow. We have not yet seen any attacks against Bitcoin as a technology, only as a community.

I posted this in response to this...


Have you considered the effects of a shrinking money supply, caused by the rich's hoarding? As there as less gold chasing the same amount of goods, the purchasing power of all gold increased. This means that the poor were able to afford more goods than they otherwise would have.
Further, there is no deflationary spiral, because as the purchasing power of money increases, so does the incentive to spend it. An equilibrium point will be reached, since this functions as a negative feedback loop.
The only problem I see with deflation is that wages are sticky, people don't like to see that number fall. One possible solution is to tie wages to some basket of goods, so the amount paid in bitcoins fluctuates, but it always buys you the same amount of stuff.
@_date: 2011-05-09 23:44:18
Money experiences supply and demand just like anything else. Given a fixed supply, the larger the demand, the higher the price.
So yes, a dozen Bitcoins today could potentially purchase a house in the future. However, it could potentially purchase nothing, or anything in between. How involved you want to get in Bitcoin is merely a matter of risk management. Don't spend more than you would be comfortable completely losing.

You got lucky with the confirmation time, but fees are low at the moment. There are still a lot of wallets that do very poor fee estimation.

Yes, data that can be pruned by any node without worry of losing financial information.
* Proof of Existence uses it to store the hash of a document
* Counterparty uses it to store encrypted data about token creation/issue/transfer

@_date: 2019-09-06 15:22:24
Transactions contain inputs and outputs. A transaction's fee is equal to the sum of the value of the inputs minus the sum of the value of the outputs. A miner gets to claim the fees for all the transactions in their blocks *along with* the 50/25/12.5/etc block reward.
If you've got a 291.241 BTC output but only want to spend 0.0001 BTC, what you do is create two outputs, one for the spending amount and one for the change, to a new address of yours. In the case of the 291.2409 BTC fee, the person constructing the transaction (probably using custom software) forgot to include the change output. So the transaction had 291.241 BTC in inputs but only 0.0001 BTC in outputs, making the fee 291.2409 BTC.

The free market is regulation. I think people are so used to being spoon fed security (at the expense of freedom) by the government that they are just beginning to realize that they hold their own destiny in their hands. Once that epiphany happens on a massive scale, people will stop blindly trusting others and force service providers to earn their trust.
For instance, if you allow a third party to control every aspect of your finances, they have the power to do charge backs on your behalf. This lets you trade with an untrusted party without due diligence on your behalf. With Bitcoin, you have to ensure your party is trustworthy or otherwise **protect yourself** by using an escrow system.

The only thing is that the honey pot would have to send the return transaction from a different pool. Otherwise if the white hat is successful, obviously he keeps his original Bitcoins, but the transaction sent to the honeypot, as well as the one the honeypot sent back, are invalid.
For an additional challenge, the honeypot could either be or connect to a supernode (a node that connects to a large number of nodes). Perhaps you actually have a grid of bounties, on the Y axis is amount of time, on the X axis is number of connected nodes. I think it would be harder to double spend against a node that is connected to 1000 other nodes than one connected to 100.

No, but anyone who put a buy order for $0.01 in soon before the sell off is suspicious to me. Since we know Kevin had the largest $0.01 orders (he got 250k BTC, nobody else did that I know of) and that he placed it on the day of the attack, the only question is if he actually placed it before the sell off or not. Given that he logged in 3 minutes before the sell off began, and that MtGox's sessions time out rather quickly, my hunch is that he did in fact do so and is in fact the attacker.

However, MtGox has a rather short session time out, so it's still a rather suspicious window (IMO). The only thing that could prove this is if they timestamp placed bids, but that's still problematic because they own the database and can change it at will. Really, it comes down to a question of trust. I happen to trust MagicalTux more than some random person on the internet, as he has more at stake.

Citation? How are those 409 scams working out for the victims? I assume you're talking about credit cards? Well, credit cards aren't exactly person to person transfers, are they? They're one way, customer to merchant.


What issues are there with Bitcoin itself?


Use an escrow transaction (not yet available) to ensure that the money goes to the other party only if you are satisfied with the trade, and an arbitrator if not.


Lol. An individual may like Bitcoin in the sense that it is interesting, but it *is* a threat to the business model of banks who rely on the masses having little choice but to entrust to them their money. Central banking is a **scam**.


If I want to send you money, how quickly can I do so through the banking system? With Bitcoin, you can see the transfer immediately, and be reasonably confident that it is not economically feasible to reverse the transaction in an hour.


I suggest opening your eyes.

A bit longer? Let's say 10% of miners are mining on the minority chain. Their expected time to find a block is 100 minutes. The coinbase for that block won't mature for over 10 days. The difficulty won't retarget for another 142 days. That is not a healthy fork.

I've slowed down my spending now that the exchange rate has been trending very much upward. That doesn't mean I'm going to hoard all my bitcoin forever. Their one and only use is to spend on things that I want.
In order to realize how silly the deflationary spiral argument is, imagine you have 10 BTC. Today, you could exchange each for about $20 on the market. If you believe that 1 BTC may one day be worth $10,000 it's silly to sell or exchange at this price. However, when 1 BTC is worth $100, it may be too tempting and you'll spend *some* of it while saving the rest. Again, at $500, you may spend some more, and at $1000.
Bitcoins are "worth" different things to different people at different times and different price points.

I have a moral objection to taxation, but the reality is that most people don't want to break tax laws. "Spend and replace" is dangerous advice in the United States because every time you spend Bitcoin you incur a capital gains tax liability. Supporters of spend and replace often ignore this reality or try to convince people to just break the law. I'm all for tax resistance, but only when done willingly and cognizantly.


Yes, I agree. The main problem with merchant adoption isn't high transaction fees though. It's training of staff, integration with existing systems, low rate of customer adoption gatekeeping[1], and low attention span community[2].
[1] "You don't *really* accept Bitcoin because you use a payment processor/sell for fiat/don't pay your employees in Bitcoin", etc.
[2] I've heard a number of stories about businesses that accept bitcoin and get a huge volume of orders initially, only for it to drop off to a trickle after some time. After a while, the costs of accepting outweigh the benefits and they stop.

I contest this interpretation. If you look at the citation, the quote for this is "Fiat money, such as paper dollars, is money without intrinsic value: It would be worthless if it were not used as money."

Basically, pools exist on a spectrum of only you to everybody. When you're mining solo, there is lots of variation but larger individual payouts. You may get lucky and get 3 blocks in a day, then go 4 weeks without one. If you were in a pool with every other miner, you would get almost the same payout every time.
Other than that, I switched to mtred just because it's by/for redditors, and I like the idea of more competition between pools. Also, I like the way larger infrequent payouts feel. In the first two days mining, I got 3.2 BTC for two blocks (I think), compared to the 0.05/block I was getting in Slush's pool.

I don't understand the point you're making here. Increase in the mempool size *necessarily* corresponds to an increase in the tx count. More inputs and outputs per tx means the size increases faster than the tx count though.


It's actually cheaper to use fewer many-input many-output txs than it is to use more few-input few-output txs. It's the same benefit that batching transactions together provides exchanges.

It allows you to encode up to 40 bytes per transaction (only a single OP_RETURN is allowed per transaction) that are provably unspendable. This means nodes can discard this data and it won't affect the financial uses of Bitcoin. It also doesn't pollute the UTXO set.

Yup. An address is constructed from...

Ok, so a million under the mattress isn't hoarding then, got it.
I don't think hundreds of dollars saved over years is nearly enough, but **it's not my money, it's theirs**. Should I be allowed to destroy other people's money because I think they haven't saved enough and their money needs to be worth more? No? Then why should you (or your representatives) be allowed to create money at will because some people have "saved too much"?
Hoarding or saving is purely a matter of preference. Sometimes people don't want a lot of risk, so they save cash or other liquid stores of value. Other times, they want more risk so they invest. It's not complicated, and there's absolutely nothing that needs to be "fixed" about this situation.

Prices are only "pegged" to the dollar because businesses cannot pay their expenses with bitcoins. It does not mean that they are turning around and selling the received bitcoin immediately, though they may. Perhaps a smarter choice (if you believe their value will increase) is to sell enough to cover costs and save the rest.
Once expenses can be paid in a semi fixed amount of BTC, then businesses will no longer have to tie their prices to the dollar, but instead to their costs.

It's a way of bootstrapping Bitcoin acceptance. If merchants accept Bitcoin, even if only to immediately cash them out to USD, that does two things.
1. It gives people who have bitcoins more things to spend them on.
2. The bitcoins they sell will allow for others to acquire them more easily.
Over time as Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, they can reduce the amount they sell so as to participate more fully in the Bitcoin economy.

This isn't quite true. Bitcoin amounts are stored internally as 64 bit integers, representing the number of base currency units. 1 bitcoin = 10^8 base currency units. I'm fairly certain that the addition of more precision would require a change to the software and protocol that is not backwards compatible. If more units are required, I think it would be that alternate block chain(s) would be created and either coexist with Bitcoin, or replace it.

Again, what is the difference between saving and hoarding? I'd like a coherent definition for one that does not fit the other.
Here's my definition: hoarding is when someone else saves more than you think is acceptable.

Supply and demand are factors in price, there is no "correct" value of either.


So says Keynes, so must it be true.


It's volatile because it's a small market. It will stabilize with time. I suspect its useful properties will keep it in use until that time.


I suspect you don't have a good understanding of the history of money. I suggest you read [What has Government Done to Our Money?]( [(pdf)]( Gold was money, then governments monopolized it and forced paper upon the world through the use of force (monopolized law).




That's how a speculation market works. Those who are bad speculators lose money and can no longer speculate. Those who succeed stabilize the market.


What do you mean "grow"? The number of Bitcoins grows by 50 ever hour or so. Do you mean the economy which uses that currency? If so, then of course, that's the very definition of growth.


You use the term confusingly. The supply of Bitcoins will inflate at a known rate for a very long time before the it is fixed. This fixed supply coupled with an *expanding economy* causes what you call deflation, really lowering prices. Given that Bitcoins are easily divisible to eight decimal places, the unsuitability of Bitcoins for every day businesses would mean perhaps universal use.


Explain what you mean by fabrication.
Speculation stabilizes market prices.


You can only speculate about the reasons of the current price decline.


Excellent deduction. You've described the *necessary conditions* for the price to fall.


You're quite visibly projecting your wishes.

The exchange rate has little or nothing to do with the cost of mining. The difficulty of mining (and thus its profitability) has much to do with the exchange rate.
At least, that's the popular interpretation. The logic is that as the exchange rate rises, mining profit increases, which draws more miners, which raises the difficulty. If the difficulty climbs too high (too many miners) for the price, profitability falls and miners leave, lowering the difficulty.
I don't see a similar feedback loop where difficulty drives exchange rate.

I keep my wallet(s) encrypted with one of many GPG keys. I wrote an application to manage them; when I select one it decrypts to the Bitcoin data directory and launches Bitcoin. When the client is closed, the wallet is re-encrypted. This works for me for now, but is a bit of a hacky solution.
A solution that is in the works for version 0.4.0 of Bitcoin is to encrypt the private keys individually. This is a better solution as it allows the client to run without exposing the keys to an attacker. A password is only required to use the private keys to sign data, which means only to send a transaction.

When the supply of money is static and the economy using that money grows, prices (and wages, though sticky) fall, which increases the purchasing power of the money. It is true that assuming constant growth, the longer you can forego spending, the more purchasing power you have. This is a good thing, as money's only use is in exchanging for the goods humans need and want.
But people do not forego spending and consumption forever. As their purchasing power increases, the incentive to spend becomes greater and greater, until they finally do so. This increases the supply of money in circulation, decreasing all purchasing power slightly. In this way, these two forces reach and equilibrium - economy growth and saving increasing the price of money, and spending decreasing it.

You cannot export private keys from a hardware wallet such as the Ledger or Trezor. However, the only thing that matters is that there is *some* wallet software that is compatible with both BIP148 and your hardware wallet.

It could happen in the same way that banks lent out gold receipts for gold not in their vaults. However, that was risky as it raised the possibility of a run on the bank. With the inception of central banking, this risk was erased. However, there is and can be no bitcoin central bank (they cannot create more bitcoins on a whim), so fractional reserve banking will again be risky. I doubt, with bitcoin as the everyday money (the best case scenario), that fractional reserve banking would be anywhere near as widespread as it is today.

There was never anything wrong with overt ASICBoost. People just confused the two, didn't know the difference, or just used ASCIBoost as shorthand for "covert ASICBoost" because that's all that was in use at the time.


No, only *covert* ASICBoost has that result because they grind on the coinbase scriptsig, which is now used as witness merkle root. Overt ASICBoost uses some of the version bits in the block header, which has only one negative effect: it decreases the number of simultaneous BIP9 soft forks. Which IMO isn't a huge deal as I don't think we'll be using BIP9 in the future (just look at what happened when we used it for SegWit).

I would prefer a more accurate definition. Longest is actually "most accumulated work" (you'd be surprised how many people take it literally). Node counts can be artificially inflated, and I think it's more about the people than the nodes. 
Here's my attempt:
Bitcoin is the blockchain with the most accumulated work, most stakeholders*, and having a genesis block with hash `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`
\* Stakeholders being everyone who owns tokens on or otherwise uses the blockchain, directly or indirectly (e.g. custodial service users, timestamp service users, users of second layer payment systems, etc).
I think this covers a number of different scenarios logically.
Possibility | Result
Majority of miners relax SegWit rules, stealing SegWit outputs | Majority of stakeholders reject this hard fork, remaining on a minority chain that should be called Bitcoin
Majority of stakeholders change the proof of work algorithm | Majority of miners reject this hard fork, remaining on a majority chain that should *not* be called Bitcoin
Majority of stakeholders and miners agree on protocol change | Bitcoin
Measuring miner agreement is easy through block signalling. The practically difficult part is measuring stakeholder agreement on the consensus rules. I think ideally there would be some Sybil-resistant method of measuring support for changes to the rules.

Yes, you're wrong. Miners signal their intention to start enforcing the new rules, which leads to nodes enforcing them too. The only other way they've been done is a flag day activation, but that has no guarantee of miner preparation, which increases the risk of a chain split.

Electrum won't let you run a Trezor with old firmware. You can only update the firmware through myTrezor.com or using python-trezor tools. My only spare Trezor has a faulty button so I cannot hold both buttons down to update the firmware to test the rest of the process.

This is only a byproduct of prices initially being set in USD, and then converted to BTC based on the exchange rate (which isn't very robust, since it's based almost entirely on the going rate on MtGox). Once businesses are able to pay for at least some of their costs with bitcoin, they can price goods in bitcoin primarily which will remove (I believe) a lot of the price volatility.
Also, it's not a requirement of Bitcoin that your private keys (the only thing **you** need to keep available and secure) are stored on a personal computer. There is at least one member of the community working on a secure hardware device that stores keys and does the signing - the keys are never shared with an untrusted device.
Also, you can encrypt and back up your wallet (the key storage for Bitcoin right now) to any number of services like Dropbox, Wuala, Gmail, Carbonite... whatever. Right now, this has to be done manually, but there will eventually be tools to automate this.
Additionally, Bitcoin is not incompatible with banking, even fractional reserve. The difference is that there is and can never be a central bank that can create Bitcoins on demand to shore up the reserves of individual banks - similar to free banking prior to the 1900s.

The only thing that matters is that a majority of miners keep signalling for SegWit. If non-mining nodes run BIP148 it in no way "forces" miners to do anything, since the only thing they do is relay blocks and the miners are already connected to each other. If a majority of miners defect and stop signalling SegWit, the only effect is that BIP148 nodes will be on their own chain.

That's exactly what it does. The problem is that if you assume your computer/phone is compromised, it could have given the attacker's address to your hardware wallet instead of the merchant. The payment protocol solves this by having the hardware wallet verify the SSL certificate chain/signature for the payment details.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:48:28


Not in the case of an abandoned soft fork.


Why do you think that? If the exchanges follow the longest chain and it doesn't signal for SegWit, then unless the vast majority of all nodes are BIP148 (so exchanges never see those relayed blocks), they have no effect.

You're not understanding.
Your computer is compromised. You visit a website, your browser displays "send 1.23 to 1XYZ...", you send the unsigned transaction to your hardware wallet and it displays "send 1.23 to 1XYZ?". You confirm that the details match, and you accept.
Uhoh. Turns out that you have some malware on your computer that replaces bitcoin addresses it finds (e.g. on the website, before you ever see the real address) to ones the attacker controls. There's *nothing* that can stop this other than using the payment protocol, as an attacker could not replace the address with their own without invalidating the digital signature.

A lot of that is probably owned by multiple people but is controlled by centralized wallets or exchanges.
But if you think that's bad, you should look at the wealth inequality in the United States. The top 1% of the population owns 35% of all wealth, the next 4% owns another 28%, and the following 5% owns 14%. That means the top 10% controls more than 3/4 of all wealth. The bottom 50%? 1-2%.

Why do you think a transaction's position in the block indicates its priority? Transactions can be ordered for a number of different reasons. I think there was a certain of ASICBoost that did strange transaction ordering.
As far as actual priority, I believe after fee, age is often used to determine which transactions to include in a block.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:25:28
Real SPV nodes connect to any full node via the P2P network. It's just better to connect to your own full node for the best privacy and security.
Electrum uses a client server model, though to can run something like Electrum Personal Server on top of a full node.

It's not increasing in complexity, the algorithm stays the same.
The difficulty of mining adjusts so that blocks are only solved on average once every ten minutes. If they're solved more frequently, the difficulty adjusts upward; less, downward. This is fundamental to bitcoin because it preserves the mining reward schedule and keeps a fairly regular block time.
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:24:22

Well, you can't buy the S4s anymore, and I don't think they were ever a better deal.
The [last time]( you could buy an S4, the units were second hand with a 10% discount. The cost was $623 and did 2TH/s ($311.5/TH).
The current batch of S5s cost $370 and do 1.15TH/s ($322/TH).
Now, the upside of the S4 is that it comes with its own power supply, but it consumes 1380W compared to 1180W (for two S5s).
@_date: 2019-05-10 14:43:39
ASICs run one specific algorithm and cannot be reprogrammed. That's what makes them so efficient, but they are also incredibly inflexible. Changing the hash algorithm would make all current ASICs useless for Bitcoin mining.

You take turns signing with each key. Different implementations handle it slightly differently, which means they're not interoperable.

Paper wallets are harder to use and less secure, at least if you ever plan on spending your bitcoin. Because at that point, you need to import your private key into a computer, ideally one without a network connection. Then you construct the unsigned transaction on an online computer, transfer it to the offline computer (without also transferring malware), verify the transaction, sign it, transfer it back, then broadcast it.
Oops, you realize the change wasn't sent back to your paper wallet, but a randomly generated address from the wallet you thought was safe to delete and now it's all gone.
If you're going to use paper wallets, follow the GLACIER protocol or something like it. Practice, practice, practice on testnet so you know *exactly* what you're doing before you use any real funds.
Or just use a hardware wallet with a passphrase, I don't think there has ever been a successful attack without knowing the passphrase.

Yes, multi-signature wallets. You generate two keys, keep one offline in a secure place, and a third party generates a third. Any transaction sending from this wallet requires two out of the three keys to provide a signature.
In normal operation, you use your online key and the third party's key. They can provide fraud/rate limit checks to the transaction and refuse to sign if they have concerns. The third party cannot ever unilaterally move your bitcoin though.
If they were to block you from sending a legitimate transaction, or to disappear along with their key, then you restore your second key from backup and move the funds to a new wallet.
On a transactional level, you can get protection similar to (and I'd argue better than) what credit/debit cards provide. This is through a similar construct called an escrow contract. This is another multi-sig contract though this time it's single use. The three parties are the buyer, seller, and arbitrator. The buyer transfers the payment into the contract. If the transaction goes smoothly, both buyer and seller sign a transaction sending the funds to the seller. If there is a dispute, the arbitrator gets involved and both parties provide evidence. The arbitrator then can sign, along with one of the parties, a transaction distributing the funds however they decide. Could be a 100% refund to the buyer or some other arrangement. At no point can the arbitrator take the funds for themself.
All this with one of the simplest contacts possible in the Bitcoin script language. There's all *sorts* of cool things you can do that would never be possible with a bank account.

You should really read some details about the case.

Ross's defense were further hampered by the judge [instructing the jury to disregard]( essentially their entire defense strategy.
So yes, they "proved" in a court of law, in which the jury was *actively prevented* from having all the facts.

SegWit was a block size increase. Blocks larger than 2 MB are mined fairly regularly. If large centralized services switched over to SegWit already, we'd have even higher block sizes and increased capacity, no additional forks required.
Make no mistake, demand for block space on Bitcoin is nearly unbounded. If the block size were increased tomorrow, blocks would likely be full again within a week.

Core devs are very conservative with changes to the protocol. They're not going to merge anything into Bitcoin Core that isn't thoroughly reviewed and tested. Two months to prepare for a hard fork is barely any time at all. Exchanges and wallets may make themselves technically able to operate on either fork, but there is no way they will call such a fork "Bitcoin" unless there is overwhelming support from their user bases.

No, that was never one of the main selling points. It was something people pointed to for a while, yes. But low fees for on-chain transactions is directly contradictory to Bitcoin's main selling point, which is lack of centralized control.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:17:01
Bitcoin's primary differentiation from other forms of currency or payment is not the fees are low. It never has been. Yes, in the past it cost nothing or nearly nothing to send bitcoin. But those bitcoins were also worth nothing or nearly nothing. Anyone who touted bitcoin's low fees as a primary selling point were mistaken.
The real solution to high fees isn't to eliminate the actual distinguishing properties from bitcoin, but to create additional layers (in as trustless a way possible) that more capably handle enormous transaction volumes. Yes, we will also have to scale on chain, but on-chain scaling is not a solution alone.

You're completely missing my point. The argument over whether Bitcoin is useful to terrorists is stupid. Of course it is, for the exact reasons it's useful to everyone. As soon as we make it not useful for terrorists, it becomes no longer useful to anyone.
To put it another way, why don't we question whether cars or clothes or cellphones are useful to terrorists and how can we change therm to make it no longer so?

Any SPV (simple payment verification) clients are fully peer to peer, they just don't validate the blockchain quite as thoroughly as full clients. Bitcoin Wallet for Android and Multibit are examples of SPV clients.
Electrum isn't an SPV client (it does no verification and needs to connect to a server), but it's still much better than blockchain.info because *anyone* can run an Electrum server. If one server goes down, you can switch to another. Blockchain's server is proprietary, if they're server goes down you've at least got your keys, but you can't use that client anymore.

Bitcoin is making me generous.
Yesterday, while driving from Overland Park Jeep with my new car paid for with bitcoin, I was sitting at a stop light when a homeless guy with a sign came up to my window. Normally, I would wave them away, but I figured I'm sitting here in a almost brand new car, that would be a huge dick move of me. So I gave him a fifty dollar bill and made his fucking night. Prior to that, I donated a bitcoin each to Sean's Outpost, FFTF, and a couple other charities.
So... no. I have had the exact opposite experience.

The only reason it sucks for customers is Bitpay's insistence on using the payment protocol. Some new merchant to Bitcoin doesn't understand that, and to be honest there aren't any other good options for them.
Merchants adopting bitcoin payments for non-idealistic reasons care about:
* No exchange rate volatility (also no capital gains tax liability)
* Ease of integration with existing systems
* Support for the merchant
* Support for customers paying
* Little training required for staff
Can you name another solution that ticks those boxes?


Why would this gain widespread adoption for retailers if it's hard to use, causes training and customer support issues, causes additional tax liability and accounting complexity?
Bitcoin is (relatively) easy to use as an individual, just download a wallet and go. It's much more complicated as a business.

Anyone who has run a node over a metered internet connection. :)
As Pieter said, compact blocks cut down block relay to 4 MB per day. Previously, transaction relay made up 87% of a node's bandwidth usage, now it's probably 95% or higher. Finding ways to cut down on this usage is somewhat obvious, though difficult in practice.
Minisketch sounds great, it's exciting to consider an up to 40x improvement in transaction relaying. That's nearly two orders of magnitude! It will both lower the minimum bandwidth requirements necessary to run a node *and* allow current nodes to increase their number of connections. Propagation inefficiency is also one of the big blockers preventing safe increase of the max block size (imo).

Ah, that's why. Some miners prioritize transactions which reduce the number of unspent outputs. Since this removed 68 outputs from the UTXO pool, some miner probably included it even though it doesn't pay a sufficient fee.

Back in July. The problem is that BFL ASICs don't return a result immediately when one is found, it continues searching the entire nonce space for additional shares. This causes a delay when submitting shares, meaning a large percentage of them were stale by the time they were submitted. This isn't a problem in normal pools because participants are not competing for shares like they are in the share-chain of P2Pool (as I understand it).

In addition to what others have said, it doesn't *need* to be the case that the buyer pays the transaction fee. In the future, it's possible that the buyer could send a free transaction to the merchant, who would then aggregate a number of those free transactions, using them to pay itself including a fee. Currently miners aren't smart enough to include a free transaction if there is a paid transaction which depends on it, but that is a pretty simple modification to the miner code.

One thing that might make this a little more palatable is if those in the queue got their exchange rate locked in when new coins became available, rather than when their funds cleared.

Back to the proposal itself, you should read Chapter 8 (and the preceding chapters if you haven't already) of the [whitepaper]( It describes simplified payment verification, wherein a client only has to store block headers (80kb) and unspent transaction outputs they own.

No, that is how it works. You can choose the odds that you want to play... lower odds equals higher payout. They have a handful of static addresses, each representing one of the odds. So once you know the address, you never need to visit the website again, you just keep sending Bitcoin. In fact, all of the addresses are tagged as Satoshi dice with their odds on blockchain.info.

Converting at the time of authorization (Shift) as opposed to at the time of loading (Bitpay) has benefits and drawbacks. The major issue for me is that using it requires you to keep a bitcoin balance in a hosted wallet service. At least with Bitpay, you can send top up payments from any wallet.

If you like paying taxes, is it safe to assume that you pay more than is legally required of you, under threat of kidnapping or other violence from your government?
To answer your question, bitcoin originally appealed to techno-libertarians and anarchists.

We have alternate clients. What is being discussed is alternate *full* implementations of the bitcoin protocol. These are two very different things. A piece of software can easily be a consumer of the bitcoin protocol without having the possibility of a chain fork.


I see what you're saying, but I don't think it's necessarily a problem. I say this is a big proponent of decentralization, but in this case I don't thin it can be helped.


Did you read his whole comment? He goes on to explain exactly *why* this is not sufficient for an alternate full implementation of the bitcoin protocol.


Are you a software developer?


If you're worried about malicious core bitcoin developers, I wouldn't be. If they made any malicious change to the codebase, it could easily be forked and that change removed. I'm pretty paranoid, and I don't see this as much of an issue at all.


Chain reorganizations are common, but large ones are uncommon and generally a sign that something is up, yes. The problem is, what does the software **do** when it sees a large reorganization? If every implementation doesn't behave in exactly the same way, it could allow for a malicious individual to exploit that behavior.

The fee is not mainly to protect against block chain bloat (the maximum block size does that), but to prevent network denial of service attacks.
Also, you have still not *proven* that your proposed system maintains the same security properties of the full block chain, you have again merely stated that it is so. See:




What do you verify it against? You would need to get the block prior to it also, and verify it, and the block prior to that, etc. That's why it's a block *chain*, because each block depends on the last. You cannot verify a block's validity by itself, you need every block prior.
So I dispute your claim that you have sufficient knowledge of the system to improve upon it, and that your proposed system is superior to the block chain.

If there are no coins available, you could instead say "would you like to enqueue this order? it is expected to be filled on or around $date", then execute the purchase when coins are available.

Yes. I do think that. Tell me, how would they siphon off wealth, exactly?


"How deflation works" is that if the amount of money stays the same, and the number of goods and services increases, then the purchasing power of the money increases.


Wrong. Here are some sources that show inflation more negatively affects the poor: [1]( [2]( [3](
Can you explain to me how inflation affects the rich more than the poor, since the rich *don't actually hold any cash*, but instead they can afford capital goods and other assets that resist inflation?
Your argument flies in the face of reality, where monetary inflation is a constant across the entire planet's governments, and wealth has been concentrating more and more.


No, and I never claimed that. In those days the government still issues coin, and they debased it to provide more value to themselves. It was less efficient than central banking, but it had the same result. Of course, there were many other, more direct ways in which the governments of the world fucked the poor to provide their buddies, but that's not the topic of this discussion.

You are correct that you're no longer in competition with them, but it doesn't immediately become easier to find a valid block hash.

That's because the difficulty can decrease, but it can only do so rather slowly, and first a large number of blocks must be found.

If bitcoin goes mainstream (which will happen slowly and in spurts like we've been seeing), then it will eventually hit more or less a price ceiling. The amount of goods that a bitcoin will purchase will remain relatively constant, increasing only as the economy as a whole becomes more productive. So your purchasing power will slowly and mostly predictably increase.
This means that it's possible to loan bitcoin if you expect the business will produce more value for you than your bitcoin would sitting in cold storage.
It also means that it's easier to save in a way that incurs little risk (why should I have to put my money in the stock market just so I don't lose it to inflation?), which gives people a way of purchasing capital goods without incurring debt and all the risk that injects into the economy.

If you're paying for a large purchase in person, they could verify your identification and require you to sign a purchase agreement to the effect that you will not double spend the transaction. They could also have double spending insurance, so that they don't have to deal with double spends if or when they happen.

But there can be no central bank for bitcoin. Nobody can make more bitcoins appear out of thin air to bail out failed fractional reserve banks. There's really nothing wrong with fractional reserve banking when there is no lender of last resort to socialize the risks.
That said, I don't think (much) fractional reserve banking will ever be popular in bitcoin. I think a system like the Free Lakota Bank is likely to be much more widespread. One of the reasons for that is that you can always just *use bitcoin*, so there is a base level of competition that the banks must offer lower fees, at least as many features, and as much security as the bitcoin protocol itself.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:06:09
I don't think this is technically feasible, for a variety of reasons. If you think it is though, you should come up with a technical specification for this method of block storage and analyze its properties compared to the current method. For instance does it offer the same security guarantees, does it scale, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:07:53

What's this, a fucking *dollar*? This is insane, I'm selling a bunch more. Ten dollars, are you **kidding** me!? I'm selling the rest before it crashes!"
*edit: added quotation marks to clarify that this is a hypothetical individual and not myself, unfortunately*
I can't imagine any of the very early adopters having more than 1-10% of the quantity of bitcoins they originally mined. They probably gave away or lost a portion when they were worthless, and sold most of the rest as the price rose. I say this as someone who *bought* in starting at $0.30 and had given away, lost, or stupidly spent probably 200 BTC, and sold or spent at various exchange rates quite a bit more.

I don't think you will see bitcoin denominated loans until bitcoin is ubiquitous. At that point, bitcoin's purchasing power will only increase as the costs of producing goods fall (due to increased efficiency), and only ventures expected to produce more return than doing nothing would receive loans.
On the flip side, no longer would individuals be reliant on debt to start businesses. Since saving is easier with a stable money supply,  people could more easily defer consumption to purchase capital goods.

Just FYI, you'll come off like much less of a dickwad if you don't start off by insulting your audience.


This is a banking system and fiat currency problem, not a bitcoin problem. The reason it's so hard to buy bitcoin is that once you have it, nobody can take it back from you. On the other hand, almost every type of digital fiat transfer can be reversed after the fact. There are also many laws requiring businesses which handle fiat currency to collect ridiculous amounts of information on you. Complain to the government and the banks.


Using a service like Coinbase locks in the price of bitcoins from the time you initiated the purchase, so you don't have to worry about this. You can also try to time the purchasing and spending of bitcoins as close together so that the exchange rate fluctuation is minimal.


The average consumer is going to want to leave bitcoins in their wallet if there is a chance they could gain money. You're only looking at one side of the equation. Also, some people are more risk taking than others, and you're not accounting for that, assuming that everyone is the same.

But most of them are, and that's the big benefit. Bugs get found and fixed faster when there is a whole community depending on a component. Open source software is also often audited by security experts for vulnerabilities, chances are your home grown solution isn't.


What you're advocating *is* security through obscurity. I would much rather an attacker know the source code of the frameworks I'm using than be able to find weaknesses in my home-made solutions to the same problems. I guarantee you that any open source framework is going to be more secure than a closed source version that any single competent software engineer created themselves.

You're missing the point that this is so merchants can prove their identity to their customers. They didn't choose PGP over X.509 because every merchant that accepts payments online already has an X.509 certificate. But the payment protocol can be easily extended to allow for PGP signed messages as well, but that would mainly be between individuals, and this is designed to facilitate better merchant/customer interaction.
Did you miss the part where, when you purchase something from a merchant using the payment protocol, you get a signed receipt that **proves** you paid **the merchant** (not a MITM). That way, if there is a dispute, you have real proof that an arbitrator could use to more accurately judge the case.

There's actually been a [bunch of talk about this]( It was decided that [Open Transactions]( is a better solution due to various aspects of the Bitcoin protocol, but the contracts would likely be denominated and automatically settled in bitcoin. Alternatively, [micropayment channels]( could perhaps be used, but that concept wasn't around at Hocnet's inception.

That's exactly how Free Lakota Bank works. They have both demand deposit and interest bearing accounts.

Even if we assume that you are correct in that it is *possible* for Congress to create a law outlawing the use of bitcoin (I don't think they could). Even if we assume that such a law wouldn't be immediately declared unconstitutional as all bitcoin businesses sued the federal government (I think it would). Even if we also assume that this law caused people to lose faith in bitcoin (I don't think it would) and merchants to stop accepting it (some would for sure, but not all) and thus the exchange rate plummeted...
That still doesn't kill Bitcoin.

It may or may not be cheaper. Sellers are free to set their own exchange rate. I use the greater of the 24 hour price and the spot price, plus a few percent. It's definitely cheaper than the people who offer bitcoins for PayPal, as they have to factor chargeback and other risks into their price. Basically, cash is the best way to easily buy bitcoin because it is the only way to receive fiat without risk of having it taken back from you.

You should look into offering a multisig storage service. When the user generates a new key to receive funds, they would also initiate a call to your web service which would generate a new key on their account. Then, they would create a multisig script and give the person sending them money a Pay To Script Hash address. This way, when they spend the received money, the transaction would have to be signed both by the bank and by the customer. The bank can't steal the customer's money unilaterally, and the customer's computer getting hacked doesn't lose them money.

When you use a bank, you don't *move* dollars, just change the record of which accounts on how many. The same is possible in a decentralized (federated) fashion with Open Transactions. I really encourage you to do some reading about it, it's really a cool system that I think will complement bitcoin very well.
I'm still learning about it myself, but I imagine a federated system of OT servers would be able to play the part of fiat currency "banks" without being centralized entities easily able to be regulated by governments.

You bought one even though you knew that if you waited you could spend less money to get the same hardware, because its utility to you **now** outweighed the utility of your increased purchasing power **later**.

If you trust LocalBitcoins (I do), then you can use their escrow system. You don't even need a phone to use it, it's really clever. When the seller funds the escrow, you are given a secret code, which you write down and take with you to the meeting. When the seller releases the escrow to you, they are also given that code, which you can verify matches the one you had. At this point, you know that the bitcoins are in your LocalBitcoins wallet, and you can withdraw them to the permanent wallet of your choice.

He's talking about generating your own X.509 certificate and giving them the public key. It's possible to do currently at least IE. No central authority required. They're called client certificates, and they never really caught on as an authentication method. That might be because keeping key material safe is just as difficult, maybe harder, than keeping passwords safe.

That's the problem. Bitcoin *isn't* a well defined protocol. If any new implementation does not adhere *strictly* to the Satoshi implementations intent **and** any weird bugs it has, it can cause a blockchain hard fork.

One idea I had a while back for a decentralized system of law is for each provider to keep a git (or other version controlled) repository of their "code".

I'm not sure Ponzi scheme is an accurate description, but I do believe it is a scam of sorts. The dollar has lost something like 99% of its value since the inception of the Federal Reserve Bank, whose purpose is among other things to keep inflation in check. That value didn't just disappear though, it was transferred from those who get new money last (lower to middle class wage earners) to those who get it first (those connected to politics and banking).

One thing that might make this a little more palatable is if those in the queue got their exchange rate locked in when new coins became available, rather than when their funds cleared.

It sounds like what you really want is an SPV client. This type of client only stores the block headers and transactions it cares about. There are already implementations of these, the BitcoinJ library is one. However, I think it will always remain necessary for full nodes to keep the entire block chain just like it is kept today (maybe with pruning of spent outputs).

What is this deflation you speak of? The number of total bitcoins in the market is increasing at a rate of 25 per 10 minutes. Even when the mining subsidy is 0, bitcoin still won't be deflationary, because the number of total bitcoins will stay constant. Now, hopefully productivity will rise which will increase the purchasing power of each bitcoin. This is natural, and there's nothing wrong with that.
My opinion is that bitcoin's usefulness as a store of value is directly proportional to its usefulness as a medium of exchange. Similarly, the more useful it is, the more demand there will be for it, and the higher its price will be.

You realize that hard disk drives increase in size in the long run too, right?  Today you can buy a 4TB hard drive for ~$200. The block chain is less than 8GB, which is 0.2% of that $200 hard drive's capacity, or about $0.40 worth. 100GB would be 2.5%, or $5 worth. I don't see much of a problem.

Bitcoin nodes will refuse to relay double spends transactions, so unless you send the double spends directly to a miner colliding with you, or have your own mining hardware, there's no chance your double spend will be accepted. Even then, the chance it will be confirmed is proportional to your own hash power compared to the first network (likely very little).

If there are any dust outputs, it not only won't be confirmed, but won't be relayed by the network. You'd have to connect directly to a miner that accepts non standard transactions.

Using it headless (it's a Raspberry Pi, so it has an HDMI port and optional GUI) is a bit hit or miss. The lights don't communicate the device's state very well, the print button is not very responsive, and it's unclear when the poweroff routine is complete. If it stays powered on for too long it seems to become completely unresponsive and I have to unplug power. The case fits together well, but not perfectly, as the case is snap/screw together laser cut plastic.
It's a really cool concept and device, but you can tell they're building these on a small budget. Most of the issues will be solved by software upgrades, and I can deal with the case. While it feels cheap it'll probably last better than injection molded crap.

That's false. Major dealerships like this only sell new cars for their brands, in this case Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler. They also have a used inventory, but that is limited mainly to what their customers trade in.

Pretty much only if the community never grows, which is implausible to me. Consider how much attention Bitcoin would get if it keep a stable inflation adjusted value for a long time. This would probably increase adoption and drive up the price.

They're not impossible, they just require that you expect the real value in the future will be more than if you had just held Bitcoin. Right now this is difficult because the price can rise and fall so drastically, but when we reach saturation this will no longer be the case.
Further, a non inflationary currency provides an opportunity to build capital by saving rather than by debt.
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:26:52
How does that solve the problem? You still need the data from outside the blockchain in order to verify transactions.

Still watching the talk, but I had an idea around the time you're taking about panhandling with QR codes.

You can already do trustless escrow with bitcoin. It's pretty easy, but not incredibly so. So it's more like someone waiving PayPal's buyer protection features and then complaining when PayPal won't help them recover money from a bad seller.

One solution to this is for transactions which combine many tiny inputs into one output to have the normal relaying and fee requirements waived. I'm not sure this will make sense until spent outputs can be pruned to save disk space though.

I don't think you'll see many or any of these features in Bitcoin-Qt, and I think this is the right way to go. Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind is meant as a reference client, that is something which is stable and can be used as a template to build other clients. It's not meant to have every bell and whistle, it's meant to serve as a stable base for the bitcoin network and a place to reasonably safely keep your funds.
Now, some people may have other ideas about this, and they are free to fork the client or create their own. *That* is one of the many beautiful things about bitcoin. You don't have to appeal to the committee, or get popular consensus... when it comes to things which are compatible with the current rules of the network, you can just *do it*.

As said by timepad, colored coins are the opposite of taint. Taint follows the coin whether or not you want it to. Color can *only* follow the coin if you *choose* to follow the coloring rules. So the scenario you describe isn't a problem.
What **is** a potential problem is that you could have a bitcoin that represents a 10^8 shares of a stock, and you could accidentally spend it as a regular bitcoin, destroying those shares.

I'd like to talk to you about this some more. I had a brainstorming session with a friend and I think we came up with some interesting ideas related to this.
Separately, I wanted to ask if you've played League of Legends? I recently started and am fascinated by their Tribunal system, which allows the community to self-moderate and decide the fate of reported users. One of the most interesting things about the system is that they gameified the judging process. You get a rating based on how often you decide with the majority of judges on a case, how long of a "win" streak you have, etc. This seems to be a concept that could easily be applied to a crowdsourced group of arbitrators, which separately review the same case. Those arbitrators who have higher ratings will command a higher price and thus have more to lose by deciding a case incorrectly.
