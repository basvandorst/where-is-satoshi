I wish I could tell you definitively that it'll be a global currency. My guess is no, at least for a long, long time. But it doesn't have to be in order for it to be wildly successful.
The important thing to understand here is that the bitcoin network and protocol cannot exist without the bitcoin currency and vice-versa. If you don't have a network, no currency can be spent. If you don't have the currency, very few people would mine.
The protocol is pretty amazing if you've studied it at all like I have. There are so many cool things that will be built on top of it in the future as bitcoin gains popularity in much the same way entrepreneurs did with the internet. For that reason alone, I think it's worth getting some bitcoins because all of those services on top of bitcoin will depend on the network which will depend on the currency spurring demand.

colored coins can be used for decentralized exchanges, dollar/gold/altcoin gateways and whatnot. it's not really practical to use it to prove exchange solvency.
exchange solvency proof is really simple. use the private keys of the various addresses you have to sign a message asked for by a third party. you then prove a) that you have X amount of coins in a bunch of addresses and b) that you control them since you have the private key.
coinbase essentially did that recently with andreas antonopolous:

You can't fraudulently spend using just the bitcoin address. You can with the credit card number. The difference is that you're giving a public key in the former, the private key in the latter. I'd much rather have the public key leaked since that's public anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:40:13
You would still need the public key or its hash in order to send bitcoins to the address. The public key can't be generated without the private key and the pubkey hash can't be generated without the public key. So unless the recipient has generated the private key already, you can't send money to this address without knowing the private key.
Hence what you ask is impossible without breaking ECC crypto or SHA256.

Question 6 is stupid. Nobody knows all the different altcoins in existence. I'd bet dollarcoin will be created if it hasn't already.
Question 7 doesn't even make sense as a question.
Question 9 is very subjective. But 3 is probably the best answer.
Question 10 is also worded poorly. It averages once every 10 minutes, but is not guaranteed to be so.
Question 12 is also more precise than it should be. It could be more than 3600 or less. Depends on how lucky the miners are that day.
Question 18 doesn't make sense. SHA256 is not a form of encryption. It's a hashing algorithm used for proof-of-work. ECDSA is what would make more sense as that's actually the cryptographic security behind bitcoin addresses.
Question 19 is wrong. You can still mine with GPU's. You just won't get very much bitcoin, but you still will get some.
Question 20 is misleading. It takes at least a couple of seconds to propagate through the network, it may take longer.

I would start with making an analogy to the internet in 1994. Very few people knew what it was and a lot of people that knew thought it was too complicated. A lot of people, especially older people, said it wouldn't go anywhere. People that knew the technology, though, were saying it was going to change everything. Who was right?
Bitcoin is very much the same way. It's a technology not many people understand. I've found that the more technical you are, the more you understand its potential and realize how much better it is than what already exists. It's funny, but the first things people were saying about the internet was something like "well, that'll get rid of the post office". It was because the main application at the time was email. Not many people dreamed of online stores, search engines, MMORPGs or answers to pretty much any question you can ask. And that's what bitcoin is like. Many people are now focused on how easy it is to send money across the globe in a few minutes. That's the bitcoin equivalent of email. It's useful and a massive improvement over what exists, but that's not the end of the story. There's a whole mess of stuff on top of the bitcoin network that's possible that we haven't even touched yet like smart property, bond and stock issues, decentralized peer-to-peer trading of almost any asset.
tl;dr investing in bitcoin is like getting a very short domain name in 1994.

More likely, you're thinking the QR code leads you somewhere that you can actually buy the thing being sold, you know, like a url.
The problem with using a QR code on TV is that it's a one-way payment mechanism. There's no way for them to know much about you.

Regarding the p for the ECDSA curve, p has to be prime (that's why it's called p) and ideally, you want p to be as close to 2^256 as possible without going over. The mathematical reasons for this are because you want randomly generated 256-bit numbers to be in the prime field. If p isn't prime, this exposes cryptographic vulnerabilities among other problems.
2^256 - 2^32 - 977 (FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F in hex) is pretty freaking close to 2^256. That number isn't arbitrary, it's the closest prime we know of to 2^256 without going over.
The other numbers that define secp256k1 are the base point G (79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 in hex) and G's order n, (FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141 in hex). Why G and n?
G^n by definition is the infinity point, or the identity in group theory. You want to find a G such that the smallest n to make G^n = I to be as large as possible. In this case, we know n &lt; p and the motivation to choose G is based on the fact that n is pretty close to 2^256 as well. Another G could be used if the n were bigger, but n is close enough to p and works fine.
So in other words, secp256k1 is a curve that has parameters that aren't arbitrary.

sqig is giving you bad advice. If the objective of an investment is to keep what you have, you should just bury it in your back yard and be done with it. It's one strategy among many and how you invest depends entirely on your investment goals.
His goal is to not lose principal. Yours might be different. To say that one way is superior is misguided at best and moronic at worst. Logically speaking the expected long-term value of a bitcoin on the upside is $X and on the downside is $0. If $X * probability of success &gt; $800/bitcoin, this is a perfectly fine investment. sqig is an idiot if he thinks everyone should invest like he does.
Buying $1000 of bitcoin is a perfectly fine investment. That's exactly how I got started. If you're okay with the risk, just buy some off of localbitcoins or the like. IMO, the upside is too huge NOT to buy some.

His three main objections to bitcoin:
1. Although bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on entirely transparent algorithms that strictly regulate their supply, there is nothing that regulates their replication. 
Hashing power is what regulates their replication. Altcoins simply don't have anywhere near the hashing power of bitcoin, hence if they use the same proof-of-work scheme, the altcoin can be taken over very quickly and made worthless.
Author clearly doesn't understand what makes the bitcoin network strong.
2. I’m talking about the ability of an authority of some sort, say one with the ability to operate entirely in secret, to trace blockchains as desired, from place to place, and to hack in to systems as required to effectively confiscate these in the event that the authority deems their use to be criminal or politically undesirable.
You can't confiscate without the private key period. And if you keep the private key off-line, you simply can't confiscate. Heck, with multisig, you can't even torture someone and get their keys and confiscate their money. You'd need at least m keys. You can trace bitcoins through the blockchain, that's true, but anyone with even a little bit of security consciousness can make it very difficult to trace. A single coinjoin and you'd be in the clear.
Author simply doesn't understand Elliptical Curve Cryptography and how it works.
3. I believe that there is a third important reason why gold and silver are likely to win out over bitcoin in the marketplace for money, namely culture and religion.
This is a legitimate concern. That said, culture and religion were used to writing letters and sending them through the post office in 1990. They were also calling people using landlines. Culture changes and this author overestimates cultural stability, especially with respect to superior technology.

Until Ethereum can prove that it can do everything bitcoin currently does *securely*, it's not going to gain much traction. The software we're talking about is as complicated as an OS. The security aspects of the coin are going to be paramount and the development cycle should reflect that. I wouldn't expect much for a year at least. Think about how often newly designed OS kernels are released (hint: they take on the order of 3-5 years) and you get an idea of how long this project will take.

What would I want to see? Honestly, a good story. Forget the rest, if it's not a good story, I'm not going to watch. What about decentralization would make a good story? Honestly, I don't know. Most stories by nature require some sort of centralization. That's how you end up with some stakes for the main characters. Perhaps stories, Twilight-Zone style where you show small aspects of what a decentralized world looks like. No crazy recurring characters, just lots of good stories. I'd like to see a variety of different actors, not just the essentially centralized Hollywood A-listers.
What would I do to get people excited? Again, I would write good stories. You'd need really good writers and instead of driving stories from characters, I would drive stories from concepts or interesting ways to view things. Decentralization has a lot of those.
I would personally like to speculate on what a decentralized future looks like. Would the government have trouble collecting taxes on anything other than property? Would property taxes go up so much that property values start to fall? Would economies that adopt decentralization first have a subtle but very large advantage over those that don't?
Hope this helps.

Cheating implies that you are entitled to something and that someone took said entitled thing away from you. Like you bought a car and found out later that it's a lemon or was otherwise misrepresented. Surely, this is not the case for bitcoin?
I think what you mean is that you're envious of all the people that got in early. That's very different from being cheated.
Your question about bitcoin being adopted into the wrong set of hands assumes something, namely that there's some "right" set of hands. Right or wrong in what way? Morally? Legally? Societally? Until you can define who the "right" set of hands are or that this concept should even exist in the world of bitcoin, your question has no meaning.
Does the fact that some people are envious of early adopters pose any significant risk for Bitcoin? Certainly. This is quite analogous of the age-old class struggle. Poor people are envious of rich people and sometimes that leads to social unrest. Could that happen with Bitcoin? Yes. Altcoins are thus far, the main way the envious have tried to subvert Bitcoin and it's definitely possible someone will be successful with enough innovation.

1. $800 is an arbitrary number. It's like stock price, it's got no meaning until you know how many shares there are. So right there, you're not off to a good start because you're complaining about how much something costs without pegging it to anything and then calling it "absurd beyond all tenable logic". If you want a substantive response, you need to explain why the market cap of $10 billion is absurd, not why 1/21millionth being $800 is absurd.
2. Directly, true, but through use of things like gyft, tons do. Sure, there's friction, but that's ok. Normal credit card transactions also involve substantial friction in the way of credit card fees and fraud and the like. The point is that the friction is in different places for each form of payment and thus opens up opportunity.
3. Converting bitcoins to dollars on an exchange involves substantial risk. There are other venues where there isn't as much risk and given the many venture capitalists that are looking to buy without finding buyers, this is significantly less than is to be believed.
4. There are certainly people getting paid in bitcoins at bitcointalk. Sure, it's not many people, but that will only grow. It's actually a really convenient form of payment for small businesses that need services in other countries as it involves far fewer fees.
5. Spending fiat to buy bitcoins still can make economic sense often times because credit cards cost 2-3% for most companies. These often will give 2-5% discount for using bitcoin, so it makes people want to do this very thing you call redundant.
6. And you get this from what? Tulips? Some random stock chart? This is a commodity no one has seen before, what justification do you have that it follows the same rules? You can't just say "obvious bubble" and point to a chart and act as if you've proved a point. You haven't. You've pointed to a chart.
7. It's possible to make it anonymous, but sometimes not having anonymity is actually a feature, not a bug. Consider green addresses and the like.
8. Being cumbersome is an entirely subjective measure. Bank transfers take 3-4 business days in the US. You're telling me that's more convenient than 15 minutes?
9. Having consumer protection should be up to the business selling the thing. It can conversely be seen as business protection. There are two sides to every transaction and you can see how credit cards are perfect for scammers on the consumer side. This merely points out that the balance of power in the transaction is different, not better or worse.
10. Can you prove this? Or is it conjecture? Even if it is merely a store of wealth, what of it? Why is that bad or make a currency worth less? Gold doesn't produce much commerce either and it's still worth a lot.
11. It's actually much more efficient than people burning sticks for warmth. Think about that.

1. There have been flaws found in the past. They were quickly patched by the core developers and I would imagine any flaw would be patched very quickly.
2. There are many crypto-currencies floating around. Some with some very interesting properties (demurrage in Freicoin, for example). If you're looking at ripple, you should look at colored coins. That's something that goes on top of the bitcoin protocol and does everything ripple does but decentralized.
3. bitstamp is the one most people in the US use since that's the price coinbase tends to quote. bitcointalk.org is great because they have a lot of sub-boards, etc. New altcoin announcements are there, for example and you can make a lot of money mining some of them. Protoshares, for example started just a month ago and trades for ~0.025 BTC. If you got in at launch day, you could easily have mined about 5 blocks, worth 250 PTS or 6.25 BTC. Not too shabby.

Generally, you have a master key which can generate a multitude of wallets. Elliptical curve cryptography is used so you can pretty much use any 32-byte string as the seed to generate a private/public key pair in a deterministic way. By appending certain known strings to a master key and then hashing it to a 32-byte string using a known hashing function, you can create a new private/public key pair.
This is relatively easy to do with any string. BIP-0032 lays out a specification so that it's very easy to categorize them, but it's possible to make lots and lots of deterministic wallets from a single master key.

Instead of an exchange, soon, there will be a need for a fiat-backer for colored coins. That's where a big bank will be very, very useful and have a significant opportunity.
Essentially, if you'll back a colored coin with dollars/euros/etc., a distributed p2p exchange becomes a reality very quickly. You don't even have to let unknown users cash out colored coins to fiat. It's essentially a bank function, but in the context of colored coins, it allows all sorts of alt-coin trading. It's also profitable if you charge slightly more than a dollar for a colored coin representing a dollar.

I'm going to give you a different answer than the typical "supply-and-demand".
It's the network. This network and protocol give bitcoin its value. You have an auditable record of what happened at any time during bitcoin's entire existence. Think that's not valuable? Ask any auditor for any accounting firm how valuable that is.
There's also the fact that this is not a network you can easily "break". There is enormous hashing power securing this network and not allowing people to cheat. That level of forced honesty is also what give it value.
This will become more obvious over time as newer technologies are built on top of the bitcoin protocol. Already, there's proofofexistence.com which is a distributed, unhackable record of something having existed at a point in time. It is an unalterable proof that a document you created existed at a certain point.
Distributed, trustless records are enormously valuable. Think about how much fraud there is in almost any industry (health care, real estate, education, small business, anything). How much is eliminating even a small portion of the fraud to you? Having a distributed, universally accepted proof of transaction is very, very valuable.
So in short, what gives bitcoin value is the network since bitcoin the network cannot exist without bitcoin the currency and vice versa.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:04:11

2. NO CHARGEBACKS. credit cards have charge-back periods of up to 30 days.
3. Unlike cash, you're not going to get robbed of bitcoins if you're backing up your wallet.
4. Unlike cash, you don't have to give change.
5. Unlike cash, your employees can't steal bitcoins from you if you set it up right.

If you really think Bitcoin's only good for sending money overseas, you really have no business spouting any opinions about it.
It's first and forebost a distributed registry. That it happens to be a registry of the currency bitcoin is only the first use. Once you understand that Bitcoin the protocol is the actual valuable thing underneath it all, you'll see the value.
You have to realize there's a whole distributed/decentralized asset registry underneath it all. Check out stuff like  to see what I mean. Once colored coins come, there's another whole set of assets that can be managed through the protocol.

With respect to a house or a car, it's a lot like loans to pay for those things. If you buy a house with 20% down, you own 20% of the house and the bank owns 80%. If the bank sells your mortgage, then some other entity owns the 80%. Then if they bundle that mortgage up into a security and sell it on wall st., suddenly some investor has like 0.0001% of your house. It's really complicated to know exactly who owns what percent of your house. Now when you pay interest to your bank, they pay the various securities that actually own your mortgage and they in turn pay the investors of the security. Pretty much all the actors in between take a cut and it makes your mortgage more expensive.
That's the problem they're meaning to address with colored coins. You can issue portions of your house as a colored coin "stock". If you issue 10000 satoshis that represent shares of your house, you keep 2000 (for your 20%) and give some lending entity 8000 (their 80%) in return for a loan. You actually don't care who owns that 8000, but you need to pay interest on the loan and the entity that owns your mortgage will need to get that interest. Using colored coins, this process is very simple. Trace who has the coin and send interest.
There are huge bookkeeping expenses that are related to problems like this in the real world that can easily be solved using something like colored coins.

There is the potential to use the blockchain as a registry, similar to a patent office or copyright office. You would take whatever document (your work of art or patent description) and hash it and put that into the blockchain as a comment in a colored-coin transaction. That way, you can prove when your invention was created and be able to settle disputes.
That's the idea behind smart property where you could register a car or a house on the blockchain and transfer the rights to the property simply by transferring the colored coin that represents it. No need for a registry of deeds or whatever, you would be able to prove you owned something. The same would go for a copyright or a patent. That said, the whole idea of copyright and patent depends on a central authority that recognizes intellectual property exists and are willing to enforce that idea. I think you'd find some here that aren't so willing to accept that premise.
As far as actually getting paid by registering something, that can only happen if some central authority compelled you to pay. So no, bitcoin isn't going to be a cure for piracy. It does, however, make micropayments more accessible than ever. You can charge a fraction of a penny to read an article or watch a movie preview, for example.

Paper Wallets are the keys to an address. You can boot up a fresh machine, install electrum (or some other paper-wallet supported client) and enter the paper wallet and you'll have the balance ready to spend.
It sounds like you're looking to invest. In that case, the easiest and most straightforward option is:
1. buy some bitcoins from coinbase
2. set up an electrum wallet and put the generation phrase onto a piece of paper
3. send your coinbase balance to your electrum wallet. 
4. install electrum onto another machine with your piece of paper and see if you can get it to show your address and balance. 
5. If 4 was successful, uninstall from both places and you're done.
Another option: buy a couple of loaded casascius coins and keep them in a safe.

there will be parties that refuse to accept dollars, once inflation gets high enough. heck, look at bitmit or bitcoinclassifieds or whatever. people would LOVE to sell their stuff for bitcoins, but no one wants to pay. as the purchasing power of bitcoins goes up, the more merchants are going to prefer bitcoins as the payment method of choice. this will lead to bigger discounts for using bitcoins, further increasing bitcoin's value.
it's not unlike traveling to countries with inflating currencies and capital controls. they vastly prefer dollars there and some people even refuse to deal in local currency. the same will eventually happen with bitcoin if things continue to progress.

At current difficulty, if you can get 650 MH/s, you can mine about 1 bitcoin per month: 
There are several cards that can do this:
The two that stand out are the 7970 ($400 or so) and the 7990 ($800 but not available anywhere)
However, difficulty should start increasing, so you're going to get 1 bitcoin the first month at the most and then drop to 0.5 or so. The 7990 is about the only one that'll get you this sort of return and it costs $800 if you can find it anywhere.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:20:57
First, nobody has these yet. If they did, they're mining with it as that's way more profitable.
Second, this is a pre-order. By the time you get it, there will be a lot of these on the market and the difficulty will be really high.

First, it would be centralized. Second, it would be traceable. Third, each citizen would have exactly 1 address (based on social security number or something similar).
Taxation becomes trivial and automatic. Illegal transactions become much more difficult as they're entirely traceable.
How? You make a centralized server that keeps track of who owns what. Transactions are really ledger entries on the centralized server.
How would they sell it? First, keeping transaction fees down to 0%. Second, stop illegal activity. Third, making sure everyone pays "their fair share". Fourth, making the economy much easier to manage.

If mBTC is silver to BTC's gold, then start denominating in mBTC already. Crazy or not, a lot of people simply don't want a small number of BTC's and are going to LTC's to have a larger amount.

@_date: 2013-11-26 20:36:59
Don't bother. Why do you care if she thinks it's a fraud? The market has spoken over and over and over again.
1. Do you understand what the blockchain is? Basically, it's a giant ledger of what address owns what number of bitcoins. When you do a transfer from address A to address B, that gets recorded into the blockchain as part of the mining process. In order to actually have the right to record it into the blockchain, they have to do what's called a "proof of work". That's taking the hash of all the transactions and getting a number that's smaller than a certain amount. So a SHA-256 hash produces a number that's between 0 and 2^256. If you say the hash must be below 2^220, that means each hash has a 1/2^36 probability of actually getting such a number. Now any miner that finds the proof-of-work has the right, as part of the mining process, of assigning 25 brand new bitcoins to a new address. That's how they get created.
2. Unless you're buying thousand dollar ASICs, don't bother. Mine altcoins instead.

He's really caught up on the intrinsic value thing. His argument being, of course, that Gold has intrinsic/non-zero value and hence can be divisible and that bitcoin does not have intrinsic/zero value and hence can not be divisible.
If we say "so is the dollar", he says, true, but you can pay taxes with it, so it has some intrinsic value. That part doesn't make any sense to me. You can't pay taxes with Gold, either.
I would say, yes, bitcoins do have utility as something other than money. Look at colored coins. You can use each 100-millionth of a bitcoin (satoshi) as an asset ledger. It's useful to KEEP TRACK of various assets in the same way a ledger is useful.  The equivalent in the physical world would be stock certificates, records of who owns what/how much is issued, etc. This is a real utility outside of the entire bitcoin system. It's just digital so there's this perception that it's not real, but it very much is useful.

Those features aren't implemented by any software yet. They're just possible given the protocol. We'll have some of this functionality once colored coins goes live.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:44:07
This can be implemented with the current bitcoin network + colored coins. Basically, each person would register an address with proof of citizenship to a central authority. The central authority issues 2 different colored coins, 1 for yes, 1 for no. Each person votes by sending the coin that they want back to the central authority. If you want to let someone vote for you, you send both coins to the person you trust.
Since it's a public ledger and each address needs the private key to vote, the votes are guaranteed to be legit.
The only problem, however, is that you'll now know who voted for what. Look up any person's public key and you'll see in the public ledger (blockchain) what they voted. It's a little hard to tell if it's a yes vote or no vote, but can be figured out by tracing the payments back.
This doesn't necessarily have to be just a government. You can do something similar for any large entity that requires a democracy.

It seems you're objecting to the fact that some people will be rich without having "earned it". I'm not sure why that should matter at all. There are plenty of people in the US that are rich and many of them do really good things (Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, for example). Rich people will do what they can to protect their wealth or to do something good with it, so in that sense, the people with tens of thousands of BTC have very little incentive to crash this market.
The USD is controlled by the Fed. They can, have and continue to print money. That's actual centralized regulation that you seem to be alluding to. A small group of people that have a lot of BTC are not anything like the Fed. They can't print money, they're not incentivized to collude and destroy the currency and they can't impose any kind of capital controls like you see in Cyprus. FDR made it illegal to own more than a certain amount of gold. That's regulation. That sort of thing is literally impossible for any of the early miners to do.
All the things that you're arguing are understandable, but misplaced. You seem to fear the unknown of what those people with a lot of bitcoins will do. That's like worrying that Warren Buffet and Bill Gates will destroy the USD somehow.

Regarding the double-spend problem, what do they think of green addresses? If, for example, a user were to be able to put funds into a 2 of 2 script with the other party being a green address that the merchant trusts (the green address would be responsible for only signing the script the first time and not signing any other time), would that make them less hesitant about 0-confirmation?

This is correct. What will be interesting is if a business offers a variety of colored coins that are "untainted", whether that will add enough value to make it worth more is a value proposition that business needs to articulate.

Simple answer, stratum is a protocol developed by the guys that made the electrum client for communicating small bits of information without doing the request over and over again. Basically, if you don't use stratum, you have to connect to the pool each time you need work. If you use stratum, a single connection persists the entire time you're mining.

They own 1% of bitcoin right now, market cap is 4 billion, which means they have 40 million-ish.
100 billion / 40 million = 2500
2500 * 400 = 1,000,000
They'll reach parity when bitcoins are worth $1 million USD. If they have roughly double that, maybe they'd consider, so $2 million per bitcoin.
At that point, you should be able to just transact everything in bitcoins, including buying a company. If FB does well, it might take longer, but around the 1-5 million/btc mark.

i've tipped up to 25% before, especially if my kids make a mess, but this attitude of entitlement makes me want to tip you much less. i'm OBLIGATED to tip? no i'm not. i expect you to remember when i tell you my kid has an allergy. i expect you to bring my food out in less than 20 minutes. i expect you to bring me the tabasco sauce when i ask for it. to expect a generous tip when you don't do these things? no, you don't deserve it because you're not doing your job.
a tip is VOLUNTARY. just like your continuing to work for your employer is voluntary. if you give me a good experience, you will be rewarded, probably. but it's not a certainty. you chose this job which has high $$$ variance, don't expect me to cover for you.

Just wait until colored coins hit the scene. That's going to open up huge possibilities. Remember, bitcoin is a protocol, there are lots of things you can build on top of it besides the currency itself.
Peer-to-peer lending/trading, bond issues, stock IPOs and the like will be available to the masses and not just the financial elite. Eventually, I believe smart property will also be hosted on the blockchain. No more registry of deeds! Just an entry in the blockchain. Imagine being able to sell your car to another address and the owner instantly has control of the car and your smartphone can no longer start the car. There are so many possibilities and we're just scratching the surface.
In other words, don't think "currency", think global asset tracker.

1. Miners have many different considerations when accepting a transaction. They include things like size of the transaction (literal size of the block which will go into the blockchain), fee associated with it and how much in bitcoins are being transferred. Most mining software right now don't really care that much about any of them. The actual computing difference is negligable for almost all of them. Perhaps an especially large transaction might cause a millisecond delay in the computation of the merkle tree. If a particular node don't take some transaction, it's just going to stay out there and enough good nodes exist that they eventually will. Basically, you only need to rely on the fact that good nodes do exist (hint, almost certain) for your transaction to EVENTUALLY go through. If you want it faster, you do need to pay.
2. The blockchain is the record of all transactions ever. There's currently a 1 MB/block limit, so its maximal growth rate is 50 MB/day, though in practice it's much smaller. That ends up being a max of 18 Gb/yr. Hard drive capacity grows by more than that every year. In fact, it's much more than that (1 TB/yr currently, but on an exponential curve). You can buy a 1TB drive for $80, so nodes will be good for another 50 years just on that drive if the current max block-size limit holds. The bigger problem is if we have much more in the way of transactions per second. We'd need to increase the block size and there are ways around that, but at the current established 1 MB block limit, we're good to go for a long time (at least well past your lifetime).
3. The protocol updates based on what the majority of the miners accept in theory. In practice, it's simply whenever they update the bitcoin open source project. Until different clients become popular, this will be the case for a while.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:43:57
1. Higher Demand/Lower Supply. Any time price rises, this is the case.
2. Nobody knows. Anyone that tells you they do is a liar because nobody knows the future.
3. Again, nobody knows.
4. Everyone who has held this asset for at least 18 months has made money. Often, lots of money. If you want to trade for the short-term, go for it. Just know that the people who have been most negative in the past have also been the most wrong.

Usually they stay with you until the transaction is confirmed. Try it, it's great.

I don't believe you need to reference previous transactions in order to sign your current transaction. However, in the scheme you are proposing, the paper wallet is no longer secure. An attacker can get your transactions and private keys to the target addresses and get all your bitcoins. If they're conveniently on the same computer, all the better.
Point is, your paper wallet no longer protects you from online attackers.

Let's think about what these verses are saying. Basically, it's that an authoritative state (the second beast) is going to force people to receive a mark to buy and sell. The mark is presumably a way to identify buyers and sellers.
Now let's look at what bitcoin is. It's an anonymous way to buy and sell. It's much more likely that bitcoin is the thing that the authoritative state reacts AGAINST. Bitcoin is the thing that would cause an authoritative state to force buyers and sellers to identify themselves in order to trade. Your argument to your parents should be that bitcoin is the currency of the Christian resistance, not the currency of the beast.

An issuer (a company, person, or entity) issues colored coins. There is a genesis transaction that determines the "coloredness" of each coin. So, if 10000 satoshis were issued for a particular color, there can only be 10000 such satoshis of that particular color.
Now once such coins are issued, they can be traded in whatever way the owners see fit. For a bond issue, for example, each colored coin would be exchanged for some equivalent loan amount in BTC. That BTC then is used by the issuer and the loan is paid back on a particular schedule to the owners of each coin of that color.
It's a protocol for stock/bond trading. This way if Satoshi Dice were to issue stock using colored coins, you can own the stock and it would be irrefutable using the bitcoin blockchain.
That said, it can be much more than that. Having a traceable record of a particular coin is very useful for many things.

You color a coin by issuing them. That will be something anyone will be able to do once there's a colored coin client. Once a coin is colored, nobody else can color any other coin the same color.
You can verify that a coin is a particular color because there's a chain of ownership back to the originating transaction (in fact, that transaction hash is in the definition of the color). Again, you need a compatible client to be able to see that. (they're working on that client as we speak)
And yes, if it represents stock in a successful company, you will be able to trade it for face value + X, where X is more than what you originally paid for that colored coin.
Note that the face value will almost always be tiny compared to the value of the asset it represents.

To be fair, there are technologies that do pop, and those are the ones made obsolete by newer technology. For example, if you plot type writers, fax machines or telegrams on this graph, they would have a precipitous drop at some point.
That's the big risk with bitcoin, it's whether something far superior will come along and beat it. This is a far different argument, however, than the ones that the media pundits give for it being a bubble.

The problem here is that you can't have both privacy and legitimacy. Basically, if you give everyone privacy, you necessarily allow for fraud. For example, if you don't have a link between person and account, you can easily create many new accounts (without a link to a person) and cast illegitimate votes for whichever side you want.
You can, however, have a third party that manages the links between the person and public address. But again, the vote is only as legitimate as this third party is honest.

If it has that much potential, then why are you getting rid of it? If it's a sure thing you can make 1.2m in 4 years, why would anyone get rid of it?
Real estate development is one of the most risky investments precisely because it's so uncertain. There are all sorts of local zoning restrictions, building restrictions, contractors, permits, etc. which take a whole lot of time and add a whole lot of uncertainty.

Send bitcoins back to the address that sent them, I would imagine. I imagine this is part of the buildout which requires some thought.

@_date: 2013-11-15 00:45:35
In the colored coins yes there are things you can no longer do. If you have a corporation with 2 shares total vs 10 million total, you would need at least 10 million for the latter whereas you only need 2 for the former. The more things you want to keep track of, the more satoshis you need. Basically, you need more units for more tracking of assets with colored coins.
So yes, bitcoin does have intrinsic value outside of it being a currency. It's useful at an atomic level for colored coins.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:59:54

@_date: 2013-11-11 22:57:26
Honestly, I actually think banks would be excited about this. They can cut expenses all over the place and have complete audits of their loans for free in the public blockchain! Note that you don't have to pay back in BTC. You can issue 80% of your house in return for some other colored coin which may be backed by the bank and pegged at $1. Then you pay your mortgage by getting the bank's colored coin for $1 a piece until you have exactly the amount of money you need to pay the mortgage and issue some of that as interest and the rest to get back equity in your house. There is an INDISPUTABLE record of who paid what when for what percentage. For free. I'd guess they spend a lot of money and time doing that now.

Great article, thank you.
I'm realizing that the real opposition against bitcoin is very much related to the ideology it represents, or more accurately, the economic truth it brings into focus. Specifically, the Krugman/Neo-Keynesian views of the world say that a currency like bitcoin simply cannot work given their economic models which stem from their ideology. Yet it very clearly does. Either your ideology is flawed or reality is flawed.
The people that oppose bitcoin simply don't want to change their world view in which inflation, central banking and any spending (be it by a government, business or people) are good. Yet reality has a way of adjusting theory and this is inevitable. As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, those in ideological opposition will simply have to change or lose their minds.

This is the exact sort of linear projection that leads to terrible decisions by governments and some companies.
So if bitcoins are hoarded by everyone, you think merchants are going to stand there and NOT try to get a commodity that everyone else wants? Hell no, they're going to give discounts to get that commodity. Go to any country with capital controls and see how much they appreciate dollars.
The more money is valued, the more value it will get in return. Merchants and producers now have to make a better product in order to get that money. Instead of an economy based on consumption, it's now based on production. You have to make your goods really attractive or otherwise you go under. That's the real power of saving.
Your scenario is Keynesian wishful thinking.
