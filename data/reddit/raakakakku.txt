With an inflationary currency, like the USD, if you just sit on your savings, they slowly depreciate in value: instead of hoarding money, you need to invest it, so that the economic activity will outpace inflation. A deflationary currency, like Bitcoin is designed to be, provides no incentive to invest as you might as well sit on your savings. That is why mild inflation, such as the USD's is typically correlated with economic growth, while deflation is nearly always correlated with economic decline.

Your dad's 75k, if he made it in the mid 60s, would have placed him within the top 5% of US incomes, while 75k today is close to the average US household income, or about the 70th percentile. A shift from 75k in the 1960s to 75k today indicates an strong downward social mobility, but not an overall decrease in purchasing power.

The fee is 10% for buying, and 10% for selling, so if you come with a $100 bill, exchange it for BTC, and change back immediately, you leave with $81.
Not bad. Those fees are only about two to three times as high as the most expensive currency exchange booths you'll find at the airport. Progress!

You have it wrong. Let me explain. If I have $1M today, and you earn $50 in an hour, I own the equivalent of your 20,000 hours worth of labour. With 3% inflation, in 25 years, I still hoard $1M, but your hourly wage has now increased to $100. I now only own the equivalent of your 10,000 hours worth of labour.
Without inflation, your labour would be worth less compared to my capital, not more.

Bitcoin does not put deflationary pressure on anything. Firstly, because the volume is tiny, and secondly because it cannot readily be exchanged for goods or services (inflation is not a measure of exchange rates, but of purchasing power).

This is a serious issue. The block chain does not contain the illegal material itself, but links to it - however, distributing such links is also illegal in many jurisdictions, and rightly so.
Allowing the storage of arbitrary content is problematic, especially for what is designed to be a distributed block chain - and the ability to incorporate links, whose targets can be manipulated later, is especially problematic. However, the paper outlines possible mitigations, that future implementations of block chains may be able to implement.

Here is a suggestion: stop gambling away your possessions and become a landlord today. If you'd done that a year ago, you would be much better off.

And you think they would use the bitcoin blockchain for that, essentially putting the interbank clearing system in the hands of Bitmain? Interbank clearing works extremely well and extremely efficiently - ask yourself why you have to pay a fee for a bitcoin transaction but SEPA transfers are free. If banks ever decide to implement a block chain for this, it will not be bitcoin, and it will almost certainly not be proof-of-work. Why replace a system that works well with one that is so obviously flawed?

I am not sure what you mean. Of course, the bitcoins exist on the block chain. However, if A sells bitcoin to B, they don't need to send any blocks. Owning bitcoin means knowing the key to a bitcoin address. The problem lies is in the non-financial information stored on the block chain, not in the bitcoin itself.

You assume that a miner would continue to mine even below cost and simply hold on to the bitcoin reward. That would be irrational: once the marginal cost of mining is below the value of the reward, a miner would be better off not mining (and, like everyone else, buy bitcoin for less than the cost of mining, if they wish to speculate on an eventual price increase).
There must be bitcoin price where, without a change in difficulty, mining is unprofitable for, say, 10% of current miners, another (lower) price where it is unprofitable for 50%, and yet another (even lower) price where it is unprofitable for 99%.
At the moment, the marginal costs of individual miners are very diverse, so it's possible that even a very large price drop does not result in a 50% reduction of the hash rate. As mining becomes more concentrated, and the marginal costs even out, the hash rate should get more sensitive to price drops.

They are selling bitcoins, which is not the same as distributing the block chain.
Owning bitcoins (i.e. the private keys) itself is not a problem, but possessing or distributing the block chain is problematic.

In short: yes, Twitter is obliged to take down tweets that include illegal content, and if they don't do so in a timely manner, they are breaking the law (the specifics depend on the jurisdiction). Likewise, if you disseminate illegal content (for example by retweeting them), you may be committing a crime.

Did you read the paper that's linked in the guardian article?
It is very easy to verify which block contains which content, it is easy for anyone in possession of the block chain to find and extract the content, and there are many examples of child pornography stored on the current Bitcoin block chain, distributed to anyone who downloads it. All this will also be quite easy to demonstrate in court.
Intent is difficult to demonstrate, but in some cases, that may not be necessary.

Bitcoin does not compete with credit cards. In return for their fees, those offer extra features such as buyer protection and, of course, "credit". Bitcoin does not offer credit or protection, and competes with debit cards, mobile payments, etc. which charge a fraction of a percent.

Oh, you mean, with split-second confirmations, on a network that can effortlessly handle millions of transactions per second? That works both with apps on your smart phone (or connected watch) for instant, user-to-user transactions, as well as with passive cards equipped with cryptographic chips, that are accepted for payments by millions of merchants all over the world? I wonder why nobody thought of that before. It might even catch on!

If I draw lines over past data, I can be fairly accurate!
If you told me this was from 2014, I would be somewhat impressed. It is only five months old, and the predicted price is already \~50% off.

But it's not even right!  
The "prediction" is accurate where it's compared to past data - no surprise there. It's far too high for the (short) period since.

Actually, there is less; bitcoin adoption is declining. I don't know what your metric is, but there is a supermarket nearby that used to accept bitcoins, it no longer does. Total transaction volume is way down. There may be more "startups" trying to push bitcoin use (there is always a delay in economic cycles), but the number of actual transactions and the total volume of transactions has declined.
