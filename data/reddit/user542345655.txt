too late, federal police already raiding his home and offices. Now we can understand why he didnt want to be exposed. the damn government is after every last bitcoin.

Unless you can show how many people purchase and hoard/hodl then the volume is equivalent to a regular exchange. eg. if people spend the coins to buy goods and services, the coins are then dumped on an exchange by the seller .
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:19:14
wow...... probably the ATO wanting some of them bitcoins or they are mad that he allegedly set aside money to get even with one of the ATO's employees. Lastly it could be because of his bankruptcy application despite owning millions in bitcoins.

So you know A-Priori that people in russia buy bitcoins in in order to hodl and do not spend them. Great detective work sherlock...

The government will confiscate them and sell them like they did in the USA. If they do so price will tank.

He just doesnt get why some people dont want to give their DNA to an exchange and submit to a cavity search as well. 
Ill explain like he is 5. 
1) people dont want to send kyc to an exchange but may want to trade on an exchange with leverage
2) they buy bitcoins on LBC and then send the bitcoins to an exchange.
3) Now they trade with leverage on an exchange without KYC.

he probably just owed the ATO some money and they heard that he has bitcoins so they want it. 
He made some enemies in the ATO and he even setup a fund to get revenge on them.
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:20:16
The volume shows nothing whatsoever, as far as you are concerned people buy the bitcoins, spend them on goods/services and they go right back to an exchange. The cycle then repeats. 
On chinese exchanges they trade "20m coins" per week - thats more bitcoins then there are in circulation...
Unless you can show how many people purchase and hoard/hodl the coins the volume is not relevant to how many coins are mined.
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:30:32
Ever heard of KYC?
If you buy bitcoins on LBC you can then leverage trade without KYC on many platforms.

US dollars are non volatile. Bitcoins are extremely volatile. 
No one buys them as a store of value. They either speculate or use them to buy goods and services.
@_date: 2015-12-15 11:00:33
care to explain what the difference is. how do you know the buyers dont just purchase goods and services with the coins which then get dumped straight back on an exchange. Hence it being equivalent to exchange volume.
@_date: 2015-12-15 14:45:58
ever heard of the darknet?

"The contract also claims that Wright is facing bankruptcy. According to Australian public records, Wright filed for personal insolvency in 2006 and was denied, but records make no reference to an insolvency petition in 2011."

thats pretty trivial for an entire week, compared to 10million coins traded on just huobi this week. (hint: fake volume bots).
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:56:17
its worth a 7 year prison sentence (like one of the FBI agents received for stealing bitcoins during the Ross Ulbricht affair) to steal 1.1 Million bitcoins...
Also once the government is involved who knows what they are up to. eg. They'll accuse him of domestic terrorism (or helping isis or something) and steal all his coins as a matter of national security...

Do gas stations need to register with fincen and obtain MSB licences in all states?
Why do people need this requirement in order to trade another commodity called "bitcoin"?

What exactly did they do? I really dont get the story?
Seems like she was a professional photographer who got paid in bitcoins? What is this all about?
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:57:03
Costs them $50 
Costs you $400
Profit: $350 + free bitcoins which consumer pays with their electricity bill... 
(instead of consumers paying their electric bills for the bitcoins why not extort consumers for "rent payments" which can be used to purchase bitcoins at much better rates?)

What I dont get is what exactly have they done to be labelled scammers/not-scammers? 
Like besides having probably bought twitter followers or however it works, what other "sins" have they committed? 
What do they even do ???
Can someone make a noob friendly explanation to decrypt all this drama?
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:40:14
They can just leak the "private email" or "private phone call" anyway. Nothing is private these days...

the fact that they cant preload it without kyc/aml in the USA goes to show how regulation will stifle innovation and technology advances. Ridiculous...
@_date: 2015-09-20 11:59:36
The USA got sick of seeing china ban bitcoin multiple times a day and yet realizing that the bans were not affecting bitcoin in the slightest. They have now decided to give it a good old american try. 
You cant fix stupid.

people dumping the price after the auction. is it related?

watch on 2x speed and it sounds like actual chinese.
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:15:23
was worth 250 at time of auction announcement, will the bidders price the coins at the bubble value considering they cant offload them all for cash without crashing the price?

Would be good if they ran it from some place that doesnt give a hoot about government requests for information.

Because they might want their account and money to get frozen for 6 months. Bitcoin is just too safe and boring. /S
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:18:58
not unless someone buys every single bitcoin, if a trader just wants 2k they can buy that easily on an exchange.
I dont get why people insist that anyone who only wants to buy a small amount of a few thousand coins has to attend this auction. The price was 250 at the time of the auction announcement ... even with $10 slippage for a 2k buy (really much less) the price could have been the average of 250-260 so 2k coins bought for $255.... why would they attend the auction in order to pay 400+ ... have you guys gone mad?
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:25:36
@_date: 2015-11-01 04:49:50
yes very strange. Seems like CNY is worthless since people cant get it out of the country.
theres an official exchange rate and then a black market rate that it is actually worth since it cant be withdrawn from china. seems like bitcoin is trading at the black market rate.
If anyone wants to make purchases from china just use bitcoins to receive over 10% discounts.

Good site, they should really add an option for google Authenticator - 2 factor - for withdrawals though. I hear sms isnt that secure. Also if you leave your account logged in anyone can withdraw your entire balance without any further requests for two factor/password.
