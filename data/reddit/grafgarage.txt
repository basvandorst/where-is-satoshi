Ding ding ding!  Same system with the same incentives produces the same fraud.  Shocking!
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:16:56
That's because no one is using them.  Anyone could fork BTC at this time and claim their version "works better" because no one is using it and space on the blockchain isn't scarce yet.  If they had the same volume of transactions as BTC they'd have a problem.  
Bcash shot themselves in the foot by ripping out segwit.  The forum isn't full of constant drivel about the whitepaper and satoshi's vision.  They've all been conned by Roger Ver.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:57:05
This has nothing to do with bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:47:32
The whitepaper is an excellent start and should be mandatory reading for anyone trying to understand the history of bitcoin.  However, do not treat the whitepaper as gospel.  There is no way Satoshi could have anticipated how things have evolved today.  I am very proud of how the developers of core have managed things to do this day and have 100% confidence in their ability to scale bitcoin in a sustainable manner.

He doesn't deserve our attention. Roger Ver is irrelevant to bitcoin and should be treated as such.

Bcash has no real roadmap for scaling.  It's a dead-end led by barely competent developers.

Agreed.  Please make that an XXL bag of donkey dicks.  I have no problem with Roger supporting another crypto.  That would be awesome if all things were fair. But he is a constant stream of lies and misinformation.  It's disgusting.

It's a complete toxic waste dump over there at I've tried engaging a few discussions on but no one wants to actually discuss anything they just want to downvote content that doesn't blindly support bcash.

I'm gonna go for market manipulation for $1000, Alex.  It's going to make great headlines tomorrow when Roger Ver goes onto CNBC FastMoney and talks about how the largest US exchange "froze" the trading at $9500. Sure smells like a great story to put on the news tomorrow while Roger continues to pump into oblivion.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:31:21
Yea, have you heard the world is flat?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:10:35
It's junk because it's a hard fork of BTC that did nothing except increase block size which didn't solve a problem it just deferred it.  And the only reason it's working "better" is because no one uses it.  Bcash does not have a scaling solution long term, bitcoin has numerous.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:54:01
And at this point it seems obvious Coinbase is colluding with Roger Ver in the bcash dumpening.  They're intentionally holding back BTC to prop up bcash
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:18:12
Stop.  Just stop.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:41
I disagree with that.  My discussions that might have been seen as intellectual have always been downvoted into oblivion.  Ask a question here that's rooted in logic and people are usually more open to discussion.  Of course, IMHO.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:45
So why is it every other exchange is functioning and trading BCH around 3k and Coinbase/GDAX is around 9500 after halting trading? Market manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:25:52
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:26






Except BCH trading isn't even functional right now.  Coinbase / GDAX can't even launch a new coin with a functioning platform.  The greed is strong.

Exchanges transferring millions of dollars IS a real function.  Have you ever tried transferring hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in a traditional bank? 
Go ahead, try it and tell me how fun it is.  With bitcoin, you can do it around ~10 minutes and absolutely zero bullshit from corporate entities trying to hold/freze your funds, perform KYC/AML functions, etc.
Bitcoin IS used to buy goods and services but it is not the primary function of the currency as it stands today.  First step is building a secure and proven platform which bitcoin has arguably done over the past 9 years.  Second layer solutions like LN will allow transaction throughput that far exceed any system we have today but these things do not happen overnight.  If you were a programmer you'd understand this.  It is extremely complex and with time we will absolutely see second layer bitcoin solutions that are far better than anything that exists today through traditional banking.

Go ahead and try to send money to a family overseas.  Lets say you live in poverty in the US but you still need to send $100 back home to your family who might live on a few dollars per day.  The bank is going to devour over 1/3 of that $100 in fees just to send the money and you might be hit with something on the receiving end as well.
I don't think you have hardly any real world banking experience from a business, international or sending large sums of money domestically even.  Bitcoin improves substantially on every single one of those utilities.
