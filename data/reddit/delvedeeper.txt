Crazy that he didn't even use truecrypt, that hidden container would've been great for him

Yeah I agree that BIP38 paper wallets should offer the best security, but if you are storing your coins in any form on a hard drive, what not also do it inside a hidden container, nothing wrong with an extra level of security that you can 'reasonably' deny existing surely.

Keep reaching for the moon
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:22:34
Moving off MultiBit as we speak, I hope I don't encounter this issue moving my coins out of the wallet. Think I'm going to move over to Paper Wallets for the time being.

The responses from the dev were completely unacceptable, that's largely why I've decided abandon ship. Keep all your logs and everything you possibly can, for however long it takes, maybe one day there will be a fix for this...
Wishing you luck.

Or you know... Just use it for free
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:30:53
Haha I'm not paranoid at all, security interests me that's all. But I will check out your second link so thanks!

Use Sublime Text, it's pretty awesome.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:25:37
This is actually a very simple/effective way of rendering that issue almost ineffective. Is there anyway you could use a script that if the power is pulled out, it logs out and gives you X amount of settings to enter your password before it shuts down?

A couple of people have said the same that he was in a public library, so would kind of make sense. It is astonishing that he was willing to have his wallet open, with that amount of coins, in any type of public space.
Edit - How was the address labelled 'Silkroad Siezed Coins'? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:16:31
The real question
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:05:42
Perhaps there's another post on the Internet with an address that reveals his identity, or happens at some point in the future.
There are a multitude of situations that could either have happened and compromise his anonymity now, or happen in the future, that can be traced from this one address.

Only bitcoins can buy the purest shit you're smoking

Last time it hit it though was different, I don't know if that's a good thing to go by or not
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:22:19
I'm torn because I also very much think there is a high possibility this is going to happen. I sold 80% of my coins at $850 hoping to catch a smaller bubble and buy back in.
Now I'm thinking about taking the loss and buying back in now and hoping for the moonshot...
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:32:33
But what are the chances we hit the psychological $1000 mark and there's a huge sell wall?
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:51:25
That's my main concern now, the bounce back will be higher than my sell price
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:39:03
Your username is literally my thought process on that ha
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:04:27
Bitcoin hadn't been around for very long and that rise was almost over night. Lots of people would have bought in around the $900+ mark and lost money, they've now had to wait over 2 years for it to get back to this point which has been a steady climb in general, the spike we're seeing now might be the first time the people who lost in the last big bubble can get their money out and profit.

From your own personal point of view, you could ruin yourself financially by having unlimited liability. It's all good until something goes wrong.
From my own personal point of view, I'm trusting a random individual person, even with the best intentions in the world, to my coins, it offers no security.
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:17:45
Literally me right now, I've been hodling for 2+ years, I've sold 80% of my coins at $850, wondering if I've sold too early and should buy back in...
I'm certainly in this for the long run, but was hoping I could increase my bitcoins by catching this bubble, which I'm not even sure it's a bubble anymore, or if it is that it hasn't even started...

Fantastic, congratulations!
I've got a question, in the docs it says rpc commands like "move" will be removed in later versions, will this be replaced with a similar command, or will we need to use regular transactions?
Also, any ideas on when they may be removed? Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:19:52
Here's another, 12 transactions so far -
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:16:39
I had a problem with multibit a while ago when trying to transfer to electrum because the fee was too small. I forget what exactly I did but it came back in the end. Google multibit transaction stuck and you should find the info, if indeed it's the same problem. Mine was an old version of multibit.

And 'encrypt' them by writing down the page number and word numbers of a certain book instead of a plain copy. Also allows you to then encrypt that and store in the cloud for a little extra security.

Nope
