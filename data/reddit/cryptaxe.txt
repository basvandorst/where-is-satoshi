It's okay, plently of people who think all things crypto currency should be decentralized get it, the rest can wait for the next moolah io scam 
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:06:54
Don't worry about that :) atomic is using op return but I won't be merging anything from the bitcoin core branch that would eliminate any functionality. I think you raise a good point though, and this centralized and money powered project in my opinion is not what crypto currency needs. They might have a whole lot more money than us but our goal is decentralized cross chain ledger, not millions of dollars in investments because we are backed by the 'bitcoin foundation' which I honestly find odd to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:21:01
I doubt it's an oversight. They definitely know that's a compromise of security, perhaps it helps their relationship with the legacy financial system?
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:56:25
What we are ATOMIC are doing (we are only in testing right now) is charging a small fee in the source coin if you are performing an exchange, and then that fee is distributed automatically to our asset holders based on their percentage. We are part of the superNET which allows us to use features of other coins such as the anonymous transaction features of coins like BTCD, such transactions would pay an additional premium for access to such features. 
The assets are completely open to the public and have been available on bter for some time now.
I imagine blockstream will be operating at a loss based on the amount of money they are needing, until they find a way to profit without stepping on the toes of their users.

You must have a lot of time to analyze peoples reddit comments... I think you've gone a bit too far down the rabbit hole on this one. Usually on a post like this there are people farting about why they think the price changed. Nobody actually knows, so it isn't a serious conversation and probably a bit delusional but it IS related to bitcoin. I dont give a single fuck what people want to talk about. 
Your response illustrates the point that I apparently failed to make simple enough for you to understand. Instead of talking about bitcoin in general, or even arguing about bitcoin, people were bickering about something off topic. I just want to talk about bitcoin on this page because it is one of the bitcoin pages.

@_date: 2015-01-05 19:09:55
It's something people bring up when I mention bitcoin in conversation. If it's not the fact that people buy drugs with btc is always "oh didn't someone just hack bitcoin and steal them". People who don't understand crypto are the people we need to adopt crypto for it to become as big of a thing as it inevitably will be. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:38:15
This is really frustrating, bitcoin does not need to take another hit and have it's perceived (by the unknowing public) reputation damaged further after incidents like mt.gox and mintpal. Problems like this are the reason why we are developing the ATOMIC cross chain transaction ledger. I hope that it will allow exchanges to be developed which require no trust, make use of the multisig confirmations we are using, and run in a transparent way. No more goxxing

I see these empty blocks from almosy every pool. Maybe empty blocks shouldn't pay the miner subsidy, but that would be a ridiculous change at this point and way too many things would need to change. Once miners are only collecting transaction fees is the soonest we might see this solved. I also wish (but don't think it is possible) that spv mined blocks were invalid.

Update for anyone that cares:
I looked into this and bitcoin (and BU as it is a fork) cannot be complied at all without assertions. So if my understanding is correct, it should have been known that this assertion would be active in production code and there is no way to prevent that. It shouldn't have been there at all.
Please correct me if I am wrong

Yes this seems like a serious issue for the entire network. Does anyone know of any way that this behavior could be detected by other nodes on the network?
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:12:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:31:55
Yep, and an assertion that always fails can be used to make sure that a state or code path which should be impossible to reach is indeed not touched. :)

I don't like the emergent consensus EB AD concept at all, I agree with you that it can cause problems. I don't feel that I particularly fit in with either side of the debate at this point.

The genrally accepted approach to this is to
1. report the issue, potentially with a solution
2. responsibly report the issue to the public
3. once it has been fixed tell everyone to update

There are two issues then. Obviously lacking code review, and then also a disregard for the safety and validity of compiled binaries. The process should be automated, is there any reason they wouldnt be performing gitian builds which would have avoided this mistake I believe? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:57:22
The private keys you own will be valid on both chains. If you have 1 btc and a hardfork like this happens, you now have 1 btc and 1 fork btc. You can sell the 1 btc and keep using the fork btc on the fork. 
People would do that to make money from the free doubling of coins, and I imagine it would also negatively impact the original chain which would be in the best interests of people participating on the fork.

Do you see any way going forward that mining could become decentralised? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:56:03
Yes, by solving transaction maliability SW allows payment channels like LN to rely on the immutability of transactions. Without that guarantee LN would be even harder to implement.

No the LN security model does not involve proof of work 
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:06:59
The reason it would be harder is that before SW, the txid could be changed in various ways by third parties. Now the parts of a transaction which could have this effect have been.. segregated. So with a SW TX, it goes on the network and you can be sure that the txid will not be changing. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 16:38:01
Well they also offer the withdrawal for free via bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:33:11
yeah and it's a pain in the butt, and you aren't making money while you fix everything that breaks 
@_date: 2016-12-04 08:33:00
Yes it could definitely be done, I just mean that currently all work on LN is assuming SW. I think we will eventually see SW activation hopefully, so it should work out regardless :)
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:03:33
it's totally your own business what you can do with your own btc, and if it's on an exchange it isn't yours

@_date: 2016-12-14 19:05:04
I'm really just trying to point out that if someone else is holding the bitcoin, they aren't yours anymore and the person holding it could just run off with them. 
If you're running a legal business, something like Bitpay would be the way to go if you don't want to design your own software.

Do any exchanges provide liquidity to any other services? That could be somewhere to look. There was a scam a while back that was going to be a B2B focused alt coin backed by fertilizer for use inside of the fertilizer trade, which of course never exited vapor ware status.

I wouldn't call the backbone of bitcoin the weakest link. A 'problem' with code is that it does what it says, whether that is what you want it to do or not. Right now proof of work is doing exactly what it is meant to, and it is telling us that there is not consensus on the SW fork. This is unfortunate, and I think that eventually SW will activate, but I know it will only happen if there is consensus, thanks to the weak link of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:58:14
I'm not sure if more users would make it more difficult. More miners and more developers (which we will have in the future if things keep working) would though. Also if a second implementation gained any real popularity, which perhaps has an increasing chance of happening, that would make things more complicated. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:02:33

@_date: 2015-07-18 17:35:35
Is there any way to manually create a transaction and broadcast it to a working bitcoin node (from bitcoin-qt) or do you not have access to your actual keys and unspent transactions with mycelium? 
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:22:21
The way it is limited is that the subsidy paid to miners reduces over time and reaches 0 once 21 million coins have been created.
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:28:59
feel free to finish this or take the code from it. :) 
I have been meaning to finish it but have been focused on other things. Adding a unused filter to listaddressgroupings should be pretty easy on top of this code.

I did a big research paper and presentation about stuxnet in school, but that was in 2012 so forgive me and correct me if I'm wrong about any of this...
To answer your question breifly, no. However, a different kind of virus could do it. 
Stuxnet was a virus very specifically targetted at seimens SCADA control systems particularly a certain unit that was known to be used in the power facility that was targetted. It's also important to note that the manufacturer cooperated / coordinated with the stuxnet creators. Bitcoin miners aren't using these kinds of systems (the power plant they rely on may though). And I don't think they would cooperate, as it would ruin their business. 
A virus could be made however, very different than stuxnet, that targets various operating systems or hardware devices that companies like intel put in computers that effectively can do whatever they want with the computer / server. 
It would be possible for this virus to be installed over the network if a suitable exploit exists. More likely though, as with stuxnet, it would infect the personal device of some mining employee who would then inadvertently infect the mining operation when they plug in a thumb drive.
This attack could shut down all of the servers, and in coordination with a stuxnet style attack on power plants, the attacker could probably do some serious damage if they have the hash power. However, I think if they tried to redirect the hashpower, instead of just turn it off, the miner would notice very quickly and shut everything down. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:12:24
You can put the wallet on the thumb drive :) 
@_date: 2017-04-09 23:09:26

I saw unloaded ones for sale a while back but they were expensive and I didn't get any which I regret now! If you search gold bitcoin on Amazon though there are similar gold plated "bitcoins" available. The one I got is pretty nice, I think it was less than $10 as well. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:13:23
I think miners would be more inclined to adopt sidechains, bringing them additional TX fees, than they were to adopt namecoin. Namecoin is centralized, in your opinion, due to the small number of miners running the full node. Sidechains provide a big incentive, perhaps even more when the block subsidy reaches zero.
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:37:31
A miner running sidechains can profit from many different sidechains, including a namecoin sidechain for example. So there is a larger incentive
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:19:45
It is more work but there is a lot more to be gained, I think.
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:03:08
It is related as sidechain coins are secured by the same type of soft fork that enabled P2SH. This means that miners can steal all P2SH coins, but have agreed not to. So sidechain coins are at least close to P2SH coins in terms of "realness"
@_date: 2016-09-27 19:44:17
If you want to save money, there is no real reason to buy the newer rpi for this purpose. Just find an old one (used would probably be $5 max) and find an old gridseed asic, they are very cheap.

Alright I see your point, thanks for walking me through it. I'll think about this and annoy you again if I have any questions or a response stem from it.

You already know that I'm open to learning from you so please correct me.. I thought the p2sh soft fork made it so that additional rules are applied (by updated nodes) to transactions that old nodes would see as redeemable by anyone. This change is enforced by miners, who could 51% attack the network, stop following these rules, and redeem the outputs for themselves. What did I miss?

I might be a jobs fan boy even though I hate apple products, but I don't think this applies to actual invention. More applicable to consumer electronics and making profit than changing things

I would argue that the funds locked by a sidechain have the same chance of being stolen by a 51% coalition as those locked by P2SH scripts. Not as secure as bitcoin, sidechain users could lose money, but it doesn't make the main chain less secure.

Well you are good to go if you're using linux and download stuff from the repositories at least. I only ran into issues once I went over to build for windows :\

You can have non segwit p2sh outputs.

Sounds like they will try and help you out. You might also be able to import the private key with electrum or bitcoin-qt but I don't know what format the keys you exported are.

If you ever get curious or just have some extra time on your hands you should consider switching from Windows to Linux. Ubuntu is recommended for first time users, you can download it here:

Is it possible for you to use bitpay?  This wont give anyone any privacy whatsoever. However if what you're doing is legal it might be easier for you, and I haven't heard stories of them closing merchant accounts or freezing funds without good reason.

Why wouldn't they just hold on to the Bitcoin as it increases in value?

You're good to go.
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:02:54
Yeah it is and  I've never seen it malfunction. Honestly not sure what the issue is it seems you have everything setup properly. Double check that the IP address you forwarded on your router is pointing to your local bitcoin node, I've set the IP to the incorrect server a few times myself. 
Also, open bitcoin-qt, go to settings-&gt;options-&gt;network and make sure you have this checked:
or set it in your bitcoin.conf, let me know if you need help with that. 
edit: I'm pretty sure you have that checked since you got the 8 connections... hmmmm

In order to move away from the federated version of their system they have said they need segwit
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:31:45
Only 4 layers? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:03:24
I'd say 100+ layers at a minimum 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:38:05
yep, I just said why 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:57:16
There are options in tomato (router firmware replacement) and in the firmware of some routers to prefer connections and throttle others based on the port they are using. Some routers even had a thing called "game fuel" which could automatically do this for many games. Don't know if that's still around. 
Just go check your routers config page and see if there are any options like that.
@_date: 2017-07-06 01:11:00
 you can check with this 
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:06:02
Edited to have correct information:
So 8 is actually the limit for a non port forwarded node you are correct. There isn't really a reason to have more connections at once but if you have properly forwarded the port, it looks like waiting is the only thing to do.

If multiple chains exist, the coins will be valid on both chains. Your father can just keep them how they are right now and if we go back to one chain his coins will still be there. If both chains stay alive somehow, he will just have those same bitcoins on both. 
tldr: don't worry about it. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:50:45
I saw the same thing as you I think. They said they'd use segwit for the more decentralized version. Does anyone know Sergio's reddit user name so we can ask him if it's 100% required? I don't think it is sdlerner like his twitter.. 
The Paul Sztorc version of drivechains does not use segwit in any way but we have segwit (unactivated) built into our codebase as it is an up to date fork from core. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:31:07
He did one on the insolvency reddit I think

Electrum lets you export private keys, and the seed backup will work fine as well as far as I know. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:56:51
I haven't used either of those, but you will be safe if you have the private key. Can you export the private keys themselves instead of as a special format for those wallets? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:17:46
With drivechains the miners still act like miners, and they dont get to change the rules. They can choose if they would like to follow additional rules (softfork) in exchange for sidechain fees, or not. Miners like having more money so they'll probably enforce the new rules. If not, no drivechains but they won't get to mess with anything else like a masternode can. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:22:23
For electrum as long as you leave them alone you're good to go. You have the private keys. If you want to spend coins on the fork things get more complicated. docs.electrum.com/en/latest/hardfork.html I haven't used a trezor or keepkey but they both claim that you don't need to do anything to protect your coins in the event of a chain split.
I wouldn't do anything or move coins until after choas (if there is a fork) settles down.
