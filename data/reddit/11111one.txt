What did you have to do to get the $10? I'm guessing they don't/don't plan to just give it to every new account unless they verify a phone # or something. Also, can you immediately just transfer it to another wallet?

Is there a minimum upload/download speed to run a node for those of us with slower connections?
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:25:57
The whole point of this change is to make it more user friendly for non-early adopters right?

Meanwhile here we are recommending blockchain.info wallet and electrum to beginners.

At least they didn't use a picture of physical coins. After all that my head would have exploded.

I would rather have a balance with ugly numbers because when the time comes to send some you dont feel bad about losing part of it. I will admit though having a lot of 9s at the end is infuriating.

One again, if it wasnt a problem we wouldnt be changing the name. Am i just being misunderstood here or what?
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:24:08
That limit can be raised with an update that causes a fork though right? It would be cool if It was set to something like 20x the average block size of the previous 12 blocks or something, i dunno, anything that wouldn't need to be changed more than once. I just wish an update that prepares for the future would happen asap while bitcoin is still new(ish).

After hearing [some bad stories]( about coinbase, people who stored there probably switched to something else.
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:45:45
Price of an arbitrary unit really doesnt matter for something like that though. That is why the market cap exists for seeing how valuable it is. Units used for trading only really make it easier for transactions. I can see your point though because an average person who doesnt understand bitcoin may not look past the first price they see.
@_date: 2014-08-27 03:04:16
Well of course it would be one unit if it was from the start. I never said anything about one name meaning two different things. You are misunderstanding me and downvoting because of it. I agree that it would probobly not be practical to change now, but if bits are used i think it would be important to use **only** them and satoshis. The average person will get confused with bitcoin being a unit that isnt commonly used and at the same time being the name of the currency.
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:27:14
It does if we don't want massive transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-08-27 00:35:45
If only Satoshi could have foreseen this problem and made it 21 trillion units with 2 decimal places to start. Maybe it isn't too late to just move the decimal point...
@_date: 2014-07-25 02:35:41
Anyone who thinks blockchain size/hard drive capacity isnt an issue needs to read this: 
If bitcoin becomes mainstream in the next 5 years and gets over 500 transactions per second we better hope some kind of blockchain pruning is implemented. Not very many people are going to be able to or want to download 20tb just to run a node in five years.
I don't think off-chain transactions are going to be a viable solution in the long term either. Once the block reward is reduced to a point where most of a miner's revenue is from transaction fees we are going to be paying up to [5 cents per transaction]( at 500tps or $25 at 1tps.
@_date: 2014-08-27 02:05:32
The problem being using 2 different names for different units will always confuse beginers. If the decimal point was moved over 6 places and everyone called that "bitcoins" instead of bits no one would wonder why it was priced with so many different names. making it simple to understand for stupid americans might be an important part toward mainstream adoption (no i am not calling all americans stupid). Honestly i have no problem with calling them bits but i do think it would be better to just use only 1 name and have that be bitcoins with a moved decimal point. Listening to people say "BUT IT COSTS $500 ITS TOO EXPENCIVE" is annoying too. even if they are just being stupid i think bitcoin would be better off just moving the decimal point and not have a name for 1/21 million.
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:38:52
I'm sure the early adopters were smart enough to not be confused by that, but you can just downvote my opinion anyway.
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:43:10
How many solo miners do you think have a connection that slow?
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:51:59
Please tell me how your original comment is relevant then.
@_date: 2014-06-22 00:29:51
No need to change the wireless card unless you need to remain anonymous for the first piece of networking equipment between you and the internet, which is the only thing that should be able to read you MAC address. As for the hard drive it depends what you mean by bitcoin usage. If you are just going to print paper wallets then use a linux live cd (such as ubuntu).
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:24:15
I'm asking you to explain it. If every miner can handle 20MB blocks how will the increased max size affect miner decentralization?
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:49:32
Are you assuming that miners will switch to a pool to avoid running a full node and that is what causes centralization?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:59:46
That is some solid logic charging students 5x more who cannot afford a formal education.
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:12:57
Do you think its a good idea to prevent gaining millions of possible bitcoin users just so people with &lt; 10KB/s connections can run a full node?
@_date: 2015-05-06 10:53:22
I suggest you read the previous blog posts, Gavin goes over this multiple times. This fork isn't meant to be a complete solution to scalability, it is to buy time while finding the perfect one. And yes i consider a possibly slightly weaker network better than having a catastrophe when approaching the 1MB block size limit.
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:17:26
I could easily switch your picture around and say there is no room for users to use the blockchain with 1MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-04-25 15:22:35
Hopefully they wait for the block size limit to be increased. Trust me OP it will only make bitcoin look bad if it tries to go mainstream before then.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:45:24
What can we expect to happen if we scanned it and it said $5 was added but nothing ever showed up?
