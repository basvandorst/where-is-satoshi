Well, I explained the history above.
Also you can't rename subreddits, so... ? I don't know what you're expecting.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:59:48
Eh, that kind of ignores history. 
r/btc was born as an alternative sub to this one due to disagreements on how the sub was run. That's cool, happens all the time. 
When the sub disagreement reached the point of a chain split, what was supposed to happen? The entire sub redirect to an alternative sub? I don't know BCH or something? Perhaps, perhaps that should've happened.
The thing is though, the original intent of the r/btc sub was to allow pretty much any discussion on bitcoin. So you have historical people there who simply wanted a very wild west free place to talk about bitcoin. Shutting down their sub because some people chain split and now support a different coin, that's a bit uncool.
There's not an easy answer.

So, nobody has actually given you the true answer. Anyway, it was created as an alternative bitcoin sub. Some people didn't like the policies of r/bitcoin and thus created an alternative. Happens all the time for all communities.

The resistance to ETFs (that seems pretty sudden and out of no-where) is so incredibly ignorant of how financial products operate.
The whole "Not your keys, not your bitcoin" is fucking stupid in terms of an ETF. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what an ETF is.
When you buy, for example, a property ETF, you're not buying the fucking house that the fund owns, you're buying into the fund and being allocated units within that fund. You share ownership of the funds assets and you delegate the day to day tasks of ownership to some third party (big names in ETFs are Vanguard, ishares, etc.).
You think anyone has ever said "hur dur, don't buy the property etf, if you don't have the house keys in your pocket you don't own it"
Obviously, if you want to own and use bitcoin, you buy it yourself first hand.
BUT, if people want to buy bitcoin through an intermediary there's nothing fucking wrong with that.
You anti-ETF people look like a pack of clowns. It's embarrassing.

Larger blocks = more resources required to process and upload/serve them to others.
Of course, a small block increase wouldn't really run into any centralisation problems but is still strongly opposed by influential people.
My guess is that they want to see the possibility of L2 solutions and whether they can solve the problems of scaling before considering a block increase.

The guys explained it but, here, I'll try to break it down:
* He bought miners prior to bitcoins price rise
* Bitmain sold out of miners
* Bitcoin price rises
* Demand for miners has risen
* Bitmain still out of stock of miners
* Second hand price of miners increases significantly.
* Guy sells his old miners at a large profit
* Put in order for new miners from bitmain
* Bitmain make new miners, send to him
* He starts mining again
It's not that complicated, but it does involve lucky timing and it's not like it's a repeatable strategy.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:29:16


The word "consensus" gets thrown around wayyyy too much without being given a strict definition. The fact that there hasn't been a mass movement of people to BCH from BTC doesn't show a lack of consensus, not technically. It could equally be explained by self interested parties (myself one of them) wanting to maximise their asset value. If you want a representation of where some part of consensus was, and where the rest of the people are who are/were more of less hedging their bets, you'd see who sold off their BCH coins when the fork occurred (at a large loss), but even then, this is a poor metric (and an impractical one).
In the same way that people not immediately moving to BCH instead of BTC didn't prove a lack of consensus. The lack of a "mass selloff" of all BCH by original BTC holders also does not prove consensus.
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:54:32

You realise they're doing this to gather data and flag suspicious accounts.
If you kept using "anything else" you'd rack up a large amount under that category and get flagged in their system.
You'd probably have your account reviewed and it likely would be dismissed, but perhaps not.
That's the purpose of this system. Instead of having the bank develop the software to track transactions and compile data, they're making their customers do it for them.

Hmmm, well I guess we need to be explicit about what we're talking about. Because I think a lot of people are getting confused by the assumptions everyone is making in the discussion.

People are talking past one another instead of to each other.

We don't. I've learnt something important recently. Reddit is almost always utterly terrible for good discussion. It's great for other things, but good or technical discussion rarely works here.
Don't bother.

@_date: 2017-11-06 01:51:05
I'm not a *"prominent backer"*, but I've been in bitcoin a *long* time and **was** backing 2X up to a couple weeks ago. I still believe blocks should be bigger, I probably have made a tonne of enemies in this sub because of my views. I have a lot of people tagged in RES because they attacked me continuously for simply expressing my opinion or asking questions. I am still highly critical of a number of core members, I still have serious questions about a bunch of things related to the bitcoin ecosystem and I think it could be done a lot better.
Despite all of that. I've come to recognise that 2X is a very poor implementation of what might be a sensible idea. Even if you're like me and think that blocks should be bigger, perhaps 2mb, perhaps up to 8mb, I would say to you that the way 2X has been implemented is indefensible. **That alone is reason to drop support for it.**
*Added thought:* People have behaved terribly in this 'debate'. The tactics used are disgusting, hypocritical, devious, just all around awful. I have found that in general reddit and twitter have been the worst places where discussion has occurred. People in very high positions should know better and have been behaving like utter children rather than participants with high involvement and importance in a hundred billion dollar system. That worries the shit out of me, but that's not the immediate concern. 2X is an immediate concern and I just have to say I am finally conceding and dropping support.
*Last thought:* I also want to say, after delving deep into the technicals of bitcoin, a number of the "devs with no name" the quiet devs, the guys who pretty much no-one knows are absolutely amazing. Very open minded, sensible, thoughtful, intelligent, respectful, polite, and humble. If only those personalities rose to prominence perhaps the community wouldn't be so divided.

Thanks for taking the high road and doing the most sensible thing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:38:02


One downside that I didn't see get much traction is that even though it was called a softfork, over time, once segwit transactions are in the history of all future transactions (whether they're segwit or non-segwit wouldn't matter, just if they had a historical segwit transaction), once that happens, all legacy nodes will no longer be able to validate transations. They can do a partial validation, but not a full validation. You'd require a segwit full node to do that.
If you care about that, that can be considered a downside. It can also almost be considered breaking compatibility with legacy nodes (if given enough time). because validation is broken.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:12:09


Key part of that is "the long run".
It is extremely concerning to see fees rise so high this early on in the project. Fee reward for miners should rise above block reward in the long run, but actual fee per tx should hit a cap. People won't use bitcoin otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:36:35
No I think it's worse than that. At least with traditional media there is a semblence of a code of ethics, there's enough competition and enough integrity that most things are fact checked and if not, they're caught relatively quickly.
Right now I feel like there's no independence in bitcoin. It's all factions.
That I think is the critical difference I'm trying to nail down:
* It's the difference between a community of factions, and a community that has independent watchdogs.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:20:27
Hmmm, yes I see and understand the rationale. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:47:15
The utility isn't simply making purchases, it's moving wealth, it's decentralisation, it's independence, the lack of intermediaries. One thing that has grown substaintially over the years is the ability to move the wealth around. A large portion of bitcoins value has been derived from that. Not just buying drugs.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:17:57


IMO, no. it's very bad.
Individual fees per tx should be low. Fee reward for miners can be high supported by larger tx volume. It's crazy to think that fees will support miners if we have capped txs and fees must rise to meet that reward.
If we have a situation in the future with a BTC price of say, $20,000. Imagine when block reward gets halved. That means that fees will need to make up for the difference in miner reward. That means that either TX volume increases to cover same, or fees increase significantly.
$20 per tx is the upper limit. Past that point it is just retarded. Nobody will ever use such a system.
Really, fees should be under $1.
Miners getting rewards from fees over block reward is the future, but the way for that to happen is with increased tx volume, not increased individual fee price.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:39:09
Indeed. This should be upvoted so people can see and learn, not the stupid memes and twitter posts that don't serve any purpose. At least watching this will help educate everyone on bitcoin, which unfortunately is sorely needed because it's just so damn complicated.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:19:56
The system being trustless is good. The community being a pack of cunts is not so good.
About the only people I can "put my faith in", is the quiet devs who's names you'd never have heard of, because all they do is work on the technicals and think about problem solving. The trouble is it's almost impossible to get good communication from those types so it's hard to understand what's going on.
I guess my point is there's no trusted media source for the layman to use. That's a bit of a problem in my eyes, because even though I've been in bitcoin for 5 years+, and I consider myself pretty technically minded and understand a lot of the workings of bitcoin, I **know** I don't have the technical knowledge to truly understand BIPs and proposals to their full extent. Bitcoin is ridiculously complicated in many senses because of the human factor built into the system. I'd wager most of the devs can't understand the full ramifications of changes and proposals because it's just literally too complicated and impractical to have that level of foresight. This forces a lot of people to default to conservative stances which can also lead to another set of problems.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:18:08
I picked that price because I can basically do everything that bitcoin does (at least in terms of functionality, not fundamental properties[decentralised, self verifying]) with other systems already in place.

Yep, the allusions to gold are simple anolgies, but the actual use case for bitcoin was always essentially an electronic payment/cash system. The idea of having "digital gold" is stupid. It's not what Satoshi had written about either in the whitepaper or bitcointalk. Digital gold will never succeed because it is always replaceable. There is no reason that XYZ digital gold is better than ABC digital gold. Bitcoin's value comes from it's utility, not it's rarity.
I can make a coin even rarer than bitcoin - that doesn't make it valuable.

I think it's much better this unbiased way as regardless of your position, it prevents ignorant/uninformed people from making a decision without sufficient information.
At the very least, with this naming convention, someone unsure about the whole debate will simply not transact coins because they'll be unsure. 
That is good in the sense that they won't lose money through a mistaken decision.

In what way can a node be made to compromise user privacy any more than a standard run of the mill node?
In terms of resource wastage, I'm assuming this is something along the line of requesting block data or header data excessively/unnecessarily with malicious intent to tie up the limited resources of peers. Wouldn't this be something better solved with a more robust peer-to-peer protocol?
I find the idea of blacklists a little bit unsettling, even if it is by user choice.

If miners rely on fees for income - as the topic of this thread is talking about - reduced use = reduced income = reduced miner investment and reduced miner activity (as they need to pay for electricity and investment in new asics) = reduced bitcoin security.
That concerns me a bit.
I also don't like the idea which is essentially: "Fees too high? Just wait till people realise bitcoin isn't good to use and stop using it, then you can use it again".
I'm like, what?
It's kind of like congestion charges on roads - "don't like paying congestion fee? Don't use the road! Just wait till enough people stop using the roads"

This is a really arrogant thing to say.
I've been in bitcoin for over 5 years, I've seen a lot of shit. I've been pissed off at certain core developers for a long time, and held views that this community would have for a long time. HOWEVER, recently I came to the conclusion that 2X is not a sensible implementation of a blocksize increase. I still think a blocksize increase should occur, but what I just recently learnt literally in the last 2 weeks is just how fucking complicated and technical bitcoin is. I thought I was knowledgeable, but the depth of and history of bitcoin is more than 1 person could ever understand. Saying something like "anyone who's interested already picked a side" is stupid fucking politics. It's arrogance, and it's shit.

If you are going to argue that, then it can be equivalently said that "Bitcoin rejecting non-2X blocks is also how it was designed". The door swings both ways. There was no block size limit in the original design, so there is no strong argument one way or the other.


This doesn't make sense, bitcoin's design is not related to the public making decisions.


is also an unsubstantiated claim, and one that is harmful to the community and this kind of language is what is causing so much division. There isn't some grand conspiracy. It's simply two sides who have points of disagreement. This isn't sinister, it's differing points of view.

The "last year or so" was a vague statement, but it meant the last year or two years, which fits with the chart (I was actually basing my statement off this very chart funnily enough).


Some are, some aren't. It's a ridiculous statement to say that all current developers are latecomers, that's totally untrue. Some are, but that's okay as well. New blood is good.
All my original statement was that a number of people from the very early days have been pushed out because their vision/ideas/position/viewpoint/whatever did not fit with the majority.
I guess one thing to take away from this is that the "threat to quit" has a precedent.
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:52:32


Greg, this


is also outright untrue.
Bitcoin "was designed" (your words) without a block size limit. I prefaced my statement by saying "if you are going to argue that, then it can be equivalently said that..."
This is not arguable, this is historic fact and anyone who cares can look back 8 years and see.


Are you referring to the limit induced by the satoshi client? That would make this statement false. This is not a "blocksize limit" by anything but the most reaching definition.


Again, inflammatory language use.
You haven't specified what the "backroom deal" is that is of so much contention and that is deserving of dividing the community so viciously with this language? What is the "*deal*"? As far as anyone can tell, the "*deal*" was - *'First we do segwit, then we do 2X'*. This isn't a "*backroom deal*" unless you're trying to frame the discussion in a particular way. The agreement is public knowledge, using language like "backroom deal" implies that there is some sinister conspiracy where an ulterior agreement has been made which is not public knowledge. If you know something that the public doesn't, speak up. Otherwise, call it what it is, an agreement between certain parties. Your pattern of repeatedly using specific language to frame discussions has not gone unnoticed.
Now you might argue that there is no grand conspiracy, or evil motives, you might say that this is simply about unethical behavior, however, Bitcoin was created to comprise parties of differing interests. Calling one parties actions a "backroom deal" whenever actions/decisions/announcements are made reflects on all involved and differing parties. It would be similar to stating that developer/subscriber consensus when .org announcements are made is a  "backroom deal". I may talk to a friend of mine, and we may reach an agreement. Is that a "backroom deal"? Perhaps I only use IRC, by excluding all parties who do not use IRC, am I making "backroom deals"?
Like I said, the language is divisive, unhelpful, and used with a clear agenda. It's a horrible slinging match, and the users and community suffer for it.

@_date: 2017-10-27 04:00:37


That's not necessarily true.
Take the simplified example where blocks are never full. Let's say the minimum realistic fee is 1 satoshi/byte (because it will never be zero):
* If all miners choose a value of ~0 satoshis/byte (minimum) for acceptance, yes, they will not miss out on any fee payments, however, they have given no reason for any users to pay anything other than the minimum fee required (i.e. 1 satoshi/byte). So miners can only expect a return precisely determined by the minimum fee and network activity. All users will be included in every block.
* However, imagine if some miners (say 50%) choose a minimum fee of ~0 satoshis/byte, and some miners (say 50%) choose a minimum of 5 satoshis/byte. Those miners may miss out on the minimum fees, but they've created a market where users can choose to be guaranteed to be included in the next block (no matter who mines it) and they ensure that the increased minimum can compensate for the risk associated with user demand for quick block inclusion. Poorer users who use a minimum fee of 1 satoshi/byte, don't get their tx confirm in every block, but they are guaranteed to get their transaction confirmed after a short period of probable time.
This creates more competition between miners and allows users choice.
In an imagined scenario with perpetually full blocks, the problem is that poorer users cannot expect to **ever** be included in the blockchain without competing with wealthy people who can afford high fees in a user competitive market.
The only alternative is to attempt to balance the tx capacity in balance with the user demand, which I think everyone would agree isn't sensible or realistic.
I hope I'm explaining well, because the economics worry me there.

I say this as an independent party, not caring, not taking sides, just observing:
It's not watching these guys speak. 99% of the time when these guys speak, they're actually really great, these instances are at technical conferences that are recorded and you get to see and learn some really interesting things. People don't dislike these guys (and others) for their appearances and talks at technical conferences (what you're referring to). 
I think most of the dislike towards the large bitcoin personalities is from message boards (like reddit, twitter, etc.) where these guys post. The posts are either abrupt, lack explanation, give a sense of arrogant finality, or they are inflammatory (possibly due to the limitations of the medium).
It reminds me a little of Richard Dawkins, who posts some extremely dumb shit on twitter, but in most every other aspect of his professional life (papers, books, talks, etc.) he's brilliant.  
Specifically regarding the core guys though; whilst they may come across benign and knowledgeable in talks with real people in the audience, they often come across abrupt, abrasive, and frankly like arseholes on media like reddit and twitter (**importantly though, this generally isn't true, or is true to a lesser degree on the bitcoin dev mailing list**). 
I wonder if the lack of face-to-face human interaction with message board posting allows for peoples true personalities to come out, I don't know. I've had discussions with Greg and Adam up to relatively recently, and Luke many years ago (all on bitcointalk), and honestly those three guys have personalities that are difficult to converse with, very knowledgeable on bitcoin, but very difficult people to talk to. Unfriendly, standoffish, arrogant, impatient, elitist, etc. all come to mind when I think back on our discussions. Not outright abusive or bad, it was still a civil discussion, but the difficult personality type is very very obvious when you try to have a back and forth. 
In the end, if you say you "can't understand" why some people dislike these personalities, you're not looking very hard. **Now I'm not saying that the crazy conspiracy theories are true or anything, I'm simply saying you're blind if you think these people are making it up out of the blue.** The reasons for why certain people are the target of community anger are clear.
I've thought for a long while that the bitcoin core team would highly benefit from a community manager of somekind, or publicist. Someone who is very technically knowledgeable, but has the personality to be the "face" of the team. I also think a lot of people should simply delete their twitter accounts, they'd be better off.
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:08:01
I mean 'the software' in a plural sense. There are many releases of bitcoin software as clients.
Right now there's at least 10 active releases running compatible nodes with the bitcoin system but from varying sources and with varying code base. 
When I say 'the software' i mean that the software that is run by a sufficient number of people. Unfortunately this is where things get muddy as the way bitcoin is designed it does not have a simple answer. But I like to use the word 'sufficient' as I think it best encapsulates what will happen in reality.
"So long as there is a sufficient number of nodes running XXX software."
I make this qualification, because if there is a short length chain, with no miners, with no users, but millions of nodes, this would be a non-functional iteration and would generally be considered a failure.
e.g. if right now there were a million nodes running 2x, but there were no users, and no mining occuring on the chain, so for example blocks took days + to confirm, this would be a non functional chain.
I guess the crux of this is that node count is not the singular determining factor, however, it is a very important factor, hence my use of the word 'sufficient' initially.

I don't think that's true. Don't miners choose what the minimum fee price they will accept is?
Trying to establish a fee market where the fee price is set by users due to an artificial constraint seems wrong.
A fee market should emerge from competition between miners.
The ideal setup would be blocks that are never full, with miner competition setting minimum fee price. If one miner has a larger investment decides minimum fee will be 160 satoshis/byte to be included in blocks they mine. This allows for smaller more altruistic miners to co-exist and collect all fees under that amount once they find a block.
That would ensure that all transactions are processed, and doesn't incentivize excessive fee inflation which we have seen in the past when blocks become full.
To be honest I don't see any reason why anyone, miners or users would want full blocks.

My insistence on using it is based on nothing but a pedantry for correct word usage.
I don't care which "bitcoin" succeeds, so long as bitcoin succeeds.


No shit.
But there is a number, let's call it n-nodes, which is the sufficient number of nodes for decentralisation. You don't need 100x n-nodes running for decentralisation. You only need n-nodes. This n-nodes number takes into account safety, security, redundancy, margin for error, downtime, failure rate, expected lifespan, etc. 
Now to clarify there is also a *minimum* number of nodes required for decentralisation, 
But that isn't what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the **sufficient** number. **You only need the sufficient number of nodes.**
**Most importantly, you do not need the maximum possible nodes**. Every user running a node is completely unnecessary for decentralisation. If you know bitcoin you know this is true.
If you understand bitcoin, tell me this, based on the fact that there is a sufficient number of nodes required for decentralisation, at what point is enough nodes, enough? What is the n-nodes number?
Why is losing the small number of zombie nodes, or raspberry pie nodes a problem? Does it reduce node count below the sufficient number? Below n-nodes? Do you even know?


The hate towards lightning network isn't towards the idea in itself of second layer solutions, but the apparent way in which it must be implemented. I'm sure you know, anyone can open a lightning node channel. However, to do this you need to transact from the bitcoin blockchain to your node. If your node has limited connections, then you will need to transfer to a large hub node or node bank, to run a hub node or large node, you need a lot of BTC to cover the inter transfers between users through your node. This will centralise the operation of the lightning network to a significant degree.
There is also the concern that the lightning network will incentivise people to retain their bitcoin on the lightning network and not in their own bitcoin wallets. As each time you move in and out of lightning you must perform a bitcoin transaction, and if blocksize is never increased, the fee price must rise **significantly**.
I am OK with lightning network provided that on chain fees remain low (under 25c for most transactions) for the foreseable future. Without a blocksize increase this won't happen.
It's not about infinite scaling on chain, it's about ensuring that on-chain transactions are not made financially nonviable except for the ultra rich, and all the poors are forced onto lightning without the ability to withdraw. 


friends, then we truly don't have anything else to discuss
I think *some* core contributors, mostly the names that are dropped around here, are suspicious and a serious problem. I think Fake satoshi, Ver, and Garzik have also become problems.
I think most of the core contributors are good coders who know what they're doing.

Why do companies have managers, directors, executives, boards, &amp; officers?
Because you need them to be successful.

Yes that's correct, but many posters do not understand that
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:04:37
Exactly. So the idea that the futures price is representative of the price if 2X is carried out is misleading at best.
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:56:23
Yeah let's get a non-biased source up in here (or as close as possible): 
Best you can say is that 70% of nodes are core nodes, with the majority of them being un-upgraded legacy nodes that it's questionable whether people are actively managing them or not. In addition, the accuracy of even that website has been called into question as node count update appears sporadic and selective.

Depending on when you want the "notice period" to start, there was a range of a minimum of 3 months up to 6 months notice.

It's the only way to look at it doing a sensible analysis.
s2x likelihood to launch is not necessarily correlated to s2x's chance of success if it launches.
for example, random product XYZ might have a 100% success rate if it launches, but random product XYZ might be really hard to get a loan for to start the business, so the likelihood of launching is only 10%.

@_date: 2017-10-25 01:30:13
I haven't squirmed away from anything.
Users don't have a metric to measure their wants.
Node count is not a metric because most users do not run nodes, they use exchanges and SPV wallets.
SPV wallet connections to XYZ node implementations and code base is not a metric because users don't care.
Exchange policy is not a metric because users don't care.
The problem is that user don't want anything other than what works. They do not care by and large.
**Users not caring does not give a default win to miners and businesses though.**
* Yes, miners have influence
* Yes, businesses have influence
* Developers also have influence
* Controllers of information also have influence (i.e. media, forums, discussion hosters, etc)
* Loud miinority user base also have influence
My point is simply that the MAJORITY of users don't care. They are silent and don't care. They just want their bitcoin to work, be valuable, and do it's thing. They don't care **how** it works, just that it works.
Do you understand this?

Ok, so they're attacking a currency they own, for their own greedy intentions, which are what? To make it increase in value? 
If their motivation is greed, wouldn't they want to increase the price of it?

That's not really relevant because those 10,000,000 users will never run full nodes. It's just not a realistic proposition.
The most generous data today gives a number of 1% of users who run their own nodes today.
Expecting the other 9,900,000 users to start running nodes just isn't feasible.

@_date: 2017-10-26 00:30:48


It doesn't take days. I've done it myself recently. It took about 24 hours. And that was not due to bandwidth. It's either finding peers, or verification. But if it's verification, it's not a RAM or a CPU issue, because those sat at 25% and 50%. So either it's coded badly, or it's a problem with peer connections. At least as far as I can tell.
Regardless, this will never improve. It can never improve. 
Also regardless, nodes are supposed to be run fulltime. If you have a problem with waiting days to download the chain from scratch, then you're not someone who's going to be running a full node for network support.


It wouldn't. The maths been done before. A 2TB drive for $80 would probably last the next 5-10 years at increased blocksize.


Correct. Bandwidth is the bottleneck.
But this is exactly why you don't want to keep encouraging these shitty connections in areas where bandwidth is so poor. Bitcoin relies on peer connections. If your peers are bad, you get a bad experience.


That's fine. I agree it's rushed. But the 2MB increase has been literally discussed for at least 5 years.
**5 YEARS!**
Developers should have tested and figured everything there is to figure out and completed the 2MB upgrade by now.

... you're still not getting it.
**The forks do not give you information about what users want**
Let me spell it out for you:
A fork gives you information about the wants of:
* miners
* businesses
* developers
* people in positions of power in the bitcoin ecosystem
* loud users
* regular users
in a combined, impossible to de-tangle single answer.
You can never know how much each party influenced the decision. You can only know that each party had a role to play in that decision. You can extrapolate some minor information, but not much, and most importantly **you can't extrapolate out what the entire userbase wants**
Here's two examples:
* If 1X succeeds even though miners were 95% in favour of it, you can extrapolate that miners opinion and wants doesn't mean diddly squat in the bitcoin world.
* If 1X succeeds because there's a loud minority of users on some forums, that doesn't say anything about the silent majority of users who just use wallet exchanges and buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:37:38


This isn't necessarily true.
SPVs can connect to a trusted to node or they can use the most work as a point of trust.

Not according to who, according to the code base that hasn't been changed
If the base code changes, that's fine. But it hasn't in 8 years. Other changes have been made, but not to this function of bitcoin.
Oh, and there's no such planned change to bitcoin that you're speaking of, so yeah, again, moot point.

I am right, but it has no bearing on whether 2X or 1X "wins out" in the end.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:26:56
So users ran clients that would fork (do you mean orphan?) blocks off the network if they didn't signal for segwit?
This gave the illusion of consensus with signalling, and then afterwards the miners and users would still need to actually use clients with segwit enabled. Which did occur.
I'm not sure how comfortable I am with that. It doesn't feel very "clean".

pruning nodes aren't trustless either though, I think if you're accepting of pruning nodes, we should be accepting of SPV nodes.

@_date: 2017-10-25 01:56:36
Yep. Perfect example. I agree with that analogy and your listed possible downsides.
**But it is still an upgrade**
You're conflating the work "upgrade" and "improvement".


Yes, but it doesn't need to be an improvement to every aspect of that particular "thing",
e.g. I "upgraded" my computer. But now it uses more electricity, it cost me more money, it requires a new higher resolution monitor to fully utilise, and it is louder than before.
It's still an upgraded computer.


If I thought they were honest actors, I would have, However, I think the conflict of interest with the intent to implement side chains and second layer solutions has been the driving consideration as to whether or not to implement a block size increase.
A small block size increase like 2X has no serious implications. We've known this for years.
The problems that the core devs say they have, and the reasons they list to refuse a block size increase are:
* Decentralisation impact - truth is it's irrelevant and inconsequential, raspberry pie nodes don't matter.
* Hard fork requirement - actually understandable reasoning but they have made it deliberately hard and difficult to **ever** have a hard fork, so again, my confidence in them is serious lacking. Based on the rhetoric used by many in the community, no hard fork will ever occur for bitcoin. Ever. Did you know that more than 75% of nodes running, are running legacy software? i.e. not up to date software. Many of these nodes are years out of date, obvious zombie nodes. If consensus for upgrades is defined by node count, you will **never** have an upgrade because these zombie nodes will continue to run legacy software and your % of consensus will never reach high enough levels. This is a straight unavoidable fact.
* It's not needed because second layer solutions will solve the problems anyway like the magical lightning - hardly need to say much this one.
I don't consider those reasons good enough. In fact, I consider them suspicious and I seriously consider the true motivations of the development team to be slightly different than what is said. I don't think it's some grand conspiracy or anything stupid. I just honestly believe that their intentions are not what is in the best interest of bitcoin long term, and their intentions are not in the best interest of the vast majority of bitcoin users and holders.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:43:25


@_date: 2017-10-16 02:56:40
The problem then is the size of those businesses. If 10x the number of businesses are for/against 2x, but they only hold 1% of the market, it's not really that big of an impact.
Everything needs to be weighted appropriately.
It's very hard.


Yes, there is truth to that.
But there is also a corollary. There are a huge number of depreciated nodes being run that people are "counting" on "their side". When these nodes are running old code that hasn't been touched or updated in years. It is difficult to know whether those node operators have any position at all on the current discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:34:41
Uhuh. So your argument is, the guy who has control over 2X, is going ahead with 2X anyway, even though it's costing him millions of dollars to do so. Because... why?
Perhaps he just genuinely believes it's the right thing to do. The space of crypto is so weird. People think others can't have different ideas to them without them being fucking evil incarnate with the most sinister ulterior motives. It's bullshit. Sometimes people think differently to you.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:03:29
Yep, I get all that, and here's my problem with it. It's not representative of consensus because it ignores the vast majority of people in the bitcoin ecosystem.
In January 2017 there were an estimated 10,000,000 bitcoin holders/users. Today, it is estimated that there are between 10,000 - 100,000 nodes running (estimate vary wildly because of count methodology, but it's irrelevant for this point).
Add the node users - 100,000 (generous estimate) + miners + developers.
You are no where near representing the 10,000,000 users.
Calling that consensus is extremely worrying to me.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:54:37


























This is correct, but a slight clarification.
You could have the bitcoin network run perfectly well with miners being the only ones running full nodes (actually, you could go one step further and have only mining pools/some central control running full nodes), and all users running light clients /spv nodes, and bitcoin would still work.
The problem with this is that it's essentially then a centralised system with a huge amount of power in the hands of the central node operators. They could then fuck things up for everyone and you wouldn't be able to do a thing about it.
The network requires a sufficient amount of decentralised and independent nodes running to ensure the honesty and integrity of the blockchain. The more independent nodes, the harder it is for any malicious party to cause damage/cheat the system.
How many nodes are sufficient is dependent on many things, but I've never been able to get a straight answer out of any dev I've asked the question to. There is a number where it's "enough" though.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:39:10

That is true, however, remember that github has maintainers, and a lead maintainer responsible for "moderation", release cycle, overall merging and appointing others.
Also keep in mind that development and developers are not and should not be a single place of decision making. In a corporation you do not allow a development team free reign to make decisions as the above link shows. In the bitcoin ecosystem, we similarly cannot allow the same to occur.

If 1% of miners lowers their fee requirement by 1 satoshi, you have a situation where the odds of your transaction being confirmed in the next block are:
* 100% - 5 satoshi minimum fee spend
* 50% - 4 satoshi minimum fee spend
* 49% - 1 satoshi minimum fee spend
Nobody is going to pay 4 satoshi, because the incentive over 1 satoshi is a 1% greater chance to be included in the next block. That's just dumb.
The miner is also dumb, as they just cut their revenue up to 50%.
You need to do the math before posting.

Majority of users are not deciding anything.
Majority of users are making uninformed and ignorant decisions (not necessarily right or wrong, just a fact).
Majority of users are using exchanges and SPV wallets. They are not deciding their own code to run, they are not using their own client.
It's a minority of users who use their own client, majority of users are in the dark/doesn't matter/they don't care.
It's false to say that users decide anything en masse in bitcoin, because they really don't.
It'd be like saying the users of banks decide what bank regulations get lobbied. Yeah, I guess if millions of bank customers dislike the lobbying the banks doing they can change banks, but in reality people don't do this.

Thus, bitcoin decentralisation has been destroyed, and bitcoin is a failure.
Great view you've got there...
No. Bitcoin software is any bitcoin client software compatible with the network. As you'd know if you did 5 mins of research, there are about 10 active different clients with measureable node count. All from difference sources.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:57:36
That's just not a realistic proposition. You will never, no matter what, get enough users to run full nodes. It just won't happen.
That seems like a complete waste of time and a total waste of resources if people are spending time on it.
How can anyone think that they're going to get the other 99% of users running full nodes?
Maybe, maybe this would be possible in a hypothetical world where mobile phones had 100TB capacity and mobile data was free and ubiqutous, and mobile phones had the processing power to verify... that's about the only way this would ever happen, and it's a near impossibility.

@_date: 2017-10-16 05:23:11
1. contentious - yes, in certain communities. Disadvantages? Again, a claim without backing.
2. There was urgency months ago when the network ground to a halt. No solutions were proposed at the time. No solutions were implemented despite it being discussed for YEARS. It's obvious that a pro-active approach is required to avoid such situations in the future. It is reckless to continually hope for some future miracle.
3. If a successful upgrade occurs, this is irrelevant. A successful hard fork upgrade should not have replay protection, as with replay protection it is no longer an upgrade, but a creation of a new chain.
4. Yes. Bitcoin core developers have made their intentions to throw a hissy fit and quit well known. Frankly. I don't want people like that involved in the project. Have a[ read of this article for some good reasoning on such matters.
5. Debunked. The increased node requirements are inconsequential at this stage, and have been negated by years and years of unnecessary postponement. 
6. Bitcoin cash is not a big block alternative IMO. IMO Bitcoin cash is essentially a hedge/insurance in the event of a catastrophic fault with segwit. It is also a chain that is closest to the original in terms of design. Regardless, it's irrelevant to this discussion.

All users running full nodes is fucking stupid, and everyone has known this since the beginning. Satoshi even explicitly said that it was not required for all users to run full nodes. Just for there to be a sufficient number of full nodes. SPV nodes are fine for the vast majority of people.

I honestly don't know. I hope the ecosystem will have moved towards a more stable structure in the future.
I think at the moment there's a serious problem with big name players having significant power and influence and rather difficult personalities. There's also the issue with centralised control of communities.
I also think that the current ecosystem would be a lot better and the community wouldn't have fractured had certain people just not been involved with bitcoin. I think if certain people had never got involved, but the tech/development was equivalent, we wouldn't have had such division and we wouldn't have even had the bitcoin cash split.

Agreed. The problem is I don't see any good alternatives either. The whole situation worries me a great deal.

I think honestly in this space there is no easy straightforward answer, it's going to be a tough road ahead.


Absolutely, but we run into the problem of how to you co-ordinate this dialog without a centre party controlling the path of the discussion. Both rbtc and rbitcoin are guilty of pushing discussions certain ways. bitcointalk is the same, github is the same.

I think a very large part of it that shouldn't be glossed over is that a select few developers, early adopters (i.e. large holders), figureheads, and popular personalities have **very big egos** which are clashing. Discussions regarding scaling were had for years, but these select few were so stubborn and pig headed that it turned into the current mess that it is.Watching is all unfold has been incredibly disapointing. So many people, good people, have left because of the fighting and terrible tactics, the bullshit on twitter and other terrible communication platforms. The communities have changed and are not like they once were. It's just all in all a huge disappointment to me.
Things are still chugging along well behind the scenes, so it's not all bad. But there's about 10 people who I can think of off the top of my head who I wish were literally never, ever heard from again. I would wish they never made a twitter post, forum post, announcement, or anything ever again.

No. It doesn't. Some do. Some don't. Example: A gold ETF. Many gold ETFs literally buy and hold the gold bullion (others hold futures contracts). This is not a "diversified index fund" as you claim. It's literal gold bullion.
Again, you're wrong.


Again, just look at the gold ETF example. Other commodities examples, you might start to understand why you're so wrong.
Hell, it's literally in the name. It's not an ETIF, it's an ETF. Exchange traded fund. A fund does not necessarily need to be diversified and does not need to represent an index. A fund can just be a fund that holds a single asset if it pleases.
Let's take another example, LICs, you might invest in an LIC - but that LIC only holds a single stock as it's underlying asset, say, coca cola. I suppose you're scream and rant and rave about how stupid it is to buy the LIC instead of just buying KO. So you buy KO direct and give the finger to the LIC. The next day the LIC dumps KO and reinvests elsewhere because they saw it was overbought, they make a tonne of cash, and you're down because again, you're a dumbass.
and **again** I'll quote you in full so anyone else can read this and judge. I don't want you editing or deleting your comments when you realise how wrong you are.

You think an index fund is necessarily the same as an ETF. You're 100% wrong. I'm going to quote you so you can't backtrack when you realise you're wrong.

@_date: 2018-04-06 05:07:22


ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund.
The fund can simply hold bitcoin. It's still a fund without any diversification.
Putting the fund on an exchange makes it an ETF.
Make sense?
It's a way for institutions, retirement funds, regular people with stock brokers, etc. to buy and get exposure.

Yes, but user sentiment is **influenced** by all of the above listed entities.
If that wasn't true. Advertising wouldn't exist.
Furthermore, users will make ignorant choices if it's in their immediate financial interest.
I.e. users will use an exchange with "XYZ" policy, and users will be ignorant of that policy, and not care, so long as it doesn't immediately impact them, and so long as that exchange is cheap.
Users are not the ones in sole control. To think so is incredibly naive.
The majority of users are on exchanges too, so this is a perfect example.

@_date: 2013-04-10 03:16:14
I was trying to express that the value of bitcoin is misleading.
$1000 would seem like a lot of money for a security. BUT, when put in perspective, it really isn't.
For example, an average security might trade at $50 a share, and have 1 billion shares.
If scaled proportionately to bitcoin, and the number of shares were reduced to 21 million, that share would be worth $2380.
I wasn't directly comparing them to shares, simply trying to get people to think about the actual valuation.
The number $100, $200 have a psychological impact on people. Whereas if the number of coins were 210,000,000, the number $20 wouldn't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:29:36

Hello, so am I. And yes there is.
If it's sitting completely still, there is nothing wrong with the mounting per se, I'm not saying it's going to break simply sitting there over time, but if it gets bumped it's much more susceptible to damage. The hdmi/vga ports, etc, can/will get stressed in this position and may get damaged.
Although from looking at it again, I'm not really worried about the motherboard anymore. I thought it was screwed into place and only held at the top, now I see it's held in place with zip ties. This is fine, there's no stress there, but the riser cards from the mobo to the gpus will be pulled when the rig is moved, and it's another source of a possible short.

I think people are overestimating things, but I certainly think bitcoin has a LOT of room to grow, mainly for 2 reasons:
1. Lack of borders or boundaries to transactions.
2. Speed of transactions.
Bitcoin does something that western union takes hours or more to do. Bitcoin is also one of the worlds first truly global currencies. While it's not accepted widely, it is accepted in many countries in isolated places. Which is very new and interesting.
The more adoption grows as a payment method the more interesting things are going to get.
Do I think people with 100BTC will be billionaires? Not a chance. But I could conceivably see 1BTC rising to $2000 or more (based upon similar company market caps that provide a similar service to bitcoin).

I'm not saying there aren't similarities, just that it's unfair to compare the two.

Uh, the cali car market dictates GLOBAL STANDARDS because it's so damn large. Normally, I'd agree with you, but when you're talking cars and the state of california it's a completely different story.
Global emissions and safety standards are essentially based on the cali standards (to a fault) because cali is such an enormous market.

It's seemed to stabilise around the $1200 mark. We've had $10 million sell offs and the price hasn't budged that much.
I'm seeing continuous day to day growth. I still stand by my $2000 mark.
Honestly, I hope for a crash, but I can't see it happening unless there is either some big news, or a big hack/exploit/etc.
Long term, value will continue up much higher than $2000.
Hell, investment banks and industry are still a bit wary and still aren't involved yet in any large number. That will probably cause the next spike.

From what I understand, consumers will have 2 chips on board, each rated to around 4 GH/s, though it will be throttled to around 5GH/s, Each unit should produced a minimum of 5GH/s, but it looks like it will be easily upgradable.

Let's get serious for a second. This is good advice, but needs a few notes.
1. Agree, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If it goes to 1USD/BTC then you should be okay with that.
2. Bitcoin is NOT A STOCK. Comparisons between the two are difficult. Claims of a bubble are difficult.
I am not calling it a bubble today, in fact I'm betting on it hitting $1000 this year.

Essentially it means that regular investors can invest in bitcoin, via traditional methods such as the NYSE, or NASDAQ.
THIS IS YET TO BE APPROVED
But that's what it would mean. Essentially, it's a bitcoin trust,ETF, or exchange traded fund. It's going to be tied to the value of bitcoin, and, for example, Joe Bloggs who has no idea about bitcoin wallets and such, can go to his stock broker, and say "buy me $10k worth of bitcoin etf". "Done". It's that simple now.

If this is true, your workplace is a very bad workplace. I would leave.
Unless there's more to the story, such as the way you expressed your suggestion, or your general appearance or actions.

Looking at something smaller, western union, western union is currently valued at 8 billion dollars. Bitcoin would replace western union in the long run.

They're not bad, they pay quickly and although their website is a little complex, it's easy and quick enough.
I tend to prefer these guys though: 
as their websites simpler and the spot prices are much easier to instantly find. Spot price is better as well (even though the fee is a little higher).

You don't know how ebay and paypal works.
Let me break it down for you:
* You're a seller, you sell an item.
* Buyer pays with paypal.
* Buyer recieves item.
* 2 weeks later buyer lodges dispute with paypal.
* Paypal steal the funds out of your account, or debit your own bank account to recover the funds while their "resolution process" goes on.
* If you don't have a tracking number registered with the post office for your item you sent, or you're selling a non-tangible item, you lose.
* Buyer keeps money and gets free item.
* Buyer repeats.
* Paypal continues to suck dick.

True, true.

Has anyone who actually has a background in finance done a rudimentary analysis of asicminer shares? Frankly, they seem obscenely overvalued, there is no way in hell that asicminer has a large enough asset base, and a large enough turnover/profit to justify the $172 million valuation. But, hey, I'm no finance expert.
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:46:43
No you missunderstand. I'm saying that, for example:
* I pay Jim $100 through paypal for mowing my lawn.
* I decide to fuck over Jim, and lodge a dispute with paypal.
* Paypal steal back the $100 out of Jims bank account while the dispute process goes on.
* Jim, having no real proof that he mowed my lawn, loses.
* I get my $100 back.
This isn't about their fees, though in saying that, their fees are very very high.

Well, 75BTC is ~$10,000USD. I would expect difficulty to get to around 89742960 conservatively by the time it ships, that's about ฿10.22 bitcoins per month, with diminishing returns after that. It's possible it will pay for itself, but I'd expect at least 12 months before that happens.

This should be the top post. It's more likely that breaking a high will send a rush of new speculators into the market who had previously not been aware of bitcoin. If anything, 30 will be another news story.

So long the arbitrage after service fees is &gt; 0, yes.
At the moment, the difference is about 20%, fees wouldn't be 20% so yes, it should work.
In fact, it has to work, this is the only way to get a common price across the exchanges.

What we really need to think about is the valuation of bitcoin as a whole, not just individual coins.
Individual coin value is meaningless without considering the value of all bitcoins.
The market is currently valued at $2 billion. Is this undervalued?

Making an episode plot around bitcoin is never ever going to happen.
Making a reference to it, absolutely. If you want to get this to happen and you're being realistic, find out which of the writers adds in the tech stuff to the jokes, get in contact with them or someone that knows them, and get them to add it in.
You're never going to get a storyline around bitcoin into the show. Sorry.

Why is it a lot of money, because $1000 sounds like a lot? That's irrelevant. what matters is the valuation of bitcoin as a system.
Currently it's valued around $1.5 billion dollars, based on the current price, if we got to $1000 a bitcoin, the system would be around $12 billion dollars. Still not a whole lot.
