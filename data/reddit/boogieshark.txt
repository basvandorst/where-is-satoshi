I don't know what they're going to call this generation, but they're going to kick the world's ass into shape. Really impressed with the young people I meet through my daughters and nieces/nephews

Goddamn Time magazine is a joke of a piece of shit of a formerly meaningful publication. I almost hate it when retards like the editors of Time run actual journalism like this. It clashes so thoroughly with their narrative of ignorance, stupidity and insanity.
