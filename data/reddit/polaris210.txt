I was in the market for a new graphics card and all the listings on eBay for ATI cards had things like: "Bitcoin ready!" or "Great miner". So I did a little digging and discovered they were talking about bitcoin.
I thought it was all really interesting, but since I was still in high school and broke I didn't mine or buy any. Mind you, this is when they were a couple cents a piece.
I ended up buying $20 worth last last September, then selling them for like $1000 profit a couple months ago. Really wish I had bought more earlier... So much regret...

Do you use a CPU or GPU? I was thinking about mining with my laptop (rig is too big/heavy/hot for school).

Ah ok, I'm using two 5970's right now for BTC. Should I take out the battery even if the laptop is constantly plugged in, or just remove it completely?

I'll look into removing the battery as soon as possible then. It's a pretty old laptop too ( MacBook pro from 2008) so I'd like to keep the battery in as good as condition as possible.
Now concerning LTC, do you think it will be more profitable to mine LTC or BTC using gpus?

Ok I'll try it out soon, thanks! Even if it is only a few LTCs a day.

For the last point, couldn't that also apply to BTC? Don't they already have specialized hardware that only mines BTCs?

I believe it's a 9800 gt, but I could be wrong.

64 days lol. I think he should give out more hints. If the passwords are only lowercase letters and no punctuation it would be a lot easier.

Oh man you don't even know. I found out about bitcoin when it was 10 cents for 1 BTC. I never bought, thought it was too risky. 
Only recently did I buy in at like $12/BTC, and even then I thought it was a lot of money. So much regret.......

I had planned to do something like this, but the addition of spaces between words makes it very difficult.
Maybe hashcat the actual address to get a plain text string?

He actually gave a couple more hints [here]( If I can get to my windows machine, rather than a laptop, I might be able to crack them by brute force.
