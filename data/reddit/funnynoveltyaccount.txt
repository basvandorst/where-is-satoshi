Thanks! I sent you one more PM with a question about this. Once it's totally done I'll update the post and make clear that everything was resolved. Thank you for your help.

Since you're so helpful, one more. If I want to withdraw exactly 1.0 and I pay the 0.0005 transaction fee, should I set the total as 1.0005 or 1.0?

I've only encountered buyers trying to game the system, and I'm in a major US city. The game that people play is to agree to a transaction and cancel unless the market price drops below the agreed price in the time between the agreement and the meeting. I got so frustrated with this that I took my ads off of Localbitcoin. If I go back to selling bitcoin in person I will make it a policy that the price is determined as a function of the price at the moment we physically meet.

You wrote "order que". Que means what in Spanish. You wanted to ask about the order queue.

It might have been a problem with zipzap.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:26:31
I PMed it to you.

Maybe the'll do it for a 20% restocking fee =D

Where is Spanish joke explainer?

If it's the same chips, then they're going to use those chips for the tens (hundreds?) of thousands of orders already placed before they get to you.
@_date: 2013-06-03 22:22:50
Congrats. Care to share an (approximate?) order number?
@_date: 2013-09-10 22:32:04
I did not reply to this. In fact, I filed the claim with Paypal and then emailed BFL, knowing that the lag time from Paypal and the lag time from BFL would be close. It saved me a few days.

When is Chicago going to have one? Bitcoin for pork belly futures.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:54:53
In Chicago it's 18-20, my Iowan roommate said there it's 10-15.

I know of another guy who sells drugs and has a PhD in chemistry. I think "bad" is a pretty good description of him.

I'll believe it when I can pay with Bitcoin and get a Starbucks reward star (free refills while in store). Sounds more like you got comped a drink and gave Bitcoin to an employee.
@_date: 2013-06-03 03:32:19
You could try if you want to do something online and get paid in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-18 00:08:54
This happened to me. Submitting a rocket and emailing support at bitinstant didn't seem to work but helped get me my money. About ten days total.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:36:05
Order what? 
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:33:33
I know this isn't but what is your source that a lot of bitcoin supports are against the idea of tax?
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:30:10
Whoa, really? I've bought over $300 worth of Amazon gift codes on Bitmit. I feel lucky I never got scammed. I applied them to my account and immediately spent them.
@_date: 2013-06-16 20:47:58
Maybe you should consider  or another existing crowdsourcing website specifically fur finding research.
Funding is complicated, and this has a lot of unanswered questions. I don't think I would put a donation link on my research group's website. It seems a bit tacky and could violate rules of how funding is received.
Also, are you sure your calculations are correct? When you get a grant, my university normally takes a large percentage (around 50%) as overhead. I also pay taxes on my stipend as an RA. Are you considering that with your funding?

PayPal told me they'd do a one time exception on the 45 days. I insisted they so a two time exception and refund me the 100 from the upgrade, and pushed the employee on why they couldn't so another exception. Eventually she said it was the law, which I don't believe. She refused to transfer me to someone higher up, so I gave up and contacted my credit card company. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:25:50
*So* confused why you had a lamp shining on them.

Downvoted because the post does not say that is the creator of this extension, and doesn't mention the 7% fee.
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:21:53
Bitinstant gave me my money after waited a week and then reddit PMed He said he would refund the service fee but that never actually happened.
@_date: 2013-07-15 22:23:33
Oh so nice. I registered a domain with them a couple of days ago and although I loved paying with bitcoin waiting an hour to pay was annoying.
@_date: 2013-09-02 19:38:15
Paypal returned me the $163 from the miner. I'm pursuing the $100 upgrade only with the credit card company.

Unless I'm doing my math wrong, I didn't get a fee refund. Can you PM or email me a breakdown of the fees?
@_date: 2013-09-12 20:47:03
Is it ironic? Wouldn't that mean that you would have to expect ordering with bitcoin would give you a recourse? I think being ten years old when Ironic was released and seeing it on MTV, my pliable child brain got imprinted with all kids of confusing.
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:46:13
I will give an update. I PMed with a link to this post. I really hope this gets resolved soon. I could have sold it at $70 (but who am I kidding, I wouldn't have).

One of the exciting parts of Russian Roulette is that each person chooses whether or not to spin the cylinder before pulling the trigger. This is just a betting game with buttons in a circle.

Whoops. Posted it from my phone.

All of this has happened before and will happen again. Dibs on being the second one to get paid to watch.

Thank you! Why is withdrawal under Funding Options? Doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:16:59
I suggest trading only at the price at the time you meet not at the price the time the sell post is answered. Otherwise people will schedule buys and no show if the Btc/usd doesn't increase In the time between the post reply and the meeting.

I replied to your reply to my post and I PMed you a month ago after my first PM to you got me a refund for the cost without fees. I don't know the exact date, reddit just says "1 month ago". After I never got a response about it I dropped the issue because it wasn't worth fighting over the $8, but I wasn't happy that the comment on my post said "and I sent a fee refund as well" when it seemed to me that I hadn't received a fee refund.
