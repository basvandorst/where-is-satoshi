I always think that the "deflationary nature" of Bitcoin is invalid thinking.  I think that deflation is an attribute of a fiat currency where economic activity decreases because of a rise in the currency vs other fiat currencies.  Bitcoin only rises in value when *more* economic activity in the BTC ecosystem happens, not less...

It's unclear to me that the miners aren't clamoring for a block size increase.  Most of the "sturm und drang" seems to be coming from the bitcoin devs mailing list and from some of the devs rather than the miners themselves.

| Our devs are acting like the Federal Reserve. 
No they're not.  The Federal Reserve doesn't care one whit for the opinions of the citizens of the US.  Gavin and others have written BIP's, and discussed this extensively with the community at large.  The change he's made is to Bitcoin XT, not the existing Bitcoin-core source code base.  If the consensus is there to move to Bitcoin XT then it will happen, otherwise, it won't.

Not really.  I find that Obama, while better than Bush, (admittedly a low bar) isn't really better than a C or a C+ grade as a President.  The problem is that the decisions and courses taken by the Bush administration have had and will continue to have ramifications far beyond the end of his presidency.   Two wars not paid for or planned properly.  Encouraging policies to promote home buying far beyond the means of most Americans,  The corruption at the Minerals Mining Service, the corruption at the Department of Defense in regards to "no-bid" contracts for Halliburton, Medicare Part D, Corruption at the SEC and other financial regulators, the squandering of the surplus left for us by the Clinton administration, the list is almost endless.  These policies will affect us for a generation.  This is why people continue to blame the Bush administration.

I was highly unimpressed by his talk.  He seems to assert things as facts without evidence.  The single biggest problem for me was his assertion that the 19th century was some sort of island of financial stability due to gold backing the currency.  Really? 
how about this:

I could go on, but you get the idea.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm a big fan of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, but this crap that gets pushed by these extreme libertarians/gold bugs about how wonderful things were in the 19th century is really annoying.

I'm not sure that i buy the premise that living through a depression period in a free market is necessarily better than it is under the central authority. 
The long depression of 1873 is, to my mind, a classic financial crisis of the 19th century.  It is on record (at least in the U.S.) as the longest period of financial contraction in U.S. history, eclipsing the Great Depression of the 1930's.  Many economists consider that this era of financial contraction (which was world wide) lasted for 20 years.  The reason that the Fed was created is that the 19th century saw constant and serious financial booms and busts and it was hoped that a stabilizing force might alleviate this cycle.

I know it's open source.  I'm talking about implementing BTC within something like Ethereum, perhaps something equivalent to SSH tunneling, where protocol X is encapsulated in SSH.

i would argue that the reasons for current instability in the world are far more directly related to the previous U.S. adminstration's disastrous economic and foreign policy.  We're now in a world that, due to the decline of U.S. influence has mid-size actors such as China and Russia moving to increase their political influence over their local spheres.  I have no visibility as to how things like moving off the gold standard, or creating the income tax has made Russia decide to interfere in Ukraine, or China assert territorial control over the Seikaku Islands (I don't remember the Chinese name for them).

It's not about getting killed, it's about the state demonstrating a "compelling public interest" in infringing on people's rights.  This is why Child Pornography is illegal, even though no one gets killed.   This is the argument also that the opponents of gay  marriage took when the California court case was heard, although they failed partly  because they couldn't demonstrate a compelling public interest in curbing the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender citizens.   In the case of AML/KYC, I suspect that the government could, indeed, show that they have an overriding interest here, specifically, in reducing the ability of organized crime to flourish as well as curbing tax evasion by citizens.

So, if I understand this correctly, the idea is that you pretend to loan money to someone who pretends to pay it back in order to boost their reputation so that they can then borrow real money with their new reputation score?  
And somehow, this isn't fraud?

Okay, but why not just have one transaction for "25" and one transaction for 0.17211475?

Er, yes, obviously, a natural number, as it doesn't make sense to have a negative value for a transaction...

I've lived in different countries in Europe for 15 years.  Infrastructure definitely isn't "crumbling" throughout the area.  Some countries, like Bulgaria, Romania and others have issues with infrastructure, but others, like Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, etc. have infrastructure that, to my mind, is better than the United States.  Better train systems, better metro, better roads, better internet infrastructure, etc.

I've been running it now for a few hours, but I've not noticed any increase in disk space from it.  Has anyone got any idea how quickly it prunes blocks from the blockchain?
Also, from the comments, it seems that running a full node with pruning kind of defeats the purpose of a full node if it disables block relays...

It's definitely not even close to the worst type of article on Bitcoin.  Most of it isn't unreasonable.  they should change the wording of that phrase to 'A new block is generated on the blockchain around every ten minutes'. 
Also, the other major glaring error is that they make it appear as if only blockchain.info can give you a bitcoin wallet...

I'd absolutely love to go to Tokyo to deliver this.  Perhaps also to other cities in Japan as well if there's an interest.  I'd probably need a sponsorship of some sort in order to cover travel expenses, though.

I just think that if an average, non-technical consumer asks if he can get the same level of protection, i.e. be able to call his bank to contest charges leveled on his CC, and be told "You have to take care of your money yourself", he/she is not really going to want to adopt BTC...

The goal here is not to scare the crap about of them with, as you describe, "Anarcho-libertarianism" philosophy.  My plan is more along the lines of how a lawyer in a courtroom would work, i.e. 
raise the objection ("BTC are used for drug dealing and money laundering!") and explain why that isn't really an issue ("&lt; 3 percent of transactions used for drug dealing".  All BTC's have a transaction log so large scale money laundering isn't viable").  
That's the way I'm planning to present it.
