I would have only had about $0.36 left in my account after the withdrawal, so they mostly robbed themselves or somebody else.

Look at this
 
It's a mining fee alright.
A bunch of 0.00001 reductions from the same address. I think their system glitched or they messed up when trying to make changes to the system that would ensure transactions have the proper fee amount with everything going on.
Edit: Actually I have no idea what is going on.

Why not use pgp and send messages for free?
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:37:45
Okay you guys don't like pgp. What about OTR? Surely I can't be alone in thinking it is easy to use. Plus you get forward secrecy, which I'm pretty sure you don't get with bitmessage.
Call me old fashioned, but I'm just not getting a boner for blockchain based messaging systems.

My Bitcoin always performs just fine. It goes wherever I send it for next to nothing, I can store it securely without third party involvement, and nobody can freeze my accounts.

Thanks for clearing a few things up. I'll be sure to check out the project again in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:47:31
Agreed. I'm not trying to conceal illegal activity, just some more privacy.
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:54:53
I know I shouldn't feed the troll, but I bought my first coins at $10. So I guess they performed financially as well, but that's not the main reason I'm into bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:37:38
Oh for sure there are plenty of downright annoying people on there as well as people who consider themselves financial gurus and hand out advice willy nilly. 
Yeah sorting through all the loans can take some time, even when using their filters as efficiently as possible. I wish they would add more filter options.

My roommates already have one of these or I would buy another one for them. Great product, good luck with Bitcoin integration.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:04:08
I've been on there for about the same time and had one dude miss payments but it was a pretty risky loan and I only threw a few dollars at it. I like the idea of taking a portion of my bitcoin that I'm holding and growing it through low risk investments.
It's also fun to be able to throw 0.0000001 BTC at things and track people's progress.
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:05:27
I used it several years ago when I first got into bitcoin before actually learning how to store coins properly. I forgot about my wallet there until I was flipping through a notebook in my safe this week with related notes.
I'd like to check up on it and see what is in there.
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:15:34
That's what I've been doing, but I run into the problem I describe above.
@_date: 2015-09-18 22:35:48
This isn't the best place for money laundering advice. Pay a vendor bond on a popular dark net market and gain entry to the vendor forums. This kind of discussion occurs there with people who actually launder money.
Edit: or at least it used to. If you got the coins through illegal online sales you probably already have this going for you.
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:43:23
I've done that as well.
