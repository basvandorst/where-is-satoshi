But I am assuming that the transaction will not send if my client is not fully updated, correct?

Just keep refreshing and click the advertisements a lot :)

I understand your concerns. However, I'm not asking you to believe me. I'm asking you to give us a chance to run one lottery/put up more stuff, then make your final decision once we payout.
So, give it a try? Can you really not spare 0.10BTC? I almost make this free everyday off of free bitcoin sites... Just one lottery. On Feb, 14, if we haven't payed out and posted up a screenshot of the entries and the winner, then call us a quick fraud scheme please. :)

LOL. I personally started the pot at 1BTC. I always will each round.
Right now that's $5.46USD. You enter the lottery for $0.55USD. You personally stand to gain AT LEAST 1000% of your bet. I take about $0.14USD/ticket purchased.  a link to the math.
If it really bothers you that I'm taking $0.13USD that will go towards the site anyways... Don't play lol. I've seen people just discard/throw away this amount of change on a regular basis... Let the SINGLE person that has entered take the pot for himself and make over 1000% :)
Besides, the real gambling/casino games will have a much higher percentage of payouts. They will be similar to other sites percentages (95+% I think?)
Also, I know I'm not using a hash system. My programming isn't that advanced at the moment. The three of us that are running this are working our asses off to make this as automated and fun as we can. It will take some time. Once we have more games running or if a lot of people play the lottery, I will most likely drop the percentage we take from each ticket.
Like I said earlier, don't like it? Don't play. We are just trying to provide a new place to play. :)

I am not based within the US. That was the first issue I had to work around. The US doesn't allow online gambling I believe. Bitcoin is an emerging "currency" that can be perceived as a threat. Because of this, whether its gray area or not, I'd be wary of the US coming after you if you were to run this in the states. So yes, it is "online gambling" I believe :)

... So you are saying that if I use a COMPLETELY random system, **that you can test yourself to make sure it works**, that I can screenshot and post on the site for EVERYONE to check... and you still are saying I'm going to draw my own ticket? lol
I mean... if you had read the FAQs on our site, I discussed how the drawing for the lottery would work for now. I made sure to use a system that can indeed be checked and balanced. You would have known this had you done your own research.


Again, if you had taken the time to search for about 3-5 seconds, on this very page mind you, I talk about not having an md5(checksum) system at the moment... [BitLotto]( uses this system as do many other sites. I had received inspiration from them even before you said anything. My partner and I discussed this more yesterday and we figured out how to implement this system. It will be implemented when our current lottery is over (Feb. 10).

OK :)
@_date: 2012-01-28 15:56:25
Also regular address is working now. 
@_date: 2012-01-29 17:23:26
Yes, we did launch a bit prematurely. That, I agree with you. All of the upcoming games we are programming will use the checksum system as well.
Also, I thank you for your scrutiny. I understand your concerns since I also have them as a BTC gamer. And, I also apologize for my slightly hostile responses. I was just upset at being labeled a fraud. :)
Hopefully, in the next few weeks, you can come back to our site and be convinced it's a strong contender! :)

Yes, I know the address is weird for now. My hosting site is working to fix whatever errors are happening. There isn't much there now... but we have a few games in development right now! Please, just participate and help us promote for now!
@_date: 2012-01-27 16:44:46
Also, we have a few games in development and I am hard at work making everything more automated for easier use! The site will be awesome once we can implement these working changes :D

Please **rationally** explain as to why I am scamming.
