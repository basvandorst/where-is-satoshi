Well, if my personal observation does not mean anything to you here are scientific studies:
Just want to state, I am libertarian, and I believe every person has total right to harm himself/herself.
But telling people that MDMA is a relatively safe drug is very silly in my opinion, and it may ruin their life.
Yes, it is wonderful experience, life changer, nothing compares to it. But it damages brain, this is the sad truth.

I'm not repeating anything. I support this activity to use low doeses for PTSD treatment, because potential benefits are much higher than potential risk. However from my personal observation this drug is highly neurotoxic and should be avoided at all costs for recreational use.

The fact is that there are a lot of people that suffer from this substance (you can check bluelight forums), and many of them just took it only once and did not abuse it. Also the scientific fact is that PET scan reveals massive SERT axon damages due to this substance. And it is also scientifically proven that it also damages cerebral fibers.

This is your point of view : ) From my point of view it is a strong neurotoxin and there is no way for it to use safely for recreational purpose. The sad part is that people in most cases does not realise how much damage do they get and continue to use this poison.

Flow control in C is straightforward, while in C++ indirect calls of constructor/destructors, overloaded operators, class templates and so on, makes it difficult to follow the program and find the problematic places, bugs, memory leaks, etc.
fortran cobol lisp or basic have been designed for special purpose, they can't accomplish hardware related tasks as effectively as C, they were not designed for that

Agree, I support this clinical trial, as far I know they use around 50mg for treatment, which seems to be quite safe. But when using over 100mg it may ruin your serotonin system (even completely pure substance), and recovery takes not weeks or months, but years of struggling. Just be careful, that's all I want to say.

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:51:49
Yes, it is a gamble, price may go in any direction. But despite massive sell offs, price is consolidating and building support at 16K. It did not break trend line on 4hr charts. In my opinion there is a big chance that it will explode at some point.

@_date: 2017-08-22 21:04:05

@_date: 2017-08-15 13:45:08
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:45:38
Yes, it is a problem
But making difficulty adjustment depended on time may be worse for security
Miners may exploit EDA, they may stop mining particular coin, difficulty readjusts to a miserable level quickly, and then miners will benefit from low difficulty, and you will have new blocks every 30 seconds. This is currently happening with BCH
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:33:53

Looks like their engineers still think that GPU-s are used for Bitcoin mining
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:20:04
the only known thing about the market is that it fluctuates
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:01:34
$3400 is the next support level, I dont think it will fall below that, but everything is possible
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:04:51
Was not BTC always criticized for too much volatility?
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:13:05
yes yes yes
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:10:14
They want to destroy Bitcoin

it will be soon upgraded to 8K
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:56:57
Why do you calculate total value of BTC + BCH? it has no sense
I can create altcoin and name it "Bitcoin Authentic", but it won't be Bitcoin

At last, they understood that it will hurt their profits when going against community
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:17:03
Right, we can wait one month for difficulty adjustment
I think mining pools will make up their mind and announce their plans
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:36:14
There is one problem, when you are concerned about short term earning, there is a big chance that you will panic sell. That happened to me before.
If everything goes smooth maybe 30-40%
If you are lucky then over 100%
But I expect price drop on December, current wave probably will last 1-2 months
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:06:35
You need Bitcoin ASIC miner. You can buy it on ebay, or directly from the supplier, i.e. canaan.io

I hope he did
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:50:06
no idea, but most daytraders like this chart
there are also market fluctuations, it will not rise all time

also maybe try some memory improvement medicines first? magnesium, B vitamins, Polygala tenuifolia, etc : )

It is not safe because someone may steal your ID and use it for illegal actions
Purpose of the verification is simple, to protect sellers, if FBI asks seller about the transactions the seller will give your ID to them
It's up to you to trust or not, probably you can, but there is no 100% guarantee
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:16:14
Yeah I know the feeling, few years ago I bought 6 BTC for $800 each, and sold for $600

Mining in August is like hell fire
But my miners are working to support network and earn some money
They will mine even at loss, because i hold some BTC that needs to be secured
I think every hodler must invest in mining too
Btw, it's a shame of community that we have not designed and manufactured ASIC for miners, therefore we are forced to buy miners from Jihan. Look what SiaCoin developers are doing, they decided to design and manufacture ASIC miners that will be safely distributed between community members
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:40:07
This poor coin barely gets 10K transactions per day
But see what happened on 15-16 Aug
Is it Jihan selling, buying and hodling all of these coins?
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:34:47
Analyzing charts, looking at past info. there is a chance that we could never see bitcoin below 3000, but no one can predict price actually

Great miners with a good build quality
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:23:43
Yes, that's great, but we need cheap, good quality bitcoin miners, to get rid of Bitmain monster

Good news, 2x is not the way to go
Need bigger blocks? use BCH
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:07:28
I think it wont go directly to 2800, most likely it will stop at 3400 and if it gets enough support then rebounds
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:39:52
yes, one of many dips
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:29:11
sweet childhood memories : )
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:07:29
I may be wrong, but after this epic start of the new bull run, there is now way for the price to drop significantly anywhere soon
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:03:05
it's not safe in my opinion
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:08:16
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:55:07
dont worry, your BTC now is in safe hands : )
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:04:59

yes, somewhere before December, but no one can guarantee that BTC will keep it's price on December

I confirm that analyzing previous price charts hodl is the best long term strategy

If you do not own mining hardware and don't run it yourself, you are under the risk to lose investment
If you do not own private keys of your coins, and store them on exchange, you are again under the risk to lose investment

I think every Bitcoin supporter that has significant investment, must acquire miners to protect network, no other way to protect network without hardfork, but it may be too late, hardware is out of stock everywhere

Another solution is to rent a VPS or dedicated server if you can afford it.
It's sad that bitcoin network does not reward full nodes like some other cryptocurrencies do.

"The reason"
and here is my post:
Does anybody know why people from other coin sub hate Bitcoin Core team and this sub?
The hate is very strong and irrational
They want to destroy Bitcoin Segwit
They hate core developers and wanting them to be fired and die
They hate Blockstream and call Bitcoin Blockstream coin
They hate this sub because of censorship
The hate is very strong and ridiculous
I think there should be some reason
Can someone explain whats going on?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:23:33
It is easy on bullish market (however, HODL-ing always wins on bullish BTC market)
more difficult on bearish
You need to be a good trader to get nice profits
The biggest problem is to trust exchange

You can check the source code of the first bitcoin version, definitely not AI, it's a man made thing : ) 600KB of code that changed history of mankind.
However there is a chance that AI specially created the code to look like written by human : )
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:46:00
fees should drop after SegWit activation (5-6 days), it will help for some time
after that Lightning Network will solve scalability and high transaction fee problem
Also, for small payments you can use Litecoin or Dogecoin
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:16:53

the same story with me : \
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:42:04
no idea, but segwit lockin raised the price almost immediately
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:21:50
it is quite smooth ride, still uptrend, small corrections
looks like people learned not to panic sell
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:57:36
my prediction is 7-8K in 2-3 weeks
after that I have no idea

In my opinion Blockchain is one of the greatest achievements of humanity, it will be widely used soon, in every project that requires trust and security. It will be adopted by banks, stock exchanges, trading platforms, even gold  trading may incorporate blockchain technology

depends on electricity costs, but generally yes, it is profitable if you can find good miner with a low price.

shh.. don't bother it before Segwit activation, or it may break the support level
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:40:57
yes, people lose when they sell at dips
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:33:10
I think there is a chance that we will lose only Bitmain's hashrate, about 30-40%, that will be directed to Jihan's coin
This will actually increase profit of other miners (including myself), so I hope that they will do that
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:57:44
most economical bitcoin miners are out of stock, and they have 3-4 months preorders

To the Moon! : )
Actually I think there will be no head and shoulder type reversal of the global trend, traders need stronger signal to make decision, like double or triple top, like it happened in 2013
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:32:23
Yes, it has no support line till 3400
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:57:31
even best traders cant say for sure when is it the top and when we hit bottom

You can do million dollar transaction with Bitcoin anytime, anywhere. Now imagine sending million dollar worth gold metal in another part of the world.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:47:38
Reason 1: Gold has no inherent value.
Reason 2 : Nothing is priced in gold.
Reason 3 : Literally everyone who owns gold is invested from a speculative position.
and still golds has 7 trillion dollar market cap
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:15:08
Yes, I think current wave of bubble will last for 1-2 month
I do not expect any significant price drop during this period
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:20:26
refund? : D
I have lost all hope regarding btc-e refund
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:33:47
Litecoin is good alternative for small/medium transactions
However when sending over $1000 I think Bitcoins 3$ transaction fee is acceptable, because it has most secure blockchain backed up by enormous hashrate
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:28:13
it's a series of waves, each new wave is stronger than the previous one, no one knows how long will it last
Should we expect sudden huge drop in price? hard to say, there is a chance that it may stabilize at some point without big drop, I mean if it reaches 30K, then drops about 5K and stabilizes at this point, no one will care about that too much. As market cap and adoption rise, fluctuations of BTC price will get smaller
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:37:14
Majority of miners are like dog's tail, follow dogs direction
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:36:30

@_date: 2017-08-12 09:08:18
not likely
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:23:49
most altcoins are easily manipulated, too low market cap, but if you are lucky you may make a fortune
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:22:20
transaction fee for sending even few satoshis may be $2-3
You'd better train on Litecoin or Dogecoin wallet ; )

enjoy this bull run guys
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:59:01
yep, it may be the last chance to buy sub 4K

It can be changed in few hours in the source code
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:11:26
you are clever man
personally I wouldn't go with lawyer and wife's relatives
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:16:25
maybe we will never see BTC price below 3K again
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:45:34
nothing special, traders sell high and rebuy at dips
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:20:32

BCH? Jihan is buying his own coin
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:06:08
Buy protractor to measure correct angle when you see Bitcoin logo to determine is it fake or not
I bet 2X coin also will have the same logo rotated by some angle
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:04:30
Some altcoins may rise dramatically when BTC stops growing, this is more like gambling
I dont think that diversification if bad, but carefully choose coins, and hold most of the amount in BTC
If you care about short term profits you need some education in trading
If you are long term, then hold BTC for years
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:59:16
hm.. Jihan
Market always wins, don't fight the trend
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:54:05
Glad that did not bought it
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:10:41


current price manipulation of the other coin is far away from the free market, let's wait and see what happens when they run out of money
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:07:43

@_date: 2017-08-19 13:03:33
Anyone can hardfork Bitcoin, anytime
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:57:32
hardfork problem
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:14:26
only idiot will announce incoming dump, and only double idiot will upload video if he really holds 200K BTC : )
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:30:25
people like when they find something interesting by themselves, not by advise
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:39:33
I think the chance of 2x fork is small
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:13:14
How much do you know about fiat money and central banks?
If you want to understand internals of Bitcoin you should learn basics of cryptography and programming
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:13:53
Yes that will help network too, but mining hashpower is the key security issue right now.
I think average PC with 200GB free disk space can run a node, just make sure that it can accept incoming connections.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:24:18
But you already have 8x coin, whats the sense in supporting 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:08:52
maybe, but right shoulder seems to me a lot higher than left, on 4hr chart again
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:59:31
too small hashrate, something like that would be better 
or this one 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:33:54
nope, their coin has about 10K average transactions per day (lower than Dogecoin), one person is mining all coins, and making fake trading volume by circulating the same coins on exchange
It is going to be biggest scamcoin ever, many greedy people will burn
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:20:44
transaction fees. but this will cause network instability, so I guess there will be need to keep some minimal mining rewards. But that will happen after 100+ years. Nothing to care about right now.

but still possible
probably hardware wallet is the way to go
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:05:55
hm, pretty possible
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:25:17
yep, still on monstrous uptrend
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:06:03
don't fight the trend
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:03:25
Thanks, I think this is the way to go
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:05:43
probably no one is shorting these days
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:08:07
I have nothing against BCH or any other coin (even manipulated so hard, people must learn on their own mistakes). But it is not Bitcoin and it's price does not relate to Bitcoins price, that's all.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:29:57
who cares?
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:26:39
Jihan, please pump this poor coin too
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:32:34
you don't say
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:32:38
my bet on Fortran and FoxPro : )
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:17:41


That's right, no one was expecting 20K on the previous bull run, so the price may reach much higher points than expected
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:24:08
I have the same feeling, but for $7500 bubble
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:39:53
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:08:27
I too, but as said, everything that doesn't kill us makes us stronger
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:35:34
I believe you have better luck than you think : )
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:26:53
wait for another
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:08:49
no one will benefit by this action

@_date: 2017-08-22 14:21:20
they will fork anyway
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:38:53
looks like market have reached the top
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:41:40
it's the level where price has been stabilized previously, you can check it on 4hr chart
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:58:36
I think the price rise can be explained by technical analysis, there was a new bull wave incoming on the charts
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:01:34
just wait, he will ask you about Bitcoin again soon
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:13:31
Yes, now people expect 100-200K bitcoin, but not 400-500K or 40-50K ; )
No one knows for sure what is the future

If you worry about your BTC investment, then buy one miner and run it, decentralization of mining will solve this problem
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:01:47

someone buying a lot of bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:56:16
if no one sells bitcoin will die
so it's good
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:53:10
selling at 10k maybe the worst mistake, or it may be the best move
absoluteley no one can predict market at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:19:07
if you would like to sell your coins 10000 and 9980 does not make big difference
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:44:24
yeah, thats right, but on average it hold $100 pretty well without big spikes
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:31
mega rich people are usually old and conservative, and they wont be able to purchase all of the BTC even if they wish, price would skyrocket to unbelievable levels
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:51:29
very difficult to say, if looking to previous patterns than it wont fall too low, but no one knows what will happen
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:10:33
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:15:42
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:40:39
bitcoin went from 1 $ to $100
and we have never seen Bitcoin below 100$ after that
I agree with you that there will be big dump at some point, but I may be completely wrong
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:31:53
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:11:26
Things are getting something scary, I know people who called Bitcoin fraud and pyramid at $500, and now they are ready to buy it at 10K. Anything can happen
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:12:32
low risk? are you kidding?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:48:17
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:04:59

if you plan to hold those bitcoins for 20 years then yes the price target may reach 100000
But there is a big chance that you will panic sell bitcoins and lose some money
Currently bitcoin is on strong uptrend, but no one knows when the market will enter bull mode and fall, never invest such amount of money if you have no prior experience with markets, especially highly speculated ones
But as you already invested money I suggest to educate and learn how the market works, learn technical analysis, reading charts, market indicators, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:24:36
I hope it will fall in few minutes
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:14:46
one more observation, CME will start trading in 2 weeks, if looking to 1 week charts it is perfect time to short Bitcoin, because RSI indicator most likely will reach it's peak for that time
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:39:26
Yes, but I am not sure if they can be applied to the current market condition
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:02:14
what if all btc already sold and only hodlers left?

we are on hyperbolic curve, I think it will be difficult to find any dips short term

daytrading crypto? - say good bye to sleep
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:03
I will wait for maybe one week, if the price doesn't break 10K I may sell part of my BTC and then wait for dip
If the price breaks 10K I will act according to market indicators. Personally I think that we will reach 12-13K and then the dip, but I may be wrong

you want someone to blame later? : )

trend line is intact at the moment
10% drop is a joke in Bitcoin world
when trend reverses then we can talk about the burst

| The market will dip/crash but then stabilise as massive demand still exists
The same rule works for Bitcoin
after each crash it's getting stronger
Currently it is way more volatile than real estate, but I hope that will change when it grows bigger
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:52:54
risky decision

why do you think that real estate in London is not an asset bubble?
we are surrounded by the bubbles, even growth of world population is a bubble itself

After loosing 20M dogecoins on Cryptsy I also started from scratch.
And now about $1400 stuck on BTC-E
And it seems that BTC-E is doing exit scam like Cryptsy did, periodical updates to keep hope in people, meanwhile moving all of the money, before completely shut down the website
Such unlucky person am I
