Your correct peter schiff hasn’t ever got Bitcoin, I’ve watched him squirm a few times on the Keiser report, when good old max keiser has put the intrinsic value scenarios over, yet he’s one who refuses to see the light.
This other dude here also who says about all BTC holders wanting nothing more that to cash into fiat maybe correct for now, but that’s not ultimately what Bitcoin holders want, we want access for paying with BTC everywhere, hence LN and time will be needed.
Hey keep your fiat and your gold, when I can pay in crypto I don’t need the latter.
Fear is what makes a man fight, even a weak man who isn’t a fighter.
This is what the none believers are doing, fighting through the fear of the power of technology and digital payments and stores of value.
Welcome in the future.
One more thing go and take gold to a jewellers and see what they pay, second hand value that’s it.

Good I’m pleased companies can take advantage here, and set up global businesses.
Accepting crypto  is SMART, turning it away is DUMB, well done PH.������

Stop worrying about dips and how low it will go, you should go if your worried like that and try playing lotto instead.

Who cares, these dummies that bank there will suck it all up, only the people with brains will leave.
Also remember these banks want to implement some form of fake Blockchain tech and an insecure banking token, oh my god just think of the chaos and lost funds then.
You can’t beat BITCOIN haha.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:31:13
I agree sir.

Move your exchange to the Philippines, says on here they are letting people open exchanges with tax giveaways.
Never give up.����
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:09:58
Bitcoin will, but it will maybe do it faster when another bank needs a bailing out,
Let’s keep a close eye on deutsche bank.

Over your head, bcash isn’t bitcoin.
Bitcoin core is not bcash.
WTF your point.
I said yet again gold is often faked, digital cash like bitcoin can’t be.
Forking coins isn’t faking, as the original coin still stays the same, as I was talking about BTC you idiot not Bcash.��.
A simple question for you, how many Bitcoin core tokens will be produced?
If you answer is 21 million then your brain may see, they can’t be faked.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:59:08
Good job, everything helps.
Nice seeing cards helping and not talk of card banning ������.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:27:42
There correct, most not all alt coins are a waste of space, all and any copies weaken the strong.
All of the money that has gone into other shit coins should go into BTC, that way everyone wins iMO.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:03:47
That’s exactly what his play is, make BTC more competitive and his original payment system less.
He knows that he and Paypal can make it work.

Don’t tell them anything, it’s your human right for some privacy.
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:11:22
You don’t need anyone telling you this, you should be able too see this for yourself.
But it’s good that people with influence say this more.

They will all be wearing these down the council estate in Peckham soon ��.

That’s an interesting article, but pure rubbish that’s been ill thought out, there are areas in both section one and scenario two that have been written by a half wit.
What the authors miss is adoption has to be gained by faith and not forced, no human is likely to use fedcoin who they clearly state can automatically take taxes when ever they like.
Also they have no miners, no gate keepers centralised isn’t an option as it won’t be any different as what they have now.
Facebook scenario is absurd and frankly boring, not worth reading.
And lastly the pathetic scenario of watering BTC down by creating millions more coins urrrrr, think they will find a token and network only has utility because it’s used and secure.
Those created coins exist today but BTC is still the king, because a lot of the others are just shit, created for fun.
Go away and try harder hahaha��

Hope he does win, I hate FB it’s for farts.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:15:50
BTC is supreme, takes less storage, doesn’t weight much, can be used as a payment in a shop or online, can’t be faked, easier to hide and store.
Young people embrace it more, and it’s limited more than gold, with less manipulation (arguably).
Can be used for smart contracts and more going forward.
Less people will buy into gold going forward and more will use BTC as a store of wealth, it’s already started.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:58:37
Yes it’s all corrupt, they are all corrupt, they have the law behind them, this dude who’s in prison will be a sacrificial goat.
None of the top brass are ever jailed, banks should be burnt down.
Bankers should be purged.
Create a new world order.
Get rid of all politicians also that don’t do their jobs for the good of the people.
And make BTC globally the currency of choice.

Dodgy this bank is, this is the kind of bank that will start the next crash.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:16:30
Your point is the most valid out them all, how many gold bars in vaults are fakes.
Wake up people BTC cannot be faked, so it’s better.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:59:09
Wow do you think there’s millions of agents, don’t do a face to face trades for more than a few bucks, think your a bit paranoid, fuck the IRS.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:41:03
But that’s not Bitcoin is it?
It’s btrash.
Faked meaning a gold bar made of another metal kinda fake.
BTC is BTC, it cannot be faked.
Think about for a while.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:59:14
Fuck off.

Bill Harris is the worst kind of idiot, look if you want to rubbish Bitcoin at least look at past people that have said the same thing and been disproved.
Only an idiot would come out years later with the same pathetic claims, and I mean it’s years since these ridiculous statement were first aired.
Guy go and retire somewhere out of public view as your opinion is of yesteryear.��
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:25:01
Interesting, i thought it was agreed in general that wealth is only and agreement, I think utility and scarcity firstly dictate a value, the peer to peer agreement seals the specific price.
Interesting ending, I know he’s correct that there are few who hold most, but I disagree with his analogy long term.
I think when or if BTC becomes more valuable those whales will sell proportions of their holding, those proportions will spread elsewhere, kinda trickle down economics for BTC.
It won’t end like he thinks.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:49:32
Yes we have read all of this before, firstly banks still don’t understand BTC, soon though maybe that light bulb moment will come.
And yes there cannot be a token that’s not decentralised as if it’s not decentralised it’s not secure and can be created willy nilly just like fiat.
Decentralised is king.
Banks stay with your ageing systems or embrace BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:44:16
That cash is trash, core is king.

Which ones are the fakes, they all look the same ��.
1kg they weight,value about 23k U.K. sterling, just think of lugging it around or sending it over seas.
When you really look you see they are pointless now BTC exists.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:42:52
Leave that Bitcoin cash, in the trash haha.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:39:25
He probably doesn’t want the debt pile a mortgage will give him, mortgages aren’t freedom, their financial chains.
People in the U.K. paying over inflated prices and shit loads more back in interest.
Maybe he’s right, shared housing isn’t the answers, it’s for the desperate.
I say wait my friend, don’t get in debt follow your own heart.
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:33:53
No one should care about them, Bitcoin will do what it needs, and if it’s many things so be it.
Forget these people and their vailed threats about central bank crypto cash that won’t work, no ones bothered.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:32:19
Yes it’s the worst garbage article kind you’ll see in the news written by fools.

The Canadian senate wants to have a word with those Canadian banks that like banning people buying or associating with crypto then.
