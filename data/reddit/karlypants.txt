By the time Bitcoin reaches its full potential, people who don't understand it won't need to. Most people don't even understand how money works.
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:38:21
Any word on a launch date?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:16:11
It could be a feature of a coin, or future protocol update. Access wallet, spend a satoshi once a year for eg or coins put on dormant list, surrendered after eg 5 years.
It could be an automated service of course...

Biggest audience of any financial show in the world... (he's also far from a fuckwit, a misguided genius imo who thinks he needs to do a Bill Hicks routine rather than entertain people with his considerable intellect)

Don't most/all exchanges do their dealing off the blockchain, so the delay is waiting for their system to process the transaction?
i.e. when you buy coins, you're not getting them in some live market, the exchange just nets the trades against eachother and processes everything themselves...
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:01:38
You can try!
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:47:37
Tough crowd :)

Come to Ireland, you don't even get the interest bit!

It was only 10pm and then I think I spent .000.... *thud*
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:18:24
Supply and demand - if there's suddenly 10% less coins my stash it worth 10% more in fiat...
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:21:16
I'd rather they make the decision for my neighbor to live and send me my part of the bill rather than leave it up to nature...
(But I *am* one of those crazy Europeans who believes in reducing fear, and that equality enriches society rather than it being some commie threat...)

Smells like Full Tilt Poker. What is it about morbidly obese men and other people's money?

The top few already do...
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:14:35
My point is, could we know? Being an entirely digital system we don't have the same physical restrictions and it would be positive for the currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 08:26:31
Not at $10bln it ain't

It's just plain embarrassing...

True - if were talking core protocol it need not be though

You zapped your money from inside a stolen safe, how awesome is that?

Very impressive, kudos x

Horse shit.

But should it be?
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:08:38
They also accept USD, all they care about is profit, I doubt they worry too much about competition in payment methods. I predict Amazon will add BTC by end of 2014.
Don't see any reason Apple, Google et al won't follow suit. They offshore everything for tax purposes anyway so hardly regulation stopping them...

I don't think Dorian is Satoshi fwiw but how is this proof of anything? 
@_date: 2014-02-01 11:49:28
Paradigm shift!!!
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:16:19
I resemble that remark.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:17:46
I am Satoshi. Just getting some user feedback ;)
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:15:42
Yeah I guess an arbitrary max dormant time baked into a currency could be a feature. Must access wallet once a year etc to confirm ownership...

Pro Tip: If someone ever takes 10 minutes to pour a pint of Guinness don't drink it :)

He doesn't seem particularly upset. This will blow over in a day when Newsweek clear things up and he can remember the time the world wanted to hear from him.
I just hope he makes a big chunk of money from someone. We could even start a Bitcoin donation fund and get him interested in it!

We also change water into wine sometimes but it doesn't taste as good
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:21:27
Its a piece of internet/economic/business history. Keep it as a souvenir of what could go down as the biggest fraud in history when converted to fiat from BTC in 2020 :)
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:23:16
That's what taxi meters are for...
@_date: 2016-03-13 13:18:33
Woah thanks for the great link. Pretty clear picture and would appear to counter the argument that Eth is only borrowing money from BTC...?
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:54:39
I may have read this wrong but the general gist of this is that you're selling all your Bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:41:03
Yeah I'm with you on the big picture hopes but practicalities of the average person caring about the basis of money is where I've the same doubts as ever.
I've rode the bubbles and enjoyed the self fulfilling prophecy but I just don't see where it goes beyond the inevitable further rise due to network effect.
Most people are stupid and don't care once they can eat and sleep.
I think we've still got a store of value case, stronger than ever... All stats are encouraging but I'm still waiting for the killer app to make BTC something the avg person can use without even knowing they are. That's been so long coming now I'm happy to just sit on some digital gold as a hedge.
I'm also hedging BTC with ETH and looks to me like a programable layer on a blockchain has a lot more long term value and utility. 
Sleep easier knowing I've a piece but I can't see mass adoption for the moon scenario anymore.
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:52:51
Hahaha good point 
Your English is fantastic so congrats - the losing/loosing thing is an Internet meme in itself ��
Great post btw...  I'm a long term bull but no more confident now than at any point since 2009 tbh
@_date: 2016-06-26 09:08:11
10k a coin means 150bln market cap. How would $50ml investment translate into 140bln of market cap increase? Does not compute.
Re use cases, they apply for blockchain, not Bitcoin - private chains obviously suck but it doesn't follow that Bitcoin is the one that succeeds imo
What do you think Ethereum's business model is? It's decentralised, infinitely more utility for the corporate purposes you describe.
I'm completely dispassionate about it all at this stage hold both plus fiat and riding the waves. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:30:33
All of this except the bonus point. Nice brain.
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:46:51

You can store them in your brain...

Satoshi's stash.
@_date: 2015-11-29 11:47:21
Of course, but despite the white paper vision which I'm totally in agreement with a CB is not one anon person. Decisions at least follow some flagged (bullshit) narrative.
Not knowing if 10% of an entire currency supply is burnt or instantly accessible is not good for long term credibility. If they can be moved he should move them, otherwise no ability to prove accessibility after effectively premining is a design flaw imo.

You're a pioneer. Thank you for your service to the chain!

When people can spend Bitcoins on stuff they want they'll spend them...

I still have the same number of Bitcoins as I did yesterday.
