Beat me to it.

Yeah, I was going to for a few seconds, until I read the *many* posts online about the accounts being locked and the user not being able to receive their balance. 


I was somewhat concerned that, at some point, Square would be able to figure out the crypto trades by the Bisq code used in the transfer. (This is based on what I've read about Bisq.) Though I'm less concerned, overall, about square. And more concerned about the people way above Square. (If you know what I mean.)

Sorry, I should've clarified. 
I meant Bisq w/Cashapp as payment. Not purchasing BTC via Cashapp. (Which seems to be a huuuuge mess anyway.)

At the moment I'm more concerned with buying, and I can absolutely see why it would be less than ideal if I were on the receiving end of fiat via Cashapp.
(thanks for all the info, btw)

300k for a meth lab in Arizona. I mean, who *wouldn't* buy this.

This is... something. Wow. I've been home sick all day, so I went over the post twice to make sure I wasn't just in a haze and misunderstanding. 
It looks like it took you about 15-20 minutes to make $15 worth of BTC. I might stop ignoring people who try to scam me.

It's *very* traceable though. You can trace every transaction.
You just can't link the address to a person without some kind of record. In that sense, it's nowhere near as "black market" as gold or cash. But it's much easier to transfer. 
It *is* serving as money at the moment, though. It exists in a state of huge potential, even now. Positive and negative.

Oh, no. Possessing more than $500 in crypto means you should have a hardware wallet. I mean, maybe they exist. But I wouldn't buy them.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:04:38


Why? 
I get if you feel it should hit a price and stabilize, but why would it need to depreciate? 


There's no if. It sounds like you're fundamentally against Bitcoin. 
Do you feel the security and methods of "transfer" are positives?

I use dollars as bookmarks all the time. My wife thought it was hilarious until I took her to Barnes and Noble and showed her how much it costs to buy a bookmark. Rationale: it's not a scrap of paper, so you're not as likely to lose it or toss it. It's still worth a dollar. And you're not going out to buy a bookmark, so you've managed to avoid being a retarded person.

I feel like at least half the point of Bitcoin is that it *isn't* that. What background mechanism would you propose? Backing it with fiat?
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:50:46
Fair enough.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:25:04
But it's not a ponzi scheme--because it's decentralized. How you're describing it, *every* form of currency without central control--beads, gold, etc--is a "mutual ponzi."
Bitcoin is essentially that--beads or gold--that we've agreed has value due to its mechanism of "transfer." (In quotes because it never *really* transfers as such.) Value will go up as adoption goes up. This is a phase, I'd imagine. And, I'd also imagine, it should remain deflationary. So unlike the cash I have, it at least won't lose value over time. Assuming adoption continues to widen.

Seriously. I feel like $500 is the threshold to pass for a good hardware wallet, but some of this crazy security BS is just that--LARPing. I can almost picture the sweat and dandruff falling on the keyboard as the Ultimate Security Protocol is being typed.
**Edit:** Almost forgot--congrats to OP!
