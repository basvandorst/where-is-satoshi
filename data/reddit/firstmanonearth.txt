What? It's not even close, not even as a joke. This is a currency, Nigerian Princes are scams. Bitcoin isn't associated with any person or group the same as email. You can read the whitepaper here

Bitcoin increasing in value is not the same as interest paid by a bank.

Bitcoin is a currency. Currencies can be stored in banks for security, transferring money, generating interest, etc.
A bitcoin bank wouldn't have to be used for transferring money, since bitcoin solves that easily. A bitcoin bank could be used for transferring money, since there's no reason not to if you're storing it in the bank for other reasons.
Security is still a requirement. Security can be self done, but it's necessarily difficult.
The reason you would store money in a savings account is because you have no use for it presently, and you can't earn enough profit on it yourself^1 (by investing, funding ventures, trading). The bank collects together all their deposits and uses experts who make tons of money using that capital. Money is much more valuable in larger amounts^2. They pay you for access to your money. This is interest. There will be bitcoin banks that pay you interest. Projects requiring large amounts of capital are not going away. This is not contradicting any tenet of bitcoin.
^1 You might not know how. You might have a job and thus can't watch your investments all the time. You might not have enough. Can you construct a factory using your money?
^2 It can fund ventures like building bridges, constructing factories, creating businesses. Small amounts of money can't do these things.

Funny thing is anyone could have done this sleuthing. Just Google search with a date range of January - February 2011 the original SR address.

I'd prefer if the money was returned to its owners.

Or just memorize the private key

That would increase confidence in BTC I think. A massive holder would have distributed his coin to a bunch of others. There would be fewer people who could dump and crash the market.
