Implementing bitcoin and other crypto currencies directly is just too expensive for most web shops. And how would they censor transactions? You usually just send the amount to be paid, they don’t know what’s being paid for. The most they (Bitpay, ..) can do is terminate the account so the webshop has to find another payment provider. 
This isn’t any different for other forms of payments, Bancontact, Visa, MasterCard , .. are all usually implemented via a service such as Sofort, Mollie, Ingenico, Stripe, .. so you have a single API instead of 20 different ones. If you think everyone is going to be running nodes and implementing API’s, I’m afraid that won’t happen. Even the larger web shops in my country use those payment providers.

It's really the same in both subreddits though, both have reasons to disagree with each other, but neither of them can be mature about it - instead, everyone acts like a bunch of teens.

It’s a short term solution that will make everything work properly while they can figure out a proper long term solution. You can’t keep waiting for the best solution when the entire thing is struggling to keep up. You fix it short term and refactor it when you have a permanent solution. That’s how it works in the real world, can’t imagine things like air traffic control being down for months because they don’t have the perfect solution. If bitcoin wants to be currency, that’s what it will take.

Just don’t store it in a hot wallet, you want your bitcorn to stay cold. It prevents it from popping. Keep it in a cold wallet.

r/btc existed long before BCH did, the reason why it was created was because of censorship here. Whether the censorship is true or not I will leave in the middle. BCH supporters however are very vocal there and I do not support the aggressive marketing going on (wallet thing, declaring BCH is the real bitcoin, ..), but I'm sure many other people there disapprove but aren't as vocal about it.

Actually, Ethereum has been doing more transactions than bitcoin in the last 3 months while keeping transactions fees stable (well below Bitcoins')

You say "they" but I see only one guy who answered you? It's probably him who downvoted you, and maybe one other guy on your first response. But it seems to me you're not really trying to have an actual conversation, looks rather provoking and insulting - so you're going to get the same type of response. Just my 2 cents.

Well that's where sharding comes in, doesn't it?
If Bitcoin can already temporarily fix these scaling issues, they should, if it really wants to become a currency. How would you respond if major payment providers are charging you high fees during Christmas and other periods with a high amount of transactions? Majority of consumers wouldn't be happy about it.
I guess it doesn't yet matter very much as any crypto currency is far from actualy being used by consumers, but the people who look into it now are quick to turn to alts or go return to fiat and never look back. I don't think you want these scaling issues when you're actively getting into the news with major achievement like reaching $10k. You really don't want negative attention like "we tried bitcoin on a webshop and it took 2 days for the order to be paid". Maybe Bitcoin is growing too fast right now.

This is just childish behavior. I'm subscribed both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and the bullshit between the two is just getting out of hand. It's like I'm browsing 4chan. 
Anyway, I'll just block Moonstats - I don't support this kind of behavior in any way. This shouldn't even be here.

I agree, it was hard finding anything at all to compare it with. It’s the closest thing I could think of.

I'm pretty sure iDEAL is for the Netherlands only, but there's indeed many other services that work similar.
