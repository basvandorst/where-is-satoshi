Does anyone have a site or tool that will tell me how long a transaction will take with a certain fee? 
I usually use the average fee graph but maybe I’m overpaying...

Coinbase promised to make Bitcoin Cash available to their users months ago and then they fulfilled their promise. What is the problem here? 
I remember in August everyone on this thread was furious with Coinbase that they couldn't get to their Bitcoin Cash after the fork

Christ your right, thanks man!

Sell on Coinbase, super easy

168 million dollars and this guy is doing the daily 8-5 grind because he can’t get it out of a trust. Not a chance. That’s not how trusts work. It’s legal entity not a bank vault
Share the public key with us. We can find out if he’s for real on the blockchain

This scenario would be awesome 
Tired of rampant speculation with no underlying ability to actually transact for goods and services

Well said. I'm at about 50 hours still waiting for confirmation for a recent transaction. It's stressful to have money tied up for that long. 
Hopefully Core is getting the message and is working to get things back on track

Love this guy. Love this video. Great vision for the future 
The fees to transact with Bitcoin today are $10 plus, higher then ever. There's a 120,000 unconfirmed transactions. 
There's got to be a way to both  prepare for the future correctly and take care of pressing current issues hurting Bitcoin

Ya, your insurance agent is a liar

Love this!

Unfortunately, it doesn’t make sense to make small transactions with Bitcoin anywhere. Fees and wait time is too high. Need the lightning network

Bitcoin core is a dictatorship

Who you calling pal, buddy!

We’ll agree to disagree :)
