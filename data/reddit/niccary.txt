Awwwwe! Good point. I'm going to fire our hype department ;)

I had a ton of student debt too. Fortunately I was able to pay it off a decade early thanks to bitcoin!

Hi, 
You're funds should be 100% safe. It's only possible to spend your Bitcoins if the private key is shared with a service. 
Here's a post we wrote about them:

We call it the soviet aesthetic :) -- I completely agree though, in all seriousness, never had a designer. We're hiring though. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:39:28
Nicely done!

We'll be updating all of our wallets this summer with a fresh UI. Before we invest a ton of time and money to completely re-do the iOS app we're going to work on getting approved first. We love feedback and need your help to get better. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:28:31
This is awesome. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:41:53
We're on it!
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:31:01
I will donate to this cause. Thanks JasoonBored!!
@_date: 2014-10-29 00:15:16
Donation will go to the winners' charity of choice. Provided they accept Bitcoin!

Will the real niccary please stand up?
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:18:39
Build! :) we know we have a lot of work to do. We're going to recruit, hire, grow, invest, and continue to embrace the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:52:43
Yeah, sorry, I had to fire our hype department ;)
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:43:11
I can't wait to check this out! Going to be there tomorrow!

Kyle from CoinPunk and Nic from Blockchcain here --
Thanks for all the support the past 20 hours. It's been amazing. We've received thoughtful words of encouragement from people all over the world. Apple can never ban HTML 5 wallets and we're working on them. 
 
@_date: 2014-02-08 12:19:37
Great job! That was really nicely done!!!
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:40:22
I will donate half a bitcoin.  -- DM me and I'll toss you coins. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:27:00
Give the Blockchain wallet a try (blockchain.com), and if you DM your bitcoin address I'll send you a few bits :) Would love your feedback either way. It's free, easy to use, and you have 100% control over the coins you store there.

Hi harda, 
Thanks for your input; in this case, it's relevant to put a few things in perspective. I'm  Co-Founder of Blockchain.info 
The bitcoin community is a lot bigger and more diverse than this reddit forum, and it's composition of users has vastly expanded since I got involved back in 2010. Last week we saw more cases related to transaction confirmations than ever before, and we're doing everything we can to explain to folks what's happening; but patience is running thin, and I don't blame people. We've already implemented dynamic fees and will be slowly and responsibly rolling that out but we're not convinced that's a long term solution; it passes the buck along to the end users. 
We've grown a lot here at Blockchain.info the past 5 years. We were one of the first companies to build a wallet that’s web-assisted and doesn’t control private keys. Have we experienced growing pains, like many other companies that have experienced accelerated growth? Absolutely. But we’ve always worked to fix any issues in a responsible and timely manner. When mistakes were made, we owned up to them with public security disclosures, and worked hard to make things right for our users -- not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do. It should be noted that we regularly deal with very sophisticated DoS attacks, phishing attempts, and social engineering efforts, and do everything we can to keep our users and their funds safe. Most of the time, no one sees the results of those efforts, and that’s ok. It's simple to sit on the sidelines and snipe but how many times would you be willing to respond to the frustrated user that just want's to send some money to his/her partner and kids back home and can't because of network congestion. Building businesses isn't easy, and supporting millions of end users is exceptionally challenging, but it's worth it when you can make a difference. 
Many firms don’t have the resources to provide great user support, but we answer all cases within a 2.5-hour average, 24/7/365 days a year. Whether you’re new to bitcoin or a longtime Blockchain.info user, we do our best to answer all questions asked of us. As we’re constantly growing, we’ve been listening to the global bitcoin community and making improvements including supporting multiple languages and investing in the community's future by sponsoring well over 100 hackathons around the world. Furthermore, we’ve built a new HD wallet from the ground up that is more secure and easier to use than ever before. As a long time bitcoin user we'd love you're feedback 
I think you miss the point regarding the danger of classifying transactions. It's concerning because we need to be able to support more transaction volume in general, for both large value transactions and tiny ones. A high fee network will exclude many and diminish to value proposition of bitcoin. I can assure you this point will be argued by the incumbents who work to discredit Bitcoin daily. From my point of view, in order for bitcoin to reach it's potential it shouldn't betray the early adopters and millions of users that rely on it as a peer to peer transaction network now. Many normal, non-technical individuals depend on bitcoin to receive their income, to send money to friends and family and transact openly online. We need to support increasing the basic capacity on the network now before they lose trust or find a more affordable system.

Hey, the Export Feature to download your history is back in the wallet now. Wanted to follow up personally. If there is anything you feel we can do a better job with please let me know; always open to constructive and thoughtful feedback.

Hey mgcl2, 
Nic Cary here, Co-Founder of Blockchain.info -- I'm a big fan of the export feature too; and you will see it return in the near future. We don't usually share release dates so I can't comment on when this will be live but it's on our short term roadmap. We've been pushing a lot of updates to our new HD wallet, on web, iOS and Android. It's not always easy to manage the competing priorities of advanced functionality, new features, and nailing the basics. Admittedly, we really rely on user feedback to help drive the discourse even though we know we won't always please everyone. Anyway, I've added a personal reminder in my calendar to follow up with you once it's live so you can check it out. We're not just re-introducing it, but we'll be making it better. 
-Nic 
@_date: 2016-06-28 14:55:23
Thanks, really appreciate that. We've turned over a new leaf here and have a pretty exciting roadmap over the next 12 months. I'm more bullish than ever before :)

Hey well_did_you, 
Thanks for the feedback, I've been trying to find better ways to communicate concepts that relate to current expectations and experiences. At most of these conference, even today, after over 7 years, many people haven't heard about Bitcoin or Blockchain yet. I'm always interested in improving the pitch on behalf of the community so I value your impressions. Thanks for sharing them. I'm not sure I understand all your criticisms but I do think I need to be more cautious with my vocabulary with regards to fees. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:22:04
Hey, 
Thanks for taking the time to give me your feedback, definitely helpful. I'll need to reflect about it some more. I rarely tackle the concept of decentralization but I probably should find a way to make that comfortable for regular web users. Frequently, you're shot clock at these conferences ranges from 7-20 minutes -- so it's impossible to cover everything :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:32:38
Yay! That's amazing.
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:16:54
Congrats on the launch gents! We need more dedicated teams building exchanges :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:48:50
Very excited for Dan to be part of Blockchain!
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:28:07
Thank you for everything you've done and continue to do!
