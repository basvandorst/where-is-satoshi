Well know my programming pretty well. I should be able to handle the vast majority of the back end stuff. I don't know much about graphic design though. So I'd have to either use a template, have a designer, or work with an extremely bare bones site graphically. Add me on Skype at sasuke2910.

I just don't like the word bits, it reminds me of the programming language Haxe(pronounced 'hacks'), like do we really want this named after random computer lingo?
Soon we're going to be 'hacking our apps for bits' and that phrase could be several different things depending on who's saying it and how technical they're being.

How about actually pay someone to do it, like some of the transaction fee if it goes through their node, I'd put up 10 nodes if this happens. But right now it's just a huge waste of money, that'd be fine if Bitcoin was a volunteer lobby, but it's literally all about the money.

Well similarly to American taxes, the more the make the harsher the taxes are, although it shouldn't really matter if you're making that much, so it shouldn't really matter if you're hashing that much.  
You can raise your transaction fees to reap more money and lower your hashrate percentages forcing you to place a supply and demand game. I feel like it's a good call.

I'm a long time programmer, Android developer, and Bitcoin fanatic. This would be possible if you couldn't fake this data with emulation.
If Android adds a feature to make sure that the data is 100% crypto safe and accurate then call me up and I can work out the Bitcoin details for you. Although I doubt it will happen any time in the near future.

Wait, this is huge if it is what I think it is. My day to day worries about Bitcoin is how much should I put in Bitfinex before I run the risk of them running with the cash or getting hacked to death.  
If this is a Wall Street American regulated exchange then I no longer have to worry about any of that. I should have a strong legal obligation to my money back if they were to get hacked or tried to run.

It's computer security 101. There's no reason anyone should ask you for your password EVER. We've been computing for decades with this restriction in mind. Simply don't.

It does if you want to avoid double spends? We've already seen proof that coins can easily be double spent if you don't wait for a confirm.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:10:06
Bitundo works perfectly, we had this discussion months ago. If you put a high transaction fee on a second payment then it will double spend. Just wait for a confirm.

The site is real, take a closer look it generates the keys in real time in an insane amount of pages.

I've been using Bitfinex, during all the hacking and such a few weeks ago they just rolled back the server. Customer service exists at least. And the owners are on LinkedIn, they also piggy back off of BitStamp for a lot of their transactions, and they have a few reason to trust them. With all the talk of alternatives I can't believe no one's suggests Bitfinex.

Anyone in the world can make a wallet in seconds and most countries have a way of filling those wallets with money converted from fiat.  
Back to the basics. :/

Wow, this blew up. I'm not trying to spread FUD, there's sites everywhere that will undo transactions like 
I believe in Bitcoin as much as the lot of you, but don't be religious about it, there's still development that needs to be done and issues that need to be solved. Don't flame every person that talks about Bitcoin as if it's not God.

If your goal is even remote anonymity then don't run this on Windows. Although you can fool around with it in a virtual box pretty easily.

I just looked through all the programming languages I know, it's too fucking bad Windows Phone has an extremely limited api, no Java or Haxe? Reminds me of making 360 games all over again.

Web developer here, shoot me a PM, I'd like to get this running.

    Feb. 14, 2010: If you’re sad about paying (a transaction) fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself.
This isn't how this actually works right? To the best of my knowledge running a node gets you nothing.

When was the original money deposited? I'd say 3 days (Only one day for 80%) is actually on the more reasonable side for that much money. Especially if it's a check.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:24:55
Because you'd be identifying yourself as a potential attacker. There's been some anonymous IPs hashing out a lot recently and it's been suspected that it may be gigahash, although it's been largely dismissed due to two reasons:  
1. It suggest malicious intent, which may cause many to leave gigahash.  
2. It make transactions hard to verify and the miners may not be sure that they're getting their money from the blocks they mine, which will probably also cause people to leave.

The coins will be recovered. Think of the wallet file as a username/password to an account that holds your coins.

He's say what you get out of a mix is dependent on what the coins are defined as legally.

Yeah, it's a really bad look that almost all mainstream videos about Bitcoin are have their threads deleted or buried because they're not 100% positive.
I understand why the community would do it because there's so much positive news and everything effects the market, but it looks suspicious to people on the outside.

That's nothing compared to what would have to happen, it'd have to be worse that the Chinese firewall even.

Computer scientist here, it's possible, although not without taking away a LOT of internet freedoms, it's safe to say it will never happen without extremely oppressive governments.
