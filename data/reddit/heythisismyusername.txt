I use Coinbase's wallet (I know, I know. I'm saving up for a physical wallet) and it was as easy as scanning their QR code! Super easy transaction.

Been here a few days and I'm loving it already. Highly recommended.

Well I'm off to Australia in a week so I'm really not sure. Might buy more if it drops to 3200, but it's at 3300 right now so... we'll see, haha

Altius Coffee Brewers on Flinders Lane! Good coffee

Bought in at 4300 for about $300 which isn't a lot granted, but it's fun seeing the price go up and down. I'm just gonna hodl and buy more as the price falls

Hell I bought coffee with bitcoin today!
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:47:06
Yeah I dunno haha. I've only been a BTC holder for a month. It was $3.35AUD worth of bitcoin, I know that lol

This is my experience too. Commonwealth have been very helpful since I've moved

alright nice. Make sure you kick some lawyerly ass in OP's case. Don't let his ex fuck him for the last time.
