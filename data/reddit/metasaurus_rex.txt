This product shines light on the need for a crypto-focused and anonymous credit rating system. Commercial credit ratings are the main reason consumers pay off their traditional credit cards. If there was a p2p focused credit rating that the community had confidence in you wouldn't have to limit your lending to friends and p2p lending could really expand.

The rate of never-redeemed retail gift cards is 2% to 4%, so that's a baseline point of comparison. I wonder about the number of lost btc, but I'm unsure how much is guesswork. Do you know if there is analysis supporting the estimate of 3 million lost, or is it more like conventional wisdom?

Coinbase is the most reliable. They want a whole bunch of personal information, including a bank account number. But you can create an online checking account for free and I have not heard of anyone's personal info being stolen. 
So you just send your bitcoins to your Coinbase account, sell them, and they deposit the proceeds into your bank account. 
You can also use bitcoin ATMs but their fees are very high.

I talked to a gold dealer who said that the price of 1 oz. gold coins is down a little because of a minor market flood. More people than usual seem to be selling their gold Eagles and Krugerrands and he didn't know why. I said maybe they are shifting from gold to BTC, but he looked at me like I had two heads. He didn't understand cryptos at all.

Many investors believe that a financial crisis will increase demand for Bitcoin and drive prices up even faster. We have seen this on a small scale here and there, such as in Venezuela.

I love these. It's a great reminder how far away we are from mass adoption. In a few years I can absolutely imagine all these people saying "I wish I bought when it was under $10,000."
