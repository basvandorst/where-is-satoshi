People downvoting you do not understand the importance and truth of this;
The controls and safeguards that governments and banks use do not lend themselves to anonymous decentralization.

&lt;+theymos&gt; says copumpkin: lol, I'm the mod of that reddit, too, so I could also ban him there. :)
&lt;+theymos&gt; says I originally banned him for 2 days for persistent off-topic replies. Then I increased it to 7 days when he evaded his ban. Then when he continued trying to evade his ban (and asked to pay for "full immunity from your petty rules") I permanantly banned him.

Did you not lock your wallet? 
Here's where your coins ended up: 
Looks like probably some malware programmer. You should probably nuke your PC.

bitcointalk speculators were all convinced the rise made sense. Or at least all of the idiots that posted did.
I thought it was funny.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:37:27
Gone forever.
You gotta imagine that a significant amount of bitcoins have been lost.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:19:50
Interesting...Aren't those not supposed to be out yet?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:56:51
I doubt it was "routine."

At some point the ASICS will completely dominate the field to the degree that anyone doing 'normal' mining will get nothing at all. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:31:14
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:30:14
Yes. I don't see why that's an issue.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:49:45
Maybe not in mining, but there's a huge subculture of young dudes making fortunes (lol) and a lifestyle out of making money digitally.

I agree that measurements always have some level of noise, but upvotes/downvotes really aren't comparable to real life.
It'd be like taking your observations then adding random values to them. (although, they're obviously not random.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:39:54
I think that it would be unwise to buy for a while when the exchanges are all in such bad shape.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:47:05
Stolen in the same sense as having your password stolen (which then leads to the theft of your money from your bank account) when you are stupid enough to download malware.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:33:47
During? More like after.
But yes. It's not as if the coins are going to lose all value for a while. due to SR, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:35:41
0/10 troll.
Nobody is that stupid.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:01:30
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:44:59
Yes, it's a crash. Things just move really fast in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:35:38
Take the average of those two.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:07:01
I think that if one cryptocurrency attains worldwide acceptable, that would not occlude others from rising as well. If anything, it would increase their validity -- assuming they could be freely traded with the primary.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:39:18
Some vendors are trading -- but that's because SR provides hedged transactions (for a fee) that guarantee a certain price no matter how volatile bitcoin is.
Non-hedged sales would be stupid.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:39:26
Should have just made them up. They'd mean just as much.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:45:36
Well, obviously if it goes down that far a buy is a good move.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:34
That it's hard to read. Holy shit.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:23:49
Do you have access to how much power they're drawing?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:50:50
If they're only running at 25.2 GH/s, then they certainly aren't at 10k GH/s
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:58:19
The megaupload one had the megaupload logo.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:38:33
Upvotes/downvotes on submissions mean nothing. They're fuzzed.
 You might as well just make up your numbers.
You should have made comments for people to upvote/downvote.

SR's bitcoin rate / $ is probably pegged against mtgox, although I don't know off the top of my head.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:55:58
Yeah, I'm totally certain that a bitcoin address with 0 transactions is legit.
lol. If anyone falls for this they are retarded.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:00:55
It likely wouldn't have mattered if you've got some keylogger on your machine -- if that is indeed how you lost your coins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:27:05
Bitcoin can only be adopted in places with technology throughout. Although, places like Nigeria probably have lots of people who are playing with bitcoins.
The problem with bitcoins, that most enthusiasts recognize (but ignore?), is that they're really only used for drugs &amp; illegal trade. Bitcoins will go nowhere until there are legitimate ways to spend them -- and more importantly, ease of purchase. At the moment going through exchanges is a huge wall to adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:40:39
So many suckers. 
Sorry dude, you bought into the hype if you actually though they were gonna rise after such a ridiculous spike.
Regardless, the currency isn't going away. It might take a while, but eventually it will surpass $250 again.
