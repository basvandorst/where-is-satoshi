This is the longest bull run I can remember, just need to stay calm through the corrections just like when we were approaching 9k
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:44:43
2018 is starting to look worth the pain now
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:33:08
Agreed, sleep is harder in a bull market for some reason!
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:44:51
Still panic sold 5% of my holdings as it fell, this tension is testing me, 2 years of hodling discipline out the window in one crazy day.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:49:15
I know right! I thought I was strong, guess I need to lay off checking the price every 4 minutes.
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:51:54
For most people its a case of what level of profit theyre prepared to lose before panic selling.
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:15:18
I think they mean as an investment your percentage returns this year beat any stock investment
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:52:47
Patience and strength are needed at times like this. In 6 months you'll be one of the lucky ones who got in under 20k

At 3200 the true hodlers were prepared to go to zero
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:29:11
Yes, remember the vegeta memes started prematurely, took about a month to get back over 9k after the short orders were cleared out
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:02:14
I even had a dream about checking the charts last night. Price broke 9k then zoomed to 20k then down to 3k then up to 200k, all in a matter of seconds. Dream became a nightmare when it dropped to zero and the charts said 'No data'. I knew I'd lost everything. Woke up and checked the charts in a panic, relieved.

We're in the institutions phase of price appreciation, hence the slower run up than the retail frenzy of 2017. I agree we don't want another retail frenzyin the short term, keep those institutional billions flooding in first.

That was such a happy thanksgiving weekend for hodlers
@_date: 2019-06-20 07:44:14
20k will be a special day but the bears will immediately drag us down a few thousand I reckon
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:18:13
Quite emotional for everyone who held on for dear life last year

9k a month to your bank account should be fine from an AML perspective. You could always speak to a manager in a branch of your bank, or open an account at coutts and co they only open current accounts with 50k balances but should be able to help you.

We all need to feel a burn to learn and earn
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:23:09
Just be aware you are buying at a 13 month high, we could easily see a brutal pullback at any moment. If you are serious about hodling you have to be able to stomach those 40% drops and resist the temptation to get out! Also only invest what you would be prepared to lose i.e. don't remortgage the house
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:54:41
Try buying only when the price is falling, don't be tempted to jump on the bull's back mid-charge

Oh you're right, I only got in in mid 2017
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:09:48
Remember a few weeks ago when 7k was a big deal?
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:37:53
You'll sell at the first dip after breaking 18k, better than watching a return to 6k!

You paired up with a UK bank yet? I'm sure monzo would be keen
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:31:12
No need to panic, we'll see 9k again this summer
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:37:48
But would you have cashed in that 25k? You're one of the few who has turned paper gains into something tangible.

Every novogratz interview on youtube, he makes you believe
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:36:13
Totally agree but the hard part is sticking to your sell point when prices are rising! Fomo affects those who hodl as well as those on the sidelines. Probably better to aim for a figure that allows you to buy something that will appreciate, like a limited edition watch or vintage car. Meantime keep your initial investment in and forget the charts for 10 years.
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:15:19
No sell till 20k
