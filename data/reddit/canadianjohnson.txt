Your comment would have more weight if you didn't remove my post asking about censorship.

True enough, I did call "bullshit". And you were answering my question, which in hindsight would have been helpful if I let you answer before getting upset at how you removed my post. See, in my world I believe a discussion in a large community is benefited by THE COMMUNITY. All those different point of views right? So it was nice that you, and you alone decided to answer my question, but what about the other voices? See how I can perceive this as censorship and counterproductive to my goals of actually having an in depth conversation about what is going on? Can you actually see my point of view or are we both too divided now and can't possibly be kind to each other?

So far from what I've gathered, the potential for Bitcoin to reach a wide audience has been hampered by high transaction fees and slow confirmation times on the blockchain. The blocksize was not increased due to fear of potentially doing it wrong, so solutions for this have been proposed, meanwhile the "bad experiences" are piling up for anyone who wants to use Bitcoin on a daily basis (ie a truly digital cash with low fees and fast transactions). This appears to be, from a marketing perspective, the worst kind of marketing you could do to promote a brand that inspires the whole world to participate in an uncensorable peer to peer digital currency. Am I missing something?

So far, this is how far I've gotten. You've pissed me off after a simple question looking for discussion. I believe I know where I stand in the argument - although it would have been nice it, you know, my question and post was allowed to be... commented by multiple people with multiple points of view? Is that too much to expect? Apparently. My suspicions about this subreddit being a censored little bubble have been confirmed. Whether that was your intent or not, you are not going to win this debate like this.

Sorry but I just searched for my submission here on r/Bitcoin and it's not showing up when sorting through new submissions. I call bullshit.
