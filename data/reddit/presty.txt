if he had earned euros, it wouldn't have been "a bit more", it would've been A LOT more (~57k usd)

what do you mean by this?

Yes, it's true that Blockchain has announced that they are profitable. Their source of income is advertisement. They happen to have a lot of pageviews (having the explorer gets you that) and a lean operation.
But I'd say that whatever they are making is probably a bit far from what the world's largest exchanges are making (at least in revenue, since I assume Coinbase is doing a lot of reinvestment).
Seems to me that Blockchain has ambition and this "acquisition" is a step towards a more profitable business model.

Then the Bay Area is tax evasion haven, considering the number of places there that don't take CC. Not!
I'd love if all those places that currently only take cash, would add btc as an alternative

so, how much did you end up paying?

For now. While most transactions cannot be made through Bitcoin. But given time and adoption penetration, why convert?
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!

I don't think Github shares the number of times a repository has been cloned or files have been downloaded from it

TGW is one of my favorite shows and I was positively impressed  by that episode when it was aired.
They seem to have good technology related consultants. Bitcoin, Anonymous, "Chum Hum", Zack Florrick being pretty good with computers, etc :)

Oh please, if you ever saw how the computer systems of most banks work, you'd be frightened.

some ideas:
- buying stuff in india and shipping it back to you is one way (import/export)
- another possible way would be by selling INR to tourists, e.g. tourists give you euros or usd, you buy btc, sell btc for inr, give inr to tourists - it doesn't have to be purely cash, imagine that you run a travel agency, so hotel booking, transportation, etc that can be paid in advance for the tourists can be a way of using the INR
given how big the Indian diaspora is, I reckon they are probably already doing these things or something similar (e.g. using btc as a remittance vehicle for sending money back to family)

We did not go into defining active projects (what does that actually mean? I could've finished coding a library for bitcoin a year ago and it might be pretty used today, but it probably would not count as active anymore) but we do have a chart (not included in the blog post) that counts the number of daily updated repos 
as you can see, bitcoin projects have started picking up steam since the 1st bubble

Well, you should never look at one number by itself. We believe that all of these metrics can give you some general overview of how things look like.


That's true.


And you can do that with Bitcoin Pulse :)
