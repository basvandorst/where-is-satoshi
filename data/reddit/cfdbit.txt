I don't think you're going to find many willing to provide official financial advice, but a very common mantra heard around here is don't put any money into bitcoin that you would at all feel bad to lose. Go into it knowing that it's very speculative, volatile, and don't gamble anything with importance on it.  Good luck with your recent issues.

taking a page from legacy payment processors promotional activities (thinking Visa, etc)... maybe somebody should go on campus and offer to give away trinkets or souvenir items (Georgia Tech branded stuff, because students actually want it) and then have it co-branded with Bitcoin, or have it come along with a small amount of bitcoin to get started.
@_date: 2014-07-22 00:46:03
I got a similar sense that there's no way a Bitcoin doc can be timely for too long. I think over time there might be more stories to tell with bitcoin and more documentaries. Nobody ever said there had to be only one. Indeed the scope of this one was wide so it did cover a lot. It featured a lot of the big names in more personal ways than I thought it might: Karpeles, Ver, Voorhees, Shrem, and Jared Kenna were among those heavily profiled. It actually did talk about the fall of Mt Gox extensively. Showed the bankruptcy press conference, people protesting outside their offices, etc.

It seems that mainstream proponents realize Bitcoin is somewhat fragile and early-days still, so they wisely downplay its value as a currency because they're afraid of it getting broken by too many transactions coming online all at once or some other volatility inducing event. Also it sounds a little less insane to talk about the technology as it does the exponential value growth. I'm sure the exponential steps are frightening to those with venture money tied in and they want to protect those investments.

I hear you, lots of other stickers out there are way cheaper. But if you wanted to order just one like this from a printer it would be $25+ shipping. 
I put a good deal of time and effort into getting it just how I wanted it so figured I'd charge for that while still making it less than ordering just one would have been. I'd be open to possibly lowering the price or offer a volume discount though in the future if the market demanded that. 
I figured that it was worth charging for the effort put into making it crystal clear what the product was, including good images, very accurate and detailed descriptions. That took some time and I felt would have saved me a lot of time if I had found an option like that before buying others I wasn't particularly satisfied with. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 18:48:29
agreed, why doesn't bitpay just make a selectable option for merchants to choose what decimal places they want to use (or they could make "bits" a default, but make the others still available) and let the marketplace decide?

To add some context to where I think Thiel is coming from, during the early period of PayPal when he was in charge they focused heavily on winning the overall market share of internet payments users, particularly focusing on their share of overall eBay auctions merchants. The idea was: it's not the internet's payment winner until it wins the market, beating X.com and the others. (According to the book PayPal Wars.) So he probably figures bitcoin hasn't accomplished anything like this yet.
What PayPal lacked was being truly their own currency, which all would agree PayPal is not and bitcoin is ... Yes it is volatile but its value floats independently of any other currency.
All that said, I also was initially surprised with his comments since I actually feel like it functions successfully at some level as both otherwise people wouldn't choose to engage with it as both. But since he was asked how does it succeed, it makes more sense given his definition of success.

I'm sure search integration is on the product roadmap. I think it makes sense that they would need to have the voluntary "Accepts Bitcoin: Yes" flags out there and promote the existence of this to their merchant community first before it would be meaningful to enable search for it. Ideally I was hoping for it on this initial release too but am understanding of the iterative approach.
@_date: 2014-07-22 00:53:12
Lots of profiling and informational about 'what is Bitcoin' with good graphical explanations. Think the weusecoins.org video on high quality production level steroids. The profiling was like dropping you into the daily life especially the extended profile of Shrem and BitInstant. Took you from nothing to his arrest so I'd say they profiled that group the most. Every few scenes there was a price ticker update in the bottom corner of the screen which I didn't particularly like because I felt it emphasized the price bubble storyline. But then it is called "The Rise and Rise ..."
@_date: 2014-05-21 21:46:57
haha, well actually I do think there's a decent chance he might say something like "by the way, I still think Bitcoin's valuation is a bubble and would not recommend it as an investment over gold" ... but I'm interested in taking your bet but at a lower stakes level. I'm also curious to do a bet with bitcoin using escrow. How about 50,000 bits with your conditions?

This is a good idea, and I think it deserves to be part of a broader sustained Bitcoin Marketing effort. Bitcoin as an entity would benefit from having a holistic and positive advertising and PR strategy in place. The seeds of something like that were actually planted years ago with the Bitcoin Marketing Fund bounty which was won by the We Use Coins people, but then [spectacularly lost](
For anyone here genuinely interested in participating in this kind of effort, I recommend having a good familiarity with the ideas on the [Public Relations page on the bitcoin.it wiki]( which was initially created by Mike Hearn following [Gavin Andresen's "Public Relations" post]( on the bitcointalk.org forums back in 2011.
Having a broader effort that ideas like this could be a part of would be helpful because it would allow us to get more organized and work up to ideas like this. Eventually we could have multiple other well-defined public awareness campaigns in place as well, planned and executed in a professional manner. 
I know that reddit posts are good for talking about something for about a day or two and the they filter down behind the new stuff that bubbles to the top. Would anyone be interested in continuing this conversation on a new subreddit, a bitcointalk section, or otherwise?

While it may be a valid move and even true that things are lacking in transparency, it seems unfair to say such a statement without engaging in transparent discussion about the background or reasons.

Right, also mined coins are not immediately bought like these were. They sit with the miners until they decide what to do with them. Buying this much on open market certainly would have bid up the price, not to mention all the other bidders who wanted them but didn't get them. Consider those unofficial unfilled buy orders. It will be after the DPR coins are sold that this unmet demand will spill onto the open market because they won't have any place else to go to get the big sets of coins they want.

It's interesting that people assume his stance is one way or the other. It would be interesting to hear him explain if his viewpoint has changed any in the last few months or what led to this change. I recall that initially people were surprised that he was not in favor of it because it seemed like such a good fit to his anti-fiat preachings. He seemed like such a potential champion of bitcoin. Perhaps people are hopeful that maybe he has come to his senses.

Doesn't this create major headaches for the merchants affected? It would make sense for more to accept Bitcoin as a response. It seems like multiple possible wins: show they are ready to embrace the security benefits it can bring, educate their customers who don't already know about it about bitcoin and general personal digital security, and give their already bitcoin-aware customers the opportunity to avoid participation in these breaches in the future.

One reason for at least some alternative crypto-currencies is to have an alternative secured mining infrastructure in case one gets compromised or has an issue, then it's not like the only fallback is fiat. for consumers / merchants it could be seen as diversifying holdings or integration capabilities.

No, your debit/credit cards don't entitle you to ownership of your money like Bitcoin private keys do. Cards enable you limited and mediated ability to spend money from a checking account or a line of credit debt that is completely made possible by third party banks and payment processor companies.

I feel that as long as there's any shred of speculation involved, people should hold enough fiat currency to live while Bitcoin is still exhibiting volatility and as long as you have any speculative or uncertain feelings about it's value or viability. I always suggest only putting money into Bitcoin that you would not feel any personal pain or sorrow in losing, and treat it as a long term speculative investment. This is what I do myself.

I agree with most others that this is a good answer to the original question, but I have to take issue with what qualifies as a price driver. Everything is potentially influencing price. Frankly nobody can ever know what caused anonymous traders or the software operating on their behalf to click buy or sell. It may have been news, for all we know, but it may also have been algorithms, insider information, a fat finger, a vague change in sentiment, someone feeling a change in their personal aversion to risk, and many more possibilities. 
News is one of but many factors that can potentially influence the market dynamics. The market has an unlimited number of drivers at the wheel, to complete the driving analogy.

I wonder how much better though is resigning through a couple of vague tweets without offering backgroud substance or kicking off a dialogue.

At the Chicago conference yesterday Blockchain said they are working on a browser based HTML mobile wallet aligned with their new Android wallet to make this issue moot. It sounds as though Apple is trying to control where they allow bitcoin apps to be distributed due to various local laws, but these companies philosophically want to be worldwide and not limited in distribution by Apple.

Define control. If you believe Coinbase does a better job managing the keys than you might storing them on a single offline machine, then Coinbase may be your option. If you have your keys in a bank safe deposit box, what if the bank burns down? Nothing is absolutely perfect control.

was that in the recent Goldman report on Bitcoin? if not, link?
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:59:33
it says it's a referral agreement, so all that means is Bitpay now has a relationship with Global Payments to receive referrals from them. No hardware or software integration from what I can tell. Maybe down the line? This doesn't mean a lot more specific than that, but it is still big since it gets the bitcoin option in front of all of Global Payments's customers where they already have relationships. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:22:45
thank you for this response. How is it possible that you are at -5 votes? I'm going to start reading the ultra downvoted stuff because apparently that's where the best stuff goes. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:59:16
Couldn't Target educate customers about the security benefits of crypto-currency (i.e. being able to pay via public keys and not giving up personal info or private keys like credit cards do), and over time encourage more of their electronic sales to use the more secure protocol? That's what I had in mind. At least that Target or the media would consider this path.
Also I don't buy the Target is too big for it to be meaningful to them argument. As Patrick Byrne recently said, Overstock is only getting &lt;.1% of sales through Bitcoin but its a start that can only increase and is something available that would better serve customers.

I think this is the best answer so far, but I feel like a smart criminal would probably not steal all the bitcoin (and therefore my original question was too simplistic). A bigger issue would be if someone covertly steals bitcoin over a longer period of time, tricking the network and its users to think everything's ok and then improperly gaining. This could theoretically already be happening. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:31:08

what's telling is that people are more skeptical about a new protocol for transferring money than they are (or were) about a new protocol for transferring data. Money and ownership are more sensitive and personal than data sharing. There must be a good analogy for how all that complicated CS/Software works to help people better understand. We have to get away from accepting that it's a Comp Sci black box. It does help though that it has respected endorsements.

I feel like there should be a wiki page of "how much of my money should I put into bitcoin" and have it be very spelled out for different investor / risk profiles. This is such a simple yet easily mis-communicated thing that it would be helpful for there to be a link for the community to use repeatedly. If anyone knows of one already in existence please share. If there isn't one, I may create one later on the bitcoin.it wiki.

I think the connection between fines and violence is that if enough fines pile up, then what? At what point is there a warrant out for someone's arrest? Depending on the state, the law usually allows for this progression in some manner for law violation, which is generally the idea here. Though I agree jumping to "threaten us with violence" is a bit of an extreme path to go in talking about this, it's not entirely inaccurate.

there are so many things creating real short term downward pressure on the price, which others are mentioning here. So to me, this makes sense. All the news lately creates very long term demand for bitcoin, which is what eventually I would expect to pressure the value upward.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:35:09
I think the difference and issue is quality vs quantity ... something that the bitcoin community is going to have to come to terms with too ... changetip reply spam, 10 bit tips, and not using the 'private' designation are all things that might bother people. The dogecoin community's history and pioneering of tipping is very instructive here and should be noted by all.

it's worth noting that 1-800-Flowers.com is actually a family of gifting web sites (the company is not just flowers), which includes ThePopcornFactory.com. So now when there's big exciting bitcoin news and people need to bring out some popcorn, they can do that with bitcoin too.
"1-800-FLOWERS will be adding bitcoin as a payment option across its extensive family of gifting sites, including 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, FannieMay.com, Cheryl’s.com, ThePopcornFactory.com, 1-800-Baskets.com, FruitBouquets.com, and Stockyards.com"

It means Coinbase is building a good engineering team and they're keen to keep up with BitPay. Bitpay has their Insight platform ( and Coinbase had very basic ad hoc block exploring tools. Blockr.io is a good acquisition. What will be interesting is the things they're talking about building: a better API, a full node, etc. It means the VC investment money is being spend on building the right things, which is good.

Given the paradigm shift that Bitcoin is, I wonder if this all might become a constitutional issue.

I'm not sure how those exchanges measure up to BitStamp (in the view of Coinbase or BitPay), but I suppose alt coin support is an interesting area of exchange competition and I doubt Coinbase/BitPay are married to Bitstamp.

I ordered those as a test. They were ok but the quality wasn't what I expected or was looking for for a store front window. Most store front windows don't want a blaring white background with zero transparency, which is what that sticker is (I have it in person). No transparent background, not the actual promotional image with the recognizable gray and border.
That wasn't a bad option though.  The worst I found was some site where I ordered what looked like exactly what I wanted but it was actually delivered 2 weeks late and with the completely wrong stickers. I contacted support with no answer. I won't name names. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:28:13
totally agree. with all due respect to and all the excitement they've brought to the mass tipping concept, that thread over the weekend with tons of 100 bit tips felt a little like comment spam, many people thought it was a bot and were confused, and I'm not sure it had the same effect as something more meaningful such as what you describe. ... in short this needs quality over quantity.

Not to be negative, but the changetip tips they've been sent have been picked up immediately due to an already set up account.

@_date: 2014-07-30 20:31:33
yeah I initially debated what makes a company a bitcoin company. Does Gyft simply accept bitcoin? I think their integration is significantly deeper than simple acceptance for goods or services because they are accepting it for purposes of loading up a payment card as a way for money to be spent at other businesses, effectively enabling a big outlet for bitcoin owners to spend their money. definitely a gray area though, agreed. The more wave-making bitcoin company acquisitions will be if and when a historically non-bitcoin company acquires a company that does bitcoin-only focused work.

For customers using bitcoin the merchant no longer needs to secure sensitive payment information, in fact they don't even have access to that information. I haven't heard anyone claim that any of the businesses that have integrated with BitPay or Coinbase have taken on new IT security risks.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:23:42
there are a lot of hurdles right now for companies interacting with non-bitcoin alt coins simply because the ecosystem around those is not nearly as developed. At a recent conference, Charlie Lee was asked if /when Coinbase would start integrating with Litecoin. He said it would require an exchange to have the proper level of process / security, as BitStamp does in their view, to be able to accept and interact with it. He said once Bitstamp accepted it, he would "push some buttons to make it happen". So things like that need to go into place first, even for the clear second runner like LTC. Doge ... who knows :)

The video is also sponsored by Merril Lynch (Bank of America), so the tone is not surprising at all. 
If Peter Schiff is not purely trying to sell gold, he might eventually change his stance. He doesn't seem overtly dumb.
In this piece dated July 23 2014 ( "Investor Peter Schiff pointed this out to me last week. He has been a Bitcoin skeptic. Then he saw how his own clients can transfer funds while on the phone at near-zero cost without going through banks or other institutions. He was dazzled and thrilled."  ...

I think he was also having too much sway.

Charlie Lee (creator of Litecoin) works at Coinbase and in the past has said that Coinbase would add Litecoin support when major exchanges support it. The argument for Litecoin is that it's a separate hashing algorithm (scrypt) that secures the network, so it helps the crypto currency ecosystem diversify in case something ever happened to one network. Coinbase would benefit by being able to diversify coins and not rely entirely on the bitcoin network.

Add this to the list of what incumbent competition looks like. 
Interesting parts:
* co-opts terms like P2P. this isn't a P2P network, this is a centralized service. under this definition, all existing banking systems are P2P.
* claims that it's more appealing than bitcoin because people are more comfortable giving their information to their financial institution than many other types of entities. plays on uninformed users' fear. 
* emphasizes a minute length transaction time (much like bitcoiners cite the 10 minute settlement stat)
* overall the launch is clearly devised to claim a presence in digital payments and muddy the language to those 
* launch partner with Berkshire Hathaway (meaning, Warren Buffet)
* the Youtube video drips with similarities to the We Use Coins "What is Bitcoin" video in style and content: 
* no way to sign up right now... all you can do is go here: 
* United States only
* prevents money laundering by "border blocks", but yet claims to be built for the world's unbanked
* here's the actual product landing page:

I think it's possible to be a more deliberate choice than simply confusing bitpay with bitcoin. For general user interaction, it's an interesting test to see if people want to treat the bitcoin option as another option to a PayPal/Amazon/etc account, in which case calling it by the payment service in use, BitPay here, makes sense. Maybe this is overthinking it, but who knows.

I think this naturally evolves over time with cultural uptake / need, no need to force it. the longest lasting fiat currency is only 27 years (with some obvious outliers ... British Pound Sterling is oldest at ~1200 years) so as a world community we don't have much experience with this in general. For those that have been around, there are dozens of colloquial nicknames, so I don't expect society to have a hard time figuring it out:

who wants to start a fund to do this? how would ROI be measured? It would be interesting to test out $30,000 for a month and send traffic to bitcoin.org to see what actions or new user acquisition it could drive for the community. Rather than buying big head terms like "how to send money" on broad match, it probably would be better to buy longer tail exact match keywords to save money and get more qualified traffic. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:32:09
The SERP is inclusive of paid and organic results, so both warrant discussion.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:22:45
The idea is to spend funds on bitcoin awareness campaigns and at a bare minimum use the data generated to inform the community on user searches while driving new user acquisition. And no we probably don't start at $30K on a single keyword. The keyword "how do you send money" I agree would have no intention to actually convert into direct low funnel ROI for anyone. This would be about upper funnel awareness. If the community has no appetite for funding something like that, then it wouldn't fly. But surely we can test something. And while there may not be bitcoin.org analytics metrics available initially to such an effort, I think offering paid ad query data (something you can't get through organic search  referer data anymore) would be an even trade to whomever manages bitcoin.org in exchange for being able to view analytics engagement reporting. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:33:15

I respectfully disagree. This regulation cost is about being a custodian of others' money regardless of which currency. Coinbase is in some ways a bank that handles others' money and I think we should want organizations that want to do that to be held accountable by some kind of oversight. If Coinbase dropped all but their multisig products, so that they're no longer custodians, maybe they could avoid these costs. Not saying that is an easy path forward, but you can certainly start a bitcoin startup without being an MSB.

As I'm sure you know, analytics packages (GA included) do not require the only users with access to be site owners, though they would be needed to assist with enabling access. 
Your experience seems to come from a direct response world where revenue based ROI is the name of the game. Nothing wrong with that but there's more out there especially when you're talking about entities that need branding and awareness. 
I agree with you there shouldn't be any money thrown away. There would have to be some learning, value, new data to use in return. We don't want to make toilets rich.
@_date: 2015-04-04 07:09:40
I would certainly want to do this in a simultaneously transparent and valuable way to the community. Open to suggestions on how to best achieve both, handle funding, etc.
I could post screenshots of AdWords billing and the campaigns themselves as proof of the campaigns existence / functioning so that donors had confidence in how the money was being used (I'd put it on imgur or something). We could also do ad monitoring on live search result pages to verify they're actually running. I would also be willing to donate some of my own money into this to get it started. I don't need a large budget to get things active. But growth in the future also sounds interesting and competing with western union and others would take serious money once you start thinking display ads too in addition to search ads.
Anyone interested in working together to develop the details with me, let me know.

The data won't show on the bitcoin.org/stats page. That page is running a very basic stats.rb script that basically reports pageviews from server logs.
I just investigated and setup an automatic Adwords to Google spreadsheet report plugin (supermetrics.com). Probably doesn't constitute absolute proof, but it is a unique way to publish public daily report data.
Here is the report:

What major harm would there be if such a test were run and utterly failed? I don't see much downside other than my own lost donated time and the money of donors who presumably would have donated if they thought it was an idea worth testing / learning from. I welcome any criticism or feedback you have on the ideas, and I've seen other posts you've done recently such as your AMAs on digital marketing where you have generously offered your insights.
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:27:40
Correct, this is why you'd really need analytics data to guide any such effort. Who is to say that can't happen?
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:25:33
I don't think there's any harm in agreeing to disagree, but at least we can agree that: 


What I think you may be missing is assessing who is qualified to do it in this sort of environment. Google would not stop me from driving traffic to Bitcoin.org and I would expect that whoever can claim ownership to the Bitcoin.org site would not petition Google to halt the free traffic coming from an outsider's account. If people went around telling themselves "I should not be the one doing this" then we wouldn't have much of a community here or anywhere in the world for that matter.
To quote from: 
"Nobody owns the Bitcoin network. As such, nobody can speak with authority in the name of Bitcoin."
Also, this certainly wouldn't be my first morning waking up and running ads ;)

Explanation of a joke kills the joke and makes it not funny anymore, but here goes anyway: guy on the right wants to avoid human contact and small talk and simply enjoy his coffee in quiet so his chosen means to accomplish this is to bring up complex fringe topics veiled as genuine small talk. Guy on the left immediately replies with a disinterested exasperation wall, quickly ending the conversation just like the guy on the right had wanted. It's funny because the guy on the right was secretly trying to bait the other guy into not wanting to talk by bringing up relatively complex / obscure economic fringe topics.
