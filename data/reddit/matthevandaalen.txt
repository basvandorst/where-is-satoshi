Always when btc dips, the tulip fanboys arrive, “told you so”. Man, put your head up when btc rises, why only pop up at these moments? Gold bagholder?

You guys are forgetting that mt gox people will not get the same amount of bitcoins back. So maybe if you had 6 btc you will get 1 btc back now. So why would you sell?

He is not serious, just a gold digger. FUDing crypto by “asking” questions.

Make sure you hide most of your bitcoins to monero before you divorce.

I love these “goodbye” stories. The more the closer to the bottom we are. I remember 2015 and all the “It will never work” talk here. It is called Capitulation
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:35:09
Indeed, it needs more than one lesson to get strong hands

So true , I think it didnt cover the ‘new asset class’ stuff, decentralization, the problems it solves for the unbanked or anything I love to hear A Antonopoulos talk about. Very shalliw and much attention for Charlie.

Stellar is also a shitcoin. Only BTC and maybe ETH will be very very valuable
