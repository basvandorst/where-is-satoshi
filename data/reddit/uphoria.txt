You made a dismissive claim about how difficult TOS's are, and applied it to Paypal, someone called you on your shit and then you tried to act tough instead of doing it because you are just like I said -
Smug asshole who regurgitates memes and reddit cliche's and doesn't actually give a shit to learn the reality of the situation. Its really no different than anywhere else, you just happen to be a shining reddit example of the "armchair ____" persona. 
Your reaction of blowing a gasket at me is right in line, I suspect as you hit this sentance you are already angrily trying to find a way to say something to debase me, and it will sound like your last blowup. 
If you don't want to get called on your shit maybe don't talk shit.

Then they file bankruptcy, their assets are liquidated and distributed and the most amount of debt they can pay-back will be paid. 
Its not a perfect outcome, but if the company has so many unhappy customers refunding them would bankrupt them, what do you want them to do? Are you trying to say that: robocoin is "too small to fail" - and you should protect them from bankruptcy? 
Who deserves to get shafted with a broken, and poorly designed "kiosk" and who deserves a refund?

I'm saying the error is grievous enough regardless of why. The facts about having to wait 7 days to be notified, having to wait 4 more days for a refund, and being barred from another transaction for 2 weeks is enough. 
He could have called, he could have contacted. He already waited 7 days to find out he won't even have his money back for 4. Why should he have to spend time on the phone to figure out why? 
Hes perfectly in his right to be upset about this situation, and to move on. Are you being paid to shill? What angle do you come from where people aren't allowed to express their discontent to move on?
Do you honestly believe he owes coinbase something? Why?

True, I was just putting context on the situation. He wasn't just a racist, he bought a newspaper to write antisemitic articles that he forced his dealerships to circulate for him. 
He wasn't the best man to trust when it comes to this stuff. He had a few really great business ideas, and other than that was not really a great man.

he's so entitled for choosing to do business elsewhere. 
he totally owes coinbase his business and him choosing to vote with his dollar makes him entitled.

Honest question - Why don't you put the orders in collections? I know a lot of sellers that immediately sell the fraudulent chargeback to a credit agency to destroy their ability to keep doing this.

TPB has been offline several times, their leadership jailed, and their servers hastily moved and finally their entire website converted to magnet links to avoid the hassle of their services being taken again. 
Its not really an apt or realistic comparison to say that TPB has been 'stable' for any real amount of time. 
Add that to the fact that TPB has always tap-danced around the law, where-as black-market trading is very clearly illegal.

You really have made your favorite little strawmen to fight. your analogies are totally off-base and insulting. 
A guy being accused of fraud after 2 years of solid purchases is insulting, and if there are competitors he is entitled to try the competiton instead because he is upset.
You act like he is SCREAMING at them, and calling them names. he wrote out his story, He was very articulate and didn't resort to name calling, and said "being considered a fraudster after 2 years is insulting, and I won't do business with a company that is willing to level that claim against me". 
Stop acting like this is some /talesfromretail story. how much more passive can OP get about his decision to move on?
Also stop with your false equivalence bullshit about "a little screw up" - if they had not processed his payment because of a fuck up, that's one thing. Calling you a fraudster is NOT a little screw up. stop acting like it is. 
If you shopped at the same store for 2 years, and one day the manager tells you to leave because he things you are a pickpocket, you probably will never ever return. You will tell your friends about how you were treated, and you will move on. Stop acting like this is any different, or are you just a coinbase apologist?

When you are the only payment processor on 90% of websites, you do what you want. Paypal is Comcast for payments.

@_date: 2014-08-27 19:07:19
Yeah, but when it becomes Bitpay vs Paypal, they have to compete, instead of it just being Paypal.
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:33:18
That's a false equivalency. This would be more like you going to Target instead of Walmart because your card got declined. 
At the worst its an inconvenience, but its that or sit and deal with the store manager and you still might end up without a purchase and having to go next door. He chose to just walk out and go next door. In his case, he told the people on the way out that he was going next door because they declined his purchases after 2 year of faithful patronage. 
It happens every single day in retail, why anyone in this thread thinks it doesn't is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:18:29
I think you are over-reaching it here. If a company has either failed to receive, or failed to receive a working unit in a reasonable amount of time its a breech of contract. If anyone else is in the same position they deserve a refund. 
That said, if the ATM is simply not making money, those people won't get a refund as there is no breech. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:00:50
No it isn't. All of these letters admitting fault will be great for anyone seeking a refund.

you still need to find money recognizable enough for that.

I think the problem is with false promises. How many times have the public at large heard a company say "we promise, this was a one time thing and we will make it better"?
The total lack of follow-through by entities like Robocoin on up to Comcast has put consumers on a "Trust once, and never again" defensive. The only way to stop a company that treats its first customers like shit is to not let them get second customers. 
Business is business, people are people. The people can learn and find new jobs, the Business and its practices can fail. 
Bitcoin itself is a great example of predatory start-ups. No one in the community has been vindicated by trusting a company after it faltered.

google bans the use of their wallet for currency exchanges and purchasing virtual currencies, so no matter how you class Bitcoin, its against the rules to buy/sell.

Again, if you can't manage (the keys for) encryption on your data (which I assume you plan to encrypt your data before uploading it to the could) another way, then a safety deposit box is a sound way to do it. 
You can place the encryption keys, or the strait bitcoin key(s) in the vault.
Some people use multiple - They keep their master keylist in their SDB and their own copy on hand on their personal computer. They also have a home safe. Their data is also online in an ecrypted file that they remember the password to. 
To some extent you are trusting a 3rd party, but that is the cost of securing your data unless you own 2 physical locations.

god I hate kids who break down posts. Form your own cohesive statements, and stop trying to strawman points. It looks and reads far better. 
That said - You not knowing about somebody does not a trend make. That's pretty telling hubris. a simple wiki search could have given you far more information than just telling yourself "If I haven't heard of it, its clearly not large enough" - because that standard isn't really objective. 
As to your question about publicity and hating corporations - no one else has this automatically jaded perspective where people are only in it for personal gain. Your post stuck out as a sore thumb. Being cynical and posing "what-ifs" does as much to disprove me as claiming outright "nuh-uh".

Your international credit rating goes down, the borrow ceases to borrow you money, and sanctions are imposed that prevent trade with your nation. 
This is all standard and requires no military. 


No it does not. Thuggery does not sustain an economy, and your theory doesn't explain the lack of PPP in the Yuan and Ruble.

We aren't talking about some minor situation where some guy got pissed off over a 10 dollar order.
A guy with a long-standing relationship is treated like a fraudster for no reason, and forced to wait for their money to be returned in several days. 
Frankly as the business owner you can call me a self-entitled little cuntbag but you can do that without my money in your pocket. lose enough of us and you can shout how "entitlement" ruined your business.

These comments are nothing but people who chose to selectively buy with bitcoin shitting on a guy for being selective where he buys. 
The op is entitled - entitled to spend his money as he pleases. He's not a douchenozzle for being upset that a he was caled a fraudster. 
these comments are full of people apologizing for coinbase and acting like the OP owes them something. 
Its a business relationship. Coinbase chose to handle their side of a 2 year relationship with a 7 day delayed canned-response email and a rejected transaction.
Why does HE owe coinbase a do-over? He can chose to go elsewhere instead. 
People here acting like a company that gets my money deserves my loyalty. its the other way around - I stay loyal if you treat me right. If you treat me like shit, its the perfect time to test the waters elsewhere. 
Brand Loyalty is dead. The brand doesn't do anything for you for your loyalty. Don't do anything for it. 
I bet half the people here would do the same thing, but they all want to be idealistic and pretend they would be calm and just say "oh, you!" and keep going.

currency is capped on almost all insurance plans. This stops people from claiming their house burned down "and so did that 100k they had stuffed in the mattress."
Bitcoin is a currency, so no dice. If you call it not a currency, its a digital asset that wasn't claimed on the policy before hand. 
Most insurance companies stipulate you serialize/catalog and submit your really expensive stuff if you ever want it replaced. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:04:32
Don't become the next guy to get in trouble with the law because you are making currency without being a mint. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:54:46
The problem lies in how you could legally define it. If you claim its NOT a currency, then you have to define it as something. If you define it as a currency, then its a currency exchange, and that's disallowed. 
All I was saying is that you have to call it one or the other, and both are banned, so there is no way to wiggle through Google's TOS.

They aren't evenly distributed, and that's normal. In the case of debt there is usually a hierarchy. I found out when my mom foreclosed on her house the bank that gave her the second mortgage got nothing from the foreclosure, and is forced to pursue her directly.

Maybe they downvoted because you are a cynical asshole. 
Major retailers accepting bitcoin is big news. Overstock.com isn't some tiny company that needs to stir the pot for marketshare - they have enough TV commercials running. 
The fact that you can go to a restaurant, buy a car, and order stuff online from an online department store using a currency developed using technology and math is big news. 
Stop trying to downplay the news because you hate corporations.

Paypal policy is to lock your account with the funds in it forever and you never get it back. THey keep your money. If you had 200k in there, paypal just made bank closing you down. 
ITs really in their interest to be total rule dicks.

A lot of people only take PayPal because they virtually cornered the market on online selling. 
Most merchants know taking PayPal is worse than taking a strait credit card, but it would be like running a shop that doesn't take visa.
I'm not saying they are all bad but let's not pretend business aren't forced to do things like that.

The price of gas changes twice a day. Stores change prices at least weekly. BitCoin is not a 200 year old currency mired in ledgers across the world. 
give it a few years to even out, and it will act like any other currency. I think the problem is historical and future falacy. The same argument used to say "it wont continue to rise like that" invalidates the point that it wont. Neither of us **know** what will happen, but if trends and history continue, it will continue to stabilize, and be a workable exchange medium.
Hell, currency exchange is a huge investment ticket, and trading 1 currency for another to hedge against stored value changes happens today. To say that other currencies 'don't fluctuate' is both disingenuous and over-simplistic.
