Give us the address so we can taint every satoshi in that wallet, for purposes of tracking down the owner and letting anyone he sends your winnings to know they have received stolen/contested property from an infamous dipshit.

When you welsh on a bet under a provably false pretense of being "unable" (when in fact merely \*unwilling\*) to pay, insults are just the beginning of what you "need."
Blame your parents for not giving you enough external discipline to develop self-discipline and thereby inflicting yet another gormless loudmouth spoiled brat on the world.
You will never again be able to make a single post without the community remembering and remarking upon your demonstrated lack of intelligence and integrity.

Just because you come from a place where it's okay to act like honor and integrity are optional, please understand the people who matter in this world (unlike you flotsam trash types) take the concepts seriously.
You are done on Reddit.  You will never live this down so don't even waste time trying.  We will hound you until you pay up or make a new account.  And no, nobody cares how unfair you feel that is.
Welcome to the stage of life where actions have consequences; time to grow up little snowflake.

you lost the bet.
now either pay up or delete your account.
you have more than enough BTC to pay up, so stop pretending you "can't afford to."

you were not only wrong you doubled down on your egregious stupidity in public and then refused to honor a previous commitment.
When you burn all your honor and integrity for the sake of being a loudmouth chucklefuck, it's time to either pay up or delete your account.
It costs nothing to make fraudulent bets backed by incorrect convictions.  You are a cheater and a liar and the world would be better off with you gone from it.  People like you are toxic pollution; radioactive trash which cannot be recycled and must be buried safely away from the rest of society so that we may enjoy nice things (like Honor and Integrity) without your free-riding mouth writing checks your ass refuses to cash.

The reason you are poor is that you are stupid.  You need to shut up and learn from those who know more, not make fake bets and then try to wiggle out of honoring them.
Claiming you can't pay when the blockchain evidence says you are a liar is the cherry on top.
Time to sell your reddit account or just scramble the password, because otherwise you will never escape the social opprobrium you have earned and have coming.

You can in fact "afford to pay" and we can all see the funds available on the blockchain.
Being *unwilling* to pay is not the same as *unable* to pay but you are pretending they are the same thing because you are a horrible human being in dire need of an overdue reality check and attitude adjustment.

You are still making the biggest mistake in assuming you can simply talk your way out of welshing on a bet.  That's not how this works.
You either pay up (even a 10% settlement would be OK) or face negative consequences.  This isn't a situation where you can tell Mommy "sorry I didn't mean it" and she kisses you to make the sad feelings all better.

The thing you need to fix is your propensity to tell lies, such as when you pretend being unwilling to pay your debts using part of the 1.85 BTC in your address is the same thing as being unable to pay.
You will find a way to pay, either honorably with BTC or dishonorably with a shunned/hounded reddit account that is widely reviled as the property of a lying garbage person scumbag.

I rly can't believe this fucktard zoomer thinks he can simply say the magic words
"but i was just playing...it wasn't for real...stop being haters...i dindoo nuffin"
and suddenly all is forgiven.  As if when you "definitely fucked up big time" saying *Ooopsy My Bad LOL* is all you need to do to fix everything and move on.
