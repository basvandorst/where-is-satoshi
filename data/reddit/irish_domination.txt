Yeah, ultimately the bad actor is the company, but users who continue to tolerate this behavior enable it. By continuing to use Coinbase, users implicitly signal that they don't know/care that this is being done, which means there is no incentive to change.

This is the same guy who advocated for deficit spending Obama's whole presidency, and then wrote columns talking about how the deficit matters again following Trump's election. He has published significant scholarly work, but his public presence is solely devoted to cheerleading for the establishment neoliberal Democrat party.

Funding of war is not done elusively by taxation. Loose monetary policy also plays a big role in allowing wars to carry on long term. The effects of monetary policy are very indirect, and so they create a lot less outrage at the government than high taxation does. Weakening the power of central banks absolutely will constrain (not eliminate) the ability of governments to wage perpetual war.

You could have all the hashrate in world, and if the coin you are mining lacks the fundamental characteristics valued by the market, its going to be more or less worthless. If the criticism of BU is legit and BU wins regardless, i could see this ending up as a very expensive kamikaze mission for BUs backers. Even if they can use their hashrate to commandeer BTC, they really don't have any way to make people use BU if it turns out to be a shitcoin. The remaining crypto market will move to a different coin with more resiliency against hostile takeovers and they will be left with millions of dollars invested in now useless ASICs.

This whole argument is confusing the value of a market for debt with the value of money that is borrowed into existence with interest owed on it. Loans and interest predate fiat currency by centuries. But even without debt markets it wouldnt be impossible to be unproductive and independent, you save more than you consume and just presume a 0% rate of return in your retirement planning. You end up having to save more of your money or retire later, but you still retire.

If you view decentralization of bitcoin as one of its significant virtues, then Wu and Ver are doing you a service here. They are highlighting a potential vulnerability (by trying to exploit it) while bitcoin is still relatively small. Even if the PBoC conspiracy theories are nothing more than theories, when bitcoin becomes large enough a government **will** try to take it over. If a mining collective is posing a significant threat to the currency, imagine what a central bank fully focused on taking it over could do. I understand there are many more issues at stake in this whole debate, but assuming this doesn't destroy the whole market for cryptos, I think bitcoin comes out of this struggle stronger and more valuable to its users (who are ultimately the source of its value).

As long as bitcoin operates in parallel to traditional financial systems, regulation is going to be inevitable, considering how heavily regulated the financial system is. When most people's wealth is primarily denominated in fiat currency, the government is inevitably going to be able to exert power over crypto by controlling convertibility.

If you're in a jurisdiction that has extradition treaties with the U.S. and you violated US tax laws you're not "safe". When you renounce U.S. citizenship you do need to file an affidavit that you are current with all U.S. taxes including the exit tax, so you would be committing tax fraud under US law if you don't disclose. You can gamble on not getting caught, but you aren't minimizing your tax hit legally by doing this, and the IRS could come after you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:24
Sure you can do that. But then your assets are trapped in a foreign corporation. If you take a dividend the proceeds are still taxable income.

Yes, even then they can gig you. If your assets are above a certain threshold, or if your average income is over a certain threshold the US will tax you an "exit tax" on the liquidation value of your worldwide assets. They'll fuck you one way or the other. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:27:00
This is not true. This would 100% be considered a "constructive dividend" by the IRS. Constructive dividends are taxable to the recipient and not deductible by the corp. The IRS often reclassifies corporate deductions as constructive dividends where shareholders of closely held corporations borrow money from their corporation to purchase personal items (i.e. a home, vacation, personal investments), use corporate assets for personal use, or lease their personal property to their corporation.

I totally understand when custom fees are not optional being angry, and every exchange should offer the option to use your own fee. However,  exchanges have to balance speedy confirmation against low fees in their auto calc. The PR for autocalculated fees leaving your BTC in limbo would be infinitely worse than fallout for fees ending up too high.

The concept of a currency not being a store of value is the product of inflationary fiat money. Sound money is inherently a store of value. Rapidly inflating currencies are always imposed on populations, they don't spontaneously arise. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:10:45
This is true, but foreign taxes are deductible against US taxes, so your total tax burden ends up being the US rate unless you are in a jurisdiction with a higher tax rate than the US rate. It's pretty brutal, and part of the many reasons why many US big companies re-domicile outside of the US. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:31:49
I'm guessing exchanges are going overboard on fees figuring it's less of a headache to have users complain about fees than it is to have them complain about unconfirmed transactions.

Being a store of value is an inherent property of money. The fact that fiat is continuing to show failures as a store of value is one of the reasons that people are seeking alternative forms of money.

Oh yeah, I'm not disputing that. I always understood digital gold to be a reference to it being a digital analog to hard money, not digital bullion to lock away. Even its speculative value is solely based on the expectation that it will prove to be a superior means of exchange to fiat, which won't happen if nobody spends it. It will be interesting to see how a possible deflationary spiral from HODLing will play out without any central bank being able to tamper with things.

What Nixon did was take the US off the the Breton Woods gold exchange system. Prior to this, the exchange rate among currencies was backed by gold. The US  would exchange gold for dollars at the rate of $350/oz, but this option was only available to foreign treasuries, not to individuals. In effect gold fixed the exchange rates between various currencies. The US government inflated the dollar supply beyond its gold reserves and had its bluff called by France. Basically FDR killed gold specie and direct gold conversion, but the final nail in the coffin of the gold standard was driven by Nixon.

They theoretically could get your information from an exchange, and see all of the addresses you sent BTC to from that exchange. It would be pretty trivial to show that the wallet you gave them contains only a fraction of your BTC purchases. If you move BTC around just to avoid this, they could probably put together a solid case for money laundering charges. At the end of the day, it will be much more difficult for the authorities to take your BTC against your will, since they can't just go around you and compel a 3rd party with no interest in resisting them. But they very likely will be able to determine what your BTC holdings are and punish you for disobeying a "lawful" order to turn them over unless you managed to purchase BTC from a source that isn't subject to (or ignores) KYC and AML laws.
