I've asked many shop owners most say similar stuff...they only recently got legitimate banking support and Operation Chokehold is still a threat, mixing in Bitcoin feels like painting a target for federal DOJ/DEA problems.

calm down...trolling gonna happen.  Bitcoin deserves trolls as much as any other popular subject on a public forum, let the mods handle it.  TBH though buttcoin used to have funny comical shitposting that made fun of bitcoin fanatics mostly...now it seems like people with strange grudges and emotional backlogs they need to work out for themselves.  I would never waste that amount of time applying my energy and focus towards something "bound to fail anyways."  Clearly they have as much a disconnect from reality as the very folks they satirize.
