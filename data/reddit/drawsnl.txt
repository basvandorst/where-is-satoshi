If you want to spend the money NOW it makes no difference, so why convert? If you dont want to spend now, its saving, so you convert..

apart from some nice visuals it's not insanely brilliant ...
@_date: 2015-12-08 08:31:43
you could try the hola chrome extension
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:21:18
Its also rational to not destroy the system you profit from, so I don't really worry about it..
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:59:40
thanks in advance ;)

how long did it take until you got it?

The important detail is to tip in other subreddits!
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:22:25
says it doesnt exist
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:36:29
No dont reinstall. Google for a tutorial to extract the keys from the database and save them somewhere.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:30:19
There is no built in function for this. But you can extract it from the apps database.
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:38:40
Actually its a "request" for clarification..
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:15:10
are universities in Austria/Europe included? We got a few under the top 500 but it seems my one is not working..
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:11:06
Maybe coinomat.com
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:10:19
CoinoUSD, BITusd, nubits.. i believe u can buy coinousd at coinomat.com with credit card

Forget the negative nature of shitstorms, it's a bitstorm! ;-)
@_date: 2014-03-30 10:51:04
can you buy it anywhere in europe? the 50$ shipping cost from the o'reilly website is a tad too much..
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:56:13
would be great to get a recording!
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:38:21
thanks anyways, i'm gonna have a look at it!
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:38:45
If you think about it.. a surge like in the last months would be strange if the market expects the etf doesnt get approved. So i share your concern.
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:43:30
Did the same for my little brother but only with 0.1 as I dont have so many. But he is still young so by the time he doesnt live with our parents anymore it might help him! spread the btc love ;-)

Thx for the link! i was too lazy at first.. Sent some

That's exactly what most people don't get..

Plan c is "investing" in social relationships, so when all systems crash you have a strong network of people with diversified skills(food production, tech etc) and therefore have basic things of living and u are able to survive.
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:28:45
Do you have a source for how the balance sheet of the banks are structured in terms of loans/investments etc?
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:47:08
This has nothing to do with gov debt. As stated above its about liquidity.
 The banks dont have enough reserves at the ecb to handle withdrawals. reserves at the ecb are the only thing they can swap for paper money and coins.. a gov. credit is another type of money(private bank issued), that cant be swapped with the ecb. The other thing that would give them more hardcash is if the ecb buys bonds/stocks from the banks... dont confuse 2 seperate money cycles
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:49:21
When a real crash comes property is not going to stay yours i fear
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:23:38
i'd happily pay for them storing my real money without claiming ownership on it, instead of giving them the might to create money out of nearly nothing.
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:17:47
Ah yeh exactly, so basically banks are ngos that only make profits to offer a free service.. what are fees for?
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:16:13
bought with bitcoin! thx
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:50:24
To me the next evolutionary step, after the rise of "platform" middlemen companies like airbnb, is to replace them with distributed, decentralized systems.. No more reaping profit by centralized entities 
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:54:38
I dont get why so many people have problems buying btc. There are fast services. In europe e.g. i use coinimal to buy bitcoin in 5 minutes. I believe there is something similar for us. Coinomat, but i never tried it. Maybe we need a list of fast and easy bitcoin purchasing services
@_date: 2015-03-06 11:51:10
I remember my grandcousin had one. It was so fascinating at the time :-)
@_date: 2013-07-09 17:08:51
thanks in advance!
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:19:21
i like bitstamp, sepa works very fast!
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:46:35
ppl look at the exchange with the highest volume, mtgox. there are some fluctuations between the exchanges, but generally it follows the same direction. at least if u mean price in $.
altho price = what someone is willing to pay for it....
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:37:54
what about all the other wallets + online wallets etc?
also u cant take bitcoin qt downloads directly. what about redownloads etc.?
your logic seems a bit vague in some ways ;)
BUT yeh, bitcoins are rare as hell!
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:15:13
add a "/" after faucet and it works
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:50:05
your laptop probably doesnt refund the energy cost for running it. and your gfx card is most likely very slow for mining.
ram cant do calculations, its just memory. they use gfx, cause its fastest for this kind of calculation.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:04:21
on android market yet?
gj btw, i like the idea!
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:33:42
Perfect! Now we know for sure its not cia ;-)

copied the explanation. wall of text inc:
Why are AMD GPUs faster than Nvidia GPUs?
Firstly, AMD designs GPUs with many simple ALUs/shaders (VLIW design) that run at a relatively low frequency clock (typically 1120-3200 ALUs at 625-900 MHz), whereas Nvidia's microarchitecture consists of fewer more complex ALUs and tries to compensate with a higher shader clock (typically 448-1024 ALUs at 1150-1544 MHz). Because of this VLIW vs. non-VLIW difference, Nvidia uses up more square millimeters of die space per ALU, hence can pack fewer of them per chip, and they hit the frequency wall sooner than AMD which prevents them from increasing the clock high enough to match or surpass AMD's performance.
This translates to a raw ALU performance advantage for AMD:
AMD Radeon HD 6990: 3072 ALUs x 830 MHz = 2550 billion 32-bit instruction per second
Nvidia GTX 590: 1024 ALUs x 1214 MHz = 1243 billion 32-bit instruction per second
This approximate 2x-3x performance difference exists across the entire range of AMD and Nvidia GPUs. It is very visible in all ALU-bound GPGPU workloads such as Bitcoin, password bruteforcers, etc.
Secondly, another difference favoring Bitcoin mining on AMD GPUs instead of Nvidia's is that the mining algorithm is based on SHA-256, which makes heavy use of the 32-bit integer right rotate operation. This operation can be implemented as a single hardware instruction on AMD GPUs (BIT_ALIGN_INT), but requires three separate hardware instructions to be emulated on Nvidia GPUs (2 shifts + 1 add). This alone gives AMD another 1.7x performance advantage (~1900 instructions instead of ~3250 to execute the SHA-256 compression function).
Combined together, these 2 factors make AMD GPUs overall 3x-5x faster when mining Bitcoin

my 1 coin ... :P
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:24:09
not that its that easy ;) but yeh i totally get your intention. i also believe in bitcoin, but i want to get more btc with the money i have, so i daytrade... been lucky up to now. gl in the future
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:51:18
They dont offer stop loss orders..
@_date: 2013-07-06 11:22:15
tbh, this is a pretty likely scenario... :(
The order book needs to grow a lot more in terms of volume but also in terms of traders.
as a result the market would be less volatile in the short term and manipulation would be a lot harder (require a lot more capital on individuals)
btw... you can see huge "fake" support/resistance if you follow the chart + order book
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:07:03
i think im gonna order some burgers today! (even tho im not hungry)
finally easy to survive on btc! =)
(in austria btw and i always thought we are a very conservative country)

i dont know whats wrong with you ppl..
just buy the btc you bought something with back with fiat and you dont loose any growth opportunity ... is it that hard?
now you can spend btc for everything that u want!
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:20:07
forgot to add.. bitstamp has nice quite high trading volumes which gives you a better representation of the market.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:54:10
1) yes
2) using the standard bitcoin-qt client/wallet
3) from your wallet
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:36:09
bitstamp works fine (EU)
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:49:33

I have over 10 years xp in webdesign, lately app design.. feel free to contact me when you have decided what your project is gonna be.
depending on the timeframe etc. i might jump in, if u need someone ;)
@_date: 2013-04-26 12:36:16
that was the direct link to the website.
you can find information and instructions here:
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:38:15
yeh, ment google play. thx for the info!
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:45:18
EU here
- SEPA works very fast with bitstamp
- nice clean and useful interface and stats
- you can add google authenticator 
- supports ripple
- limit buy/sell ofc..
- never had any problems and will stay there
but i miss stop loss orders..
id suggest you put 1 coin in or something and see how you like it ;)
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:10:16
open limit orders probably, that would get you out of fund if they get executed
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:37:04
sry... i had to
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:04:24
cant get it in my country :(
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:23:19
not new, i own 1 coin :P but i would pass it through to a friend who wants to get started.
requires trust tho, and this is the iweb ;)
anyways, nice play to get ppl started!
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:57:16
