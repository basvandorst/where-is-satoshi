Wait. Bitcoin's a girl?!?!? I thought it was a bubble...
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:33:52
Omg. I believe this shit. (Sarcasm)
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:05:27
Omg, I'm putting all my money in something I have no idea about. If people tell me they make millions, so can I!!
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:07:53
Trust me, coinbase support is just as bad
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:46:10
Changelly is challenged
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:26:53
And I get paid to shit post about bitcoin?!?!

I can't believe you're actually asking for investment advice on Reddit. First of all, 50 bucks... really? You might aswell burn your money with the horrendous tx fees. Not only that, but it looks like you don't have a clue with what you're doing...you haven't done any research, and you're probably investing for a profit in return (duh). 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:19:53
Dude, first of all. Avoid scams. Secondly, do your own research and don't do what people tell you to do. Did you hear about what happened to Confido? (Rekt)
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:28:08
Well, I don't think it's possible to make bad money, so yes.

I use my umbrella as my antenna
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:51:10
As you said yourself, you're new here. All you want are low fees and the least stress possible. I recommend you stay on coinbase and use GDAX or Bittrex for exchanges. 
You can use Poloniex and EtherDelta too. But I recommend you stick with plan A.

Still working for me
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:13:23
Just wait for a correction. It's obvious you are unsure about your decision making.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:31:39
I don't which is funnier : you being gullible or the person making people gullible.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:33:51
Wait after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:13:04
Bittrex or GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:09:09
I think it would be wiser if you didn't get your financial advice on reddit
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:15:00
Change exchange
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:29:33
You're always going to get higher fees with cards then with bank transfers. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:00:07
Why do people do this?
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:13:58
What are you going to hold in?
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:45:54
To be honest, I don't think so. Becuaee credit card companies have a standard fee required from the buyer. 
EDIT : correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:10:19

For the Netherlands. BitLite.eu
They are a company founded in the Netherlands, and can be used for all of Europe. It's pretty good

@_date: 2017-10-04 20:55:19
Yep. They do that because of the only news that everyone wants to hear is the bad one. Terrorists this, referendums that....it all is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:11:59
