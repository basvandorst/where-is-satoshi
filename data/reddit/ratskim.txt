Also, not sure what other people are thinking, but any of the exchanges not offering to in the very least credit BCC/BCH - irrespective of their intentions of trading it - will from henceforth be considered shady, and possibly fractional reserves :P
  
Thanks Jihan, still a dick though bro

Fake URL..
  
Are you hosting a dodgy wallet to scam coins, or shilling for someone else who is?
  
You have posted the same link in other threads..

I think what people mean when they say your BTC will 'lose value', is to do with the speculation on how much BCC is going to be worth.
  
So if 1 BTC right now is worth $1000 (for sake of ease), and BCC is speculated to be worth $500, the price of BTC is going to drop by that number; so also be worth $500 (your total wallet value stays the same).
  
Not sure if that is right, but it is my interpretation of what is speculated to happen. Hope it helps, or someone comes to correct me asap~ :)

I noticed you did not have Coinspot on your list, probably because it is a smaller/Australian exchange :P
  
But if anyone is wondering about their stance on BCC, this was posted to their (Coinspot's) Facebook page:
  
This is an update to our previous post about upcoming changes to the Bitcoin network. 
  
Bitcoin Cash (BCC) is a proposed digital asset that will begin on August 1st due to a “Fork” (UAHF) from the Bitcoin network. CoinSpot has been monitoring this situation closely and is taking all reasonable steps to ensure that customer funds can be preserved on both chains. Customers that want absolute control of this development should withdraw their Bitcoin from CoinSpot to their own wallet.

I had this exact thought! 
  
Might be a great opportunity to buy into BTC while others are buying into the newest BTC-Alt coin hype :)
