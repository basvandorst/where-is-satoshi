Is there any way i can speed that up or increase my fee now i mean shit i would give some $100 rn to get that transaction to go through. I was reading about double spending maybe? Do you have any knowledge of this?

Well i have always used 1 link for AB and its always been the real one, so maybe it wasn't credited in which case i hope that's resolved, does AB normally send your transaction somewhere else once its confirmed? The only thing that i would thing could be a potential cause was using viabtc accerlation service but that's it unless they can somehow phish me from there. I know i always use the righ AB site and all my transactions were made through blockchains mobile app so unless that somehow can get interceptepted really hoping its they didnt credit me

The Btc value im suppose to recieve of .103 is not appering in either wallets i did the transactions on blockchains mobile app to receive my money from buyer then send it to my wallet on AlphaBay. Its confirmed on my blockchain wallet it was sent from as of this morning, does not appear in my AB wallet though and no one was logged onto the account or i would've seen a withdrawal request from this morning which there was none its like the money was intercepted the second it got confirmed not the best way to start my morning.

In person from this guy i have gone through a few times he seems straightforward each time i have his phone number we have met a few times

AB  claims its not thier fault and i was phished or hacked but if i use their official links and never download anything how  does that work? I reopened a new ticket

By chance could the person i bought my coins from have done this i bought them in person? He sent them to my wallet then i sent them from that wallet to another.
