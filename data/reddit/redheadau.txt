@_date: 2017-04-30 15:27:37
how could you forget that spectacular collapse....this however is like death of 1000 cuts, delays, excuses and then the occasional glimmer of hope like  above, who actually got his money back
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:39:00
which one VicPOL, Austrac, AML
@_date: 2017-04-30 11:12:35

@_date: 2017-04-30 13:40:03
fingers crossed....but....seems a funny way to go about it though, if they were legit and serious about sorting this out with people they would be keeping people informed about what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:10:28
preety much

they might be a registered company but they registered under a bogas address, the company is pending DE-registered as a result of that and wind up notices filed with the regulator
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:38:07
yep join the crew, these guys are crooks
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:50:08
well obviously :o
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:40:56
considering it :) 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:39:59
the issue with civil suits at least in AUS is you need to provide evidence that the company has been physically issued the legal action....very hard to do when the company now has no physical address for the proceed server to attend
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:51:41
already done for the new company @ bitlio.com
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:37:56
ok not sure what that even means
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:42:01
already done, and yes the phone number thing is underway as well.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:43:13
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:42:15
yes it is....but preety hard to enforce a judgement against a company that basically doesn't exist at any of its addresses or send representatives to court
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:22:01
waste of fucking time, the aussie cops were hopeless, I'm owed about 40k as well
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:25:20
Hi All,
A warning to all BTC users do not trust  they are Igot.com.
Igot are a well documented scam, they still owe holders many millions of Fiat dollars and BTC.
Until they repay funds owed to depositors, I would be very wary.
I am owed a stack of cash and BTC so are these people 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:50:40
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:34:30
pick one what? An address? as already mentioned I've filed case on on three addresses and physical been to two associated with the company. no joy
Plus most of the time the court will not accept a case without delivery of documentation to someone at the listed address that is associated with the company.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:27:32
the site had a secure cloud wallet facility attached to your account.
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:57:48
how long ago did they say they were sending them to you?
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:17:59
do they have one up for  bitlio.com or just the igot.com facebook?
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:47:17
that day is coming my friend.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:26:48
there was NO other Australian sites at the time that had Australian bank accounts, BPay Number etc
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:48:29
working on that as we speak
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:30:24
um thats a pretty shit question, not really relevant here.
Due diligence was done.
ASIC Australian Registered company(check)
Australian bank account in correct business name (check)
Australian Tax registration (check)
Australian Bill Bay Code (BPay) only issued by banks to legitimate companies (check) etc etc etc
This issue is in the beginning these guys were fine, I did many small withdrawals and deposits in BTC and Fiat, without any delay or problem, this went on for two or more years with delays starting in 2015....so yeah

working on it with a number of federal agencies...its hard because don't really understand BTC, but they do understand breaking the law...which its very clear they have...the issue is enforce-ability and jurisdiction...as always the good guys are hamstrung by these things where as the bad guys are not
