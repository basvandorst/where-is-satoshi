good job! Next time someone says it has no value because it isnt physical/tangible, then answer them this:
What do you think that happens when you put money on your bank account? It becomes digital and thus not physical. Same thing goes for bitcoin. As long as you dont cash out from your bank or btc, your money or value is not physical.
Besides, since the internet has come up, the most valuable "things" now are company data. And guess what, NONE of that is physical... until your press print ;) And still the company would pay you big bucks if you had his data and they wanted it back.

really... You only realise it NOW that 90% of all products are made in china? Have you been living in a cave the past 10 years?.. Why bother convincing if you just realised this.. not worth the time.. Lets NOT convince you.
(Most bitcoins are in china, ofcourse the price is going to be affected if the government there says something about it.)

it really is good news for bitcoin. One, could speculate that the huge drops were caused by the chinese financial institutions and international/national business/customers doing business with those institutions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:20:51
Pick one...
EDIT: sorry, let me rephrase that by answering your question with another question:
Do you think bitcoin will reach 500.000 USD? I bet your answer is, I dont know. Well thats the answer to your question too. There are a lot of scenarios and nobody knows which one will be the right one.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:58:33
Ok, I understand your point of indirectly funding them. But what if the FBI says fuck you, we are not going to sell it and just keep it. I mean, they arent redistributing all the other stuff they have confiscated :) or am I looking at it from a wrong view?
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:56:38
To add another thing: We use bitonic.nl here in the Netherlands to buy and sell coins. And today I havent been able to buy anything at all! It is ridicilous, as soon as even 1 bitcoin is available, it will be sold within 3 seconds, YES 3 SECONDS MAX AND I AM NOT LYING :)

Do i need a Client for bitcoin storage/buying in?
YES, you need one to obtain the BTC in
Would you suggest getting a paper wallet or digital?
YES, as long as its a cold storage 
What is Coinbase used for? Is it a wallet itself or...? and 
would it be enough as a wallet?
YES Coinbase is a kind of wallet/client/etc
Where should i buy bitcoins as a european?
Where ever you can get them within your own country / or use an exchange
Where should i sell bitcoins as a european?
Same place where you got them or...?
How does the process of spending bitcoins work? (i assume that you combine multiple wallets with a client if needed and use the combined bitcoin to buy stuff)
Depends if you have multiple wallet etc..
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:32:43
correct me if I am wrong but isn't the large amounts of fiats currently in excistence also in the hands of a few? Even if the big amounts of btc are in the hands of only 150 people, then it still wouldnt imply that is not circulating because the rest of the btc's (in the hands of the many) are circulating and every day more shops are accepting it
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:38:42

I am not sure If I answer your question with this, but ill give it a go. You are right that bitcoins are made of "thin air". But the thing is, lets say you buy 10 bitcoins in your wallet. Now you have something that is made out of 1's and 0's, thus not being physical. But, if you print a paper wallet and store those 10 bitcoins on that. Then you have something physical AND who has certain value. You could think of it like you are the FED, and you can print your own money. Therefor, you are the bank. The backing up of bitcoins actually DOES exist, it is called... wait for it.... YOU :D and every other person in the world that use/has it.
Perhaps this example will help:
Microsoft has 40 billion in his bank account. This 40 billion is actually worthless until they cash out or pay bills with it. Before that, its all digital and made of "thin air"
I am a IT professional and my expertise is Project Management. I have been studying IT since day 1. In my opinion, everybody who still says that something only has value if its physical, is an absolute retard dinosaur who still doenst understand and see what IT has done to the world. Nothing is physical anymore. Things that are NOT physical are worth MORE then things that are. For example: Adobe photoshop is not physical, but it does cost 1k+! Try buying shares in whatever company you want, NONE of it is physical, but it does hold value?
Please correct me if I am wrong and sorry if I went off-topic XD

They are a little bit late since these expensive videocards don't have a high enough GH/MH per sec. and the amount of watts needed is huge compared to ASIC miners.

yes it does. The same goes for every other currency that is increasing in value, others will have to go down for it to rise. same goes for bitcoin.

Hi ax18,
1. take a look at mt.gox website, I am not sure but I think that they have that information on there somewhere. Plus its also the place where you can buy your bitcoins. 
2. Its legal 
3. Let your girlffriend make a an account at the US bitcoin exchange, she will get an bitcoin adres to use. And then its your turn, you send the money (in bitcoins) from mt.gox to the bitcoin adres of your girlfriend. She in turn, when she recieves the bitcoins, will trade the bitcoins for dollars on the same website where she made the account and supplied you with the bitcoin adres.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:46:06
even without keeping the degradation of your hardware in mind, the amount of electricity consumed is higher then what you would recieve in bitcoins, and the Kh/s is alot lower then the cheap asic mining hardwares (usb's and stuff)
Hope this helps to answer your questions

yes you are rich IF you cash it out. And you should listen to Niktator about putting a mark on your head by publishing your amount of bitcoins. If I was a hacker, then I would be hacking you as we speak..

NO, you will NEVER get any profit out of it. PERIOD.
Even if you had 1 billion years, the way bitcoin is designed, you will never ever ever ever...eeeh ever.. get profit. The mining pools and specialized equipment beat your laptop by at least 1000 times

The website is in dutch, so use Google translate if you need it. Here in the Netherlands it is a national newspaper. It is basically saying that the price of Bitcoins is almost equal to the famous Apple shares :)
Actually, btc is higher then apple shares right now, but its about the point being made
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:32:08
I am not sure if this implies to all piratebay websites, but the ones we have here in the Netherlands are now accepting bitcoins as well as litecoins? Is this for the charity program or?
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:28:26
Google will adopt it if Bitcoin goes more mainstream and reaches a bigger (organisational) audience. This is yet another question about Bitcoin and the all-mother-answer to all future related bitcoins questions:
"Nobody knows.."
Google already has the reputation of "going where no man has been before" and thus being innovative. But to answer your question, if lets say Bitcoin becomes as "known and used" as Paypal, then they will definetly implement it.
EDIT: perhaps they are working on it right now ;)
