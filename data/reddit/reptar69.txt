Yeah I definitely think this is one of the best means of "advertising" for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:55:18
I definitely think that having others see us tipping one another would be great exposure. Personally, tipping on Reddit is one of the most unique and interesting parts of Bitcoin.

Hi. Have you heard the word of Satoshi?
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:54:24
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:53:36
So what's the best way for me to get into bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:51:37
It is pretty irrelevant to bitcoin. Judging by his post, it seems like he would have done the same thing regardless of what currency he had. Just a gambling addict.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:20:50
Thank you! Of late, this subreddit has gotten more and more radical. I definitely don't mind people advocating for bitcoin but lately it seems like it's gotten out of hand. They're going to scare away newcomers.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:19:49
I'll sell for 200
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:50:43
Doesn't Facebook have its own virtual currency though? I think if Zuckerburg saw the need for a cryptocurrency he would use the one they already have.

11 ET?
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:16:18
Great idea, I've been looking for something like this and my bitcoin hoard is burning a hole in my pocket.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:26:25
Hah apparently the bot doesn't want me to have any.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:24:30
Oh wow, I don't know how I missed that! Thanks for the quick answer!
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:20:58
Yeah I don't know what I was thinking. The wallet I wanted it sent to is 17XwCU2ZzpVDeWH8ocPpNxY974mSBXLcXC
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:29:59
Andddd it's gone.
Edit: and it's back?
@_date: 2013-07-29 17:34:28
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:24:08
But the coin isn't in my reddit account either. Its been about 12 hours, so how much longer should it be?
@_date: 2013-05-27 03:41:28
Yeah it looks like spam, don't bother.
@_date: 2013-05-20 00:01:31
Yeah I agree. Tipping was actually what brought me into the bitcoin game in the first place, and I would love to tip people, but I just spent the last of my bitcoin. Once I get around to purchasing more I'm hoping to tip more so others can have their interest piqued in the same way I did. Plus its just awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:00:33
Probably 3 days ago. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:37:23
I think we definitely will
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:33:05
Typo in the last sentence. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 19:04:40
I'd go with George Bluth Sr.
@_date: 2013-05-08 02:56:36
True dat. You're a good man.
Edit: or woman.
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:13:12
8338BTC is approximately equal to a million bucks. So they meant smell like a million bucks.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:28:53
Yeah I simply don't believe those stats.
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:21:12
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:00:58
You know you can go to jail for even suggesting you're going to commit fraud right?
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:35:20
funny guy
@_date: 2013-10-06 12:35:28
That's not how 24 hours work
@_date: 2013-07-07 17:37:24
Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:43:24
I think this is another step in the right direction for bitcoin personally.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:55:44
Hi new friend :)
@_date: 2013-07-17 00:59:13
Just dropping in. Happy cake day man. Have a good one.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:12:04
I don't think the dollar is going to collapse "in the next few years". That seems a little outrageous
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:37:33
The only one I have used is bitinstant and I've had a successful time. I use cash deposits at the local Wegmens and other than the 3% fee its not too bad. The money has always been in my account by the time I'm back in my dorm (10 minutes).
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:15:55
What would you say is the estimated return on the investment?
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:31:25
Haha I'm always upset when I miss these threads.
