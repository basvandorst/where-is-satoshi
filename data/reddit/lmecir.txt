There is a problem with the meaning of "intrinsic value" more than with bitcoin. What does "intrinsic value" mean in this context? I think that it means "the value determined through fundamental analysis without reference to the market value".
See 
While the "orthodox opinion" is that bitcoin does not have any intrinsic value, Bank of America's David Woo came to a different conclusion in his fundamental analysis.

Wrong. The facts are:
Gold has value. The constituents of the its value are:
1) It is scarce. Notice that scarcity is *not* intrinsic to gold. It is a property you cannot detect however thoroughly you examine a gold bullion.
2) It is useful. This means that people are able to use it to satisfy their desires and needs. Different people can use gold differently, and no microscope can reveal how. This means that utility is not intrinsic.
Summing up, gold does *not* have intrinsic value. It has value, but the value is not intrinsic, no microscope can reveal it.

Fungibility: there are different degrees of this property. Pieces of gold can be melted together, in which case it may not be possible to recognize the original constituents any more. It is not possible to do this with fiat money, which makes fiat money less fungible in this respect. However, there is a law protecting bona fide acquisition of fiat money, which adds to fungibility of fiat money. Bitcoin may lack the bona fide acquisition rules in certain jurisdictions, although it is possible to use mixing services to obfuscate the history of bitcoin achieving an effect similar to melting.
Portability: gold has certainly the lowest; portability of fiat is higher, but still not on par with portability of bitcoin.
Secure (cannot be counterfeited) is called recognizability.

Ludwig von Mises defined it as follows: "the utility not based on the function of the object as a medium of exchange"

The site uses "The standard deviation of daily returns for the preceding 30-day window." For bitcoin the definition does not look useful, though, taking into account how much the calculated volatilities differ. More useful and telling might be a value calculated using a longer window (3 months, 6 months, or maybe 1 year?).

"In my own mind, I toyed with the issue for more than a year. It puzzled me." I bet that is what happened to von Mises when trying to invent the regression theorem as well. You are right when trying to apply the regression theorem to bitcoin, since:
*bitcoin is a medium of exchange at present
*the logic of the regression theorem is not hard to verify
==Back in time==
What has to be done when applying the regression theorem is to go back in time (or to imagine going back in time, if you prefer) to the moment when bitcoin was not a medium of exchange. In accordance with the regression theorem, at this specific moment in time bitcoin cannot be valued as a medium of exchange, a currency, or money, since it is not a medium of exchange yet. Similarly, the bitcoin system cannot be valued as a payment system, since it is not a payment system yet. Thus, the simple argument that the payment system gives the value to bitcoin at this specific moment in time does not work.
==Using our present knowledge==
Bitcoin was not a medium of exchange back then, but, judging from the present, it was of economic advantage to acquire some bitcoins and wait until now. Is it possible that the present outcome has given bitcoin economic value in the past?
==Claim to expected economic benefits==
The objection that nobody knew the present outcome in the past is relevant. However, due to bitcoin design, there was an expectation that bitcoin would become a medium of exchange materializing its possible economic advantages. Therefore, at the time in the past it was possible to evaluate bitcoin as a claim to expected economic benefits, i.e., similarly as any claim to expected economic benefits. To do such an evaluation precisely, one should enlist the possible outcomes, their future valuations and their probabilities. To obtain a positive valuation it suffices to realize that:
*the possible outcomes are nonnegative
*at least one possible outcome is positive
*the probability of a positive outcome is greater than zero
Thus, bitcoin had a positive value as a "claim to expected economic benefits". The term looks rather complicated. Perhaps a simpler term expressing the same in a more succinct way is "a collectible", as in "collect and wait until the expected economic benefits materialize".
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:00:22


Not bad! However, "store of value" is a slightly misleading name for this utility. It is more common to call similar things of value *collectibles*. People collect things like: gold, silver, old cars, rare paintings, rare stamps, gems, ... Different collectibles have different liquidities, gold is probably the most liquid collectible at present.
I strongly object against saying that "gold is backed up by fiat money", though. That is mistaken. Even if fiat money lose their value in hyperinflation, it is not likely that gold experiences the same crisis together with the fiat money.
While bitcoin is currently used (to some extent) as a medium of exchange, its main utility is the same as the main utility of gold: it is collectible. The problem is that many people call this use (in case of bitcoin) "speculation", mistakenly thinking that when you do not buy bitcoins to immediately spend them for goods, you are a "speculator". The reason why this is wrong is that *speculation* is defined as short-term trading. Any long-term usage does not fit the definition.

Fiat currencies are "decentralized" on Earth in the sense that there is no "central currency" available. Bitcoin can change that.

It is problematic, indeed, to calculate inflation into transaction costs.  Besides, the transacting parties are not the ones who pay the inflation bill.

Bruce is right. Here is a more direct argument to support his idea:
Suppose Adam has 50 NCU (national currency units), is a fan of XBT (bitcoin) and wants to support the idea somehow (you may have seen such an example before). The simplest way to do is to just buy a 50 NCU worth of bitcoin and hold it until he gets a chance to spend it for some goods he will need at that time without needing to sell his XBT for NCU first.
How does it work:
1) Austrian economists define money to be the most marketable (demanded, traded, liquid) good. Now, in Adam's case, it is likely that NCU are more demanded than XBT. However, when exchanging 50 NCU for XBT, he pushes the NCU demand down pushing the XBT demand up at the same time, "pumping" the value out of NCU economy and into bitcoin economy. Both the liquidity and the price of XBT will be affected at the same time making XBT more liquid and more valuable at the same time, increasing XBT's "moneyness" at the expense of the "moneyness" of NCU, increasing all of: liquidity (demand) and stability (the opposite of volatility).
2) Increasing value of XBT Adam also increases the incentive for miners to improve their performance making bitcoin more safe and more valuable
3) Increased value provides incentive for others to provide services to the bitcoin community because there is more wealth to be had, it also provides an incentive for other bitcoin hoarders to follow his example. This is a self-enforcing cycle leading to point 1) again.

The problem with the first claim is that it is unrefutable. No matter what the situation in 5 years turns out to be, the author may claim he did have doubts about the future. Unrefutable claims, however, are unscientific (rubbish not worth a scientist). The same applies to the second claim: the author may safely claim whatever he likes if he precedes it by "it seems". Unscientific and unrefutable rubbish.
The only refutable claim is the third one. That is refutable even now, as the Overstock CEO already knows.

How can Kevin Dowd be a famous economist and not know that the intrinsic theory of value has been refuted long time ago? 
Paul Krugman is at least careful to not speak about "intrinsic value", knowing that it would ruin his reputation. To circumvent the problem with "intrinsic value", P.K. "invented" a notion of "floor", and was *very* careful to never define or explain what his "floor" means. An attentive reader can refute his mumbling at the first sight, though, knowing that he cannot even define the, purportedly economic, terminology he is using.
Edit: using the "intrinsic value" notion, K.D. joins the same group as John Quiggin, being doomed to just restate his "prophecy". Funnily enough, if used properly, (not that it is reasonable, the theory has really been refuted), the intrinsic theory of value *can* prove that bitcoin *does* have intrinsic value - that is, of course, a result people like K.D. or J.Q. cannot obtain, since they do not know the intrinsic theory of value, as it looks.
Edit2: what they really want to discuss and prove is that bitcoin does not have *direct utility*. However, they do not even know the notion not having read von Mises. Also, if they really knew von Mises, they would know that it is not possible to prove that bitcoin does not have direct utility, and that it actually cannot be true.

Your article looks quite well written. Did you consider a formula:
1 BTC / 1 USD = (Total Expenditure [USD]) / (Total Expenditure [BTC])
It somehow looks to me as the Total Expenditure [BTC] may be estimated using more approaches than just multiplying the estimate of the velocity by the estimate of the number of active coins.
Edit: alternatively, you do not need to estimate *both* the velocity and the number of active coins, you can use the number of the coins mined and estimate *their* velocity, which shall be lower than the estimate of velocity calculating some smaller number of "active coins".

A little misunderstanding. I claim that bitcoin does have intrinsic scarcity, because it has been designed to be scarce, scarcity is its design, i.e., intrinsic, property. You can examine bitcoin and find out it is scarce, because that is a part of bitcoin specification, a part of what bitcoin is. However, the other necessary requirement to have a value is to be useful, and nothing has "intrinsic utility", since utility is how people use the thing, which is always extrinsic to the thing itself. Nobody really knows (we may only guess) how will people use gold 100 years from now. Therefore the economic theory argues that bitcoin (as well as everything else) does not have intrinsic value.

Yes, I know, but you proposed gold has "intrinsic value", which, since the value is based on scarcity, implies that scarcity would have to be intrinsic.
In contrast to gold, bitcoin does have intrinsic scarcity, because it has been designed to be scarce.

Edit: ...and the fact that the original proposer was an SPA looks particularly amusing too.

Thank you for explaining one of the flaws. The fact is that every theft devalues bitcoin and robs other owners as well, since a thief never values stolen bitcoins as high as their original owner.

" in the past 7 years, an idea has turned into a global widely used currency" - indeed bitcoin can be said to be "global widely used", but it is controversial whether it is a currency at this moment in time

Bitcoin is an innovation, no doubt about it. Altcoins are copies, trying to circumvent bitcoin's supply limit (unsuccessfully, in fact), that is the problem.

While the source presents valid points about liquidity, it seems to mix up liquidity of bitcoin with its total supply. If we express the liquidity of bitcoin in billions of US dollars per year, these are the figures obtained: 0.000 (2009), 0.001 (2010), 0.418 (2011), 0.606 (2012), 14.765 (2013), 23.367 (2014, estimate)

You described a case when Alice wanted to send some fiat money and exchanged bitcoin as a medium with Bob. Thus, you described a case of utility as a medium of exchange, not a case of direct utility.
Do not get me wrong, please. I do not say that bitcoin cannot be used as a medium of exchange. I just say that when it is used as a medium of exchange, it is, by von Mises's definition, not a *direct utility*.

It is not a synonym. The problem is that the payment network *must* transfer monetary value to be a payment network.
The function of the bitcoin network as a payment network *does* depend on the function of bitcoin as a medium of exchange - if/when bitcoin is not a medium of exchange, the bitcoin network is not a payment network. This is why the utility of the bitcoin network as a payment network, while existing, does not fit the definition of *direct utility*.

"Theoretically, Bitcoin exchanges (such as Mt. Gox) could sell more bitcoins that they actually have and hope that there will not be a digital bank run" - the word "Theoretically" is inappropriate, since this is what did happen, "that they actually have" should be "than they actually have", I guess

Hi, my notes:
"This was simply because the production of gold did not keep up with the economic growth. " - Your "simply because" is not citing any source. It looks a bit ignorant, since other explanations, such as: "this was because the governement(s) did not keep their promise to exchange the currency for the fixed amount of the precious metal (went bankrupt)" are possible.
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:39:28
" It is certain that if Bitcoin keeps gaining popularity and if it can function as a medium of exchange, it is in the process of proving the regression theorem wrong." - that is not obvious at all, and you did not bring any arguments in support of this statement. It is certain that Konrad S. Graf, Peter Šurda, and some other people would disagree.

Wrong, fiat is not "backed by the economy". That is only a myth. In case of trouble you cannot turn in your fiat and get some specific part of the economy. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 09:23:29
Actually, people do say that bitcoin is "backed by math", even though it makes no sense. Bitcoin is not in contradiction with Austrian school at all. Most bitcoins are still accepted for a primary purpose, not for immediate use in exchange for other things. We know that people collect bitcoins (use as a collectible is a primary use, animals also collect things) for the purpose of hedging against various forms of financial instability (hyperinflation, excessive capital controls, bail-ins, etc), which is what other collectibles are good for too. I have yet to see somebody oppose the claim that its properties make bitcoin valuable as a collectible.

Your memory is quite short. The world in which the first bitcoin pizza never happened is this very world, just some time ago.

"Bitcoin was invented to be a means of exchange, not a collectible" - it is an error to think that means of exchange cannot be collectible. Actually, it is the other way around: divisibility, portability and durability are good properties for money as well as for collectibles.
"It blows the idea out of the water..." - actually, it does not. The first use of bitcoin surely was not the use as a medium of exchange. First miners just collected the mined bitcoins, not having an opportunity to use them in exchange.

"want to know more about short-term bitcoin investment" - I have got news for you: What you described is not a bitcoin investment, it is a speculation, and a particularly naive one. Assume that many people do this. Do you think they will not lose when trying to sell at the same moment?

"It provides a floor" - no, it does not. There is absolutely no floor except for zero. As an example, see the tomatoes used for throwing at other people. What is the floor value if it is not zero? See the subjective theory of value, which provides a clue.

Bitcoins were collected *before* they were traded. Re "bitcoin was invented to be a means of exchange" - funnily enough, bitcoins were not used as the means of exchange immediately after bitcoin network started to work. The facts are there for you to check. If anybody is putting the cart before the horse then it is the one who ignores what happened first (primarily).

Quite wrong, you are only talking about the specific case of money made of a precious metal. Do not forget that camels were money too. You should realize that your definition of "intrinsic value" applies only to the case of money made of a valuable substance, and that the money must only represent the value of the underlying substance, nothing else. That is one of the possibilities, but you are out of luck with other types of money.
@_date: 2015-10-03 10:06:06


You seem to not think deep enough about the meaning of words. If there is a "floor", what it is? Value is subjective, and you have got no idea what the use of gold shall be 100 years from now.
"Intrinsic theory of value" is obsolete, you should have a look at the "subjective theory of value" to get the latest and greatest of economic theory.
@_date: 2015-10-09 21:34:52
" inflation can be limited because the money is essentially backed by the very material it is made out of" - well, that definition is very limited. There are commodities that are significantly more valuable than the material they are made of. Take integrated circuits as an example. The silicon is significantly less valuable than the circuits. Expensive models may be significantly more valuable than the fabric they are made of. Jewelry can be significantly more valuable than the gold it is made of. Postal stamps are significantly more valuable than the paper they are made of. Live camels are more valuable than their meat.
Note that for valuable software or songs there is no material you can say they are "made of".
Summing up, your definition can only be used for coins made of a precious metal, and you are out of luck trying to apply it to other cases.
@_date: 2015-10-03 10:10:17
Seems that you need a better explanation. "Backed by economy" would mean a specific part of economy to be available, e.g., for one dollar. But it is well known that the dollar is not worth some specific part of economy, its value, relative to the whole economy is getting much lower in time.
