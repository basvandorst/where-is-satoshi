No currently this just shows info for bitcoin but i will look into adding ethereum

Of course and then you can watch that $20 grow some zeros
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:14
Fuck the free world
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:25

I created a faucet app in 2015/2016 and gave away 9 bitcoins but didn't get paid from Google admob, so basically gave them away for nothing but looking back at it at least i done my part helping to spread bitcoin

Nob spelt wrong
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:55:45
It is also hold mispelled. It's a special word that has 2 meanings but to the untrained eye it's just hold spelt wrong
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:06
Yes there is a Google assistant developer tutorial on youtube and the engineer used Bitcoin price alerts as an example
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:30:26
It's basically hold on dear life, it originated from bitcointalk forum. I was wondering about FUD too, and just finally found out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:36
You must be new around this neck of the woods?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:01
Exactly

The bitcoin reward for miners half every 4 years so they become more rare and the difficulty increases to mine them needing computer power not yet available. It's rising now though because more people are becoming aware of it and also futures start Monday. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:38
Haha yeah that 11:11 always catches me looking

I checked everywhere, i can't see anything about BCH but i did check my bitcoin address on  and it does show there is BCH there. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:45:46
Set up an account on wex.nz (used to be BTC-e) and transfer your BCH there and trade it for BTC. That's what i done. You can always send your BTC to your wallet once your done.

Bitcoin is not a bubble, it's the future of money or at the very least the blockchain technology will be used.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:04:53
Absolutely blinding news old chap. Sips on tea
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:59:54
Same man i only got my free BCH at the weekend and managed to sell it for BTC when BTC was dropping and BCH was rising. It was a sweet deal, i slept well that night
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:03:23
I think because my BTC was saved on blockchain.info as an imported wallet i dont get an option to get BCH but i do have the private keys so i should still be able to get the BCH some other way.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:07:28
I think i'll just try and get it another way using the private keys from where my BTC was stored (which today i actually transferred to my blockchain.info wallet) after looking online it seems easy enough to do. Thanks for your help though
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:26:08
Well i previously had my BTC stored on a Bitcoin Wallet app before i exported the keys then imported them into my blockchain.info wallet account but now i'm wondering if i could use the same private keys i imported to blockchain.info to access the BCH? My BTC is now gone but i should be able to access BCH right seeing as i had BTC stored there before and after the last fork?
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:09:51
No i don't see any BCH option in my settings so i guess they didnt get moved along. The only 2 cryptos options i see is for BTC and ETH. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:14:37
If i had the option with an imported wallet how come it didnt show in my blockchain account during the last hard fork? Could i have access BCH from my imported wallet? I'm just thinking it's free BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:57:47
So because my BTC was stored as a imported wallet on blockchain.info and blockchain.info didnt have support for BCH at the time then i'm guessing mine should be ok to get BCH as my funds was never actually saved in my blockchain.info wallet it was just my imported wallet which was saved there so I'm thinking i should be able to get some free BCH too using my private key for my imported wallet. Does that sound possible?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:15
It's back up now but apparently there was a DDos attack
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:35:29
Ok i've just found out that my bitcoin was saved into my blockchain.info account as an imported wallet address instead of the BTC actually being stored in my blockchain.info wallet. I've just transferred this over to my actual blockchain.info wallet instead of it just being imported. So i guess i'll get that BCH option now. Anyone know any good places to exchange BCH to BTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:49
Edit, now going parabolic

@_date: 2017-11-07 15:14:43
It may have done but i don't remember seeing anything about BCH in any of the settings or any of the other options on that site but the good news is i can see a BCH balance against my bitcoin address on bitinfo so looks as though it's possible to get. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:08:27
I would do it, i'm thinking of doing something like that myself
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:07:47
What's wrong with blockchain.info? You still get the 12 words to restore your bitcoin if the site ever goes down? Or is it bad because you can get hacked by phishing sites pretending to be blockchain.info?
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:22:58
Believe me lessons have been learned from the last time and luckily most of my btc was moved somewhere safe but i also had around 0.03 left in my wex account to trade when the price dropped. Still a shame to lose any bitcoin though. So i guess there isn't any news on them returning crypto to their rightful owners?
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:15:43
There's 100 million pieces in each Bitcoin though so there's enough to go around.
100 million x 21 million = 2.10000000E+15 by my calculations
