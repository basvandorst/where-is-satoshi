I think this could be trying to show that *fluctuations* of the price of bitcoin aren't much different from *fluctuations* of the S&amp;P 500 index. 
Therefore it does not seem to be a significantly less stable investment than a regular stock anymore.

Only the fact that you have purchased bitcoins at some point, not whether or not you still own them.

You can also, for example, create an address in a hardware-wallet, transfer all your coins to it, and just put the wallet in a safe at home before leaving for the US (and destroy the 20 word mnemonic or whatever way the wallet has to restore coins).
That way you're in no way carrying your coins with you, so the law simply doesn't apply.

No matter how high or low the inflation is, 'rational' miners will always 'outcompete' the 'benevolent' ones.
But a miners always have wider interest range than just 'outcompeting' other miners.

Can some please point out where the part where they include bitcoin in the list of monetary instruments is?
I couldn't find it.

Sounds like someone has sold their coins earlier thinking it's the peak again, and now is desperate for the prices to drop back so he can buy back in ;)
