I still think that this is simplest and fastest way how people can use their coins on Amazon.
The more we have such services as Bitstore.tech then more faster will use cryptocurrency in every day people life

Greetings earthlings :)
Probably you will agree that the year 2018 for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was not the most successful year.
There are a lot of different reasons for this and from the main ones is that bitcoin and cryptocurrency did not advance to the masses and not used in the everyday life of people. But everything can change in 2019.
Imagine how convenient it would be if you could make purchases at Amazon and eBay with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
Now we have this opportunity!
[Bitstore.tech]( \- First crypto shopping platform
