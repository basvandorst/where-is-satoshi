I'm also taking it very objectively that while it can be true that adoption is "picking up speed", without hard numbers this statement is moot for predicting future adoption. An increasing trend is hardly a indicator that it will be close to maximum adoption. 
By the same token, I could also state that I am picking up speed in walking westward, and the coast of California would be the "maximum" westward distance I can walk to. But realistically, the odds of me walking all the way to California are pretty much nil.

I would put it like this. Blockchains are based on zero trust. On the contrary, governments are built around assumed trust. So you can't have a government, at least in the traditional sense, if no actors are to be trusted.
And you said, a centralized blockchain will be shitty, it defeats the purpose of the resilience factor. In a truly decentralized system you assume no trust, but also can't be compromised unless over 50% of the nodes are bad actors. In a typical database that relies on complete trust, you just need one bad actor to infect the whole system.

It's definitely going through growing pains, and more people are now just seeing it as the price climbs. 
Tx fees do not consider exchange rates with other currencies, which is why they're mostly trivial in coins with far less value/coin. Transactional times are related. The sooner these scaling problems get fixed, the better for everyone.

My high school economics teacher gave us a short lesson that stuck to me- what gives money its value. He mentioned things like scarcity and backing by large institutions. Then he said that while these might sometimes contribute to value, the biggest contributor to the value of money is *general acceptability*. Something has value as money wherever it's accepted by many people as intermediate form of trade. Just get a lot of people to accept it, then the money becomes a necessary thing to have.
I think this is something that should be taught in any basic economics class. That this value is a matter of perception and acceptability.

So here's what I'm wondering. If going "all out" on an investment raises the risk of regret if they could have had more, why go all out? Why not just sell 80%, 90% or even 95% and keep the rest "just in case"? Is it a matter of being so financially constrained that they absolutely must sell 100% of their earnings? If hedging your risk is an option, I would definitely go with that instead.

Got a basic investment question that's about a situation I had several years ago. Back in 2012 when I was early in my career I had student debt (which I have paid off already) but earning decent income. I just went to my local bank to ask a banker there some basic ways to get started investing, perhaps in bonds or an index fund. He told me that, as long as I have interest collecting in debt it's not a good idea to start making other investments because those won't appreciate as fast as the interest from my debt.
So I took his advice decided not to do anything other than finish paying up my debt. Was I given good or bad advice? Would it have still been a good idea to at least diversify my money into other accounts if I had to pay debt?

What about creating a cryptocurrency specifically to test an experiment, and as a sandbox to try out solutions to the scaling problem? Have a crypto that mines crazy small blocks, and only support a few thousand transactions daily so it faces the scaling problem very quickly. Then it could be used as "proving grounds" to test solutions without impacting the blockchains that have serious money going through them.

From my understanding of LN, it seems like LN works as a "pit stop" for individual wallet users to move their purchases off the blockchain temoprarily. Users that want to use their own wallet money and gradually top off a balance where it's large enough that they can move the balance back to the main blockchain, and large enough that the fees are now relatively painless. Is this correct? Is the idea for trying to increase adoption for smaller businesses that don't get tons of BTC volume on their own? That's how I'm seeing it anyways, treat everyone's aggregate of small purchases as one large BTC transfer, to reduce tx overhead.
I have a Gyft account, and bought a $25 gift card just yesterday using BTC. That was withdrawn from my Coinbase account but I was not hit with any transfer fee. That kind of surprised me, but I figure since these companies have a ton of transactional volume between them, they can take up the overhead so that the customers don't pay such large fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:43:43
That was the thing that made a lot of people suspicious. NiceHash's own wallets had lower fees and lower payout minimums, to encourage miners to use those wallets. I opted for an external wallet (Coinbase) for payouts, and I'm still unclear as to how those funds are gonna end up.

I cringe at some of the communities listed there. You know why? If the average joe has to learn about an-cap and agorism philosophies, then Bitcoin is facing an uphill battle.
The interest to learn a particular science, or technology, comes from culture. As an example, educational programs can only be used to help take advantage of that interest and turn it into knowledge. If a culture does not put science in high regard, education and science funding will have a higher chance of failure and less efficient in achieving its goal. It was easier to send a man to the moon in the 60's than in the 90's because the culture and view of space exploration was very different.
Most people do not fit culturally into libertarianism, anarchism, or agorism. That's just the hard truth. So my conclusion is- culture drives the education on a subject, if the subject has broad implications like Bitcoin does.

False dichotomy detected. First of all, I wouldn't want to live in Chicago anymore if government suddenly ceased all functions. I'd feel safer in a town much closer to the countryside. Take a hint from survivalists (I'm not one but they are the best people to go to on how to live for yourself) - in a huge "shit hits the fan" scenario where are you now free to make your own rules, you best not be around high-density populated areas. To that end, and my second point is, small, local governments would work well in this situation, especially if positions are voluntary and not paid (I don't consider managing one aspect of a small town a 5-9 chore if responsibilities are voluntarily decided and chosen). 
Ergo, the best way for people to have a self-sustaining economy and uphold the non-aggression principle is to band together into smaller villages and hamlets.

Netflix and Hulu are good examples of how to pull people away from piracy.

When you order a Green Dot prepaid card, you have to enter your personal information, SS# included. A lot of people use them regardless, particularly ones with no credit history or don't want to be tied to credit. I believe similar requirements apply here because it is also for a store of currency.

Personally, I am only interested in work and industry demographics, the rest is irrelevant by comparison. It is more of a question whether some demographic X is artificially set back from getting into career Y, or if X simply has little interest in getting into career Y generally speaking. More likely is that one of those influences the other.
Age representation is a real problem in US government, though, especially on the federal level. And there is a marked difference with how the average 20 year old thinks with how the average 70 year old. The median age in Congress is much older than the median age of the US. I think most deep rooted problems of bigotry, the Cold War mindset, and "culture warriors" that want to keep the status quo are due to generational differences.

Unfortunately we do not yet have the tech equivalent for other services that can be carried on globally with a voluntary consensus. Bitcoin does it for money, and DACs have potential, though. For now, we'll need to resort to old fashioned physical communication to voluntarily provide other services and use them. And as far as I know this works more effectively when you are no more than one degree of separation from one another. Until such technology can be invented to bypass human trust on a global level they way Bitcoin did, voluntary consensus must remain close-knit in order to avoid miscommunications.


Then we differ on how government is defined. I don't limit the definition to a centrally planned authority with some select group of people. If a society can self maintain and everyone takes voluntary action to make decisions or carry out some service that other can freely take or not accept, I consider this a government, a voluntary form of one. It's not what most people think of a government, because most people associate governments with always being a non-transparent, centralized entity that is backed up by force. If Bitcoin can break paradigms with the understanding of money then the same can hold true in the future for thinking outside the box and not held back by these conventional meanings of government.


Yes, efficiency is higher in decentralization. But physical communication is needed for services where computer technology cannot yet fully replace. You seem to be looking more into the future, but I am looking at how these problems can be solved at the present time. If there is an argument that says central authority is a necessity for large, densely populated civilizations (which I don't consider a good argument anyways), I would then say that these large civilizations aren't desirable.

For example, the President promoting a subsidy for some tech-related initiative would only be tangentially related. can keep its financial and political talk, since it's a more niche interest than anyways.

Traditional currencies don't undergo a price discovery phase like Bitcoin. Those are usually established with a parity to a pre-existing currency, or some other store of value to gold. 
Bitcoin was released with no parity to any store of value. So it has to "find its way" for quite a while. Furthermore, fiat currencies, when new, are enforced very effectivey to guarantee a quick adoption.

The objectivist philosophy shares the same weakness that many opposing philosophies suffer: *It requires a leap of faith.*
Rand is opposed to taking advantage of the relatively weak. To seek your own pleasures without taking advantage of others means a degree of self-control is expected, because you cannot use physical pressure on someone else to keep that level of discipline. Expecting everyone to pursue their own self interests in a manner that is not destructive to others takes as much of a leap of faith just as expecting a government to not be destructive to its people.

The blockchain does a good job doing away with the need to transfer discrete physical units of tender like coins or paper money. Bitcoin does make carrying wads of paper notes low tech already.

The US cannot yet avoid its racist past. For most of its history it has been racist towards different people that were *considered* non-white at the time. Up to the mid 20th century, such people were denied certain access to representational power in numerous roundabout ways. (see those 1950's "literacy tests" for voting)
These things are taboo today but the effects still linger because surprise, a lot of the 50's generation is still alive, although they are slowly wearing off as the workforce is being refreshed with younger people. Some PC groups want to accelerate the wearing-off process, while others are completely misguided and overshoot that, thinking that a perfectly distributed representation is possible.
The tricky thing about this, and one that is argued a lot about, is how would a US with no effects of past racism look like, when the US hasn't even experienced such a state of being? Social sciences are wishy-washy because you hardly have a control to test against.

I think studying macroeconomics requires a basic understanding of human psychology. Money has value when enough people say it does. "Enough" can vary depending on how big a society is and how scarce resources are. 
Economics isn't really about banks or governments, just like computer science isn't really about C++ or compilers. Banks and governments are  *current tools* that implement an economy. Economics is about how people choose to distribute and use resources and how the distribution is managed.

These are good points he made, but how do you implement a stateless society that works in with a model of voluntary trust in a population orders of magnitude larger than the Dunbar number? Anarchist and other ruler-free societies have only flourished in small communities and villages. (the Amish are one example) 
This happens in small populations because everyone practically knows everyone else, or at least to one degree of separation. When the community grows too large, human trust gets put at risk, you'll get more rogues that want to take all the benefits for themselves. Either you drive out the rogues, or split the community. Both of these things help restore order but it also keeps the population(s) small. 
Therefore, such a model cannot work in large places with millions of people spanning hundreds or thousands of miles. Even a small town of 20,000 will have problems with knowing everyone and keeping in check without some degree of central authority.
The human trust model does not work well in large, mostly anonymous populations. Bitcoin solved this problem with money, but you'd need something even more transcendent to solve the problem with self-management of social order when it comes to thousands of people or more.

I wouldn't say it's completely a scam, but it is dubious in its planning. As much as I'd like to see humanity colonize the solar system someday, Mars One is showing signs of a marketing scheme totally dependent on resources out of its control.
The reliance of different milestones that are expected to be carried out by different businesses and orgs operating independently of each other means there are several single points of failure. It is more believable for SpaceX to singlehandedly attempt the Mars mission on its own. And maybe forming a partnership with a different company (like Bigelow) for habitat-focused resources.

As the famous Churchill quote puts it, "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those [before it]".
This quote tells me, other than his belief that democracy is the best option even if it still sucks, is that we still have a long ways to go to understanding good models of society on a larger scale. Your reluctancy to require a solution tells me, "let's not discuss this topic analytically".
There is no "sure thing" when discussing political concepts. No one famous has been credited with discovering a "law" in the field of politics that says such-and-such is always the case, probably because you cannot approach it like a physical science. Even in hard sciences, you should use phrases like "it has been proven" with caution.
So why do proponents of different types of governments (or social structures) have no shortage of ammunition to discredit the others? Because they usually discuss them in terms of large populations.
They have a total disregard for Dunbar's number, and it is probably why, beyond a certain population size, most ideas that work well in theory start to break down. And maintaining relative order in a world without government? That still has the same weakness, trust in total strangers. Again, Dunbar's number says no.
Back on the topic of bitcoin. What Satoshi did with it is brilliant, because it bypasses the need for human trust, whether that human comes from bank, government or an individual with no forceful authority. It is revolutionary not because it does away with the need of an institution... hell, it does away with the human interaction element because math is king here.
Now, if someone can come up with a system that promotes the growth and well-being of a human community *that is not dependent on unconditional human trust*, well then that guy deserves a Nobel prize, whatever that may be worth.

It's not so much ensuring lots of profits as it is the fear of reducing profits in order to adapt to a changing market. It's just as bad but it's too much of being conformist that is the problem. They prefer to rest on the laurels.
This always happens with large, established players because they operate less efficiently and more expensively than small nimble upstarts that can jump on the next possible market transition. The former group prefer to reverse the trend because expansion and adapting for the long run for them means sacrificing a lot of $$$ for it.

I agree that some business do not want to see their revenue from transactions dip in value by over 10% in one day (which is still very possible right now).
If receivables were "batched" so they can be converted to more stable fiat in a timely matter that can help mitigate the risks. However, this would only be a huge concern for companies that are just breaking even or can't afford to lose a lot in profit margins. I think that the more bullish companies with tremendous assests would do better if they sit on the bitcoins for a while and use it as capital investment.

Bitcoin is a different beast from stocks and commodities in that you have to be pretty knowledgable of its technical underpinnings to get the big picture. It requires a cross-disciplinary lesson in econ and P2P technology to fully understand it.
The same can't be said for a technology stock, because you can just understand its value from a business and marketing standpoint without understanding exactly what goes in producing the products or services of said technology company.
Buying into bitcoin is buying into a technology itself, not a company that is marketing products/services based on a technology.

At the end of the day, I think that would be one of the fundamental shifts that would skyrocket the use of Bitcoin.
The majority of people get most of their money from their jobs. And there are hardly any jobs out now that pay you in Bitcoin, so the cash to Bitcoin exchange is still very much a requirement. That can only change if many businesses use Bitcoin internally and directly fund their capital with it.

There's a silver lining to all this. The majority of alt-coin miners just want to eventually convert them to bitcoin, so all these alt-coins mean more bitcoins in peoples' hands. It's obvious that their purpose is to increase one's bitcoin wealth.

There's another subtle unknown variable that will also continue to change and affect the value of a bitcoin. That's the amount of *usable* bitcoins in circulation. 
Either through human error or deliberate "destruction" of bitcoins by sending them to an address with an unknown private key, that number can only decrease over time. Nobody knows for sure how many are usuable right now, and you can't see it affecting price right now, but it will have its effects more in the long term. This is more about the purchasing power of a bitcoin than the exchange rate of bitcoins to dollars, since dollars also change in purchasing power.

It should be obvious that buying a few grand worth of bitcoins is not a huge part of the market when the current market cap is at a few million grand. You'd just own 1 millionth of the entire market.
But, how many people in all are using bitcoins right now? That's the interesting question. Over 65% of all bitcoins have been mined, but it's  very likely less than 1% of the world owns any right now. Here is a [distribution of bitcoin ownership]( by total number of addresses.
The most liberal estimate is 1 address/person so the highest possible number is 11 million people are using bitcoin right now. However we know that many of those people are using multiple addresses so I feel there are around 1 million that own less than 1 BTC and on the upper end a few thousand speculators own about 50% of them together.

If bitcoin keeps rising in value, it better damn well be because adoption rate is rapidly growing and thus you would have no need to cash out all your bitcoins since you can more easily buy what you need directly with bitcoin.

It *could* face an exponential growth like Facebook and Google and it *could* enter a saturation point where growth slows down and value is more stable, but right now it's Facebook circa 2006 when it wasn't made public.
That's the odd thing with Bitcoin. Because it is not a company, it is *always* public. It's not privately traded. Privately held companies have no requirement to disclose info about their financial status, so the public does not see many of those rollercoaster bumps of the early years. It's still in a startup phase but the floodgates are opening to investors. I'd compare the treatment of Bitcoin right now as more of a gold rush commodity.

His explanation of local historical currencies actually reminds me more of the altcoin markets than the bitcoin market.

People are missing the peer-to-peer nature and almost treat typical e-commerce as P2P. Here's an argument I read against bitcoin.
"A new technology like email is where I can send a message to someone. That provides an inherent service. Bitcoin has no inherent value apart from the suspended belief in its value by others. The only difference between using a credit card online and bitcoin online is that with a credit card, there are actual records of the transaction."
Totally missed the peer to peer aspect of bitcoin. But then it becomes clearer when he wrote this:
"It doesn't take a genius to realize that 'decentralized', 'peer to peer", "unregulated", are all buzzwords and trying to liken it to Bittorrent etc. You can't seriously deny you notice the buzzwords and smooth marketing style and their similarity with computer software... the entire website practically looks the same as Bittorrent's did with 'P2P' and arrows going all directions"

Bitcoin is not just a currency but its own transaction system. Currently, people use credit cards or bank accounts to transfer money from one party to another online. This kind of online banking and e-commerce is merely applying old, pre-existing systems using a computer to provide some added convenience to the user.
On the other hand, bitcoin runs on a system more robust and transparent that does not require a middleman to make a transaction. The money "lives" in a computing device, and transactions are traceable and final. Compare this to having your money stored in a bank, where you rely on a third party for access and your computer is just showing you numbers on the screen but the bank has the authorization and possession of your money. **Bitcoin is literally digital currency as opposed to a digital representation of hard currency.**
With bitcoin, you are your own bank. And everyone is able to look at the ledger of transactions in all its history. But central banks don't need to worry, because with smart support and smart regulations, third parties can offer services to people who are not yet confident in managing large amounts of digital currency by themselves. For instance, you can currently allow a third party service to entrust your bitcoins, but it is not customary for most services to insure them up to a given amount. I believe services like these need to take hold in order to gain widespread adoption.
Finally, while the internet has greatly increased the "liquidity" of great ideas- if you can express it that way- the practical case is that you often need money to fund great ideas. Now put two and two together and you can see how bitcoin would naturally work in a more connected world.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:47:38
When most of the major trading and bitcoin purchase sites are down or freezing their services, it's a good example to show that bitcoin adoption is still in its infancy. The infrastructure isn't growing quickly enough.

By the mid-22nd century, each 100 Satoshi will be called a "credit". The credit has a managed floating exchange rate, calculated in real time by the central bank to maintain the average value of all participating currencies.
Some regional currencies are worth more than a credit, and some less. When the Systems Alliance joined the Citadel, its various national treasuries were linked into the credit network. A human with a bank account of Mexican pesos, Japanese yen, or Indian rupees can purchase any item priced in credits at fair market value. All economies that participate in the credit network are required to price items in both local currency and credits.
Hard currency can be stolen or counterfeited, so electronic fund transfers are the norm. More importantly, physical transactions cannot be easily tracked, making them ideal for tax evasion or the purchase of illegal goods.

Bitcoin is more vulnerable to changes from bad news because it affects bitcoin adopters but not so much non-adopters. They already have bitcoins so the change in price is basically instantaneous.

For a website that has tens of millions of dollars worth of coin being moved around from person to person, you'd think this is the kind of security you'd expect.
I once used a Get Paid To site (think bitcoin faucets but more full-fledged with options and paying in dollars) and this particular one takes fraud VERY seriously. You could only sign up using your home computer because that's where you should do all your offers and transactions. You can browse the site from anywhere, though. Also, only one account per household and you are not supposed to let anyone else use it, not even your relatives.
If you tried to withdraw points/cash from a computer away from home, they can freeze your account and you have to request a ticket to resolve the problem. Using proxies puts you into deeper shit. Repeat offenders get banned, and their funds likely get put back in a pool for other users to collect. If you are moving to a different address, you need to notify them so that you can continue using the website normally.
Rules like this could be set up elsewhere for exchanges, but I think 2FA would smooth things out as it will be more automated and require less ticket handling. As far as Blockchain goes, they always send a verification email if you use a browser's private mode (I use Chrome incognito on my laptop) as it would lack cookies and detect your browser as a new one.

I want a trading bot but it's not easy to find one that is 1. Free 2. Deals with bitcoin and 3. Take in more than 1 buy/sell order at a time.
And yes, it's frustrating to type in manually when prices are quickly changing. Buy at 500? Ooops, ask price went up to 505 when I submitted.
Also some exchanges don't have the option to enter how much bitcoin you want to buy in fiat values. Only in BTC values. Why? Some people want to buy in X dollars. Don't let me take out the calculator and figure it out.

Here's my first purchase experience. I bought 0.1 BTC when the price per coin was 250.90. The transaction was pending for 7 days. A week later (Nov. 12) when the price was well in the upper 300s, I received 0.1 BTC at the original price I paid for, $25.49. 40 cents of that was for the fees.
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:19:38
Prioritizing the smallest orders doesn't make much sense. That would maximize the ratio of expected BTC to actual BTC at the time of placing orders. Orders that are fulfilled first will be easier to predict the exchange rate because not much time has passed. 
The risk of getting a quantity much different than expected depends on the amount ordered, and the time of the wait. So wouldn't it make more sense to have small (low risk) orders put on a longer (high risk) wait, and large (high risk) orders on a short (low risk) wait? That way the risk among all the orders can be balanced as much possible. Combining longer wait times with the larger orders is a double-whammy of uncertainty.

This goes back to what the NSA did with Google's data- they weren't actually "cracking" the data, but just intercepting it through packet sniffing, before Google wised up and decided to start encrypting their data.
So would a strong encryption on the transaction data itself, before the server sends the data, be enough to thwart most interception attempts?

When people exchange bitcoins for dollars (or whatever their local currency is), it's essentially another purchase being made with them. I forgot who said it first, but in a way this makes bitcoin sort of a meta-currency.
It doesn't matter if people are cashing in with their bitcoins. It's still contributing to liquidity, and that indicates that people do want to use bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:22:49
I agree it's a problem but not inherent with bitcoin but how a lot of the media is treating bitcoin. It seems to be squarely put into the commodity section, with the hype of the dot-com boom. Hardly anyone talks about the technical and business-side benefits with bitcoin and its transaction system. People are just going "oh look at the prices" and don't get the big picture.
I think the bigger bottleneck for adoption lies in the infrastructure. The network limits 7 transactions per second (we already hit the 1 per second milestone this week), and larger blockchain size can become an issue. Also, the software and third party support for buying and storing bitcoins needs to become easier for anyone to use.
When the biggest bitcoin exchanges currently are seeing delays and hiccups in delivering to their customers, it's clear that the currency is still in beta phase.

There exist libraries to interpret and perform calculations with very large numbers, but we just have to hope they are bug-proof as with dealing with tossing money around.
The advantage of digital currencies over gold here is that it is more practical to count and manage very small amounts and differences. It's not as practical to measure value in micrograms of gold much less count them in atoms.

The crash from $30 was really severe, bringing down the coin to about 10% of its peak value. The crash in April reduced it to 30%. This recent crash was to 60%.

We also know that the gold supply will dwindle, but we just don't know when. It would be impossible to extract every last amount of resource for a profit, be it gold, oil or some other non-renewable, so we're only counting the practical-to-mine gold.
Disclaimer: I don't know what goes into the process of discovering gold deposits but as far as oil is concerned, it's highly agreed on that all of the easy-to-get light, sweet crude oil is already known and quickly dwindling in supply. Just as with coal, we've extracted the top quality stuff first, then as we needed more, get into lower-grade stuff, and also more expensive to extract. I don't know if that's the case with gold.

Good point. Bitcoin launched with no parity to any currency. Over a year later, an innocuous pizza purchase was made, and one thing lead to another. It went from a zero to having a non-zero value, and going back to zero is almost impossible.

How are they correlating individuals with bitcoin addresses?
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:54:59
I think most go to MtGox because it typically has the highest sale prices and we tend to also go by it as the current market price when talking about new ATH's. Prices are high because they've been shown to have difficulties withdrawing cash for customers, so they're willing to sell BTC there for more than Bitstamp or Btc-e.
Anyways, it is pretty sluggish on several fronts. I did something as basic as unchecking the box to disable the "use market prices" to sell option, and according to the browser's developer debugging tool- the average browser request time is 8 seconds. Doesn't seem acceptable for a fast-paced volatile market.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:10:58
2^160 addresses is approximately 1.4615016e+48.
With a max of just under 21 million bitcoins in existence that totals to about 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Or 2.1e+15 satoshis.
If you could distribute all bitcoins in the most wallet addresses possible (only 1 satoshi per wallet) the odds of getting a wallet address that has money in it is 1 in 6.95e+24.
So the chances of wallet address collision with an address in use are extremely small. That's less than 1 non-gold atom in 200 grams of pure gold.

I frequent two forums for gamers.. One of them have mostly people thinking bitcoin is a scam with the common "buttcoin" meme making rounds there. The other has a group dedicated to crypto miners (it's a big PC forum) that are interested in profiting and trading. Though there are still skeptics there.
In fact I first heard of Bitcoin in april in someone's topic saying "Told ya guys to buy Bitcoin!" and he posted a screenshot of his coinbase deposits of 20 BTC converted to dollars.
I have come to the conclusion that people that think bitcoin is scammy only read news when it concerns the price of bitcoin.

Nobody has mentioned yet that his conclusion makes sense since the amount of bitcoins that will be mined follows a logarithmic pattern? Roughly log2 n * 4 years if you smooth it to a curve. We already have mined over half the coins.
What's interesting is that this chart is on a log10 axis, not log2. Which means that, for the time being, both the market cap and value of the bitcoins are on an exponential growth.

I think more infrastructure (ie. big chains and stores accepting it) would just increase demand even more. Then we'd face our next big bottleneck which is network scalability. Unless it scales well enough to accommodate more transactions, it'll hit a serious crash and decline in value when that bottleneck is reached.
