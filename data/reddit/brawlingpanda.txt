Yeah, any broker will ask for verification. You can try the old school way and buying bitcoin in person through local bit coin I think its called. But they will prob sell you bitcoin at a up price. Try the ATM

ATM machines are easy, the one I used I found on google, it was at a liquor store... asked me to download bread wallet, and you show you bar code to the machine, Buy bitcoins but beward the fees will rape you. I put in $21 dollars and only got 8 dollars worth of BTC. You're best bet is to buy from coin base or better GDAX which is also owned by coinbase.

Why would anyone give a fuck that much tho, to pay more than what coin bases fees are?
For example, I bought bitcoin at a ATM machine, the fees completely raped me. For what ? Privacy? Is it that important?
