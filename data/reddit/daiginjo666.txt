I am interested in getting started in the bitcoin ecosystem, but I have limited computer science knowledge (a little python; I'm an undergrad Math major with some crypto experience and some understanding of finite fields)
Does anybody know anything about the internships at Blockchain.info?
I know they get a hard time, but what other resources would you recommend for somebody in my position to explore? 
I am a recent grad and have few responsibilities  financially and geographically.

So why does everyone hate on Blockchain.info all the time?
I don't use their wallet service, but sometimes I use them to check out charts or as a block explorer. 
I'm asking because I am looking to get started in bitcoin and saw their internship as one opportunity to enter the space.

I recently asked a form of this question. Of course it depends on your background. 
To summarize the answers I received - 
-Read and understand all of the documentation on bitcoin.org
-the bitcoin whitepaper  
- "If you want to get involved in Bitcoin development, it would be a good idea to have a basic understanding of programming and c++"
-the developer guide 
I made a similar post and bitcointalk .org and received those helpful replies.

Gemeni is fantastic when you don't require support. I had an issue a few weeks ago, and it was a nightmare getting it resolved.

I'm not aware of Gemeni's phone number. The number they have listed is to a government agency I believe.

Your first statement is false. The second one is awkward.

Yea a lot of US based poker players of course lost money and suffered greatly because of Black Friday, but, for me and for many others, this introduced us to bitcoin in 2012, late 2011. Although obviously bitcoin poker could not support most of those players at that time (and now). 
I look back the amount of coin I would play with on those sites (and stakes) at the current BTC/USD exchange rate and I would never play those stakes today lol.

Yea you can deposit with BTC on Americas Card Room and Ignition (changed Bovada =&gt; Ignition in the US iirc), but I'm not sure if they'll pay you out in coin
I used to play on betcoin for a few years, but not for a while. Worth checking out. 
I used to play on seals a few years ago as well, but "swc poker" is different. I played a little bit on there as well, but no idea about how the krill / promotions etc are
