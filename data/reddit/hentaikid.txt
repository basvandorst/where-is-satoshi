In some legal systems having a badge comes with a presumption of credibility. Does the US system not do this? 
e: I don't think people are understanding I'm not asking "ARE POLICEMEN HONEST?!" I'm saying there's actual legal statutes in some jurisdictions that say "Policemen have the presumption of honesty"
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:45:19
That's very nice, but if people can't earn it or spend it good luck convincing them it's a superior alternative and they should use it.

Hear hear. Bitcoin is perfect for adult artists but the intersection between potential customers and bitcoin users seems to be tiny, meaning few artists will bother to accept btc despite it's advantages. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:27:46
Oh sure, I'm just wondering, in some legal systems they do have to. Police and other public servants have the "presumption of honesty".
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:13:51
Are you talking about yourself? Because from where I'm standing bitcoin is a hard sell, it needs to be something that offers clear advantages to artists and dismissing problems because they don't affect you isn't really helpful.

I have a couple of services that let me cash out btc instantly here in Spain, what I don't have is anyone willing to pay me bitcoin :) 
If services like BTC point or bit2me worked in more countries, they'd be perfect.

It's in German, so start asking the German customers why they aren't buying... Obviously 99% of non-germans are going to wait until they see a site in their language.

From a user perspective, there's no difference. There are people here who are technically savvy and are still having their coin stolen, therefore casual users, never mind technically unsophisticated elders, have no effective means to secure their money under this system.

I'm interested in the censorship aspect, as in, avoiding it. Right now VISA &amp; MC have some extremely stringent regs on adult content online, so it's nice to sidestep that if possible

@_date: 2015-05-25 10:58:54
It would be positive if hackers and thieves knew their stolen btc would be blacklisted and unspendable. Not so good if this was applied to censorship or repression.
There are legitimate cases for blacklisting. Since the technology supports it maybe things will evolve with more granularity, i.e. you're able to refuse stolen bitcoin but are willing to take "donated to wikileaks" or "used to pay for porn" bitcoin

I am aware, I have a Venezuelan friend who travels regularly to Europe, has to petition to get the dollar quotas from the govt, I think he also had some $ squirreled away, the hard part is getting, or having the $. 
But yeah, I see your point, might be wiser to just put the money in $ acquired on the black market.

Jeremie Périn is a great animator. Check out Trucker's delight, also by him

I'll look into it, but billing is definitely the key issue for the adult industry right now. Hosting and registrars with strong anti censorship values aren't hard to find but billing and other sources of revenue are definite achilles heels

What about blackjack and hookers?
@_date: 2015-01-25 11:29:56
No, I've only used verotel as my processor, globill before that but they shut down in a rather explosive way. I've used epoch and ccbill as an affiliate (i.e. earning commissions when I send them joins). Those are the major adult ispsp services, there are a few others but I'm not aware of them. 
They charge a higher percentage, have fixed fees and you have to get approval for your content, but that's the way it works if you want to have credit card processing. 
It's likely any centralized bitcoin processor will adopt similar rules

It's not my work alas, I just posted it as an example of something that couldn't be on a paysite (Underage characters!!)
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:50:28
Indeed, I can even use bit2me to convert my btc to euros, but the problem is the demographic overlap between btc users and the people who'd be willing to sponsor my work (The paysite model is pretty much dead, too much free content)

Not in Venezuela, acquiring $ is extremely regulated, you need to justify it, and there are quotas.

Well, it's tiny because it's brand new, but I hope it to be a meeting place for artists who want to accept btc and comissioners who want to pay with it. 
One idea I have is mini crowdfunding... post a sketch and a btc address, let people fund it if they like it

Nanotech won't let you make gold, you need a particle accelerator or a nuclear reactor to do that
But a nanotech fabber like you describe would disrupt economy to such a degree that a dollar bill would be a pointless thing to duplicate.

Linda and Ged are nickle and diming over 2 quid, outlook not so good over a magic internet gimmick that's likely to lose more than that overnight
E: I have bitcoin processing for my adult site via verotel. Guess what, if you use a processor that converts to fiat you still need to get that money into your account. So Linda and Ged get one BTC customer a year and have to pay a 25$, or whatever it is, wire transfer fee to get their money. For a small business, fees matter.

You might want to read Charlie Stross's Singularity Sky, in it a 19th century style planet is visited by an advanced civilization, the Festival, who have this kind of technology. They rain down cellphones from orbit and offer people anything they want in exchange for stories.
Oh and nanotech would not let you make gold from scratch but it would probably make extraction extremely simple so it would kinda let you have rare materials.
Anyway, for science fiction scenarios you might as well read entertaining novels by the masters who have explored those ideas. Stross is a good one. Accelerando goes from 21st century to the singularity and beyond.
