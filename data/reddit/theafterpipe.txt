Regarding your actual question, yes, it is very easy and intuitive to buy/sell BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH on Coinbase. They are known for having a fantastic UI.

I think you need to check your title: What do you mean by "sells in 5 states"? If you're referring to the states to which Robinhood is opening its crypto market, they will definitely expand that after a while. Otherwise, I have been using Robinhood for a long time before today in a state not listed.

Yes I would, and others are correct that Coinbase's fees are pretty steep. I would put in the effort to learn how to navigate an exchange like Gemini, although the learning curve is very low.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:28:21
I did a little homework before I started trading on Binance and I thought this was very clear from the get-go.
One thing that frustrates me is my inability to turn my paltry BCH into something better. :/

Take a basic finance course and learn the time value of money. That will start you somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:13
You are advocating leaving an exchange because they support another crypto? You are ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:59:22
What a well thought-out response to a simple request for clarification...
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:40
As others have said, a fee was levied.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:18:33
Same. Was tipped back in 2013. I forgot about it until I randomly found my wallet earlier this week. Has about $18 in it now.

Thanks. Will do that and let you know the result.

Never mind testing purposes.
But common sense and critical thinking really isn't part of this sub anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:50:49
Where are all of these demanding posts coming from? You're upset because a large business hasn't implemented a change you want in your desired time-frame? You're making ridiculous accusations ("don't care enough" [how much is enough to you? obviously it's only when you get what you want]) based on assumptions (have an "army of programmers").
Man, you need to take a step back and realize that a lot has happened in the cryptocurrency market in just a matter of a few weeks. Just because you have a myopic view of what you want doesn't mean there are underlying issues that need to be addressed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:19:30
What do you mean by "neutral"? BCH is a legitimate crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:05:58
I've been hodling since 2013 and I learn something new every day. For instance, I did not know that Square Cash has already implemented BTC purchases...
Be careful of paying attention only to "profits". The dismay of lost value has a tendency to be proportional to the excitement of gains.

Back in the day, I submitted my information to start trading on MTGox. It took several days and I was getting impatient. I had some BTC that I had mined all ready to go. During that time, MTGox went under. I just barely dodged that bullet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:40:49
You got sources on that shiny info?

Before Bitcoin, there was no way to reliably send money over the internet without going through financial intermediaries such as credit card companies or banks. Exchanging different currencies could be troublesome with large amounts of money.
Bitcoin eliminates these issues by providing a Peer-to-Peer method of transferring money across the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:36:26
I don't know why you're being downvoted for an honest question/mistake... I know this conversation sure helped my understanding.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:59:58
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:08:07
Coinbase exists to make a profit like every other business out there.
Not your wallet; not your coins.
**Also remember:**
Coinbase has done an incredible job at making it easy to acquire and hold Bitcoin. They've been there for BTC through the MT.Gox issues, and they've been there through many dips in BTC value.
No one is forced to use Coinbase; they can make their own decisions. So far, exactly none of their decisions cause me to be dis-interested in continuing to bring them my business.

I stopped watching because he was unintelligible. Shame because it seemed interesting. I tried.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:37:03
I should still be able to access the BTC since I have the PK and the address is correct, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:20:45
None of these are legitimate reasons. Your opinions on what makes a coin legitimate or not really has no bearing on whether anything "illegal" or "unethical" occurred and your emotions are clearly guiding your thought process.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:14
Read your parent comment again; they are in no way criticizing Bitcoin; just the religious mentality that vilifies dissenting opinions.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:00:44
What about transporting my gains to another person's wallet? Is the tax burden moved to that wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:34:58
You're so brave to bring this out in public.

I reset the cache and nothing happened, but after I updated the app, it worked and my balance is correct. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:31:39
Wait, why can't I trust Coinbase after today?

Decentralized and unregulated - what did you expect?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:01:12
Absolutely do. the day they implement Segwit, however, there will be posts reminding everyone that “Coinbase prioritized a shill over BTC progress” or something dumb like that just to justify their irrational behavior.

I have not left Coinbase at all. I've been using Coinbase for many years and they have proven themselves to be nothing but reliable and user-friendly.

Luke-jr? Huh. I used to play on his servers in Armagetron Advanced waaaay back in the day.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:42:11
Same - almost started using them when everything blew up. I guess I dodged a bullet, there. Although, I only ever was able to mine about 0.01 BTC.

In the future, I don't believe we will be using Bitcoin to purchase $3 coffee. I believe Bitcoin may be used to back currencies, or other cryptocurrencies will be used to purchase $3 coffee. I believe Bitcoin will be used to move large sums of money across borders and over great distances for a very low charge.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:13:50
Thank you, that was very informative.

Did you use a hardware wallet or have them transferred to an online wallet?

For now, be aware you need to keep your private key secret and generate a receiving/send address.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:18:43
Yeah and since I mined mine, I don't consider it gambling since the experience was more valuable to me than the fraction of a coin I mined.

Candlestick charts display market sentiment.
The top and bottom shelves of the candlestick indicate where the price of BTC opened that minute (or five minute period, hour, day, etc....).
The green candlestick means the price opened low and closed high (increase).
The orange candlestick means the price opened high and closed low. (decrease)
The "wicks" extending out the top and bottom indicate what price BTC was trading during that time - it could have traded higher than the open price, or lower.
it looks like each stick in your picture is a half-hour's time.
For instance, if you look at the very first candlestick in your picture, you'll notice it is green, has no wick at the top, and a little wick at the bottom. This means it opened that half hour at a particular price, traded a little lower (the little wick extending down), but ultimately ended the half hour a bit higher than before.
in reverse, if you look a bit before the 23:05 mark, you'll see a large, orange candlestick. This indicates that at this half hour, the price opened at a little bit below $8,100, traded all the way up above $8,100, but ultimately ended trading almost at $7,800 - a dramatic decrease in price.
People use these indicators to track buyer sentiment and try to read these in such a way as to time the market for dips and rises.

This article was written by the type of guy who just constantly asks "But what gives Bitcoin its value?" even after you explain it to him.
He constantly quotes people who themselves admit they don't understand how bitcoin works or just think it is criminal currency. Or simply currency, period, without considering the underlying technology.
He constantly takes at face-value the opinions of a set few people
The Bitcoin Bubble and Why Experts Believe it is Real... They believe a bubble is real because they have no idea how it works or any inkling of understanding of the underlying technology.

I mined all my bitcoin way back in the day, if you consider that an investment. Recently I bought a (very) small amount just to augment my collection and to play around with other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:14:45
I am not "all in" - though my risk is very low since I mined most of my BTC in 2013 - so I really haven't invested much more than time. While I think being all in is foolish for any investment, I also think that it is silly to stay on the sidelines. Participation is just too fun!
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:30:05
Honestly, to have anything at all invested in any cryptocurrency to me is a thrill. I enjoy participating in this incredible experiment and it gives me a chance to learn more about things some pretty interesting ideas that span technology, finance, and psychology.

As someone who works in the IT department at a medical facility, that question has come up among me and my co-workers.
1. Bitcoin mining would produce next to nothing. Ethereum mining might be a slightly more profitable venture.
2. Ethical questions come up with power consumption.
3. HIPAA audits would shut that bizness down. They scan the networks and if they see any funny business, especially rogue mining programs, they could consider us to be in violation.
4. Open or closed, A/V can pick up mining programs and log the activity.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:24:58
I think it would take a significant event to bring it down lower than $5,400. Otherwise, I imagine it will hodl around $5,800 - $6,200.
