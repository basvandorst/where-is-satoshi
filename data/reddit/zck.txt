I made a few cold storage wallets according to [this guide on bitcoin.it]( I transferred a very small amount of bitcoin into one wallet, and want to move it to a second wallet, just so I know I'm all set up to do so.
But the problem I'm having is that when I start up Bitcoin Core with my first cold storage wallet, and try to send to my second cold storage wallet, I get an error stating "the amount exceeds your balance".
My best guess is that because I haven't synced the parts of the blockchain that show deposits into my first cold wallet, the Bitcoin Core program doesn't think I have anything in the wallet.
But the "how to retrieve funds" part of the guide says downloading the blocks is optional. How can I send the bitcoin from the cold storage wallet without downloading the entire blockchain?

Do you have a source for this? We know that reddit's traffic [doubled in 2011]( and if it was a steady increase [in 2012]( , doubled again^1 . So you'd think that reddit was way smaller four years before our data begins.
[1] If you start at 2.065 billion pageviews, and increase by 6% every month for twelve months, you get 36.92 billion pageviews for the year.

Well, that's fair. One thing I was thinking while I wrote the comment was that I only found monthly uniques for December 2011, and yearly uniques for 2012, which obviously aren't comparable in the same way that pageviews are for the month and year. But I forgot to write it. Oops.
Definitely reddit's slowed; that's for sure. I'd just think that, in the six years since reddit was bought in October 2006, the uniques must have gone up more than eightfold. This is especially true if it used to double yearly.
But I'm certainly willing to accept your data, and I'd love to see more from reddit.
N.b. it's weird that we're both downvoted to 0. Or at least, we were until I upvoted your comment. I don't get why people would downvote a fact-based, calm discussion. Meh.
