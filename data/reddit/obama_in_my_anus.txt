Your comments are comedy gold.  That strategy would NEVER be used in this scenario by anyone with any financial investment knowledge whatsoever.
As I continue to try and teach you people the three basic rules of financial investing:
1.  Diversification.
2.  Diversification.
3.  Diversification.
If you have more than 20-25% (and that's on the high side) of your investment dollars invested in bitcoins you are retarded.  Absolutely retarded.   That's the best medical condition I can think of describe a person of such mental deficiencies.

Ouch. You admiitting to such sn egregious flaw exemplifies why you  don't have a single solitary clue when it comes to financial/money management.
 
Let me take the time to school you for a moment and give you the top three ways of being the most successful at investing:
1.  Diversification.
2.  Diversification.
3.  Diversification.
You are the reason Bitcoin is doomed to fail.  
That's because you don't have a clue as to what you're doing with your most valuable liquid asset.  
Your own money.  
Not a single, solitary clue.
And here's a perfect example to prove it:
Question:  at what price point have you put in a stop loss order at?
Answer:  you haven't.  Of course you haven't.
You're like the typical blue haired ladies sitting at  Vegas slot machines, continually pumping quarters in because eventually "you know it's gotta hit."
Anyhow, I know you don't have any stop loss orders placed and therefore that tells me all I need to know.  That you're gonna ride this out until the price hits $0.00054, because "eventually it's gotta hit."
Here's the real world answer:  No.  No it doesn't.

Hating it????
Like the saying goes at McDonald's:  "***I'm LOVIN' it!***"
Today is yet just another entry into why Bitcoin is a failure...
***Entry no. 5,724:***  there is no "fail-safe" mechanism built into the buy/selling of Bitcoin like there is for the NYSE.  Unlike bitcoin, if there is a sudden drop in the NYSE, there is a fail-safe system in place where the market automatically shuts down.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no such system in place.
Blah, why am I even wasting my time trying to explain concepts like these when they're obviously way over your head, intellectually wise.
You obviously don't know know the  first thing when it comes to financial investments, and you most likely never will.

No problemo!
1.  First the pro-shill bitcoin article writer starts out with "***Why the Bitcoin Price Drop is Great News***" 
2.  He then goes on to back up his assertion with-  "***Reason  – A Lower Price is a Better Price...   This price drop doesn’t scare you, does it? Rich people see an investment’s value drop, buy low, and then sell when it rebounds. Poor people buy high, panic, and sell low. That is the easiest and most obvious reason. Buying something that was once almost $1200 for less than $400 is a good thing.***"
  
So, would you agree with me that he's saying it's a good thing that the drop in the price of bitcoin  is a good thing because now you can buy more of it? 
 I certainly hope you agree because that's exactly what he says.
He then completely contradicts himself by then stating:
1.  "***And how many times over the last year have you heard someone on TV, online, or in an investment discussion say “Buy Gold &amp; Silver!”? You hear it almost every day. So how is silver down about 25% over the last year, and gold has dropped more than $100?  If you believe everything you’re told about ... the price of gold and silver, you are walking blind without a cane.***"
Soooooo....  Buying bitcoins because the price has dropped like a rock is a great thing to do, but in the same breath, you're blind if you invest in silver or gold because their price has dropped as well.
But fret not your troubled heart!  The  article writer proclaims he has "***a financial investment background on Wall Street,***". 
Yah, and I've deposited checks at my bank once or twice in my life so I guess that means I must have "***an investment background in Banking.***"
I'd love to know what his  "financial investment background on Wall Street"  really consists of.   Probably not a heck of a lot because he doesn't know jack shit about how investing and statistics work.

Lol...  the bankers own the Washington politicians.  It's bitcoin that has already lost.  Game over, man; game over.
Heck, even Bill Gates learned the hard way that you have to pay to play and finally gave in to having to pay off Washington politicians.  
Here's the timeline from when Microsoft stayed out of Washington D.C. politics to finally realizing they have to bribe the politicians in order for the politicians not to put Microsoft out of business:
1.  1994:  Microsoft takes pride in having "no presence" in Washington D.C.
2.  1995:  Microsoft sets up a $16,000.00 annual lobbying budget.
3.  2012:  Microsoft's annual lobbying budget: $8,090,000.00.
When it comes to bitcoin, the banks are laughing all the way, well, all the way to the bank.  
If Washington politicians can break Microsoft, bitcoin doesn't have a chance.
**Note to all of you bitcoiners:** You better somehow set up a way to coordinate paying off the Washington politicians.  If you don't have your own lobbyists shelling out millions of $$$ to get the votes to go your way, you are absolutely, positively gone.
And basically, you bitcoiners are already gone.  There's no way you're going to outspend the banks when it comes to paying the lobbyists to funnel the bribe money to the politicians.  
Buh-bye, bitcoiners; buh-bye.
edit:  a word.

People who are selling are those who:

2.  Thought it was a sure fire get rich plan.
3.  Bought bitcoins with money they really couldn't spare.
4.  Have  bills that keep coming due every month so they have to sell, even at a loss, to free up some cash to pay those bills.
That's why it's so simple of an understanding as to why the price will continue to drop like a rock.

I think there was an autocorrect issue with your reply but it sounds like you think the bitcoin price could increase by +10%.  Which would still keep the price in the $300's.  Not exactly a steller increase.
I'm not sure why you thought a publicly traded "Wall St. vehicle", even if opened by now, would increase the price.
I made the prediction a couple months ago (roughly, i'm too lazy to look up the exact date)  that when bitcoin entered into the $300's that ~$400 would forever be its ceiling.
So far, i'm beating every bitcoin "expert" out there with their predictions.


That's an easy one.  Overall, It'll remain in the $300's; with some possible spikes due to manbullwhale (or whatever he's called), but overall it'll level out in the $300's for the rest of the year.  
That's a completely easy call to make.

Even an anchor will bounce prior to settling into the ocean floor.
Seriously though, you use the term "market" when in fact that's the whole thing wrong with bitcoin.  There are no market forces established that can enable it to go higher.  Only a bunch of people that have no idea how to trade stocks and that live by the motto of "I don't care how low it goes... I'm in it for the long haul!!!"
If people aren't putting stop orders on their trades then they should be sitting on the sidelines until they learn the basics.

My eyes are on the words of a slightly wealthy man - Mark Cuban, who compares Bitcoin to gold and says central banks will never let it truly succeed.
That's what it all comes down to; bitcoiners have absolutely no idea of the power of the central banks.
Question:  How many bank executives went to jail over the $7,600,000,000,000.00 banking monetary meltdown? (the actual monetary loss is debatable, but the $7.6 trillion loss seems to be a middle of the road estimate.  YMMV)
Answer:  The answer is the same as the chance of bitcoin succeeding; and that answer is 0.00
Unless the central banks have complete control of the bitcoin currency, it is doomed to fail.  Therefore the only outcome for bitcoin is its ultimate collapse.
An analogy I created:  The central banks have all the cards and yet bitcoiners still want to play Texas Hold 'em poker with them.  Bitcoiners still don't realize they have no cards to play; the central banks have them all.

Define the following as they relate to the article:

2.  Bitcoin purchases
3.  Exchange market
4.  Bitcoin services
Seems like all this pertains to is not paying a commission VAT when buying stocks with bitcoin.  But I don't know for certain, so that's why I'm asking for clarification on the definition/scope of this decision.
To the degree that this will have any impact on anyone/anything?  Most likely zero.

Well, I first have to laugh at this Bitcoin genius -  - who, with all of his charts and graphs, is spouting all sorts of future  price points... $475, $1,750, $200... But the one that got me laughing was when he projected one scenario being that the price to be at $470 by either last Sunday night or today.  It hasn't exactly happened yet.
And while i sit here with no charts, no graphs, no logarithmic equations;  I see that the price is still averaging $400 which is exactly I said its ceiling is.  
$470?  Not quite, Mr. Bitcoin genius author.  Not quite.
@_date: 2014-11-01 17:35:41

3.  You have no 401(k) plan.
4.  You have no clue what a Roth IRA is.
5.  You have no dividend paying stocks in your "portfolio".
I could go on and on, but the continual "yes" answers would become as tedious as your personality.
As I stated several weeks ago, $400 will be forever the ceiling of Bitcoin.  And would you looky there.... Bitcoin is currently holding steady at $398.
Now for the rest of you.... Please bring on the downvotes!!!  That only proves that deep in your minds that you're starting to panic about your "investment"... That it's not going to the moon as you had hoped.... And you overextended yourself in buying more coins than you could realistically afford.  And now the rent bill is coming due.  Along with the utility bills.  And maybe even some college loan payments.  Yes, the panic is setting in.  Soon you will have to sell at a loss to pay those bills.
So please, downvote away!!! I feed on your fears. I hunger for them as those fears turn into the stark realities of having to pay all of those monthly bills.  And there's no profit coming in from your coins that you were counting on to pay those bills.  Those never ending bills.  Like the tip of a dentist's drill bit that keeps drilling deeper and deeper into your tooth until it drills into the nerve.  And then the pain becomes even more severe.   Yes, downvote awayyyyyyyy!!!!

Exactly that.  Nobody is cutting losers and looking for a "bottom" to coke back in.
It's all panic selling.  People have to pay their bills even if it means cashing out at a loss.
Basically, bitcoin is like a pawn shop or one of those Pay Day Loan  places... You start out with enough cash  to live on and then you quickly end upside down financially wise.
People are trying to flip bitcoins like people tried flipping houses a few years back.  Sure, some people made money off of doing so (like I did), but a majority of the people lost their shirts because they didn't have the first clue about what they were getting into.

I completely agree that people are starting to take notice.  I'm a waiter at a Red Lobster in Manhattan and just the other week a patron decided to pay his bill with btc. 
So I whipped out my portable POS and it was a magical moment as the QR code was scanned and the transaction was competed.
A table of young lawyers sat nearby and their jaws nearly hit the floor as they witnessed that glorious moment. "I thought the stories of btc were too good to be true, but now that I've seen it for myself, I'm now a btc believer."
  
I then took the generous tip they left and decided to see "Aladdin" that night in the city. I met a pretty girl along the way and asked her to come with me. We talked about btc and even held hands as the show began.
   
After it was over, we kissed as she left on the train to go home.
What a great night, all thanks to btc.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:56:57


Wow.  Just when I thought I have just read the most ignorant statement about bitcoins, you come along and top it.


Yes, I'm sure that's just an oversight on BOA, Goldman Sachs, et al of forgetting to put you on their internal email routing lists.
The central banks have ***TRILLIONS*** of dollars at their disposal to squash bitcoin at any moment they wish.
Let me take a moment and give you a little free schooling:  
It all comes down to one thing.... 
Banks making their shareholders happy.  
And the very second the banks see their shareholders unhappy because of bitcoin, bitcoin will be wiped off of the map.

Money eventually leads to corruption and Bitcoin will be no different.  Besides, do you *really* think the big banks like Goldman Sachs are going to sit by and let Bitcoin take away part of their share of the pie?  Or the Federal Reserve - a privately held company with basically no accountability?
I have to laugh at the naivety of comments such as yours.  You have no idea how easily Bitcoin will be crushed if it ever does show even the smallest of possibilities of taking away usage of the American dollar.
Congress (bought and paid for by the big banks) will easily shut Bitcoin down in a heart beat if the banks tell them to.
Bitcoin is a pipe dream.  Or a more apt description is it is a pipe bomb.  There's zero percent of it not blowing up unless the big banks take control of it.
It's just that simple.  All they have to do is make one phone call to Congress and there will be an immediate law passed stating that Bitcoin transactions have been linked to funding terrorist organizations and henceforth all Bitcoin transactions are illegal and subject to lengthy prison sentences.
Bitcoin is a lost cause.  Get out while you still can.

I'm wondering if there is any statistics on the average age of a Bitcoin "investor".  I'm guessing most are in their low 20's..  The ones that have no idea on how 401(K) work, or how IRA's work, or how financial institutions work in general.  That's why indeed Bitcoin will crash because, as you pointed out, people will begin to realize Bitcoin is not an investment vehicle, and eventually bail out.
To any potential replies to my post....  I said " most", not "all".  So please refrain from letting me know you're not in that age group and that you are one of the special ones that know what you are doing.  Thank you in advance.

Best of luck!  So far you've made a little profit.

I care!
Ok, not really.  
    
But at least I tried.

I hadn't thought of the tax implication before....  How would that work?  Since you're not buying something in dollar currency, how are taxes collected?

Sounds like that's a good buy-in point.  The value has dropped too fast to buy in at anything higher; there could be some more drops in the making.

Currently bitcoin is more like a rock than the moon.  The price right now is &lt;$640.00 and shows no signs of this free fall drop.

I would but I lost my health care.  Thanks, Obama!

You might want to use that noose to yank bitcoin out of its free fall!  ;)

Thank you all for the common consensus.  I'll wait.

You must be ecstatic right now because the cleansing is currently &lt;$630.00.  Ooops... now it's &lt;$620.00... Ooops... now it's &lt;$610.00.  If this keeps up then bitcoin is going to be the cleanest thing around!  ;)

bitcoin price just dropped into the $500.00's.  Cha-Ching!!!  Currently at $580.00 and showing no signs of stopping!

I haven't heard of that one - thank you for the link.

Exactly that.   Nobody at the Fed wants to be responsible for killing the Golden Goose.  QE is here to stay.
