I definitely think this is the biggest barrier to adoption by more people. It was one of the main reasons I didn't get into bitcoin 5 years ago when I first learned about it. I thought it was interesting, but I didn't know how to go about buying and storing bitcoin, and didn't trust myself to learn/understand everything necessary to do so. Oh well! Now I'm taking my time educating myself and going to play around with a small amount this year to learn the ropes and hopefully make my noob mistakes with a very small pot of money.

Coinbase won't let me past the phone verification stage. I was able to submit all my info to Gemini, but I expect verification to take 2-4 weeks because of other people's reports. I was able to get verified on Bitflyer in 2 days, which is awesome. Bitfinex and Binance were no-gos for me when I tried. I haven't tried Bittrex yet though.

Awesome idea! Thank you!
Noticed a small typo on the definition for "Mooning" - it should be *strapped* not *straped*
Edit: Found a few more: 
"Pump and Dump" - *inflated* and *exaggerated* are misspelled 
"Signature" - *handwriting* 
"Smart Contract" - *fulfillment* 
Not trying to be a grammar nazi, just trying to help you polish it up! &lt;3

Your local Barnes&amp;Noble or similar bookstore, probably!

Isn't appalling a bad thing? Did you mean appealing?

Since the IRS considers crypto a type of 'property' not a currency, the better analogy is that you are bartering one piece of property for another when you buy a car with Bitcoin.
As far as the valuation - these things definitely can be negotiable and ambiguous for other types of assets like stocks and real estate property, so that is not new. As long as you can show the IRS how you came up with your valuation and it was done in a reasonable and logical manner, then you won't get in trouble. Whether your Bitcoin was worth $14,000 on one exchange and $14,280 on another at the exact same moment doesn't matter much in the scheme of things. You just have to pick one and be able to justify that choice if you are audited.

No, that's probably not a smart move. It should be the approximate price at the time of the trade. Otherwise how would the IRS account for profits made by day traders (of crypto or more traditional equities)?
