I apologize for not being clear or explaining myself. The intent of the article is to show issues bitcoin can solve. It is correct to say what she did was wrong and illegal. I am not condoning illegal activity. It is difficult to say what she did was immoral or unethical based on the limited facts. With that being said we also can’t measure her intent to deceive, which all may be a result of her lack of understanding (that she couldn’t bring x amount of money on the plane without reporting). I think it is a reasonable assumption to say that she would take fiat because she wanted to avoid major fees in converting fiat, and/or wiring money. Bitcoin can solve a lot of these issues. Ultimately she and many others, wouldn’t be having issues like this if they had crypto. You guys may be right in saying this is not the best example, but a lot of people don’t trust banks so they carry fiat everywhere. It’s a pretty common issue.

Quality is actually a lot better than I thought! Same with the body type. It fits perfectly on me. Also you can find it on amazon. Get them before Nike complains!

If you want an instant buy, sign up for Bitstamp! The verification didn't take that long and after that you can just charge however much of bit coin you want onto your card!

I'm going to be honest, nothing is really 100% safe. Even coinbase was compromised once upon a time. If you are looking to make big trades buy a trezor and secure your coins that way. But other than that you pretty much don't really have a choice if you are trying to buy bitcoins with a debit card. Although if I were you, I would switch to GDAX ( owned by coinbase, and you can use the same pass and username) it haves a smaller fee and you can always just do a bank deposit! Bank deposits for me took one day that's it.
