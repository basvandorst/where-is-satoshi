they used illegal NSA spying powers and hacked the Iceland server, all of which could not be admitted to in court because it would make that evidence unable to be used.
I personally still believe Karpeles was the one who took over and handed it back not long before the busts (after Karpeles found out via the feds that the investigation was happening when they seized all Gox USA coins, it was handed back as he knew they were coming after them) and shortly after that it was all over.

if you run a website and someone blocks your ads, you aren't being deprived of anything.
if you own a clothing store and someone is stealing your stock, you are losing money and product. but if i go to buy your clothes and ignore every billboard and ad in the store, THAT ISNT THEFT!
if you own a restaurant and people skip out on the check, that isn't the same as people coming and ignoring advertisements you put up all over the restaurant area.
"If enough people agree with you, companies will have to find another business model. But what you're doing, blocking their revenue source and consuming their content anyway, is theft."

yes, because being unemployed (which I am not) and hating intrusive internet advertisements has some similarities?
what exactly are they you faggot?
I've owned plenty of websites, did I cry when people blocked my ads? NO
if someone blocks your ads, you come up with a non-intrusive way of making money (sell merch, sell anything, ask for donations) dont be a turd when adsense says you've had a million hits and only getting a few thousand dollars.

theft is not piracy. blocking ads on a news page or other website while consuming their text is not theft. it's not even in the realm of piracy.
I can block audio, video on websites that automatically load, is that theft? because the website creator wants to FORCE me to listen to his song or video, but im blocking it.... IS THAT THEFT?
why the fuck do you keep referring to someone stealing an actual physical thing, 
these websites aren't offering you their content in return for you viewing their ads, they are offering you their content and have then put up ads to try and suck some money out of it.
if their content is shit, no one comes. if their content is good, they throw up ads and try and monetize the free content.
crying about missing out on ad revenue on a website is just as stupid as all your fucked up examples which you don't even understand.
if im watching TV and i pre record it and skip the ad breaks, IS THAT THEFT? of course not you dumb fucking cunt.
going by your examples, If I read the local free community newspaper and refuse to look at any of the advertisements, then I'm a thief and I'm stealing from the paper.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:41:51

pop ups and pop unders ARE wrong, the simple fact that advertising companies look at how adblock etc works and come up with ways to get around that when they should work out alternative methods of revenue.

re: the russians, the ruble has dropped 60% of it's value in the last two months so you'll probably see a lot of them not travelling anymore. huge condo developements in Jomtien just out of Pattaya have now been abandoned completely and wont finish possibly ever.
re the chinese, they are literally the scum of tourism. in hong kong, they called them 'dirty dumplings' from the mainland. every single country you go to they don't know how to line-up (that's their culture I guess to push in), spit everywhere, block access to roads, entrances, etc
the chinese government sent a notice out last year or year before telling it's citizens to wake up when travelling abroad because each year they are voted the worst people to travel and before them it was the Americans.

reddit is a retarded lot. At first everyone loved Karpeles, then the hack, then everyone on the reddit HATED him. He came back and offered some messages about what he can and cannot talk about and everyone again while not exactly loving him, upvoted all his comments and had the idea that he was OK and hard done by, by the US government most likely.
now the Japanese arrest him to questioning and everyones saying FUCK YOU MARK, YOU DIRTY DOG blah blah... but nothing has changed, no new evidence has come out.
the same morons if he is found innocent will come out and praise his ass and everything he's done yet again.

The program, codenamed PRISM, is considered highly classified and has never been made public before. The list of companies involved are the who's who of Silicon Valley: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple. Dropbox, though not yet an official part of the program, is said to be joining it soon. These companies have all willingly participated in the program, says the Post.


don't you honestly think that if Apple was one of the only true platforms that couldn't be viewed by the NSA, that they would shout it as loud as they can for years and have it in newspapers with them giving interviews about it constantly?
would that not be telling pedos and terrorists "hey you fuckers, use Apple products and we're all safe"
after all the LulzSec and HBGary leaks Apple was busted and then released an official press release lying to everyone
