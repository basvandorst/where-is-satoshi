@_date: 2017-12-05 07:40:28
All altcoin investments are really investments into bitcoin with the investor hoping that the chosen altcoin will outperform or dethrone bitcoin. Long term, this is *highly* unlikely.
Sidechains pegged to bitcoin will bust the altcoin bubble. No more pump &amp; dumps. No more ICOs. No more airdrops. No more premining. No more bootstrapping a value token.

Where can I invest in an internet competitor?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:33:23
\*sigh\* My point is that there's no competition. Because it doesn't make sense. With the internet, you want to be able to connect to everyone else. WIth money, you want to be able to exchange it with everyone else. Preferrably without the need to convert.
While sidechains don't exactly eliminate the need for conversion (*for a reason*), they will all be tied to / based on the same type of money behind the scenes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:52:40


I don't *know* if I'm right and you don't *know* that I'm wrong. I'm offering an interpretation that I *believe* is closer to reality than yours.


That's basically one of two reasons why currently they do:
A) buy it as a hedge against BTC in case it fails completely or in relation to the coin I'm investing in.
B) buy for the unique properties the coin offers (Privacy on Monero, ~~BeanieBabies~~ CryptoKitties on Ethereum)
Altcoins that bring something to the table but bootstrapped their own blockchain will fall victim to sidechains. And as Bitcoin continues to... not die... and improve... the expected value of (A) will fall and fall.
Having only one, as close to perfect as possible type of money is the most preferrable outcome for everybody.

You're missing the point that bitcoin is the internet in your Myspace / AOL / etc. analogy. Ethereum is perhaps pets.com before the dotcom bubble burst. Do you feel we will see an internet competitor any time soon? I don't think that's even remotely conceivable.
As long as you think alts have a future, it's my opinion that you're undervaluing bitcoin (whatever price tag you personally put on it). Sidechains will completely obliterate even the (so far) worthwile altcoin experiments.
I don't think you are a shill. Your position is probably reasonable in relation to the amount of time you spent thinking about all of this / the information you have. But the real "holy shit!" moment is yet to come.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:59:13


Because sidechains enable altcoins that are pegged to bitcoin. It allows for permissionless innovation and exploration of specific use cases without entering into competition with bitcoin. This is far better than trying to bootstrap your own value token if you're just interested in smart contract experiments or stronger privacy guarantees. ICOs, premines and pump &amp; dumps will be history.


Explain why they wouldn't be better off existing as a bitcoin sidechain?

A blockchain without a native token is a rube goldberg machine for something that established distributed database systems do far better. You can create a blockchain without bitcoin, but you absolutely do need *some* coin for it to make sense. Because without one, you have no miners. Without mining, you need some form of central control. And once you reach that point you might as well just setup a plain old database and increase efficiency several orders of magnitude.
If you "dump the B$", then the tech and game theory around bitcoin is completely worthless.
You need a token. What you call that token is completely irrelevant. But the thing with bitcoin is that it already successfully established itself as a valuable token. It did that first and organically. Do not underestimate that. It's highly unlikely that some other coin is just going to come along and replace it. For that to even have a chance of happening, you'd need a technological breakthrough that allows a hypothetical successor to do everything that bitcoin does but far better. Some innovation that cannot be leveraged by bitcoin and can itself not leverage bitcoin for its purposes.
Many projects claim to be exactly that. 98% of them are outright lying to you. The rest is either acknowledging considerable trade-offs or their developers are incompetent / in denial.

Any bitcoin user who doesn't want to trust anyone else does need their own fullnode. That's just an indisuptable fact.


In this case we do know better than he did at the time.
He assumed true SPV would be possible, but so far neither Satoshi nor anyone else in the world was able to pull that off and some think it's entirely impossible.
Without SPV, or specifically without the ability of non-fullnodes to detect any bitcoin rule violations, big server farms as a scaling solution are out of the picture.
I'm 100% sure Satoshi would agree, because this would reintroduce trust into the system. The entire point of bitcoin is to not have to trust anyone. Including miners.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:05:42

Fair enough.
To me it looked like BIPs that get to a state that indicates completion tend to end up being implemented in core with very few exceptions. This, combined with the fact that it's located in the same github org made it look like BIPs are more of a core thing in practice. (BU also felt the need to establish BUIPs which maybe wouldn't be the case if BIPs were truly seen as neutral ground.)


Well I'd say that BIPs go beyond GH issues and PRs in terms of detail and process and are also helpful with stuff proposed and implemented by and for the core project.

@_date: 2017-09-13 09:06:48
This, again, boils down to the question "Who controls bitcoin?".
My take is that users do. Not miners. Not businesses. Not developers. Only in the sense that they're users as well.
In no way shape or form is merging 2x in core's interest. Neither is firing core in the interest of everyone else including miners and businesses.
The NYA is posturing with little to back it up in the end. It's only a thing because of Barry Silbert's and DCG's influence over many of the participants and the fact that a lot of CEOs were just tired of this impasse and didn't (or still don't) fully grasp the implications of a "compromise for the sake of compromise" in this environment.
S2X will fail. It needs to if bitcoin wants to stand a chance.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:39:07
SW2X activates @ block  If I'm not mistaken that means we will be 43% into a difficulty period. So if there's a significant miner exodus (which I highly doubt) the bitcoin network needs to find 1,152 blocks with a lower hashrate.
Let's say 5% hashrate stays with bitcoin. That's 7,2 blocks per day. So we would need a little over 5 months to retarget.
With 10% hashrate remaining, we'd need 80 days. And so on.
This would suck, but it wouldn't kill bitcoin. If B2X trades anywhere near what the futures market predicts, this will resolve itself quite quickly as most miners do have to pay bills.

*He* has shown that. If you can't come to the same conclusion after reading those mails, chances are you share some of those misunderstandings.
In essence: there will never be any compromise in bitcoin's future. Whenever there are concerns that haven't been sufficiently adressed, the status quo will remain. There are no deals to be made. You can either make your case or you can't. If you attempt to argue for a change, better bring some data. And an implementation. And if you haven't spend several days thinking about how your seemingly little change can be exploited, don't even bother.
Take this for example:


YES! There is no leadership. This is a GOOD THING. Bitcoins follows a meritocratic governance model. Satoshi left because he didn't want to become the benevolent dictator of bitcoin.
Vinny also mentions the HKA there, of which he claims that "attendees agreed to a 2MB HF". This is FALSE. Attendees agreed to *propose* a blocksize increasing hard fork. It was understood that consensus would be needed in order to activate something like that. Guess what, consensus wasn't achieved and it was dropped. Pretty hard. For good reason.

In theory perhaps, but there are very few BIPs that reached the status 'final' and didn't end up being implemented in core. So this process does kind of look like Bitcoin Core Improvement Proposals in practice (from that PoV).
The exceptions are BIP71, BIP72, BIP73 and more recently BIP91 &amp; BIP148.
Also the fact that the BIPs repository is on the same github account as the core implementation puts it a little into that corner. (Not that there's anything wrong with that... just saying...)

Stop trying to make S2X happen. Core *cannot* merge it. Wladimir only merges in changes that have consensus. Literally all core developers are opposed to it. In order for the core project to incorporate S2X you'd need all of the developers to betray their principles and the trust people put into them. It's not going to happen.
The only option is to essentially fire core by moving the whole ecosystem to btc1/bitcoin.
But they're not a viable alternative to core. Just trying to keep up with core development and rebasing their changes on top of the latest core release would be a fulltime job for them.
S2X was created to get SW activated and prevent a fork. That fork happened regardless and SW is already active. So what's the point?
The only part S2X played in activating SegWit is providing a way for miners to somewhat save face. UASF did the actual convincing.

We have all the time in the world to make this as good as it can be. Developers are in charge [of the implementation they work on]. The best implementation will win. CEOs can't really wrap their heads around that. They want to be in charge. They want to make trade-offs to acquire more customers. They're driven by short-term, selfish, profit-oriented thinking. They're trying to hide that behind pseudo-scientific arguments and might not even be aware of it.
Feel free to seize business opportunities where they arise, but don't act like the Bitcoin project owes you anything. And don't overstep your boundaries. It will come back to hurt you in the end.

The way bitcoin works guarantees that there are 1000s of unconfirmed transactions all the time.
There's only one block every 10 minutes on average. Sometimes it takes a lot longer for a block to be found.

No, the same strategy does not work for Enron or Goldman Sachs, because part of it is to not convert back into fiat for the sole purpose of holding fiat -- ever.
Don't try to time the market. Buy small amounts in regular intervals. Then hold. I mean, sure you can go and try to call the tops and bottoms. Maybe you increase your USD holdings with it short term. But it's not an efficient way to significantly increase your net worth long term.
Diversification is a great general rule of thumb. But this is a very rare opportunity one should recognize and seize.
I don't know why survivorship bias should apply here. No hodler has really "died". The only bitcoin owners that lost value (in theory) have been owning bitcoin for a maximum of five days. Everyone else who bought and didn't sell is *far* better off. This is what I'm advocating. Buy and hold.
While it makes sense to cover your ass when suggesting crypto to friends and family, the truth is, bitcoin has an insanely good risk/reward ratio. This is "once in a lifetime" level stuff.
Some people see more clearly where this thing is headed. If those people invest more than you would deem appropriate, they're not necessarily crazy. To the contrary.

Completely subverting the appropriate process for change in the bitcoin network. All signers still onboard are making a fool of themselves very clearly and very publicly.

You're right in that sense, but I'm making the assumption that people who can't afford to use the network have little incentive to run a node.
Even with things like lightning which AFAIK needs excess capacity to handle bank-run like situations... With LN it's like a fractional reserve in terms of available capacity. If everybody wants to close out their channel at once, there's not enough capacity. So we need to make that reserve large enough.

The latter is hard to measure, but arguably the most important given the fact that there are heavily opinionated parties with a metric shit ton of disposable cash. Also... a majority as in 51%?


Agreed! But this conveniently glances over the fact that 'Core' is not a single entity.
The github repository itself and its maintainer are rather meaningless, wouldn't you agree? I mean, imagine what would happen if Wladimir were to abuse his priviliges and merge something purely out of self interest. The developer community would of course just rally around another repository with a new maintainer.
So this leaves 'Core' as a loosely coupled bunch of software engineers who agree with each other that only stuff that has widespread consensus within the development community should be merged into the their client.
Do you believe, like some actually do, that Blockstream controls the development process?
If yes, then color me puzzled and disappointed.
If no, then core is a consensus based / meritocratic open source software project and you can't claim that Bitcoin Core development, let alone Bitcoin development, is centralized or controlled by someone.
Well it is controlled by software engineers, collectively. That much is true and IMHO very fair considering that bitcoin is first and foremost a free and open source software project. And I think this is what SegWit2x tries to change. It tries to introduce a new hierarchy with business on top.
So no, to me 2x will never be bitcoin even if miners and other businesses disagree. And if exchanges don't offer me a way to get exactly out what I put in and own, then there will be legal consequences. (Not that I would ever leave any bitcoin on an exchange longer than I need to.)

Bitcoin is most certainly NOT fiat. Fiat money is "intrinsically valueless money used as money **because of government decree**". No one is forcing you to use bitcoin. And bitcoin is only intrinsically valueless in the sense that everything else in existence, e.g. gold, is. The fact that it's virtual or "not backed by gold" doesn't make it valueless. It's value is derived from it's properties (and people finding those useful). Open. Permissionless. Decentralized. Global. Virtually instant. This stuff has utility and thus *real value*.
There is of course risk in bitcoin, but I'm arguing that it's comically low at this point. Absolutely and especially relatively to the rewards. I'd say the biggest risk factor is the social aspect. Stuff like S2X for example. Takeover through ignorance &amp; stupidity of plebs. But the current attempt seems to be failing... yet again.


Bitcoin will only really crash if it suddenly loses its utility. How would you imagine that to happen? All governments globally banning it with hard punishments? Yeah right... Even then they can't stop it without shutting down literally everything. Bitcoin would just evolve to adapt to that environment.
Eventually bitcoin will ensure a slow and steady price deflation rate. As long as people lose bitcoin and/or the human population increases it will slowly gain value. It will gradually become less of an investment opportunity and more store of value... and virtually perfect money.


I also don't *know* that I would fall to my death if I jump out a fifth floor window. But I sure do act like I would. Just because there's uncertainty doesn't mean that every scenario is equally likely. Anyone who says they absolutely know what'll happen is lying, yes. But not everyone who's assigning extreme likelyhoods to certain scenarios is.
Bitcoin is not a stock. Repeatedly comparing it to one is pointing to the reason you find my position absurd or extreme: you haven't really conquered bitcoin intellectually yet. That might sound like an insult, but really isn't meant as one. It's a process that simply takes some time. I know, your bullshit radar is beeping again. Understandably so, but it's a false positive you'll eventually recognize as such.


I'm not and advertising for altcoins in this way is to me another indicator you have still stuff to learn about this space. Well, I do own a small amount of litecoin but more as a novelty. Sure, I could've made a killing with Ethereum if I hadn't decided, based on my understanding of it and the criticisms I read, to not invest. But with Ethereum it would've always been about finding the right time to exit with huge profits. Pure speculation. Getting in front of the greater fools. Not my cup of tea. Bitcoin on the other hand *is* the exit to me.
I have lost what to me are huge amounts of money in the years after the 2013 bubble (on paper). And it still felt like making the right choice when I acquired more at &lt;$300 levels instead of thinking about minimizing losses.
Bitcoin loses it's perceived risk very quickly the better you understand it. Once we deal with the social attack vectors and bitcoin is properly inoculated, I guess the biggest risk factor that remains are governments managing to fix the whole financial system and everything that's wrong with it by themselves, thus making bitcoin somewhat redundant and unnecessary. I feel confident that this is not going to happen.
Anyway, I recognize that there's also the possibility that I've gone mad. My (obviously biased) assessment is that this has a low probability :) ... I believe I 'get' something many many other people don't quite get yet. And I'm putting my money where my mouth is. Intentionally without diversification.

Hm... should we have allowed them to vote in that case? That's a significant decision making power. Maybe we should revisit that?
Also, am I right to assume that when a woman dresses in a way that gets my attention, then she's obviously asking for it? And shouldn't complain or resist when she gets that "attention"? And "no" usually means "yes" in those cases?
Thanks, again.

Intrinsic value in the strictest sense doesn't exist. Gold, and anything else really, is only valuable because it's useful to someone. Even food has no value for someone trying to kill himself.
If at some point gold stops being useful and/or people stop associating it with prosperity it will be effectively worthless. Aside from industry and jewelry, part of its use also comes from its long history as a reliable store of value and the expectation that this will continue to be the case. But the fact that you can hold gold in your hand doesn't make it more valueable than immaterial things like information.
Bitcoin is scarce and it's useful to many people. Therefore it has value. It can also lose that value just as gold can lose its. But I don't think it will stop being scarce or useful any time soon.


Why would you trade your bitcoin for Ethereum, Litecoin or Tezos? Bitcoin is perfectly suitable as a currency (when we have the transactional capacity to support it). But it will invert a couple of things. The economy will be less debt based and more equity based. Deflation is only bad for people in debt. If you as a merchant can rely on money increasing in value, you might to start to factor that into your prices. People still need to buy stuff, even with money that appreciates in value. At some point a discount is simply high enough to facilitate the trade.


Sure, but why should it start from scratch? The coin that will eventually dethrone bitcoin (probably bitcoin v2) will be based off of bitcoins ledger because nothing else makes sense. The moment you establish that the dominating value token can be replaced with an entirely new ledger, it completely shatters the idea of cryptocurrency as a store of value. Because the next replacement might already be around the corner -- so why invest at all?
Bitcoin is the first and the biggest and it is backing every other altcoin out there. Altcoins are mostly pump &amp; dump extravaganzas. Scams left and right. There are only a handful that have something to offer.
People will try to dethrone bitcoin and they will fail again and again. Every attempt made it harder to succeed and I'm confident we passed the point of no return here.


But the people that work on it do.

While increasing the block size is in itself not necessarily bad, this proposal doesn't really solve anything and is backwards incompatible, so everybody who wants to continue to use bitcoin needs to upgrade. And it does increase the burden on fullnodes.

Fiat currencies continuously lose value as more of it gets created. Every time a bank hands out a loan. \**Poof*\* More money out of nothing. Which the recipient has to pay back. With interest.
This results in way more debt than money to pay it back with. Thus, fiat currencies not only reduce your real net worth over time, they also enable a system that's destined to fail. Spectacularly.
Precious metals like Gold are traditionally the hedge against that. Politicians and central bankers can't directly influence their value.
Enter cryptocurrencies. They kinda offer the same hedge as gold, but being pure information, they're far cheaper and easier to store and transfer. Globally. Within seconds. Irreversably so within an hour (until the Lightning Network goes live, then that's also seconds).
Bitcoin is first an foremost an alternative monetary system. It's completely open, it's permissionless, it's censorship resistant. It's not a very good payment network for people in developed countries right now, but it will be. 
Many misunderstandings around what bitcoin is and isn't, will and won't be, lead to it being ridiculous undervalued right now. The more people wake up to it, the more demand there is. More demand at a fixed supply will get us to the proverbial moon.
Early adopters will benefit more than laggards. As it's the case with almost any success story. But in the end, everybody will benefit. One of the things that make it different from a pyramid scheme.

@_date: 2017-09-26 12:38:54


Let's say 800,000 bitcoins are owed and 200,000 are available.
Price is fixed at $483.
In order to pay all dollar-denominated bitcoin claims they would need to sell those 200,000 @ $1932.
So they need a buyer who is willing to spend at least $386 million.
Far more if you want to cover the fiat claims as well.
Given that normal market forces drove the price below that mark merely ten weeks ago, I highly doubt that they will find a buyer.
They need to return BTC as BTC and deduct $483 for every returned BTC from the total dollar denominated claims. If they sell the BTC and achieve a significantly higher price, then sticking to the fixed price of $483 for the creditor's claims doesn't seem right?

Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.


Or it just looks that way from your point of view.


I tried to explain why I do think that this is the case. We're already seeing people moving on to that with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold or SegWit2x. With every new bitcoin users and every new transaction it get's exponentially harder to argue: hey all, let's start from scratch! Anyone making such a proposal will be asked loudly by millions in unison: "WHY?".
There's not a single good reason to make the next thing not be based on the bitcoin ledger. You want to restart because you missed the train with bitcoin and want to get into a good start position this time around? Forget it.


Another indicator that the "mind blown!" moment of bitcoin is still ahead of you. Apples and oranges.


Rest assured that I draw the line somewhere. I'm far beyond the usually suggested "5% of your assets", but I don't take on credit to buy bitcoin nor am I all in fiat-wise. But it is in fact the only *investment* I have. (But I don't think I would own stock at this point, even without bitcoin.)
I acknowledge that there's risk, but at this point it's mostly the potential to somehow lose my private keys.
And yes, I am emotionally invested in bitcoin. But I don't let that drive my buying behaviour. I buy fixed amounts in regular intervals as a long term investment without looking at the price at all. If I lose all of it, it would fucking hurt, but it wouldn't have any effect on my lifestyle.
I could also argue that you're too emotionally invested in the idea that such a paradigm shift and immense value transfer can't happen right before your eyes without you recognizing it as such. Caught between the fear of missing out and the laziness to really dig deep into this stuff. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Even then it's mostly pointless. Nodes are really meaningful when people use them to decide wether or not a transaction sent to them is valid.

S2X is now merely driven by a misguided feeling of having an obligation to keep ones word with regard to the ill-conceived and underspecified New York agreement.

Yeah, early 2014 until mid 2016 wasn't particularly fun, but very profitable in the end.

rbtc was created long before the "censorship" issue.
But people flooded it when they couldn't promote their stuff here.

This has nothing to do with opinions. It's a sad reality.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:01:33
To expand on that: the principle here is to not merge things that are not well argued for or leave concerns unaddressed. I'm glad they don't budge on that.
Bitcoin is about consensus. Compromise and consensus are incompatible.

Big actors wanted to finally move on and offered a hard fork to appease Bitmain. They only looked (briefly) at the technical risk, which seemed fine to them. They completely ignored the implications of a successful NYA.
I still believe that most of them do not want bitcoin to split or to get rid of core. However, many feel they'd be assholes if they withdraw from the NYA because they gave their word and really want to honor it.
The reality is though that the NYA (beside being an utterly wrong approach) was underspecified and many concerns have presented themselves since the promise was made. Signers need to acknowledge the new information and reevaluate.
According to Barry Silbert, the initiator of the agreement: **It's OK to withdraw.**

You've been conned AND in denial about it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:50:56
It's actually wrong what I said.


If you're not insane that would be selling BT2 for BTC. After the failed fork you'll have your BT1 tokens credited as normal BTC in addition to the BTC you got by selling BT2.
BT2 bag holders get nothing.

For as long as miners see fit since there aren't many fullnodes to stop them, let alone the desire to do so.
Because miners control everything and we have to trust them. This is Satoshi's vision after all... didn't you know?!

Kind of.


Consensus doesn't necessarily mean that 100% fully agree with a change. It means that there is a general agreement that all concerns raised by opponents have been properly addressed.

This is embarrassingly stupid (again).

I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about here, but the stuff that Bernie was proposing is employed by virtually every civilized western society except the USA. So the answer to your question why I would think that for example a single payer healthcare system would be "sensible" is: look around you.
And before you repeat falsehoods about european health care systems: No, I don't have to wait 8 weeks to get a doctors appointment.

Ehm... can you define for me what you understand as 'consensus'?

Sidenote: if a drop like this makes you nervous you've invested too much in relation to your understanding of this asset.

Hashpower is only meaningful *within* a ruleset defined by bitcoin nodes used for economic activity.
E.g. the reason Litecoin miners can't extend the bitcoin blockchain is a rule saying that you have to use double SHA256.
If miners can set the rules by decree of their hashpower, why not change the mining reward in a way that keeps the 21M limit, but rewards current miners more than future miners?

Those are the symbols for the chain split tokens used for futures trading. You convert one BTC into one BT1 and one BT2 and then trade one for the other.

Yup, polling was wrong. Nope that doesn't automatically disqualify everybody who cited such a poll once from every discussion henceforth.
And we do know why those polls were so far off. But that's another thing that simply doesn't register with you because it doesn't enter your echo chamber.

Loss of core will not kill bitcoin as it currently works in the short term, it will however kill a lot of potential and pose a serious risk.
If new, less capable, less principled developers step in, bitcoin could slowly deteriorate into something entirely unappealing. Forking again and again until it's evident that divide &amp; conquer was indeed the strategy and worked spectacularly. Bitcoin: dead. Attack vector: tribalism.

\^- this is going to get removed (and rightfully so). It's an attempt at driving the "is censored!" narrative by making insulting and abusive posts in day old threads. At some point this will get linked to again and people will just see the `[removed]` post and leave with the impression that this sub is indeed censored.
