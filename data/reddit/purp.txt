So...you agree?


What? Have you been paying attention? It's been steadily trending downward...

What do you mean? I pay taxes on bitcon.

Now there's no word that means literally any more. We already had a word to mean "really". I've taken to saying " literally literally" which is awful.

Or just use a pool that automatically trades to BTC for you (like clevermining)

Get out now, I just did. I should have known better, sigh.

Of course they denied it, but it's true--it was a combination of two hacks apparently. 
1. Brute forcing the password (via Find My iPhone API), then, with the password, 
2. Spoofing iCloud to make it think you were the phone itself, not just a web user logging in. (Then you could request a "backup" of everything on the phone, not just what the user had voluntarily uploaded to iCloud.)
There were probably other attacks used as well, but this is a confirmed vulnerability. 
Downvotes? It's true...

Why would I buy on Newegg with Bitcoin if they aren't offering a significant discount over credit cards? Credit cards offer consumer protection and cash back. I don't really benefit from "anonymous" transactions when buying RAM. Seems like Newegg gets the benefit of avoiding credit cards fees whereas I get nothing.

Isn't BTC transfer fee more like $0.40? Says $0.01 here.
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:47:21
Yeah they are. You can deposit a check at an ATM and instantly withdraw the money. The deposit won't be *processed* until morning though.
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:32:53
first you have to hack the gibson then upload your deposit and your bitcoins will be in the cloud

They weren't very significant before bitcoin was popular and the market cap was the size it is today. Now that it's more established they come into play.

Why do people always point to the bubble and say "see price has gone up!". That's not how economics works. If you don't think the price has been trending downward you haven't been paying attention.
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:58:37
Ugh, this rhetoric is so tired. I'm subscribed to this subreddit...you don't have to be so defensive and bury your head in the sand. I'm a believer, but bitcoin (currently) has some real problems. Empty, trite platitudes like "YEAH BUT IT USED TO BE WORTH LESS THAN A DOLLAR!!!!!11!!11" don't count as real discussion. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:39:18
I didn't think the article was that hard to understand, but it seems to have gone completely over your head. It explains why the price has decreased lately, I'm surprised you were unaware of that.
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:12:12
Maybe it varies, but mine lets me withdraw the full amount (up to a daily limit in ATM withdraws).
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:28:37
RIP the word "literally"

Yeah I see the idealist reasons behind it, you could also argue that it's not supporting Big Bad Banks, and that's true. That's not enough to make John Q Consumer switch, let alone even the more casual bitcoin enthusiasts.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:07:46


Is this new? I stopped using VoS once I realized you can't withdraw fiat without jumping through hoops.

Might be a better fit for Darkcoin

"You don't need protection, take my word for it" isn't all that comforting. Newegg had never made a mistake? It's not about Newegg providing the same protection, it's about the lack of protection from the credit card company.
How is it faster? Newegg has my credit card on file. It's not *significantly* faster.
The only benefit I see is not having to give out my account number.
Otherwise, it's just costs. I'm holding bitcoin speculatively. To buy on Newegg, I could either pay a fee to buy bitcoins from coinbase, or get cash back with my credit card.

So what? You aren't buying an ice cream cone, they still control access even after you buy it.
