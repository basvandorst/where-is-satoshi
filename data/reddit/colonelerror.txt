The way I am reading it, I can buy and sell bitcoins, as long as I'm doing it solely for my benefit, and not be a money transmitter. If I buy low, sell high, rinse and repeat, it looks like I'm doing nothing wrong.

No, it's blocked the same way bittorrent is "for the good of the network". They will then tell you to kick rocks at which point you have three options
1) Switch to a different cable/fiber to door provider, which you should have done ages ago.  
2) Switch to DSL and go from 50 Mbps to 5 Mbps  
3) Continue using Comcast because you have no better option and they know it.

Couple quick stories about Comcast:
1) I'm having trouble with my internet. Randomly drops connection about once a week. Call up "We'll send a tech." No fix. Call again "We'll send a higher level tech" Nothing. "We'll send out a Line Tech (the ones that aren't contracted, and make about $120 an hour) Nope, still no fix. Call back one more time. "Where is your modem in relation to the router" "Right next to it" "Oh, they have to be 3 feet apart." Here I'm thinking "What the hell does that matter" Guess what fixes the problem.
2) Moving cables around to tidy up my TV area, and unplug the cable box. When I plug it back in, it stops working. I call up, and after being hung up on twice, and redirected to the wrong line and disconnected, I get, "Oh, you can't unplug the cable line from your box, we need to send a tech out." After I get off the phone, I try switching cables. That fixed it...
3) My current cable modem is one of those combo modem/router boxes (which I'm only using because it also does phone, and my package is somehow cheaper that way). So I want to use my router, because it has better wireless and other advanced features. I goto the modem to turn off the router function. No option for it. Fine, I can figure this out, let me just turn off the wireless. Nope, any options it has are greyed out. I call up "Oh yea, we have to perform all config on your modem from our side" Why the fu** can't I do this. So after she finally figures out how to disable it, I hang up. A day later it stops working so I reset the modem. Router and wireless turns back on.
If it wasn't for the fact that the only other way right now I'm getting close to 50Mbps connection is paying twice what I do now, I would be gone and never deal with them again.

I understand the fundamentals of how it works, but I have a decent working knowledge of cryptography. It's also not entirely difficult to explain why to trust it to someone without mentioning SHA once.
Some people are dumb though, and the only way they get through life is by having others that they hold in high regard tell them what to trust. The idea isn't to go after them with "This is why bitcoin is better", you go after the people they trust.
Not trying to be an ass, but convince churches to accept bitcoin 'tithes' and watch droves of people start using it.

So, the difference between Armory and a private/public keys you are used to is easy. What Armory is backing up (to make the watch only wallet) is a single key. From that one key, it generates the private/public keys you are used to. The benefit is that you only ever need to back-up Armory once, while other clients generate a bunch of pairs, then give them to you as you ask for them.
You _could_ use your Armory Watch-only wallet somewhere else, but as far as I know, no one has released software to do that yet.

Days destroyed is a figure based on amount of coins moved and the age of said coins. You get a large amount of days destroyed when someone with a large account they haven't touched in a long while moves coins.
It's 'important' because it can forecast someone that knows more than the rest of the network, and is moving their coins in a hurry after sitting on them.

Right, you should base your understanding of crime based on the fact that is there were a valid issue with it, then it would be changed, ie Slavery, prohibition, prohibiting blacks from voting, prohibiting women from voting, etc.
