It corrects its self due to "buyers with no stomach for the ride", "whale investors" &amp; exchange price differences. For example in GDAX it hit 19k something and everywhere else only reached 16-17k. Meaning this 14-15k we're right now is actually only a 1-2k drop. Since a lot of people use gdax the masses of not well educated people respond to a 19k drop more than they should.

If the internet can be slowed in any way as of now &amp; there is only 1 ISP in your area you wouldn't have a "choice" in service. Your choices would be to not have any service, pay more for service(an unacceptable percentage increase for the vast majority of the population in an area) or move to another area. This is for the corporations' benefits. This generation heavily relies on the internet for many things, including business. They do not need this law for "innovation".  Netflix is a huge competitor which is the primary target, along with hulu, sling, p2p, etc. It's not like I care though.

So basically it's about a grand right now and bitcoin at 6500k approximately. Meaning your percentage is way higher. Also the fact that there replay vulnerability means you can lose any money.

Anyways there are about 3 upgrades that are coming which imo bitcoin needs. I'm just glad segwit2x was a rouse because the U.S. federal reserve &amp; other corporate assholes was trying to manipulate the price. All these big players are tied to governments, etc. It seems that they have failed. Maybe a second pump and dump wave, who tf knows. Conspiracy? Yes. The branding, community &amp; bitcoin's true purpose holding its shit together? Most likely. I can understand why there was somewhat of a scare for non veterans yesterday.

I have to admit, I'm pretty new to bitcoin; but this analogy is pretty spot on. I've seen all the alt coins &amp; shitcoins &amp; none have had the ability to take over bitcoin core. Even if the exchanges are bribed by the DCG to make B2x to BTC it won't work. What works at the end for the exchanges is the value given of the crypto. The miners have 0 say as well. Even if it does turn out that segwit2x turns into bitcoin it'll be rectified in the near future by BIP &amp; all that work would be for nothing because a phoenix always rises from its ashes.

Where does it say that in this community guideline? Shitcoin is name calling fyi. Your argument is the epitome fallacy. I don't think you know what's at stake here. The big shots are trying to control a currency that is more valuable than gold right now. AKA the government. I'll call anyone anything as I please as long as it's in the rational realm to do so. Bitcoin is the single most greatest invention since paper money and you just want to sit here &amp; not call anyone that gives even the slightest mention of hope to S2X a turd, because fancy pants reddit site draws a delicate snowflake line when it comes to harassment? Pssh please, YOU DON'T KNOW REAL HARASSMENT. You seriously need to get a grip of what's going on in the world. The middle class and lower class are being bombarded by interest rates like no other. Bitcoin is essentially instant, way lower fees &amp; theoretically no inflation for long periods of time. Come @ me.

b2x can eat a dick. Stop glorifying any possibility.
