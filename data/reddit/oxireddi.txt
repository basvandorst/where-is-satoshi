No one has to be long. You buy a contract betting that bitcoins value will decrease. The future borrows the same amount of bitcoins on the market and sells them immediately. Then it waits until your contract expires and buys the same amount of bitcoins to give them back. The difference between selling price (high) and purchasing price (lower) is your benefit (minus interest rates, fees etc.).

Sorry, I cannot agree with what I read here. You were right to sell. You felt it was the right thing to do, nobody knew at what level BT would recover. You saved part of your money, took your losses. That's right.
Think about the people who bought around 19 K! They have not been able to recover so far and they do not know if the BTC will ever reach again that level.
Now, there are several things you should consider:
- Diversify your assets. BTC, ETH and maybe stocks.. Some are more dynamic than BTC.
- Watch the market, see how it evolves and try to find some patterns. 
- Then buy when you think it is at the lowest. Buy with a fraction of your K. Wait and watch again. If the market continues to go down, you can buy again with another fraction of your K. If it goes up, wait until you think it reaches its top and sell fraction by fraction to optimize your benefits.
- Be careful of transaction fees. Your benefit should exceed the cost of the transactions of course!
All this is about trust. If the market trusts a coin it will show it. Be rational, follow the market then anticipate it and you will cover your losses and even make benefits. :-)

So the selling point for big owners seems to be 20K$.
We know what to do next time then... Buy below, sell before it reaches this level...
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:31:39
Yes! Or 1 BTC in exchange for 1 BTC... For what it's worth...

Selling BTCs for Santa at 1 BTC = 1$. I Got plenty of them... Who wants some?

If it is really "massive" you should inform your bank first!

1-hardware wallet
2-yes-unless you give him/her your private key (joke)
3-send to your wallet's public key from coinbase

What distance would you put at trailing stop, you guys? I am thinking of 800 to 1000...

Here it is!!! Look into your chimney!... But don't get burned playing this game!...
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:10:59
There are still lots of other potential late-adopting investors... 
If you look ate the curves, the market is obviously manipulated. The "big" owners don't want to scare the little fishes... I would bet that the bitcoin will not go far below 10K$, so that it quickly regains value. And everyone (almost) will feel relieved and start playing again.

Sure!! Just send one dollar to this address IStillBelieveInSanta and soon you'll receive your bitcoin!

I fear the following scenario (based on the past, eventough this can hardly predict the future):
X1: down 5k$ in 15 days (X1a) then up to 8k$ (X1b) then down to 3k$ in March (X1c)
X2: 2 months
X3: more than 2 years
But during these two years some altcoins will take over.

Worth remembering (Bitcoin):
* **May 11**: up to 30$- then crash to 3$+ in 4 months. It took 20 months to recover... (see here: 
* **Apr 13**: up to 230$+ then crash to ~65$ in 4 months. It took 8 months to recover (see here: 
* **6 Nov 13**: up to 1000$+ then crash to ~225$ in 4 months . It took more than 2 years to recover (see here: 
* **Dec 2017**: up to 19K$+ then crash to **X1** in  **X2** months... It will take **X3** months to recover.
 
Your guesses for **X1**, **X2**, **X3**?
