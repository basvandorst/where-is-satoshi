It's the last spasms before it plummets into negative values!
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:22:03
I can't wait for the inverted vegeta screenshot shouting :"It's under 9000"
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:37:52
yes, in a few months we'll be able to buy at 2k
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:20:27
Now he's up 2 grand 
edit 1: oh, now he's where he started
edit2 : looks like he's making a 4 grand loss now
edit3: looks like he lost all his money

But then the appowner gets hacked and a modified version gets put online, phones automatically download it, asks the code to 'unlock' it(or waits till the first transaction), and then sends all the bitcoins to the hacker while showing everything is working as it is....
Perhaps it's even happening right now and you don't even know it....
(that's why I prefer to compile wallets myself and go through the source first)
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:10:46
that 1 cent in litecoin would have been worth $2billion in a few years
@_date: 2018-09-02 06:07:18
Reminds me of the Final Destination 3 movie
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:47:54
Best wait till bitcoin is under 2500 usd (so march 2019)
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:54:12
The result of mining bitcoin
And now no one can use it as they have no internet...
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:41:38
Let's imagine a world where bitcoin is main stream:
Banks collapse, people who didn't get into bitcoin will be unable to get their money from the bank, so start rioting... 
governments collapse
electricity centrals get abandoned because no one is paying the people working there, they shut down or explode
in the wasteland that's left there are no computers running , no miners processing transactions. 
With no one being able to do any transactions, bitcoin is worthless
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:51:13
They can't regulate bitcoin, but they can jail people who trade in it by making laws making it illegal to use bitcoin for trades (it'll be the new marijuana)
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:18:15
Just the last gasp before it dies
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:43:19
Told ya so
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:50:20
Mwah, I'd say wait a few more weeks to buy at 2500
@_date: 2018-05-31 08:29:50
It's going to eat our brains!!! Run for your lives!!!
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:00:18
yup, quite cheerful today
@_date: 2019-11-03 15:15:18
And i'm sure freedom supressing governments and corporations will just let that happen...
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:53:36
Gonna need some extra lower lines for this
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:38:47
Don't worry, it's just climbing up to the diving board before it dives into a pool with no water
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:53:49
Should have waited till tomorrow when you can buy 100 bitcoin for the same price
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:25:35
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:23:19
If you mean bitcoin price in triple digits, then yeah, you're right
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:11:47
Still too expensive to buy. Best wait for 8000
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:45:26
that just means that you should stop eating candy every single time the price goes up
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:43:51
Can't wait for december when it goes vertical again like in 2017
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:51:53
I'd have named him pussy or tits
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:48:37
This is what killed the price going up.
Not any economic reason, no pump/dump scheme, no. **This** is why bitcoin won't go over 10000
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:06:09
And he's gone!
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:54:56
It's going up to 57000 and then drop to 4500 before it slowly goes up again
@_date: 2019-02-24 22:40:21
Still too expensive to buy
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:43:28
It's actually the last spasm before it dies and goes to 0
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:47:18
Just makes the next dump even more painful
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:18:50
I'm here, and i have faith that bitcoin will drop under $2k , perhaps even below $2
just give it time
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:30:52
less miners means it'll be easier to obtain a 51% majority, so expect attacks to happen that will make bitcoin unusable ending with it becoming worthless
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:06:44
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:08:05
Bitcoin is boring these days. Up by 0.05%
@_date: 2018-11-01 09:08:28
Too bad it's not filled with a qr code of a private key containing hundreds of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-07 09:04:16
What goes up must go down
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:17:26
It means that bitcoin is gonna die!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:47:03
Cheaper hookers are good things 
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:04:10
Tried that with a baby once.  Didn't get back up
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:23:48
Fiat is the reason they are in power, and they will do anything to stay in power.
So say goodbye to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:05:18
That falling rock is gonna cause an avalanche that takes everyone down to 0, and severely injured or even dead!!
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:13:50
This gif reminds me of "final destination 3"
bitcoin will likely end the same as well
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:36:38
I believe in bitcoin gold
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:05:21
If the electrcity goes by a Fair Use Policy , then that should be fine.
Also, it's the USA, where net-neutrality is apparently a bad thing, so electricity net neutrality goes out of the door then as well, so they can of course do that.  Perhaps they'll send less electricity to miners...
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:14:02
More like 1k
@_date: 2019-01-08 07:41:45
They should try that in the Netherlands. Triggering a bankrun there is illegal
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:31:59
I'd wait till it's at $500 (in 2 weeks or so) and then sell around $750 (after which it goes back to $500)
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:19:56
This dip is just the start.  Down to 0!!!
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:03:53
It's all over man, it's all over!!
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:56:03
This is it, the final drop down to 0!
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:41:16
And coincidentally the price of bitcoin will end up at the exact same price
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:33:16
How are you alive?
My doomsday device that wipes out all life on Earth is set to go off on 4th of july 2099
What went wrong in it's activation? Who interfered and when was he/she born so i can make sure they never get born
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:04:43
Bitcoin just died!
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:58:24
It's the cryptocalypse!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:43:39
The current forecast: Mass extinction Armageddon meteors falling from the sky
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:23:44
I remember the good old days when bitcoin was $200. Perhaps we'll relive it...
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:18:41
And there's a ton more where that came from
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:31:42
Bitcoin hasn't gone up in 24 hours , it's dead!!!
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:37:08
Nope, going straight to 0 this time
