You people are too emotional about Bitcoin. Tether said they would produce an audit months ago, we’re still waiting. When called out in the past they chose to attack individuals rather than credibly defending themselves.
If you want to bury your head, call it FUD, defend Tether because you think it’s going to make your investment go down in value then I can’t stop you. The facts are that we need to see a legitimate audit and Tether has failed to make good on that promise so far. I think the emotions are getting in the way of good judgement because there are too many red flags that need to be cleared up in this company. I’d never invest in equity of a company that was in Tethers current position. If you want to call me a shill too, I’m fine with that. I’m also fine about being wrong about Tether, but the burden of proof is on them. Bitfinex’d did some amateur investigating and raises very good points/concerns. All we’re getting from Tether/Bitfinex are crickets or personal attacks.

How do people not understand there is more to an audit than just confirming some bank accounts with money in them exist? Also people who have a vested interest in Tether/Bitfinex confirming the balance to the public is not the same as an independent third party doing so. Is Tether in compliance with financial regulations? Is the Tether entity actually the owner of those funds? There’s a trust in an individuals name that is not the Tether entity that had some of the funding in it. What is the legal standing and conditions of that trust? What do the auditors have to say about the issuance and redemption processes?
Just putting some money in a bank account (which the location of has changed multiple times) is not the end all of a fiat backed cryptotoken.

So the answer is to ignore it or continue to ask for proof? That’s the point I’m making. The red flags are there so let’s clear the air and happily exist in a world with legitimate Tether, no? That’s what people like Bitfinex’d are asking for. There’s more to an audit than simply confirming bank balances as well.

How about this nugget? Friedman dropped bitfinex from their website. Not a good sign when the CPA firm hired to do your audit doesn’t want to advertise you as a client anymore. Given we haven’t seen a completed audit from the firm I’d speculate that it is in limbo or Friedman walked away.

They’re not running a reserve token. Project much? If Coinbase were insolvent it would be much more apparent. Tether is literally creating a medium of exchange that is backed by something they hold in trust. It’s not even remotely close to the same thing. People exchange regular crypto for real fiat every day in both directions without issue on those platforms. Coinbase operates in the US under strict AML/KYC laws.
We. Aren’t. Fucking. Stupid. The fact that when questioned people have to resort to “look over there” is fucking hilarious. Anyone whose ever been involved in accounting/finance knows the shit we are seeing from their management team and people close to them with a vested interest, is the beginning of a story that has unraveled thousands of times before.
Publish independent proof. No one owes anyone blind trust when it comes to money.

Which part of my comment do I state it was the cause of it. I stated that amid a crisis there’s little you can do to manage it when your hands are tied by the gold you hold. They had to abandon it because its monetary restraints were not practical.  The OP that I originally replied to said we went through the industrial revolution with it. That’s great then we had to deal with a world war and then we tried to return to it at pre war levels and it was an impractical disaster and then we had a financial meltdown.

This sub reminds me every day that there is a lot of dumb money in bitcoin. There are people forgoing student loan payments, people taking out mortgages, people who don't even understand basic financial instruments and personal finance premises. This is not a market I'm interested in being in for the time being. The risk is absolutely enormous.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:46:59
That money essentially sits in a vault and does nothing. It does not circulate in the economy. That money is the money that makes this chart op linked go exponential. When we talk about the supply of money we generally do not include it.
See section on working monetary base. Not many citations, but given the fed has been more concerned about deflationary pressure in recent years i would say that the information is reasonably accurate unless future research indicates anything different.

Why do you think they had to fucking suspend the gold standard in the first place and then abandon it? You can’t do anything when a crisis like WWI or a major financial crisis hits you. Your monetary tools are tied to the value of a limited amount of metal.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:07:40
Not quite. You have complete access to every publicly traded companies financial statements, the notes to those statements, and you have the assurance of an independent auditing firm whose signing partner of the audit is legally liable for their assessment that the financial statements are materially stated.
Bitcoin you have nothing but charts in an unregulated market that is almost guaranteed to be manipulated with techniques that would be completely and utterly illegal on the NYSE or FOREX market.  You have an extremely volatile asset that is traded on exchanges that can not handle the traffic during major market moves and whose underlying protocol gets constipated.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:58:10
Call me a filthy statist, but your chart includes excess reserves which for all intents and purposes is money that is sequestered out of the economy, or “frozen money”. Subtract about 2 trillion dollars and you get a more reasonable look at the current money supply or what we call “working money”.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:32
That’s idiotic rationale. If you can’t serve people when they need to make a move they’ll want nothing to do with you or the risk involved with getting a transaction in a timely matter. Why use a trading platform that doesn’t let you trade when you need to the most? Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:16:53
 Yes, unlike internet protocols the market value of the bitcoin protocol can be a bubble because bitcoin is actually bought and sold itself.

Then America went through the Great Depression.  Spiraling deflation, banks unable to lend because they can't lower interest rates, businesses unable to borrow because the cost of debt financing was too high, increasing unemployment because businesses can't pay employees, decreasing aggregate demand.
Anyone who thinks we should go back to having a currency backed by a fixed deflationary asset is a looney toon simpleton. There isn't a credible economist who would argue it's a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:12:17
Not offended, but these two idiots talking about blockchain makes me feel like a bubble is a stronger possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:31:11
The dotcom bubble was a bunch of people throwing money at shit they did not understand. It was completely speculative and they were investing purely on the hope that those equities were going to be worth more than they are today. Dotcom equities grew exponentially and people's valuations were based on completely outrageous and infeasible price points. Eventually, some companies started to cash in on their own equities with huge sell orders and the market tanked.
There's absolutely no reason this can't happen to crypto with all the shitty ICOs and the amount of uneducated people I see trying to dive headfirst into buying Bitcoin. We just don't know if it will.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:27:57

@_date: 2017-12-04 12:37:42
There's hundreds of different blockchains. The idea that only one blockchain will trump all is ridiculous. The only reason Bitcoin is eating alts alive is because it has first mover advantage. Bitcoin isn't even close to the most technically superior implementation of the blockchain right now. It is the most widely known blockchain though, and this creates trust with the public and generates a network effect.

Dude used 45k to basically gamble while also claiming to need help for med school costs. 
Smart is not the word I would use here, he’s a lottery winner at a number of levels. He has 45k laying around before med school, he has family that will help him pay for med school to the point where he thinks putting 45k into the riskiest financial asset imaginable is reasonable behavior and not selfish.
The only smart part about this sequence of events was knowing when to quit. This sub is drunk with a results based stupor and I won’t be surprised at all if most of the bitcoiners who hit it big squander it because they lack even the most basic understanding of wealth and risk management. I hope they use the money to pay someone to do it for them.

@_date: 2017-12-05 04:12:54
One of the other indicators of a bubble is when a whole lot of people, that barely know what they are talking about, are throwing piles of money at something with no respect for the true financial risk involved. People that only see huge returns and fall over themselves trying to get some exposure when they lack a fundamental understanding of personal finance, investing vs. speculating, risk assessment and basic economic principles.
I see that on the crypto related subreddits almost every day. The people who bought Bitcoin for decentralization, immutability, etc. are already here. The people moving in now are people who really could not give a shit about the idealistic nature of bitcoin that got many of us interested the past few years. This is why I am not entirely sold on this parabolic growth. It could be the S-curve, but it could also just be dumb money. These bitcoin communities are a complete echo chamber with a culture that essentially says nothing can go wrong if you just hold. However, the reality is holding to the bottom of a real crash can fuck your ass raw because you can't predict when they happen and what happens after them.

If you have 70 dollars to your name then crypto shouldn’t even be on your radar. If bitcoin 10x’d tomorrow and you had 100% exposure you still could barely even pay a months rent with it.
Worry about an education, buying a suit for job interviews, etc. All will be a better decision than throwing some pocket change into crypto.

Sure, as long as you are denominating in a stable fiat. You may not realize this but you are thinking about the bike in terms of your local fiat. If you lived in a hypothetical place where bitcoin is the standard for commerce then this is rapid deflation.

Bingo. To piggyback a bit, I wanted to buy bitcoin when I was in college too and it was skyrocketing to like $100 at the time. But with the budget I was on it simply was not reasonable. I’ve also been on the outside and watched it crash and enter a bear market for a year as well. This can completely change how some look at the “hodling” mentality.
You can’t dwell on missing out on returns that simply aren’t a possibility and many experiencing euphoric gains right now haven’t experienced any sort of bear market whether it’s crypto or stocks. They don’t fully get the emotional/sentiment of a downturn that lasts longer than a week or two.
Be responsible with the little money you have! As much as this sub would love to tell you bitcoin is a sure thing to 10x again next year, a single event can trigger a downturn and sideways movement. There are no guarantees.

Have you personally traced and overseen any of these transactions yourself? There's no proof at all, literally, that what they say happens on paper is what is actually happening. I don't need fucking bitfinex'd to tell me that there's counterparty risk when an entity that is trying to run a reserve-backed currency, with fiat held in trust, has banking issues.
This is why when you do something like this you need an independent third party to give assurance to your claims. Tether has failed to do so and has drawn extraordinary bad publicity to themselves the entire way. If there is literally anyone else that gets a "stable coin" up and running with the proper controls and disclosure in place, RIP Tether.
Nothing about Tether has changed since this whole thing started. Nothing has been proven one way or the other. Right now anyone using Tether is just putting their trust in some dudes who say everything is fine. That is not how legitimate people do business. That is why we have things like Sarbanes-Oxley today for publicly traded companies. That is why we have auditors to conduct audits and reviews to give assurance to stakeholders.
It's not about being gullible, it's about covering your own ass and minimizing your risk exposure. Tether is a big fat risk until they rescue their own credibility. I don't give a shit if you want to call me a FUDster or even lump me in with bitfinex'd. Nothing you said proves any legitimacy. Never blindly trust anyone with your own financial security.
Unlike bitfinex'd I don't outright accuse them of fraud. I accuse them of being shitty management that doesn't live up to their claims of transparency.

How about we wait until an actual recession/bear market before we start throwing shit like this random Forbes blog around. Bitcoin has ONLY lived during the second longest bull markets in history and it is currently ongoing. If you think we are in times of uncertainty right now then I am certain you haven't seen jack shit in the financial world. The current uncertainties they describe in Asia involve a dictator literally committing suicide. No one in this world thinks Kim Jung Un would maintain power after an actual missile strike against any foreign nation.

Warren Buffet tells retail investors to put their money in the S&amp;P 500, so I’d say he completely agrees with op.

Word of advice, tax evaders think they are clever but the IRS is much more clever. 
For your sake I hope you realize that if you're ever audited it's not difficult for the IRS to figure out you're using undeclared income based on transactions, your declared income, and the deductions you take. In order to get significant undeclared bitcoin and use it in the real world you're going to have to do something that would likely be uncovered in a full audit.
Cash is anonymous too, that's never stopped them from nailing evaders. Depending on how much bitcoin you're dealing with you're playing a pretty dangerous game unless you are very familiar with how taxes work, how a full audit works, and have an elaborate way of concealing the undeclared income you spend.

@_date: 2013-12-05 00:59:14
I'm sorry but this is not true in any way, shape or form.  Bitcoin is up 6% in the last 24 hours and the highest price movement between two majorly traded currencies in the past WEEK is probably around 1%.  Most currencies are a fraction of a %.  Any currency moving much more than this is considered extremely volatile on the FOREX.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:48:53
Yeah, a big red flag (rather than optimism that I'm seeing) should be outlets like CNBC treating it like a precious metal market.  People scoff every time someone posts one of those speculative bubble charts but what is occurring right now is par for the course.  Even if merchants adopt it over night speculation would go through the roof and still people are going to hold rather than spend at Amazon until they see anything remotely close to a long term stability period.  I'd be selling bitcoins left and right to pay off student loans, home mortgages and become free from the slavery that is called debt before I got fixated on becoming some bitcoin millionaire.

You're probably right with this statement but if that is the case then it also means that other people are wrong to think that Bitcoin is going to become some world wide super currency.  It's likely going to remain volatile for years because of it's deflationary and decentralized nature which is great if you're a speculative trader but not so great if you want to actually use it as a serious medium of exchange that merchants will adopt en masse.  It can function as a payment processor still but anything beyond that is pretty risky for merchants to deal with.
I feel like Krugman "trolls", as you put it, make the argument that "Hey, for this reason Bitcoin isn't that great for a daily currency" while you're arguing that the vision of bitcoin isn't going to end up being one anyways.  The counterarguments aren't even related to each other because each side isn't even looking at the same future for bitcoin on a fundamental level.  It's an utterly pointless argument to have because the side you decided to pick an argument with isn't even arguing with the point you're making, they're argument is directed at the "too the moon" kiddos who think they can buy and hold until they don't need to even hold dollars anymore.

The targeted inflation rate is about 2-3% in most developed countries and it is, in fact, 2-3% most years.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:11:55
I agree 100% with everything you said.  Bitcoin functions better as tradable commodity and I can also see it potentially replacing things like western union and paypal for transferring money with minimal transaction fees but I think some people need to take a step back from the kool-aid and think more about the what makes bitcoin practical as well as the drawbacks which absolutely do exist.
My point on interest rates was mostly just to explain to the other guy that if for some reason entities were going to lend bitcoin it wouldn't magically be better for people it'd just be more or less the same when it's all said and done.  If bitcoin were actually a stable deflationary currency you'd still get a similar spread of real interest rate as you do in our inflationary economy.  Money is still money and a lender isn't going just let profit go even if it's a smaller fraction of their bottom line.

Yeah and my point is that in the situation described by the previous poster happens then it fails as currency.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:51:14
What are you talking about?  People can and do make a living day trading on the forex with normal fiat currency.  They're doing the exact same thing: treating EUR, USD, Yuan, etc as an investment buying low and selling high.  I'd argue there are many other factors that will determine whether it will succeed.  One of the biggest factor that's stopping people from actually using it as currency right now is that it's speculated to appreciate in value,  and a lot for that matter.  If people  expected strongly the USD to appreciate 200% in the near future nobody in the US would go to the store today for anything other than what they absolutely needed.  This is one of the major arguments for targeting small inflation rates for fiat currency.  They don't want people just sitting on the currency.

Wasn't advocating for any average Joe to go out and attempt it (hence why I included "and lost").  Just saying the strategy itself isn't terrible.
I will clarify for OP, do not utilize this strategy unless you absolutely know what you're doing.  You absolutely will get burnt trying to do this if you're a newbie.  Something like only 40% of traders end up being profitable on the forex.  You need a lot of money for it to really be worth it anyways.
The strategy is fine but if it is somehow a revolutionary idea to you and you think it is free, easy or guaranteed money,  odds are it's not a strategy for you.
In short I agree with you.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:19:07
Just looking at the volume of transactions of bitcoin black friday which will likely be the biggest spending day of the year you can see that the number of people actually spending is abysmally low.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:15:04
Even if your friend became a bitcoin billionaire I'd still think he's an idiot.  The only difference is he'd be a lucky idiot.  I can not stress enough that people should never put more money than they can afford to lose in high risk assets like bitcoin and if you do not think bitcoin is high risk you shouldn't be "investing" at all because you're just gambling then and there is a serious difference.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:32:11
Here's theoretically what happens.
If bitcoin deflates at 2% per year stable (I have absolutely zero clue what it would actually be but for the sake of the example I'll say it does and we'll also assume the adoption rate is at a point where it is stable) then what the banks will do instead of charging you 6.5% interest, they'll charge you 2.5% interest.
Today's real interest rate calculation on a 6.5% nominal interest rate is anywhere from 3.5-4.5% depending on how close inflation is to the targeted 2% rate.
In our imaginary bitcoin world the nominal interest rate is now 2.5% (horray for the little people!) but the currency is deflating at 2% per year so your real interest rate is actually 4.5%, the same as before.  Banks take expected inflation/deflation into account when determining what interest rate they give you a loan at.  
The fact that bitcoin is decentralized is also extremely unappealing to adopt as both a borrower and a lender because there's no entity to stabilize the currency.  The result of any instability in the currency would result in HIGHER REAL interest rates because the uncertainty of the currency's stability will make lenders more averse to the risk.  I sincerely don't know if we'll ever see bitcoin leap some of the hurdles required to be anything more than a compliment to fiat.  There's far too much benefit for a government to maintain a central bank, and so long as most developed countries have one and we have to pay taxes to them, you're probably going to have to deal with fiat being the primary mechanism for borrowing/lending.
It doesn't matter either way, you aren't going to benefit much on a mortgage simply because the currency is now deflationary.
I seriously suggest YOU pick up an economics textbook before criticizing my knowledge of bitcoin because the fact that you have a mortgage and don't understand the difference between a real and nominal interest rate is frankly scary and proves your ignorance.   Just because we don't live in a deflationary world economy doesn't mean that no one has any clues about some of the things that might happen in one.  Deflation isn't some mythical thing that has never happened in the past.

Yeah, this isn't exactly true.  High frequency traders live for volatility...
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:36:21
Unless you really know what you're doing day trading (If your entire portfolio is only $3000 you probably don't), and by really know, I mean you're good enough to be a professional day trader, then don't bother gambling 2/5 of your bitcoin holdings trading.  Just hold it, seriously, in the long run you'll be way better off.  You will get burnt eventually no matter how much instinct and math you think you're doing to minimize risk.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:17:17
Not all investments pay off though.  It's not really an investment without any risk.   To say investing shouldn't be gambling is a conflicting  statement at the most  fundamental level.  When you invest there are expectations but no guarantees.

The subreddit pointed it out pretty clearly that it was a shit article if you actually read the discussion about it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:24:02
Sure it is, it shows that people only spend it for show one day a year (if it even has any truth to it).  If this were to be the way bitcoins are spent then you might as well go to the store and spend cash.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:33:31
People might not like my answer but nope not with returns like that unless I absolutely had to.  If you knew when the peaks would occur then yes but since we expect overall appreciation in the near future and our native currency is expected to inflate there's no reason not to spend USD holdings instead.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:01:22
You do realize that almost nothing would change for your mortgage in a deflationary bitcoin economy in real terms right?  The interest rate would just be a lot lower on it.  The real interest rate would likely be pretty close to the same.  Saying the banks win is like saying the sky is blue.  No one sane is going to lend you 150k for 30 years to buy a house at a loss or for a wash, even in a deflationary economy.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:00:35
About your second point...  If this is the long term future then bitcoin failed as a currency, what everyone that isn't in it for the quick buck hopes it becomes.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:55:53
No I know I am not capable of doing it.  Eventually what's going to happen to the average joe trying to accomplish this is you'll sell at what you think is a high, it'll go higher and then it's going to bottom out somewhere higher than you sold at and while you're waiting to buy back in it might go even higher and never go any lower than what you sold at in which case you are now biting the bullet and jumping back into the game at a loss if you want all your BTC back.  Or the other case you're going to buy at what you think is a low and it's going to stabalize even lower and if it's there long enough you might get nervous if it's ever coming back up and have to decide whether you want to stay in the market at all.
And I mean, really with $600 you aren't really making a killing even if you do it successfully for awhile.  It takes a lot of money to make a lot of money, so why risk the emotional stress with the peanuts you've got and just ride the wave and hope it's a long upward trend that many expect it to be.
If you don't care if that $600 dollar were to be flushed down the pisser and enjoy the thrilling highs and depths of despair gamble, then by all means, but I wouldn't recommend it.

I'm not saying in that situation Bitcoin fails entirely, just as a currency.  This discussion does make me reconsider what actually makes Bitcoin valuable though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:55:16
There is absolutely nothing wrong with the strategy.  What determines whether out not it's terrible is how risk averse you are and how good/lucky you are at hitting the peaks and valleys.  Boat loads of money are made and lost every day doing this on other exchanges.  Bitcoin is no different.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:00:06
Traders and investors certainly do.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:50:40
Well to play devil's advocate, we don't know how many people bought something with bitcoin and immediately replenished their bitcoin with USD.  None of these people are really parting with any of their bitcoin at all, they're just using it as a temporary vehicle for their fiat transactions because of a promotional event that makes bitcoin look good.  You can argue they're using it as currency but if you look past the veil of this transaction you see they don't want to part with it because of it's appreciating nature which is one of the major criticisms of it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:26:08
Because if people only spend it once a year for show then it isn't a good medium of exchange (I don't think it needs to be a good medium of exchange, only playing devil's advocate by stating that people spending bitcoin on black friday was pretty much a dog and pony show unless people keep doing it).  Also if this is the process of how you're going to spend bitcoin then you might as well just spend cash and skip the extra step :P.
