Not a couple generations, it will happen most likely within the next financial crisis. Even if the banks can shuffle world reserve currency off to china without completely destroying america or starting world war 3 the system has systemic failures that can not be sustained so it will eventually fail. The millennials are the first american generation that know the safety nets will not be there by the time they are ready to retire.

Funny thing, Keynesian economics works with enough central planning and currency controls to a degree if you can control the flow of money the slippage is manageable, however this is neither efficient or effective anymore with a global boarderless asset transfer network.  So as Bitcoin grows it will further disconnect central planners from the real economy as they lose control over the velocity and direction of money.

The underlying supply and demand valuation you are talking about only represents the minimum bitcoins can be worth with a certain amount of use. This valuation, although helpful, is not a great indicator as the price is mainly controlled by public opinion and speculation of future value. The added use value of these new services is nothing compared to the validation it gives Bitcoin. However, these new services do use bitcoins and even though it may have limited effect at first, as it becomes more common the confidence in this network will grow and that will be reflected in the price.

You are confusing leadership with centralization. Bitcoin has tons of leadership. This is confusing for most people because everyone wants Bitcoin to fit in a nice little package, something marketable that can be bottled up and sold. However, that is not the way Bitcoin works. Instead it is like minecraft, a blank world that gives most of the creative power to the user. At this stage you can use it to make transactions or hide wealth in some pretty cool new ways, but you could also use it to build that product you want Bitcoin to be, bottle it up and sell it to the masses. Kind of like what some of those companies I named up above are doing.

Socialists complain that big money influences government to profit itself at our expense. 
The socialist solution, is to then make government bigger.
Think of the government like a tool. You are essentially given a choice as to who gets to use this tool. Unfortunately there seems to be a nasty habit of the operator being corrupted and history says he is more likely to use it against you than to help you despite what he says to get your permission to use the tool. Socialists then claim the solution is to make the tool bigger.  Unfortunately this doesn't solve the problem of the operator being corruptible and in the end the operator gets corrupted again except this time he has even more power to profit from your expense. 
Libertarians on the other hand say, as we do not know how to stop corruption lets make that tool smaller. It will be harder for the operator to profit from our expense with a smaller weapon.

We will never reach $10k if we start being selective in who can use bitcoins. They are for everyone. Criminals and citizens alike. This is the point I am trying to teach you. 
Furthermore, we will reach $10k faster with bad actors using bitcoins as it ads to the user-base and those people who are actually using bitcoins, even if illegally, are adding infinitely more value than a sideline speculator who thinks we can get the price to increase if we banish the 'bad people'

I am trying to explain that 'we' should be 'you' unless you think its Bitcoin's responsibility. This is the first time you said its not. Until now your calls for 'we' could be interpreted as a call of action to Bitcoin in general and that is not how you get things done here. 
If you want tools to help enforce laws, you have to build them.

If bitcoins only use cases were taking over remittances and clearing houses and notaries, your logic may hold true, however these are only a few and not even the primary use case. Like I said, the  primary use case for bitcoins right now is a safe haven speculative commodity, and if this is successful then bitcoins will eventually be used more as currency. When currency becomes the primary use case, you can bet your last dollar you need to be 1 in 21 million.

Corruption is only efficient in centralized systems. Socialists, want more centralization. Despite the governments historic low approval ratings and criminal background, they want to give it more responsibility. We need to separate the government from responsibilities not give it more. 
The government is my enemy. It is both unnecessary and evil. It is a tool of coercion and despite best intentions it always does more harm than good. Even if by some accident it actually does some good, that good could of been done much more efficiently by private enterprise. 
You see, it isn't big money that is the enemy. It's really socialists who want something just for being alive. The 51% attack has been performed by the lower half of every great democracy in history so I don't expect anything different.

A network comprised of completely anonymous transactions could never integrate with the existing financial systems. You bring good points, but in the current system privacy is a commodity you have to pay for. Could it be better, yes. Should it be better, yes.

At least with bitcoin as is we will get the choice to have that privacy, we also get to plug into the big markets and that could be incredibly profitable.

The systemic flaw is corruption. So everything else aside, what is the grand plan for fixing it while consolidating power? Consolidated power attracts corruption. Only by breaking up responsibilities and distributing power more evenly can corruption be made more manageable and accountable. Doing that, is the complete opposite of what socialists are asking for. 
You complain about the price of healthcare and education yet it is my understanding that it is precisely because of government involvement that these things are so expensive. Government can't reduce costs of anything, ever. The only thing that creates an incentive to cut costs is a free and competitive market. Education used to cost $50 per kid per year, now it is over $6,000. Why? Public education. Who wants to build a school if someone already borrowed our money to build and maintain them? We used the same strategy to destroy Africa's farmers. Who is going to grow fruit to sell when they dump it from the sky for free? Do you seriously not understand that schools suck because there is no incentive for them to compete? Same goes for police and yes even our roads. You put the government in charge it only makes it more expensive and less gets done and absolutely no innovation takes place. 
[Law as a private good.]( The moral of this story is, everything should be voluntary. It is much more efficient and also has the added bonus of being morally correct. 
Now the weird part is under the our circumstances a combination of socialist-libertarian agendas would actually be the best way forward from here. I would agree with universal healthcare, if all the hospitals and doctors were free to compete among themselves. I also think this would be the best option for education now sense we obviously can't just close every public school. However what we could do is restructure the Department of Education as an auditor and privatize the schools to make them compete for funding. Kids still go for free, schools still have to compete, I'm still forced to pay money but now its at least less and the system is improving not getting worse. 
Basically, take how we run our military. The government is the customer, all the private security companies compete for the business. This model has worked pretty well, so why is every other department ass backwards? 
I would really like to see the socialists play nice with the libertarians. I think the give and take could create some truly great changes in the country. We could at least both agree that private money should get the fuck out of politics. It is such a shame we won't see a Rand/Bernie ticket campaigning on ending corruption and getting special interests out of Washington. Maybe its for the best though, that might burn the internet down.

In a voluntary society people would pay into non profit organizations for the government services they wanted expanded, or at least let people decide what government agencies to fund with the taxes.
As it stands here in the US, we elect politicians too. However recent studies have proven that special interests (lobbyists) get what they want over 90% of the time. That means 30% of the public, gets what they want 5% of the time, another 30% get what they want another 5% of the time and special interests get what they want 90% of the time on average. Special interests also help to make sure the last 10% the public fight over is done with their narrative.  Its a completely broken system.

Velocity is required for some calculations. Because bitcoin acts like a combination of investments no single formula would be best for looking at bitcoin's value. It is a commodity, and a currency and a ledger and much much more. No one has an equation that can give you the value of something like this yet because we don't know what it will eventually be capable of. Some think it can already topple governments, others have been calling it a fad for years. Find a happy medium and make a guess.

Lost me. Bitcoins will always be scarce. They HAVE to be, the network depends on it. 


50/50 but people invest in bitcoin primarily as a tamper proof store of value. These new services will attract some more intelligent investors, but it builds confidence for the next stage. When average joe should start investing, we have a reputable base of legal services being used in large companies right now and that makes bitcoin much more than some anarchist or libertarian fantasy. Opinion is what matters for the price to go up. I agree the use case is small, until it becomes standard. The satoshi burn rate your speaking of, will not noticeably impact price for years, unless a speculative bubble launches us to new highs and scarcity becomes an issue when everyone wants bitcoins.

Right well if you think fiat is better then the only use case for bitcoins is the black market and the NASDAQ implementation was a stunt that they will back away from and develop their own blokchain.  However, I do not believe fiat will remain dominate during my lifetime.
Again, my point is that bitcoin acts like a commodity that can be used as a currency and that is how it will stay for some time. When/if bitcoins primary use becomes currency, the value of each bitcoins will continue to rise relative to how much they are used.

You can't because it doesn't effect adoption. It may effect investing, but to what degree, you haven't shown any peer reviewed studies proving how many people are scared away. 
On my side its at least simple. One user for any reason ads value even if criminal. So how many people does he scare away?
Now if your statement is true then where are all the people who don't trade USD because the Mexican cartels use it? Oh they don't exist, because your logic is flawed.

How much do they spend to accept bitcoins? From experience it doesn't cost a thing for online merchants. Set up is a minimal sunk cost. 


That depends on what you expect from your transaction. If you don't want to risk identity theft then bitcoins are one of the best options for security and privacy compared to ccvs. If you want speed then bitcoins again are better. The only metric bitcoins seem to lag in are users and those take time to acquire. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:58:36
Unless your a bitcoiner explicitly looking for it, then your chances of finding it are proportional to your determination. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:37:02


Yes and Yes.


No but again I specifically said online merchants. POS in person is much different. Also training the end users is a top down approach and doesn't apply to the bottom up track bitcoins are on. Mozilla experimented with accepting bitcoins for donations because users are using bitcoins already, no training required but time for the network to spread is still needed.


Projected losses on an isolated test page can be explained in a number of was such as due in part to bitcoiners checking to see if they really could donate with bitcoins but not because they had no plans to do so.  Regardless they still accept bitcoins...

If Bitcoin was the only threat to the fiat system this would be plausible. Fortunately the system's greatest threat is itself, and will inevitably collapse under its own weight. We have been witnessing the first warning signs of this collapse sense the financial crisis of 08. The powers at be are becoming increasingly hostile, like animals backed into corners it seems they lash out at anything these days, and because of this I don't see any grand widespread effort of cooperation among them to create a strong opposition. One elite will not sacrifice even a portion of wealth to subdue a technology they can not destroy and I don't think cooperation is on the table for them at this point either as they are all fighting each-other for the best position to survive the next financial crisis. Taking these perspectives into account it is much more likely that they risk a small portion of wealth to hedge their bets or ignore it completely through ignorance.

Yes bitcoins still act better as a speculative commodity than a currency, but it wont stop greeks from being interested in it. The ability to be your own bank, never get your accounts frozen or funds confiscated, being in full control of your money at all times, these are really big ideas to hit online finance and in a nation where people just lost 50% of all bank accounts the volatility risk will be overlooked by a small minority and that is how Bitcoin will grow to be a more stable store of value as more and more people take the risk that gets smaller and smaller as more people join.

The interconnected fiat system is designed to handle a certain amount of failures at a certain rate. However due to the QE punchbowl many risks have been exasperated to levels never before seen in written history, to the extent that we can't even be sure the price finding function of the market is even still functional. This means that either central bankers have found the philosophers stone or we are headed to a complete system reset. 
You are correct, it is reasonable to wait for the smaller collapses first. (Cyprus, Greece...) and then watch to see if the problem becomes an epidemic (if the Euro failed) and this was largely my strategy before bitcoin. In a world without bitcoin, this would of been a global power shift, maybe a WW3 and then we would get another few decades of this horrible system as they patched it back together with tape. 
However with Bitcoin, things change a bit. The first is this whole notion of national bonds, who needs bonds if your currency is naturally deflationary? This seemingly insignificant shift will be the largest transfer of wealth in human history, and it will wreck all the best laid plans of fiat planners everywhere.

No. all core dev upgrades are optional, the nodes on the network then choose to upgrade or not. If a core dev created a patch that hurt bitcoin in any way there would be a community wide debate and most would chose not to upgrade. So a patch to make bitcoin less divisible, would never get implemented, however a patch that made it more divisible might if everyone decided that was an upgrade worth implementing.

If this was the first time I had issue with r/politics I might of had more patience. However let me run you through this one example and the experience I had. I linked a relevant article that had not been previously linked. You can tell because reddit has that nifty tab for it and the only other link was the one here in r/bitcoin. Now for mine to get singled out within 10 minutes as a duplicate post in a sea of duplicate anti-rand anti-libertarian blog spam I might be able to sympathize that it could be an honest error. So I politely reply to the mod's comment in my thread and say I checked, didn't find the other thread could he un-flag mine. The mod does not reply. My reply to him gets downvoted. So I shoot him a message directly. No reply. So I message the mod mailing list. Another half hour goes by and no reply. At this point it has been an hour, I feel pretty well ignored so I post my rant back on the original thread here. A few minutes go by and a mod tells me they are checking on it finally and I reply thanks so much and wait for the flag to be removed. A little annoyed I lost an hour on the new tab but oh well I figure this wont be a huge audience anyway. Nothing. Some time later a new link by someone else is posted and that one can be okay now that a decent amount of people are pissed off. 
I understand that you guys got a lot of bitcoin spam and none of you probably care about the political discussions that are going on around this industry. I understand errors happen and in a sea of rand spam another rand post might accidentally get deleted. However it is only after what I can assume was a huge flood into your modbox that this issue was dealt with and we finally got a discussion going on this morning's news around 5pm. 
I love politics, and I wish I could be a regular over in r/politics but this isn't the first time something like this has happened.

Early investors pull money out to build services, this drops the price but expands ease of use and utility. 
With more ease of use and utility we will see more demand, when increase % in demand surpasses current % of inflation you will see a rise in price. My bet is sometime before the next halving you will see price start to rise as the market anticipates the drop in inflation. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:57:34
I am currently taking an interest in oil with this mindset. Oil seems low, but its not relative to gold. So is oil low or has everything else been incredibly inflated?

Every asset in a debt based economy is someone else's liability. This creates systemic risk in the system, but the powers at be are allowed to ignore this risk because the system is imposed by fiat and all competition was rounded up and shot behind the woodshed.

Relatively slow adoption... compared to what?
This isn't a video game, or cell phone. The adoption ocf a currency takes time. I think bitcoin has had exceptional growth, growth so astonishing people routinely point to it as some defacto proof that it won't work. 
Try thinking of bitcoin like an organism rather than a product for a moment and take a step back. Bitcoins were first a commodity, all they could do was changeb records on a decentralized ledger, like a tiny egg with a single purpose and only under the right conditions could it hatch. Then someone traded them for goods or services, and the egg hatched into a cool little caterpiller. True, it's a mighty step up from the egg but still very voulnerable and not very pretty to most people. Now this little bug also had one job to do and only under certain circumstances would it succeed. It was out in the wild and it needed to bulk up fast so it started eating anything it could. That little currency went from nothing to over $1,000 in the span of a few years. Before this currency is 10 years old, it is being compared to the gold standard. That is like a toddler running in the olympics. This experiment has already exceeded tons of expectations but this little caterpiller isn't done yet. Smart contracts, microtransactions, decentralized free trade, global notary, this bug is spinning a cocoon and what comes out is anyone's guess at this point. 
If you think $1,000 was some fluke of the market, I promise your going to be suprised.

Resource distribution is distorted by central planning, decentralized economies with free markets will have a much more efficient price discovery that will result in a much more efficient and fair distribution of resources. This is not necessarily related to debt however debt based economies are inflation driven thus they only grow by spending, this results in reckless spending that can contribute to distorting price discovery.

Bitcoin exchanges don't have a good track record. Again you expose yourself to a potential total loss if the exchange goes down. It might not seem like a big risk if your just using it to make purchases online but it can be if you start to hold them longterm.

All fiat is interconnected and the USD is behind them all. 


Even the Saudi's. 


oil price is not low in respect to gold. So is oil low or has everything else been inflated and the oil pack decided to get right with the money first? They look foolish now but the first one to leave the party always does, its the guy that gets stuck with the bill at the end I'm worried about. 


Trade is the excuse, the function is the continued complete control over economies and the giant blank check they like to use so often. 


Very simple, it is when % increase in demand is higher than the % of inflation. Right now bitcoin is in its awkward phase. Too big to kill, not big enough to change the world yet. We may start to see the tipping point as early as next year when Bitcoin inflation gets cut in half again. Then we only need to sustain a 5% increase in demand or higher for the value to rise.

Yes. If coinbase goes down, for any reason, you have a risk of losing your coins. If you use a trezor your bitcoins will be completely secure in your possession. 
Bitcoins are tokens, entries on a ledger. The private key gives you access to the 'account' to spend them. If you use coinbase, they hold your keys for you. If you use trezor, it holds your keys and you hold the trezor. It is safer than most hot wallets and you retain complete ownership of the keys. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:20:46
if you use coinbase you do not own your bitcoins. They do and you have an iou for bitcoins in their possession. If you are not tech savy, I advise you continue with this approach as they know how to keep them safe and the risk of using them out ways the risk of securing your own coins. Again only if you are not tech savy.
If you buy bitcoins on BTCmarket you can withdraw them to your coinbase wallet. Just go to withdraw and input your coinbase wallet address and send, they should be there in 10-30 minutes. 
There are a lot of wallet options, be sure you chose the one right for you. I prefer trezor hardware as I like being in control of my money.

2009 - (network is born) A pinhole is punched into the bottom of the fiat machinery.
2010- (exchange to fiat starts) The pinhole starts to leak. 
2011- (free marketplace born) The oil leaking out widens the hole, more leaks out. 
2012- The hole has now started showing signs that it may become a problem, the oil has continued to leak at an increasing rate, but the owners of the machine ignore it because its too small to do any real damage to such a large machine. 
2013- The hole has become a problem, the owners of the machine try a patch (shutdown free market) but the patch lasts less than a day and actually makes the problem even worse. 
2014- The owners of the machine now try and spin the news of the machines problems to everyone that relies on it, while launching PR stunts to try and convince the oil not to leave the machine. This of course doesn't work because oil being a liquid won't be reasoned with, it just flows from a highly consecrated area to a lower concentrated area when not fully contained. Some owners of the machine start to disagree on how best to fix the problem. The leak continues to get worse.
2015- The leak becomes a *feature* of the machine as some of the maintenance workers finally got approval from the owners to start setting up guidelines for the oil that has leaked out in a vain attempt to suck some of the leak back into the machine. This of course is like trying to clean up oil with your bare hands and probably will continue to make the problem worse. Some of the owners of the fiat machine start to notice this strategy may not be best and start defecting to build new minimachines with the oil that's leaked out. 
2016-2019- The differences between the owners of the fiat machine and the owners of new minimachines become confrontational. Things get ugly, but no mater what the owners of the fiat machine do they can't seem to patch the hole and every day their competition working with much more efficient machines grow stronger. 
2020+ish The fiat machine has leaked over half of its oil, it seizes up, engine becomes an unusable hunk of junk, the rest of the oil rushes out determined not to get stranded in the broken machine. Errybody parties on the moon.

This hypothetical, although not as crazy as the "what would it take to do ALL the transactions" discussion is along the same lines but much more relevant. 
Everyone needs to be prepared for OpenBazzar being as successful or more likely more successful than silkroad. The only solutions available would be to increase the block size, and/or decrease the time it takes to find a block. Both are arbitrary limits that can change, however these changes haven't been made for two reasons that I am aware of. The first is physical limitations of the internet, the second is the network's security. Most likely, I would expect them to allow the increase in fees for the time as I would not be in favor of weakening the network if it can be avoided. Now if it then gets to a point where its killing the network, I would expect a slight trade-off.

The OpenBazzar project is the frontrunner. So how decentralized trade emerges? When did it go away? People have always been trading with eachother directly, they still do, this just let's people trade with eachother globally. Like ebay but without that trusted third party stuff.

Im not disagreeing with what your saying is happening. I am disagreeing with the tone that this is somehow bad for the network. This is how it was designed to work, the hashrate is supposed to bleed the value down closer to true utility value until demand overtakes inflation and we start all over again. The only thing here I am wondering about is when does demand surpass inflation forever, because there will come a time when demand is always growing faster than inflation for bitcoin and I can't wait till we get there. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:45:08


Incorrect, Bitcoin challenges multiple arms of the government. From patents, to education and history all the way to money. Bitcoin offers us an immutable history, global financial liberty and global free markets. Just one of these would be threatening, with all of them and so much more potential it is down right frightening to the ones in charge and a huge opportunity to the other 99.9999% of the world.

This has been thoroughly discussed and is not a concern. I would never put my bitcoins into an institution that mandated they get signature power over my money. I can be my own bank with Bitcoin, then its just a matter of buying a trusty trezor that generates new addresses for each transaction or using dark wallet services to mask my identity. Bitcoin enables financial liberty the likes the world has never seen before, the consumer has a choice and that is all that is needed. Nothing you described extends the power of governments in my eyes, its completely optional to be tracked by the government with Bitcoin.

The 51% attack is a none issue, even a central bank would rather profit with a dominate position in the new economy than attempt to tank the price on an indestructible new payment system that it isn't sure it could kill even when burning money to do it. 
The miners are not Bitcoin, they are independent contractors that are hired to perform a service. The network runs just fine if one person mines or one million. Due to the distributed nodes, mining centralization isn't a huge threat with the incentives aligned with the network and the users. 
The most likely scenario: We range around 200-300 for a few months until the world realizes the great halving of 2016 is drawing near, then we man the moon rockets for maybe the last bitcoin bubble. After we could see demand outpace inflation forever. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:29:30
The reality you put forth was and I am paraphrasing so tell me if I get this wrong; "Governments would have more ability to track transactions"
To which I explain, no they wont without complete control of Bitcoin, which they will never get. They will never be able to tell how many bitcoins I have on my trezor unless I tell them. They will never be able to tell how much weed I order from Canada unless I tell them, ext. You can even do it manually for free or use convenient dark wallets. 
Like I explained Bitcoin offers a choice. Sure the institutions you speak of may arise, but so what? I won't give them my bitcoins so tell me how that effects me?

All coins are anonymous coins if the user decides so and until that changes I'm good. Your vision of creeping NWO is the very polar opposite of what is happening internationally right now. Countries are conflicting more with each other not less, citizens are disagreeing with governments not agreeing with them. A poll today shows that Americans think our government is now the number 1 problem in the world. Only the most brainwashed statists can foresee a happy future of government and Bitcoin holding hands.
Even if the majority filed taxes on bitcoins and reported all bitcoin transactions, the government still wouldn't be able to track, find or single out my coins if I chose not to file or report on myself. Your understanding of Bitcoin is flawed but thank-you for the conversation, your perception was interesting.

If that was true then they wouldn't have to use force. Your logic is flawed. 


Nope, when regulatory burden is increased companies leave. Check out New York, most start ups have stalled or left.  
As to how do you remain anonymous,it is rather easy. Generate a new address, no one can stop you and no one can know its yours unless you tell them. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:30:58


I wouldn't make assumptions like that. Considering mining is a form of speculative investment, and a worse one than buying the coins instead most of the time, I would say most miners are not in this for quick gains. I would say most sell only what they have to and lock the rest away. Regardless it doesn't matter what the motives are or if they dump everything they are holding on the market. The slower bitcoin rises, the longer it goes down, the better for everyone involved right now except the get rich quickers and no one cares about them anyway.

@_date: 2015-03-30 18:57:53


Incorrect, this means for BTC value to rise, demand must increase faster than the rate of inflation. Miners will most likely always sell coins to meet cost. This disperses the coins into the public more keeping bitcoins from becoming too centralized. The high stakes game of bitcoin trading is not for the weak hands.

@_date: 2015-03-12 23:05:08
My second example is common sense. The regulations require Bitcoin start-ups from New York to register in each individual state with a cost of about $250,000. Sure the big guys love this because it cuts down on competition but all the smaller start ups that can't afford such an expense relocate to more regulatory free zones, like Canada that has a 5 year wait and see but don't touch approach to Bitcoin.

Please elaborate on how governments accessing the blockchain extends their control?

Tide turning. 
The intelligent people in the financial industry are jumping ship. Like the Masters, you know those commodity people that invented derivatives, kinda big deal, are now working in a bitcoin start-up. A few higher ups from just about every major financial company have now made the jump to bitcoin including folks from JPM and Goldman. Large retailers are taking notice and accepting bitcoins. Titans such as Google and Microsoft are getting involved in small ways and only the most courageous reporters dare laugh at this little experiment that could and should change the world. They ignored it, they laughed at it, now regulators and banks have been trying to slow its progress as much as possible without igniting a direct conflict, like when banks close customer accounts for using it or a bill in congress gets lobbied to increase the regulatory burden. This signifies the banks desire to fight it but also their fear of what a direct fight might result in, because they had the power to outlaw it but they didn't. If they push too hard too fast the backlash from Bitcoin could be devastating for them, such as making it completely anonymous instead of pseudonymous. 
tl;dr Bitcoin already won, the rest of the world is on the verge of this discovery and as time passes it just becomes more and more obvious.

I can pick points in the series that seem to match bitcoin's own transformation. 
The banishment of the foundation to the farthest corner of the galaxy. Bitcoin being built in the recesses of the internet. The rise of a religious cult bent on galactic domination. The consolidation of libertarian fanatics bent on breaking central banking. A politically and religiously atheist trading guild that traded with all and war with none.  The free market of the silk road and soon open bazzar with business professionals preaching 'we can coexist' to the existing powers and that Bitcoin is by default neutral to all beliefs. The inevitable confrontation of Old vs New as the growth of the new system outpaces the collapse of the old. 
Maybe I am reaching but it blows my mind.
