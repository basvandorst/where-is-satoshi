How long have you been in crypto? Bitcoin was under $1000 in January 17'. Some alts like strat (99mil supply) went from $.07 to $36, Verge went from like $.00001 to $.30. Bitcoin moving $3000 a month isn't  impossible.

You could sell and buy LTC. If LTC goes from ~30 to ~60 in the next 2 months you'll be glad you did

i would think most people arnt buying even 1 coin let alone multiple at a time, people buy to add to the moon stash, price going up ~$150-$200 isnt making a big difference for people buying less than 1/2 or 1/3 or less of a coin at a time

pretty broad question. are your talking about adding a debit card or your bank account deets? are you saying youre going to add/remove either or each time you want to buy/sell? sounds like a good way to get your account flagged for closure. ive had my details on there for 4 years and dont worry a bit and had no problems.

its dropping bc it just hit an all time high wednesday and people who bought when it was lower were selling, it went up $600 in two weeks, when people dump the price drops, and then when more people buy bc the price is low it climbs again. as more people continue to buy the price will rise again but know one knows how low it will go before it climbs.

coinbase (exchange+wallet), breadwallet, block.io, electrum

coinbase is fine to use as a wallet, you can download their app to. they insure your coin however some will always tell you to have your own wallet, for the most part you can sleep comfortably with your coins on coinbase but if youre buying a lot you can always take them offline to store on a cold wallet and then only you have control

people said it was crazy to buy at $1000, yes buying at the ATH without waiting for a dip isnt great strategy but it will rise again, when and how much well...

"insanely large combination of possible 12 word strings"
would take anywhere between 1 to 10 billion years to do

you have to buy with your limit and it will increase, after you buy with $150 after a few days it will let you buy with $500

try coinbase again? whats wrong with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:03:19
lightning. if lightning gets activated in the next few weeks it will be very lucrative compared to bitcoins 200k pending transactions, +12 hour wait time and absurd fees
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:04:42
Lots of people are always buying, it's essentially not about price, it's about accumulating as much as possible in what you can afford and then hodling till the moon.
