There is something about that $6000 Low that this market likes...still havent broken that Low of Feb
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:30:26
Unless we get an inflection point in there somewhere, you’re right holy shit these guys at Bitmain and TSMC are raking in the dough
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:29:07
You can be “in it for the tech” but you definitely can’t say you like losing money 
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:45:08
No, we don’t lol. No one bought bitcoin hoping it would go down
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:52:25
Bull Run Confirmed
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:28:01
IMHO, I don't think its the less-developed countries like Venezuela or Cuba that will spark the next Bull Run.
We will need a huge capital investment from some big financial firm (or firms) in order to spark the next run

Can we get to 11k today?!
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:35:19
How long til 12?!
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:33:52
I just have a hunch we aren’t out of the woods yet
Volume is abt only 2/3 of what it was in Dec
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:29:34
not too late to buy direct into Cardano
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:59:04
Exchanges (For the Majority of People...not early Bitcoin Adopters) will probably end up acting like a bank in that they will have secure centralized storage of Cryptocurrency.  The responsibility of a person to maintain all of their own cash just seems like a dangerous thing for todays society
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:42:02
The reversal since 6.8k
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:05:31
This is funny
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:36:25
Can I get 1 of your 160k Leftover Bitcoins?  Would appreciate it!
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:37:55
Waiting for those Asians to wake up so we can crack 9k for good
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:18:41
This article is a special kind of stupid
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:57:02
Nothing. This whole reversal has been due to Asia
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:20:33
Asia deff drives the market. At least this turnaround 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:46:46
Idk if it were a 6-12hr chart I would agree...1hr not long enough
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:16:56
Isn’t that what ETH, ADA, and others are doing ；）
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:40:52
Just Tethered...exited several Alts.  See you in a few weeks guys
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:18:59


Damn Bro you sleep in late
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:10:05
Is it Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season, or is this a Bull Trap? Any thoughts?
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:55:29
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:15:56
Sell your debt and he'll pay up, haha
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:02:55
I'm talking about the real-world debt...pew pew
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:13:06
