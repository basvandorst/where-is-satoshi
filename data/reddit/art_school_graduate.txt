Alright Timmy here is your million dollar question.
Before sending millions of dollars of btc to an exchange what should you do first?
1: Get your account verified.
2: Test out the withdrawals.
3: Have your withdrawal limit raised.
**4: Do none of the above and cry on reddit when your funds**

Just pointing out that every dollar you make mining bitcoin, comes out of your parents pocket. You might as well ask your parents directly for money and skip the whole mining thing. What's the point of earning $1000 a month mining bitcoin, when your monthly electricity bill goes up by $1500. This is no different from buying stuff with your dads creditcard, and keeping the money when you resell it.
