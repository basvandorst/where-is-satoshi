I don't think he has really considered the technology of a lot of other coins. They're not waiting for bitcoin to adapt. Bitcoins going to have to work hard to keep up. Bitcoin is relying heavily on its first mover advantage right now, but that wont last.

Its losing ground.

I dont really know. But ive never heard him mention anything outside of btc, bch, ltc, or eth.

If you already have your ledger and the wallet app setup you just need to do the transaction i assume. In the wallet app there is a place that says receive. Click on that. There should be a long string of characters that you can copy. On the exchange there should be something that says withdraw. Click that and itll ask you for the wallet address. Just paste it there. Then submit it. If youre nervous just do it with a small amount of money. Itll take a bit of time to go through so dont freak out if it doesnt show up immediately. The longest ive had to wait was about an hour. It should be faster than that though.

You've bought 40k worth of bitcoin and you don't even know how to make a basic transaction? Do yourself a favor and sell it back for usd. Start smaller. Do some research before you go all in.

Theyre not though. There are a lot of promising projects that have been anle to learn from btcs difficulties. They may not be at btcs level marketcap wise. But that could change.

Good point but there still are coins that are competing with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:55:45
Yeah but newer cryptos have been able to look at the problems bitcoin has faced so that they can adress them sooner. In that way theyre able to speed up development because they know what to look at out for. Decentralized or not.

Its a new industry, so its far from perfect. Have you looked at their [guides]( They pretty much cover everything youd need to know.

I don't think that this is the attack on crypto that most people think it is. A lot of people have had issues with their money getting tied up in exchanges or not having their bank transfers go through. Im sure many of these people end up disputing this with their banks, leading the banks to stop allowing transactions to these exchanges so that they dont have to deal with angry customers and missing money. Im sure your point is true in some cases but surely not all.

Idk where youre from but the usd is decreasing in value due to inflation. And most places dont pay you in cash. Cash is anonymous but it cant be used for online transactions. Btc can. Volitility is a downside but it will go away as widespread adoption increases.

Then how do we get BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:41
Whats about local bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:51:47
All my trades were pretty insignifcant attempts at day trading. I think i broke even in the end of it all. Do i have to report every single trade? What form would i use?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:09
Thats dumb. Why dont we get tax write offs as the usd is constantly decreasing in value?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:18:39
Its more anonymous. Easier to do international transactions. Is increasing in value for the time being. You have more control over your money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:20:18
They connect sellers and buyers of btc. You can do cash exchanges locally. You have to verify your identity initially and the btc goes from the seller through the site to the buyer. I imagine that after an initial meetup you might be able to convince them to trade without using the site. But thats more dangerous i suppose.

Shit im dyslexic.

Yes but they can always allow smaller divisions of bitcoin so it wont really matter.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:06:27
Wouldnt every transaction have to be recorded for tax purposes?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:19:33
I think ideally there should be systems in place that allow people to trust a centralized authority with their bitcoin if they feel that they are able to trust that authority more than themselves, but the underlying structure of bitcoin would still allow it to be used in a decentralized manner if one so chooses.

I mean lower than coinbases card fees. If youre smart though you use gdax, which has lower fees on limit orders. The real place that gemini shines imo is how they pre credit usd deposits.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:16:23
Being illegal doesnt mean much. The whole point of it is that its not in the hands of any central authority, so they cant just seize your funds or shut down your account. Your money is only accessible with your private key. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:25:26
I had a friend who did this and claimed hed made thousands. I tried to get him to teach me but he wouldnt. I sorta get it though. I dont really want to be too responsible for people getting into crypto. So far im making more on my crypto returns than i am at my part time job, but theres still a lot i dont know and im always ready to lose my money. I can live with that, but i dont want to be responsible for losing anybody elses money.

Thats not really bartering. Its exchanging goods and services for a currency. Thats just how money works. How do you think you get your fiat?

A tiny bit of python and ti basic.
