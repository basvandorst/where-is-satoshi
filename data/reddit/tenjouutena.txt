Why do you guys think that someone needs a solution for moving currency between countries. 
Really, the 'use case' for bitcoin is between 100 and 500 USD.  At that rate the fees are small and you can find local currency to actually use to consume.  Any lower than that and the feed start to pile up, as does the general transaction overhead.   Any more than that and there is fluidity problems in actually finding a source to get spendable currency out of it.  
And at 100-500 USD, most banks / western union, amex travelers check, or whatever, provide a mighty fine service.

In about a month (judging by transactions) they've raised about 0.7 BTC.   There's about 8 months left before the drop, so at a constant rate it would be 5.6 BTC.   there's 71k people in Dominica.   So each person should get about 0.00008 (rounding up) BTC (Which is about 5 cents).

The times these things are done with physical remittances (instead of just accounting entries) is to satisfy tax authorities anyway; and they probably, like it or not, aren't going to recognize the bitcoin transfer.

None of these really protect from the rebroadcast and hope style of double spends, though.   That's really the issue with all of these analysis of the problem, is that they concentrate on 100% success scams.

POS systems could, but it would take a lot of extra programming vs. 'look for transactions addressed to this address.'   Besides there's no real incentive NOT to do this.   You could even write a better script that tries to send both transactions from different parts of the network, increasing the time it takes for the attempted double spend to be detected.   
Double spends, accidental or not, happen all the time on the network.      There's tons of unprocessed duplicate transactions that eventually get dropped.

Yeah, the headlines make it seem like it was just BTC, but he's actually mostly arrested for knowingly facilitating money laundering, bypassing restrictions he pledged to uphold, and allowing unregistered use.   THe meat from the DoJ Report:
SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated FAIELLA’s business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLA’s business as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA to use the Company’s services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers; personally processed FAIELLA’s orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLA’s illicit activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Company’s Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was SHREM’s job to enforce them and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as a money services business.

After BTC became popular, many people started other bitcoin-like networks.   Some of these were designed to cover problems (or perceived problems) in BTC (10 minute block time; memory-lite hash sceme (i.e. only specialized miners are profiatable); fully deflationary currency;  Toxic community).   Others were mostly designed to take advantage of people with money and wanting to get rich quick.  Paycoin seems to be one of the latter.
Collectively these others are called 'altcoins' in general.   Some BTCers really hate them, others are ambivalent except in cases like this where it's an obvious scam.
(FYI Paycoin and GAW are close too but not exactly the same thing.   One is the network, the other is the "company" that runs it (more or less.))

I suspect I've dealt with credit card processing more than most people on this sub.   I've worked on several 'ends' of the process, and it's only bitcoiners who are obsessed with chargeback fraud.   With businesses I've helped it never comes up as an actual thing.    Even casual googling on it more or less comes up with a few prolific crazies obsessed with selling their own wonky point of view.    Reports on CC cost and chargeback cost done by large information companies (and not the gut-feel style "comparisons" that often appear on bitcoin sites) pin it at way lower than bitcoin folk tend to specify.   Places I've worked at it's not even broken out, just a generic number with other types of uncontrollable loss that never rises above about .1% of their top line.
