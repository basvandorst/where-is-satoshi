Bitcoin's probably not for you just yet. So far the only advantage it has over fiat is for vice (gambling and drugs). You clearly don't care for all this speculation, politics, and philosophy. That's perfectly reasonable, but then there's nothing for you here.

Is his view of the bitcoin community the bitcoin subreddit? I'd agree that there's a ton of circlejerking here. But the bitcoin forums have way more substance and are bigger too. Ironically, this is a result of reddits algorithms. Fools find easy validation here when they find none on a place like bitcoin forums. 
Also, I'd argue the dogecoin subreddit is even more circlejerky than this place. It's just more broadly appealing  because it's apolitical. Everyone likes a good circlejerk once in a while, but no one likes watching other people do it.

You're probably one of the few. I see that as too risky for myself.

"Inherently internet money" sounds an awful lot like the philosophizing that goes on here. And for now using bitcoins on the internet is way more clunky than using fiat because: 1. You likely keep most of your money in fiat and have buy bitcoins in order to use them. 2. There are very few places that actually accept bitcoins. The ones that do are doing so for advertising and out of speculation. There are a few edge cases where bitcoin is superior to fiat but they don't apply to the majority of us here. Therefore the only reason to be here is to speculate in the abstract

What about legal issues? This seems like the kind of thing apple would sue for.

You don't need legitimate grounds to sue. You just need a ton of money and an axe to grind.
