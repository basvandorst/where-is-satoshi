go to gdax.com its owned by coinbase and your coinbase account works there. transfer your coins to gdax. its instant and free. then transfer out from there to your jaxx wallet for FREE
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:15:12
It works you just can't trade on gdax in to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:12:54
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:13:48
BUY HIGH SELL LOW !
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:16:47
Go to gdax and link your account. You can transfer between the two. No need to go through blockchain.

THE GOLDEN RULE. DO NOT INVEST MONEY YOU CANT AFFORD TO LOOSE. 
i would never put my kids futures or my house on the line. you are a brave man. hope everything works out for you.... im sure it will..... but still... ahhhhhhhh.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:21:41
everything segwit / legacy is compatible with each other. but only if you send from a segwit - segwit address will you reap the benefits. the benefit is smaller transaction size. and thus smaller fees.
edit : if everyone supported and uses segwit we could possibly fit 1.7-8mb of data in the same 1mb block.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:39:59
it can take a few days before you see any action from ether side. when you buy with a credit card you get instant funds. you dont have to wait.

open source software means anyone can make a fork. there will be plenty in the future. i plan on ignoring them all....

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:29:08
I use one called bitcoin ticker widget. It works pretty good. Also has alot of other features.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:04:52
omg. i wish i didn't do that. :( LOLOLOL 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:06:05
prices come from the exchanges themselves. its not a blanket price across the board.

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:06:51
THERE ARE NO BITCOIN COINS WTF
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:22:12
You can transfer your coins to gdax and withdrawal for free. You say gdax is a bitch, but that's the only out for your coins without paying the network fees.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:52:40
Buy high sell low
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:32:32
lol wat.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:59:01
i don't think that's how it works. you cant just claim others coins...
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:23
dude is such a bully.

ahh cool i thought both partys had to support it but that makes more sense it would only haveto be from the sender. thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:46
your fucking dumb. end of story.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:10:30
Coinbase to gdax is free... Gdax to where ever also free.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:01:37
I think the system is trying to make room for the fees. Try to send half the amount over first. See what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:37:18
lightning network will alleviate almost all the fee problems if it can be properly implemented and becomes what they hope it will. its just gettign to the ITS WORKING stage so give it a few months to start seeing it pop up in actual applications.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:14
hell why not 18.5k ??? wooooo
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:13:03
if you sell your coins then reinvest in to coins its not really any different then holding it....
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:55:19
Pretty much. It seems complicated to use. But it's all in the back end software. The user will just have to open the app wallet and send to a address. It will be just as easy as it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:06
coinbase goes down everytime there is a dip its fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:37:53
they ask for and hold your id for the sake of money laundering laws. you cant get them to delete it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:05:19
shits cray
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:11:35
to to gdax.com. its owned by coinbase and your coinbase account will let you login there. you can transfer your coins to gdax then from there you can send them to quad for 0 fees. i do this. its great.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:26:59
Jokes on you guys. This dude's a time traveler.

having security is worth the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:48:30

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:07:48
The whole market is tanking across the board...
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:49:54

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:41

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:19:13
buy with credit card on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:35:28
hopefully you bought bitcoin and not bitcoin cash... if you payed out of your bank account it might just take a few days. if its from a credit card it should be instant.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:59:34
You only don't pay taxes if all you do is buy and hold. You pay taxes on every other type of transaction. Sell. Trade. Exchange between 2 coins. Ect.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:56:08

Do your own reserch and make up your own mind.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:14:38
It's a good idea. Do you like give them your private keys to hold on to or something. Cause that seems a bit sketchy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:59:29

Pretty sure bitcoin.com is his.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:23:14
Bitcoins will be mined till 2140. Lots of time. After that all you have to assume is that they can divide infinitely.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:13:46

@_date: 2017-11-28 04:52:22
You did about all you can. Just wait for a reply... Im sure they will work out a refund for you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:14:43
Just close your account and take your money else where . They can't tell you what your allowed to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:19:04
From a PR perspective, if he was working for a company and acted like that. He would be fired.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:04:01
Coinbase can set up buy orders monthly weekly daily ect. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:12:47
Just because they use a card doesn't mean they are going in to debt. I use my credit cards for everything I buy, and pay it off with my pay checks. I think using a card is just the fastest way and also prolly the way people feel more comfortable then giving out the bank information to buy magic internet money. Plus I get 2% cash back on my credit card purchases... Including my crypto buys. Auto 2% gain.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:03:47
They should go down eventually. The developers are also working on new techs to help scale in the future. So don't worry about it being a forever thing.

What does following your coins gain you though? Oven if you can find them. Your not getting them back.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:02:08
Ooo thats got a nice ring to it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:50:47
coinbase does credit card but its a 4% fee.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:41:12
Lol I like this one.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:00:03

@_date: 2017-11-28 04:14:26
Yeah but only one of them fingered the camera, said fuck you a bunch of times and rage quit... The other guy was deff egging him on, but if your gonna agree to something like that, and do it promoting his brand, you gotta remain calm and collected. I will forever remember this video and how he acted.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:31:39
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:22:05
buy on coinbase. transfer to quad. then sell. is that really that difficult to understand?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:41:32
Pretty much how I feel about it. The whole bcash is Bitcoin thing is what I really don't like about the project. Just be your own coin like every other alt before you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:32:09
I'd say next is 15. Then 20. Then 25. Then 50. 75. 100k !!!!!!
