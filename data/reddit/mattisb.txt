Reminds me of all the headlines google news gives me after bitcoin does good. Any drop is a 'crash' or it 'returns to support at x', anyway they can spin it so it looks like it lost way more than it gained. I love the vid.

It's a technical that exists if you study graphs and believe past performance can predict the future. At 4hr there's a support level. At 12hr there's a different one. Pull out a week and they're both seen as tiny fluctuation and the trend is almost straight up.

Be very skeptical of advice you get from this sub...mine included! :)
Invest what you can afford to lose. If you can't afford to lose the money then consider putting it into something more consistent like a large cap passively managed index fund.
A good person to consider bitcoin isif they're tolerant of a high risk/reward and if they believe in the future of btc in the long term. 
Timing the market doesn't work and noone can reliably do it. A strategy like dollar cost averaging would be a better idea.
People who've done the best are people who buy and hold based on belief ni the long term value of bitcoin, not someone trying to flip it for a quick profit or some speculative shit like that.

Do you hold gold? USD? A lot of people think as you do but bitcoin has a lot going for it that gold or usd doesn't. Gold can't be printed but it's not very liquid...and I don't think gold would do well in a sort of major crisis at all. USD's is most liquid for americans at least but it can be printed and everyone is just content with inflation snagging about 3% currency value per year.

Got [this]( figure of total wealth to be 241 trillion USD. Generalizing the percentage of wealth owned by the top 1% to match what's in the US, 1% owns 35% of total wealth [(cite)]( 
35% of 241 trillion ==  84.35 trillion
1% of 84.35 == 0.8435 trillion == 843 billion 500 million
Market cap of BTC right now is 66 billion 800 million. 
I don't do a lot of math but if anything I"d like to see how my estimation fares to something that's a bit more accurate by someone who knows more than I do. :)

Let's see if he can prop up the price when coinbase releases all of their customer's bcash for withdrawals a day after (1 January).

Which makes you think, if the bcash shot-callers are still heavily into bcash, they'd get their money out before then....

It's awesome to know about the number of investors but I wonder if anyone has any insight to the amount of new spenders of bitcoin, or any measure of spender adoption rates. I wonder if it'd even be a tenth of that.

It sounds like you're in it for the long term. Simplest advice I'd give is to buy more as you can afford to and don't sell. I made most of my money when I wasn't even checking the price regularly. 
The idea behind this is that you're investing at an early stage in bitcoin's development and the expectation is that with more widespread adoption the price will continue to rise.
Hope this helps you.
\*edit\*: make sure all your dealings with bitcoin are through reputable sources.

I think the idea that Dimon's comments crashed bitcoin is pretty naive. People have been calling out bitcoin as a scam/fake/ponzi/bad investment every day and throughout it all bitcoin has shown that it's practically invincible against people who just criticize it.
There was nothing original or new about anything he said and likely the only movement occured when people started trading the news that 'Dimon caused a drop.' 
 Too many people are true believers and certainly weren't waiting for Dimon's approval of anything. Then WSJ did an article where they chaimed bitcoin is likely worth zero, and bitcoin traded with more stability than it had recently after it was published. The idea that these bit names and institutions have power over bitcoin just on account of their predictions and opinions has been proven more or less every day to be false. These orgs and people can hate but when it comes to influence they have practically none.

But they have a really good reputation. I still trust them!

I remember when the price went from high 4's to high 3's. People were divining the future from drawing lines on graphs, what you're doing right now, and they predicted 3400 would be a good point to buy. They either stood by their word (unlikely) and are still waiting or they quietly realized their technicals were shit and bought back in at a higher price than they could have if they hadn't tried to time the market. 
I could be wrong though. What do you forsee for bitcoin in the immediate future?

Coinbase charges a percentage fee. The transaction fees in total would be the same if you bought 70$ today versus 7$ each day for the next ten days. 
Idk why this sub seems to be against coinbase all of a sudden. They have a great reputation and even reimbursed victims of a phishing scam of their website that they had no obligation to. Their fees are up front and very visible, and they protect newer investors from making some of the dumb mistakes people on here have made. Not much use complaining about a 1.5% buy/sell fee when you send your litecoin to a btc addy and lose everything.
**Edit**: is right the fees are different. I'm sorry about this mistake. If you buy 10$, you'll get 9.01$ and a .99 fee. $100 will be a 97$ with a 3$ fee. 1000$ is a fee of 15$, 985$ of bitcoin.

I was once invited to one of these meetups of btc irl; I was naive, hadn't checked btc on reddit in a couple of years, and stumbled onto r-btc without knowing that I meant and didn't realize my mistake until it was too late. 
One of the things that btc won't tell you is that many of its members, perhaps mods even are involved in the practices of scatology. This is a method by which you throw feces at a wall and interpret the patterns to divine the future, as well as for sexual gratification. 
My memory of the party is hazy but I do remember that at one point in the dim red light that Roger  Ver himself appeared in front of me after the events were already underway--attendees were giving each other enemas, splattering poop and poop-water all over the floor--and touched me on the shoulder. He said to me, "mattisb, let me tell you of our plans to ruin bitcoin. But first, let us poop in each other's mouths." He then squatted down and squeezed out a nasty poop, right into Dr. Craig S. Wright's eagerly awaiting mouth. 
Bitcoin Cash supporters are by and large poop fiends. This is satire, but given how they think, isn't it at least possible they're guilty of such acts or even worse? 
And that's why bitcoin cash really is a shitcoin.

A lot of people have high hopes for bitcoin, that it will become adopted in mainstream and will draw in a lot more investments than exist currently. 
Because of this most of the people who buy bitcoin are relatively unwilling to sell, even for a decent profit. And if you're on the other end, if you want to buy bitcoin, you have to convince sellers to part with their coins, so bids for coins have to be pretty enticing.

What do people with a lot of capital gains on their coins do now (assuming they hold &amp; spend)? If you spent like 10$ btc a day what do they do come tax time?
I'm super long on btc and admittedly I don't spend for small purchases yet but I've been wondering about this tax issue--how the heck will the irs approach this, and whether I can afford to just leave it off my returns and let them 'fix' it and penalize me if necessary.

It seems you can't trust anyone anymore to just speak to the truth of something, everything has to be filtered through what that person has to gain by influencing the truth one way or another. 
Like with the FUD news every day it seems with bitcoin it's something new, and you can't trust any of it, because they may stand to gain on BTC going up, down, or just ad revenue from bullshit sensationalism.

I'd recommend you read a random walk down wall street. Technicals have never been shown to work reliably and actively managed funds--people who think graphs and lines can divine the future--have worse returns than passive ones.
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:02:41
I think with bitcoin at an all time high coupled with the overall volatility of bitcoin in general that you should pull most if not all of your money and invest in something more stable such as a passively managed index fund that tracks S&amp;P or other major index.
You could reasonably expect a fund like that to accrue 7% annually which you could use to retire and live off interest or continue to save and grow this for you and your kids' futures.

Speculation in bitcoin is tremendously high and as a result the price has been bid much higher than worth on the hope of a better future. 
There are investments whose return is more predictable. E.g. a passive index fund tracking the S &amp; P 500, you could expect a return around 6-8% per year, and while bitcoin over last year is up 500% the latter is way more volatile and less predictable. Investment portfolios geared as an example towards retirement generally begin with higher risk/reward investments like stocks and index funds and proceed towards more guaranteed money like bonds as people get ready to begin to realize gains accrued.

One interesting thing I heard numerous times over the past 14 day or so, especially in the run up to the 5k mark was an explosion of really, *really shitty* advice that people seemed to be taking seriously. Some were openly admitting to and advising people sink everything that they own into bitcoin, or worse, more than that, to take on debt in order to buy more bitcoin. 
I've got no way of knowing how many people took that sort of advice advice, and now that bitcoin's dropping I doubt anyone would admit to doing it. 
A guy I won't name on this sub is a daytrader started trading after btc was over 4k but his 'impressive 1-day returns' he kept bragging about just prior to 5k led him to feel qualified to give advice to other people on this sub when he'd probably bought and sold an asset fewer than five times himself. He'd drop acronyms and shit to look superficially credible--oversold this, RSI, MACd-- like he knew what he was talking about when in truth he's a millenial teen gambling with 10k of his parent's money who sends ltc to bitcoin addys (oops). 
It's frustrating when a large part of this sub gives legit advice like dollar dost averaging and don't invest in more than you can afford to lose, but then a minority of retards on here play to people's worst FOMO and advise people to do shit that they might feel for the rest of their life. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:40:58
My apologies...I more meant my post to be funny/sarcastic; I just don't understand what my or anyone's recourse could be to something like this beyond something superficial. Afaik there's no way for anyone to really punish antpool for doing shit like this. They just sit back and mine. These miners would cripple bitcoin to turn a quick ¥, unfortunately we just have to hang on and hope this relatively new idea can survive every exploit people can craft.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:20:48
I was talking about what we both learned--he might have read the same book that I did, it's well known--about 'active management.' In the book it's about stock pickers who try to beat the rate of return of the market as a whole. 
Stock pickers are similar to people who invest bitcoin by trying to time when the market is low or high. You're probably better over the long run at just putting your money into the market when you can and not caring too much about the price. 
In the case of this guy, what the market did was it increased about 565% year-to-date. His return over the same period was about half of that. What he was trying to do was to get smart and 'actively manage' people's money. His whole computer setup screams someone who thinks that they can get an edge over other people, he's probably a technical trader (reads graphs to predict the future). He would have been better buying in and just holding.
But really I've made a simple idea too complex now. **TL;DR:** if you believe in bitcoin's future and want to invest then your best bet is to buy and hold. This guy tried to time things and probably got into altcoins and as a result he wasted his time, energy, and others' money to get half of what he would have had he just bought &amp; held.
if this is unclear let me know, I've invested some time into this now so the least I can do is explain it well. :)
I was just watching the [author talk]( about whether he still believed what he wrote, the vid is long but maybe two minutes from where I linked will explain the big idea behind the whole book. Remember 'active management' means buying/selling things (e.g. bitcoin) in an effort to get higher returns than the market would provide.
@_date: 2017-09-22 03:25:04
If Dimon's opinion significantly influenced a sell-off it's surprising to me because bitcoin gets negged as a scam/bubble/fake every day. His opinion isn't special or original and afaik noone here is crossing fingers for the blessing of financial institutions to invest. So fuck that guy.

IIRC the credit/debit card comes with a 3.99% fee. That's too much.
It takes longer but I'd recommend a bank transfer to your USD wallet. It's free and no fee there. After a week or thereabout, the deposit will clear. Then log onto gdax and click 'deposit' to move money from coinbase to gdax. Once it's in your gdax account you can trade real quick. Still best to minimize trades though to save on fees.

GDAX/Coinbase also [refunded affected customers.](
So...it goes from 'wow ETH crashed 380 to .10!!����!������' to 'big trade caused a flash crash' to 'a large trade caused prices to droop, which triggered numerous stop losses, and GDAX reimbursed affected customers for their losses'.
Someone might be scared out of investing in crypto from the first story, and the second or third might be neutral to someone actually taking note that an exchange actually cares for its customers. Tells alot about media when they run with the tone of the first just to drum up quick reads and panic.
