He is a great benefit to the community and as aspiration for us all to live up to.  Thanks Andreas!

This is the worst attempt at FUD that I've yet to see.

You are aware that this is really just a software project, correct?  I am not sure if you are familiar w/ software projects, but they are iterative efforts.  In this case, there is not an end date to this project, therefore, we are able to speculate (buy) BTC as its being developed.  The utility of BTC is nowhere near what its going to be upon vast adoption.  Therefore, if you just expect low fees during the scaling process, you are just misinformed about how the blockchain actually works, because that would not be possible.  Use BCash if you want lower fees right at this moment....just don't expect it to be a viable longterm solution as it will probably die out like 99% of alts do.

Done.  Thanks for doing this.  Hopefully we can get thousands of sigs.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:12:22


Why would this be the appeal?? Theres nothing revolutionary there. The decentralized nature of BTC is the appeal. You are simply misinformed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:24:01
Told ya :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:15:59
The words of a salty nocoiner. So cute!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:28:25
Dude if bcash surpasses BTCs marketcap, the crypto world is in big trouble, that would be a horrible thing. Theres just no way that will ever happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:56:31
Lol, what are you talking about?  Dont you understand when it comes to some like crypto, its extremely confusing to newbies to the space?
Forget about yourself for a second and be compassionate enough to think of others who can very easily be manipulated into buying into a similarly named crypto.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:18
Haha I cant stop watching it for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:11:28
Hey man, Im a BTC bull.
With that being said, I dont have to rely on BTC to make payments for my personal life.  Im must saying to only rely on BTC in the shortterm may be risky should we have a couple bearish months in a row, you still want to be able to pay your rent.
Plus, since its difficult to use BTC to pay your bills, why not just buy BTC with every USD paycheck?  I guess I dont understand the logic here.   It sort of just causes an unnecessary inconvenience to have to convert to USD every paycheck just to make these payments.  Why not just set up a recurring BTC-buy for every paycheck?  It gets the same end result without jumping through unnecessary hoops.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:08:53
Controversial??  Forget about that word, its too subjective.  It doesnt matter the time in history, insider trading is clearly always wrong.  Are you actually trying to passively dispute that?? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:56
As soon as Coinbase allows everyone to buy/sell BCH, everyone is going to dump BCH....so I wouldnt worry.  This is just another pump/dump.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:24:43
Does anyone know of a resource to buy a plug-and-play full node?  I would love for everyone in my family to contribute by running a node, I just don't have a ton of time to set them all up assuming it still takes a while.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:41:12
Agreed.  Before watching it, I will admit I had a much less advanced interpretation of everything that was going on regarding Bitcoin.  I still think most have a more simplistic view of what Bitcoin actually is, which is completely normal I would say.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:35:49
When Lightning network officially goes live, how can BCash survive?  They will literally have 0 utility at that point, right??
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:55:40
You hit your moon.  Congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:18
For sure....haha its such a dirty tactic.  They must be in bed w/ Ver to some degree.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:15:18
Me too. Do the dips actually still bother some people?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:52:32
The Bitcoin.com wallet. 
You must be new to the space, so I dont blame you for being ignorant of the situation. Invest wisely :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:10
Lol, I did the same.  I gave my parents and inlaws some Bitcoin as an early Christmas present while drafting a lengthy explanation of what this movement is actually about.  I also sent them that same video and now they are almost on the same page as me about how significant this all can be.
Glad you enjoyed it.  Andreas is the man!
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:59:19
Why wouldnt you just buy BTC biweekly though?  I guess I am failing to see the benefit of doing this.
Again, I am a BTC bull and longterm/longtime hodler.  But it really doesnt make sense to just have your paycheck converted to BTC, when you can't pay your bills with BTC.  You will have to convert a requisite amount of BTC to USD every paycheck just to facilitate this.
Its way easier to just buy BTC every paycheck w/ your fiat.  Then you dont have to worry about converting BTC to USD every other week.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:09:24
Completely agree.  He is a great man and humanitarian.  Completely selfless.
Literally the antithesis to BCash's Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:43:54
0.1 BTC is affordable still though.  Just put a little away each paycheck and you will be there in no time at all!  Im just trying to kickstart my families journey into BTC world.
Happy holidays my friend!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:22
I moved mine to Bittrex and sold it didnt want to wait.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:50
Haha just watch.  The value we get for BCash right now is only SLIGHTLY degraded from when the ifork happened.  Sucks that we will get slightly less BTC, but I assure you, anyone stuck in Coinbase this whole time w/ their BCash, will be selling.  The price will not sustain &gt;0.2 BTC overnight, theres just no way.
This was a giant arbitrage attempt that was apparent enough that the SEC was contacted already from some big traders.  This could end poorly for those acting on insider info.  Invest wisely!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:57:35
I like how you broke this down, makes sense to me.
The daily volatility will just shake out the weak hands.  Those of us who have been around BTC for a while, know that as long as it continues to go up annually, its a reasonable enough spot to store your wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:01:33
Very well said.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:36:34
I thought Bitcoin Diamond was determined to be a scam??
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:01:33
This is certainly a risky move.  BTC is still in the 'beta' stages if you will, therefore price is anything but stable.  Luckily we have the benefit of BTC's price trending up on the annual timeframes, but just be sure you can sustain a multi-month long downswing in value, when that happens.
Now you have transformed from a simple HODLer, to a person surviving on BTC.  Therefore, its daily value actually has more value to you.  I respect what you did, but just make sure you will be able to continue to pay your bills by doing so.  I have a feeling you will be fine, just crunch the numbers to know what type of downswing you can sustain without feeling the impact on your personal life.
Good luck brother, HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:50:54


I can certainly agree with you on that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:58:50
Haha ok man. I think you are kinda confusing yourself tho. Your (OP’s) approach simply will get the same net result as my approach (paycheck in USD, buy BTC regularly) but you just have to jump through more hoops.   Do what you want I guess but Im am engineer so logistics are just ingrained in my way of thinking and this approach will simply be more effort with the same result. To each their own I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:53:47
Why is your 'opinion' more important than the actual fact that Bitcoin Cash is simply trying to confuse investors into thinking they are Bitcoin?
When John Doe reads an article in the WSJ about Bitcoin and he unknowingly invests in Bitcoin Cash thinking that is indeed the Bitcoin he read about in the WSJ (due to whatever misinformation he may subsequently read that equates Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin), isnt that essentially misrepresentation on the Bitcoin Cash side?  Seems almost like false advertisement to me, no?
Knowing this type of confusion exists, why can't Bitcoin Cash rise above all of this petty nonsense and simply be its own project, instead of existing in the shroud of Bitcoin, trying to be successful based only on the first 7 letters of its name?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:18:12
Did they?  Im in GDAX right now and the BCH price is just stuck, hasnt moved at all.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:18
All of us who are receiving their BCash on Coinbase arent able to move anything.  When that is lifted, there will be a mass BCash sell off.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:27:39
Appreciate the sentiment.
I didnt necessarily want to include my life story in the little Reddit post, so equating the value of my BTC to my life savings was a reasonable analogy.  
I am 35 and have a 401k w/ over 200k USD value and my wife (32) has about 150K USD worth of value in her 401k, then our collective ROTH IRAs have about 30k (collectively).  Aside from that, I have about 10k in fiat in a savings for an emergency.
The reason the term 'life savings' = BTC on 'thumb drive'  is reasonable, is because the value of my BTC on the Ledger is way more than in our retirement.  So its not that im irresponsible, it just so happens that BTC matured so quickly, that just happens to be the case.
NOTE: Only got this detailed because this is my throwaway.  Thanks for looking out tho.

Hi Are you new to the cryptospace?  There are a few reasons to praise Coinbase, as you mentioned, but there are also just as many (or more) reasons to be very frustrated w/ Coinbase.
1)  Coinbase sided w/ the S2X upgrade, and we all know how that went &lt;eye roll&gt;
2) Coinbase has not yet released any BCH to its customers, post bCash fork.  This ended up being a positive for most of us, almost by coincidence....since the bCash price has risen so dramatically in the months since the fork.  
3) Coinbase has not yet implemented SegWit.
So yeh, if people are clearly frustrated w/ Coinbase, they have valid reasons to be.  If you have been around since pre 8/1/17, you should be frustrated w/ Coinbase as well (assuming you were a customer of theirs back then).
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:03:02
Very well said....butttt, not a huge fan of the slightly bear-ish tone that emanates from this.  Sorta wish it was a bit more positive to be cemented in the aisles of Reddit history.
Ah well....to the moon anyways!
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:30:18
Hey thanks for the reply man!
Yeh I just started to think having basically my life savings on a thumb drive that my kids could easily flush down the toilet is not the safest measure of security. So I basically realized I have to break this up so that if catastrophe happens, I at least will have a multiple point of failure system setup so that not all is lost.
Thanks for advise.
