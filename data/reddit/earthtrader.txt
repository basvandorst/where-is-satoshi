well the world's second BTM was installed at the airport in Istanbul so I was expecting high cost to be compensated by high volume. I didn't know that banks actually lose tons of money on ATMs at airports
but  the highly annoying thing is the money changers that rip you off every time you go abroad and the ATMs that rip you and then again airport rips them. and airports are already huge shopping malls (incl duty free) with huge customer flow and advert echochambers that you have to pass before getting to your gate after every single step of yours has been tracked and resold, and that although you pay high airport tax on your ticket for being treated like a terrorist and still most airports lose money AND suck. so i guess the answer is that only banks are the ones making money through their loans that airports pay back for decades

alternatively one could consider having to manually type a long combination of letters/ numbers instead of scanning the code. That way a friendly party could accept it, but would only actually use the code if running low on all other funds. But he could pay back with the same paper. If the value would be a dollar that can work with trusted parties for small trades and high chance to receive your own paper again. if one distributes let's say 10 papers, the counterparty could check one random to see if all just bs. the more checks the higher chance to be there are no fakies.

what you would ideally like to achieve with money is to represent average cost of labor. if you take primitive culture that can work ok it's easy. if you have a complex economy with constant changes it's hard. if you think of inflation of representing of average increase in productivity you still have changing prices - so in average the money supply would have to match increase in productivity. However productivity gains are not equally distributed and some fields may even decrease productivity (thanks to nature) so locally and temporary inflation and deflation is the result.
That in general doesn't say match about distributing and organization of production. Currently wealth is created by the vast majority and extracted by a tiny minority.

Lot of things are.
Well of course theoretically you can contact the merchant and ask if he takes bitcoin and then pay in btc, but practically that does not happen (often). One could also offer to pay in gold or shells. Maybe if you're under the radar that may work. But most biz is public domain and will be sanctioned if they try.
edit:  So for the moment BTC is kind of treated like a commodity.  There is an exception one could pay rmb, but the transaction is performed via bitcoin and spits out rmb at the other end (not very common either)

Dev's are in the know, as they started the 24h selling limitation for exchanges but keep quiet now on this issue and have an interest to keep the price of ETH as high as possible for as long as possible to create an image ETH market cap = 200 M &gt; Litecoin. No.2 crytpocurrency after BTC.

so bitcoin doesn't represent average lowest electricity cost?
Bitcoin as representation of electricity cost MAY delay, not stop the race. at current volatility (take last 2 years) chances are you'd lost more in bitcoin that USD if you randomly bought and sold BTC for your daily needs. 
But don't confuse inflation with interest. Bitcoin doesn't wipe out interest - otherwise it would be free to lend bitcoin.

strong property rights within a layer of no property rights as a whole - what he describes as a problem is what our system has solved: it's called CORPORATION - making money without responsibility (better even is foundation as the property rights are even more fuzzy while still paying foundation members out at little tax). it's not a legal question just a matter of size if you are big enough you can wash money for terrorists and mafia, drug dealers like HSBC.
the political theory is actually not that hard to state: decentralization where possible as centralization is socially/ politically too expensive. but if there is central power it has to function as a tool to defend the individual against the group and the weaker against the strong. the fiat money is just ONE symptom of malice but the fundamental problem is much deeper and that is to lend a term of Warren Buffet or Marx: class war.

i think the big problem is that people are pushed into 9-5 labor which is a 8 to 6 at least. after 8 or 10 hours work and 1 or 2 hour transportation (in the big cities) the debt slaves have little energy left just want to eat and ease the nerves when dealing with the social conflicts that are brought into their family environment. so everything has to be bought - because of lack of time and energy and every time a corporation takes a cut and the government. 
If we cut labor hours dramatically there is lots of room for DIY of all sorts without govt or corporations interfering. DIY is also extremely emancipating for the individual and gives it a feeling of Independence and freedom. Doesn't sound too bad especially if the alternative is a dirty overcrowded (inefficient) state run subway you're squeezed into and a lunch at mcdonalds.

I agree. Lots of people regard food as a thing you have to deal with somehow, a shell that hides some energy for your body. There is no passion about food (or cooking). Look around most stuff is really mediocre - at least I can't eat at an average restaurant - the quality is just too low.
Actually I like some of the ideas of the garden city concept. You get some land to use, a house and can then farm a bit for basic needs. That means less dependence on state welfare. 
Of course on the other hand centralization in farming is much more efficient and thus technically cheaper - but that doesn't consider all cost and strings attached for society.
Freaking farmers are maybe not doing so bad after all, prob that's the reason for Monsanto to monopolize the grains and make the farmers dependent - they have too much freedom still.
Who controls the food supply controls the people.

buying power of currency is by default unstable, what could be achieved is higher stability. That requires bigger network/ marketcap - which just means individual frequencies of different representative value/ buying power are canceling each other out. The closer Bitcoin gets to USD or SDR marketcap the more stable it becomes, but it will always fluctuate even if it destroyed all fiat.
That means highest goal for BTC is market adaption by wallet distribution and transaction frequency and volume.

when was the last time man hit the moon? height of cold war. 4 decades ago. what exactly are you going to extract from the moon? or are you planing to send overpopulation to other uninhabitable places?


the only abundance these days is cheap labor of debt slaves &amp; fiat  pretty much everything else is scarce (except ideas which will be made scarce by patents, copyright, trademark...). Productivity growth has not lead to substantial growth in the 1st world. There are examples of real income growth in societies like China, but that's more of a dead cat bounce and in exchange for strong centralization and environmental destruction through transferring production from the west.
 &gt;Income distribution is the issue and that is a political one.
income distribution is an issue and def political, right. the other issue is overpopulation because that's been eating up any productivity growth if you consider the cost of environmental destruction. for reference check ecological footprints. if we were to equally distribute standard of living that is ecologically sustainable across the globe the average would be something like poor Chinese suburban. and a smartphone wouldn't cost 500 dollars, but 3000 or more.
If we want equality at Western standard of living global population has to significantly decrease.

not necessarily. you're already wrong there. the most important factors are production and distribution. in fact one could argue that buying and selling is already a function of created inequality and distorting free market


NBA is a biz for all actors apart from the kids. 


you're thinking that everything has to be be a free market in order for ONE free market to exist. but there could be monopoly in one industry and a "free" market in another. example: monopoly on water supply in a community could be a monopoly in the hands of community. and there could still be a regular or even daily market for fresh local agricultural products.


stock price has enough to do with the prices the monopolist asks from his victims. no problem solved.


see above


above mentioned municipality holds a referendum asking its residents on the future of water supply - 95% vote it should be one entity that is not profit seeking but focusing on cheap supply with property hold by all residents equally.
So we have no buyers and sellers. we have no profits, we have cheap supply of water.
The question is consensus. The idea of decentralization is good when it tries to give as much power to individuals or a group of individuals against other possibly stronger individuals or groups. It's a weak idea when it comes to efficiency. 
Free market is very hard to maintain and needs a dynamic equilibrium with the element of luck for all actors at different times. You need many producers, many buyers and many sellers and sales have to happen often, information has to be out in the open, same with metrics like quantity and quality have to be easily verifiable and at no or low cost. Lots of conditions so many that free market occurs locally and temporarily and only for some products - it's a black swan of our current economy.

That's not the question. The question is based on the article where people use payment systems like alipay to buy goods and services online. The question is: Are merchants taking bitcoins, are they allowed to take bitcoin for real world goods and services?
Because only if they would be it would be relevant to this sub.
But if you prefer to ignore the actual reality in China and take your knowledge from businessinder backed wikipedia articles you may. Legal thinking in China is also totally different - it's more about does the gov't allow a certain behavior - not is there law that says it's illegal, and how hard and when does it crack down on stuff they don't like (regardless of legality anyways). That's a different approach from Western libertarian thinking.

An extremely unpopular step which only benefits shitty banks, but creates a bit of competition.

Bitcoinica was developed in Ruby on Rails over the course of about a week.
A couple of months later (November 2011?) Zhou Tong sold Bitcoinica for a million dollars, at the age of 17.








The use of swaps for interest encouraged Bitcoin holders to place BTC or Gox-coins (yes, really) at Bitcoinica to earn interest, much like on Bitfinex today. (Roger Ver famously lost a ton of money he had placed in Bitcoinica, not to trade with, but to earn "risk free interest" on swaps.)

within the last 6 months bitfinex has already lost more than a quarter of its marketshare in the BTC USD market (as did okcoin btw) and the trend is still going down
pros are moving
and others too
they move to bitsamp, ibit, bit-x which gained 66 - 185% in marketshare
it will be interesting to see if the diversification adds to a more stable BTC price with less sudden crashes and all the fun

who says I don't? at least as much as i possibly can.


money = time. anyways why not just stay in the fiat world? it's more convenient that way you trade your time for some paper.
point is decentralization and freedom both come at a price tag, but that's still cheaper than the alternative. and bitcoin is not a solution for all kinds of human problems, it's just one little tool for a very limited set of situations. the real change is a political decision. who doesn't understand this will also lose all his btc as eventually the centralized power can drown it so many ways.

at TRW, but it may be an urban
myth. It is about a weights engineer
on a spacecraft. He accounts 
for all of the weight on a spacecraft.
The weights engineer came to a
software engineer and said, according
to budget, there is $3,000,000
accounted for the software and I
want to know how much it weighs.
The software engineer replied,
“Nothing.” The weights engineer
said he wanted that kind of a
job. You get paid well to produce
something that weighs nothing. A
week later, the weights engineer
came back with a deck of cards.
“Is there any software in here?” he
asked. The software engineer said,
“Yes.” The weights engineer said he
would weigh the deck to determine
the weight of the software. The software
engineer said, “You have it all
wrong; we only use the holes.”

Bitfinex CEO recording after 18/08/2015 flash crash.
*It's August you know.* (ah that explains it)
open positions at 170 not filled?
*I don't know about that.*
Shit like this happens every 2 months
*We're still trying to make it work.*
even if you try via API?
*Uh Uh. No. Look I understand guys. No.1 rule of trading. You press the bottom once it doesn't work you don't press it again. OKAY?"*
*I believe it's a bug we fixed a long time ago. Maybe."*
great CEO

Well regardless of the law that's not how things work in china. Matter of fact China doesn't have fixed places to accept bitcoin on the map. Please check, the few dots you see is spam or outdated (before 2013)
But going back to 2009 there was regulation concerning  in-game currency. Mining was ok and to buy virtual goods/ currency was too, but you weren't allow to purchase real-world good with virtual currency. I haven't seen anywhere that the regulation changed. 
China bars use of virtual money for trading in real goods
Bitcoin faces fresh hurdle as Alibaba bans its use
If you happen to actual have relevant legal documents, verdicts or cases that point either way please share. Thx
