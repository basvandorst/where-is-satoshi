i'll buy ron paul merchandise, books, memorabilia, dvds- but a subscription i wont pay. I love the dear doctor but how does he expect me to spread the message of liberty to friends and family and expect to charge $10? his revolution started on youtube, it should still be there. I dont expect him to work for free, but accepting donations, sponsors, google ad revenue etc is a good start!!! Even have people pay subscriptions to have access to all the vids on the site streaming etc but let the people still see it uploaded on youtube!
