There are a ton of places, but currently you can use  Lately though it has been better to hold on to dogecoins and exchange for BTC later, as Dogecoin has been going up over 50% in value the last few weeks.

This is the most WTF and FTW I have ever seen. Go doge?

I have used prelude and it has always been reliable, fast and correct in exchange rates. There is not a snowballs chance in hell they are trying to scam you for a few satoshis. With the amounts they have been giving out for free (for advertisement) why risk it all to scam someone for some pocketchange? ~~No, this is most likely a bug they will fix.~~ I really like prelude, but right now the volume is too low.
