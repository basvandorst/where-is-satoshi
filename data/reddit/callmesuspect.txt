"“gambling” includes but is not limited to pool-**selling**, bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, roulette wheels or dice tables, and conducting lotteries, policy, bolita or numbers games, or **selling** chances therein.",
I have bolded the important parts for you, they have to be "selling" the chance to win, and therefore you must use something to buy the chance.

One of the major issues we're currently facing is that people see the price of bitcoin as "too high", when in reality since you can buy fractions of a bitcoin, the price is not actually a limiting factor unless you're only interested in buying the currency to hold and wait for it to appreciate. While yes, I do hold bitcoin, just like any other money, I also spend it.
Want to buy something worth $50 in btc? buy 0.04711 and then go spend it. The price is not a limiting factor for people's adoption, their silly way of thinking that they need to have "whole bitcoins" is.
Some people have suggested that using uBTC or mBTC as the standard denomination might help to correct this, and while yes, it may trick some people into understanding better that you don't need entire bitcoins for your stash to be worth anything, I think it would be more helpful to change our way of thinking, rather than changing our notation. 
However, more on-topic, most "crashes" are actually just price corrections, and yes, they are a nice chance to buy a little BTC at a cheaper price. These crashes normally occur when someone sees the price go up a little, and buys in, and then someone sees it go up a little more, and buys in. Etc. etc. you know how the market works.
Since this drives the price of BTC up artificially, of course it's going to go back down, but this is a short term and if I'm being honest, narrow way to look at it. If you average the price across any given week, I think it always goes up. Maybe with one or two exceptions. Price corrections are healthy though, to the moon.

I suppose I might have actually helped your argument in that case, if you're getting paid in bitcoin, [(no one ever pays me in bitcoins)]( then yes, a product like this is very useful, even if it is still less useful than the merchants taking bitcoin directly. I can see your point.

I understand that viewpoint, it has only been a few hours. But my personal opinion is that BTC will remain strong. The people who are in see the value of it, and most people will realize that a new SR will pop up soon enough. There are too many smart people who see the gap in the market. "SR is gone, and I can replace it? $$$$"

Look, companies are dozens of people, and those people aren't fucking magic. you don't submit a ticket and someones presses a big red button and goes "ISSUE SOLVED YOUR HIGHNESS!!!!!!!"
I'm guessing you've never worked any job higher than a fucking cashier, otherwise you'd know that processing of support tickets can take a long ass time, regardless of what the customer wants, you and 300 other fucking customers all need help, and coinbase has what, 2 dozen employees?
People like you, and OP, who don't respect the customer service, and then expect to be treated like fucking royalty, make me sick. Did coinbase make a mistake? Yes. Is it going to help to publicly shame them like this? No. this accomplishes nothing, it's a dick waving maneuver and just makes OP, and the people defending him, look childish.

Anyone with a small amount of logic could understand how gold is a finite resource. you're either a really annoying troll, or a very misguided, borderline stupid, person, and I'm not gonna indulge you anymore.
Here's the thing: things that are infinite, are not valuable. Gold is valuable becuase it's finite.

I mean i see your point, i suppose on the usd side of bitcoin purchases they are taxed, unless you buy them in person. I suppose one of the things that makes bitcoin not "of value" per say is there is no legal obligation for anyone to take them. We could get really abstract and say that really nothing has any value except the value we give it. 
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:03:01
Then gaia online gold; wow gold; are also of value; and comparable to bit coins per my original point. And since people gamble with those constantly; id say theres some kinda hole in the legal system.

 This will not help grow the currency for 2 reasons.
1. when someone sees something like this, who is NOT invovled in bitcoin, it makes them think only 1 thing: bitcoin is pointless. I have USD, why would I convert my USD to BTC just to convert it back?
2. the person from example one is correct. Why WOULD I convert my USD to BTC, just to convert it (back and pay a premium) so I can purchase goods that I could already purchase.
I understand you're excited and you want to encourage developers and such getting the word about BTC out,  but you have to stop and think,  is this good for the long-term health of the bitcoin? I don't think so. This isn't going to get new people into bitcoin, all this is, is a quick and dirty exchange that does a lot of the work for you, but at the end of the day it's just an exchange, they take your bitcoins, and give you usd, and I'm not seeing mention of it here, but I'm pretty sure they'll charge you a fee on every transaction as well.
I'm sorry you disagree with me, but I'd also like to thrown on as an aside here at the end that I find it rude for people to be downvoting someone just because they disagree with them. It only takes 5 downvotes to essentially silence my opinion, if you disagree with me, comment, don't downvote, discussion isn't bad.
*Edit: removed rude wording.*
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:26:59
At least you didn't do what I did.
"I'll just move .1 over to just-dice and make a little more money"
"Oh I lost. well I'll just move another .1 to cover the loss from the first .1"
"well now I'll move .2, if I can just get back to where I was"
ended up losing a total of about 1BTC, Luckily this was back when btc costed a lot less, so I'm still up in USD, but I could have been up more.
@_date: 2013-02-17 02:34:26
And so it begins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:39:39
It's not. I'ts undefined because there's no way to know how much there is in the ground without digging it all up.
But it is finite. Because everything is. There is not an unlimited amount of anything, even when we say "the universe is infinite" we don't mean there's infinite stuff in the universe, we mean it's infinitely big. Furthermore, the amount of gold in the ground 
I don't understand how you're having such a hard time grasping this concept. Not knowing how much of something there is, is not the same as that resource being infinite, they simply are not the same thing, I'm sorry.
Here's an article that should help you out

When presented with the information that one of the e-mail was 4 days ago, I retracted my statements relevant to that. that's what a level headed person does, and when I did that, you became rude. It's just disrespectful.

The same way that WoW gold is fake, the only difference between that and bitcoin is it's purpose.

It's really amusing when people flash their ignorance with such confidence. Anyways, his point was that bitcoin was skyrocketing the entire time, buying at ANY point would have been buying at an all time high. If he bought it at 600? all time high. 700? all time high. 800? all time high. 900? all time high.
You can't predict what the market does, it could have broken 1000 and stayed there. It was looking like it was going to. You have to think in the 4th dimension marty.

I really like this show. Run by average joe and stand up comedian patrick melton, the show takes a simple but comprehensive stance on bitcoin. Starting from the fundamentals in the first few episodes, helping you set up a wallet, and teaching you how to secure your points a few episodes in. The show is extremely well produced as the host has over 8 years experience in podcasting, it's light hearted and informative, and anyone who is interested in bitcoins should give it a chance.

Just because it's against the TOS doesn't mean it doesn't happen,
My point is that bitcoin is a deregulated currency, and therefore is not covered under a "currency", it's no more a currency then fake money on any gambling site is, and therefore, it perfectly legal to gamble away.

I understand what you're saying, but putting solutions between bitcoin, and the merchant, invalidates the currency. I'm sorry, but that's how I feel. A currency's job is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services, and in the state that it is only being used as a medium like this, it is no more a currency than WoW gold or League of Legends Riot Points. It's a inbetween, and I don't like it. I don't really see the need for this product. I have USD. Why do I need to spend bitcoin? Can you explain to me the desire to convert to btc and then back to usd?
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:15:22

What is this new thing about the amount of BTC I receive varying? I want to buy .05 BTC, but it says here if the market value changes I might receive something different? Is this because you guys have exceeded your daily buy limit?
