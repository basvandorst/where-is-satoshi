... That's not how free market works. That's trying to turn Bitcoin into a pyramid scheme.  &gt;.&gt;

You can buy 0.01 for $7. What do you mean you can't afford it?

Dollar cost averaging works well.

That's not proof &gt;.&gt;

Not a good analogy. Gold is much more stable with predictable markers. It's a solid long term inflation hedge. Btc is new and volatile due to massive speculation. When btc gets to $30 I'll stock up again like i did when it was $5 last year.

I understand the excitement, just hoping for a world where it's such a norm that it wouldn't excite anyone.

That's cool.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:26:39
Sound good. Bought most of mine at $5 last year so I'll be stocking up with you.

Haven't had roommates since i was 20. So too far past that seems comical to me. So it's pretty subjective.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:07:45
Does it matter?

That's not free and a gaming rig doesn't make it good for mining.

My bottom prediction is $30 so it can start it's realistic and steady rise.

You don't seem to understand that high income doesn't correlate with wealth. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:16:46
30 is what I've been saying. 20 would be great but undervalued now.

As a parent, the stereotype isn't true. Disposition is genetic, doesn't matter how much you nurture, nature with run a number with your children.
