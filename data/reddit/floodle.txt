Many Bitcoin users here seem to believe that there is no such thing as "the honorable thing" and that if you discover a private key, any bitcoins in the corresponding wallet are now yours.

You only pay tax on the profit if bitcoin increases in value, if it stays the same you pay no tax. And you don't lose the whole profit, only a percentage. So if you buy a coin at $600 and spend it at $700 you may pay $15 tax so you still got $685 worth.

I assume you're kidding however all you would theoretically need to do is create a new wallet, tumble the coins and send them to it.

Just curious why they would? do companies that size pay any banking fees?

Anyone who says you can't make money mining is lying - some people are making millions from mining - this guy is making 8 million USD a month from mining ( The key is that you have to invest a fair amount to get big enough for it to be profitable.
But unless you have tens of thousands to invest and access to fairly cheap electricity then it's never going to be profitable.

If merchants want to hold bitcoin then they can simply go to an exchange and buy it.   
Now once their suppliers start accepting bitcoin for payment and their employees accept bitcoin for pay then that would make sense but that's a future requirement.  Right now they need their capital in a format they can easily use.

3600 coins per day * $630 USD = $2,268,000   
500 TPS * .05 *60 *60 *24 = $2,160,000

Of course if people just hoard the coins instead of spend them then we may have problems.

OP made no effort to find out the owner of the coins, he could easily go back to where he got the laptop and ask.  All you are doing is blaming the victim.   
Also, the law is different in different locations however for example, California Penal Code Section 485 stipulates that if you find money you need to make "reasonable and just efforts to find the owner." Otherwise, you're "guilty of theft."

No contradiction - the ones with smartphones already have a solution, the ones without can't afford one.  
You don't care about people in Africa, you just want Bitcoin to increase in value so your holding gains in value.

So the total number of bitcoins currently being mined in a month is 144 blocks per day * 25 bitcoins per block * 30 days = 108000.   
At a price of $650 that would be $70,020,000 so they are claiming to be producing about 28.5% of all coins assuming no other costs like electricity and hardware.

They get the best of both worlds, no (or very low) payment fees but get paid in a more stable currency.  
The fact is businesses have costs (wages, suppliers etc.) that have to be paid in fiat. Lots of businesses simply can't afford to have their money tied up - you pay them, they pay their supplier - there's really nothing to hold.

Nope, these payment processors allow businesses to accept bitcoin without risk (potential volatility) which in turn increases adoption and raises awareness which results in more interest and higher values.   
The big problem as I see it currently with bitcoin is that if you have $1000 USD and you want to buy something on a website that is $1000 USD but you wish to use bitcoin it's just not going to happen. By the time you convert from USD to bitcoin you've lost a few percent and then the payment processor rates knock a couple more percent off.   
If I go to someone and say they should start using bitcoin to buy stuff but it will cost them 5 to 10% more per item they will think I'm crazy.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:41:39
It just doesn't seem possible, for example if someone tipped you $1 in bitcoin here you would need to make a note of it (bitcoin value and USD value at time of tip) for tax reasons - what if someone just drops some in your address - like if you have your address listed on your website for donations?

@_date: 2014-03-10 18:51:04
Refunding is an interesting one, especially if you don't hold the bitcoins but convert them to local currency - since the value of bitcoin can fluctuate quite a lot, you could take one bitcoin for an item worth $630 and if you need to refund it, it may cost you $1200 to get another bitcoin to refund with.
If you hold them instead then this isn't an issue - unless the bitcoins lose value, then the $630 worth of bitcoin ho have may now only be worth $300 or $1.
Or you could just state that until rates stabilize, all refunds will be paid in local currency.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:45:18
Perhaps "Those people" had hacked your localbitcoins account in advance and then got you to transfer the coins to locabitcoins to do the transaction then took them on arrival.

These are very good questions and at this point, I don't know. I guess the risk is not declaring it on your tax return and then discovering that an exchange or retailer you used has forwarded the details to the IRS.

About 4,500 more coins are being mined every day, many are being sold by the miners to pay electricity bills and other costs (more, faster hardware etc.)  So if, perhaps, 4,000 new coins go into circulation each day at a price of $450 then $1.8 million USD has to be converted into bitcoin every day to keep the price where it is.

Exchange - provide all your details including passport scans and then they could get hacked and you are wide open to identity theft.  
localbitcoins.com - pay well over the current exchange rate  
Bitcoin ATM - pay about 10% commission  
mining - lol

"If they are to become involved they need the coin to be valued at around US$2,000 to US$3,000… " - so the experts believe that the investors are waiting for the price to increase before they invest?   
Why would you wait until then to invest if you can buy now at $570? You could get 4 times as many coins for the same USD cost.   
Personally I'm waiting for it to go to $100,000 and then I'm all in - lol.

Another analogy, imagine you have 2 physical wallets, an old one you use for work and a nice new one you use when going out for the evening. You have $100 in the old one and are going out tonight so you transfer the $100 to your new wallet - is that a transaction?. If you don't spend any money when out then when you get home you put the $100 back in the old wallet, ready for tomorrow. In bitcoin this would show up as $200 worth of transactions but nothing really happened

Article text     
  
The Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday that it will treat bitcoin and other virtual currencies like property, not currency, giving a potential boost to investors but imposing extensive record-keeping rules—and significant taxes—on its use.
The announcement in general was expected to be greeted favorably by the fledgling industry, and many had anticipated exactly this result. But the announcement also served as a reminder that new technologies often can't avoid being subject to the old rules for long.
In a notice, the IRS said that it generally would treat Bitcoin held by investors much like stock or other intangible property. If the virtual currency is held for investment, any gains would be treated as capital gains, meaning they could be subject to lower tax rates.

As soon as it becomes fully legitimate and regulated, the banks will create their own cryptocurrency and use that and they will make it easy to use and simple and safe to store so the common joe on the street can use it without having to make multiple copies of his private key on USB drives and print multiple copies of a paper wallet and store them in safes and deposit boxes like I read here regularly.
At that time cryptocurrency will have succeeded which is great, a side effect is that bitcoin will then be worthless.

They're not just above the law, they're in a position to get the law changed to suit them which is even more dangerous.   They can make it so that it becomes very difficult for merchants to accept Bitcoin.
But it's easier than that to make Bitcoin suffer - imagine the scenario where visa and mastercard start to get concerned that they are losing business to Bitcoin.  They change their terms and conditions so that merchants who accept their cards cannot accept Bitcoin.  The merchant must then decide to go pure bitcoin or drop it altogether. How many merchants could survive purely on sales made with Bitcoin?

What can (note that I say CAN and not DID) happen is someone buys a load of coins which causes a price increase. Other people see this movement and don't want to miss out so they also buy which pushes the price higher. Then the original buyer sells what they bought.    
So the original seller possibly bought somewhere between 470 and 500 and then sold between 680 and 620 - quite a nice profit.  
Now they just wait for the market to stabilize again and repeat the process.

What really sucks is for people who got in early and bought cheap - say $10 a coin - in this case their loss is only $10 per coin regardless of how high the price went. The loss is only how much you paid for the coins. For people who bought at a high price, getting goxxed is no longer a problem (up to $3k a year of course)

This really irks me, I get they need to make a profit but part of the benefit of bitcoin is reduced transaction fees. People say it's much better than Visa because Visa takes 2% of every transaction. Imagine if a cash ATM took 10% every time or if paying by card at a store cost an extra 10%.

The problem with getting investments for Bitcoin startups is that people who understand Bitcoin and really believe in it's future, realize they will likely get a better return on investment by investing directly in bitcoin itself. e.g. if you had a million dollars to invest and you thought Bitcoin was really going to go mainstream, would you invest in a startup or just invest it in bitcoins themselves?

To be honest I'm not sure I know the correct answer however my feeling is that any time someone asks if it's profitable to mine, all the miners say "no" to put them off. Bitcoins are mined at around 3600 per day shared amongst all the miners so more miners means less per miner so it would be in their interest to deter newcomers.   
Maybe that's just a conspiracy theory but if I was a miner I know I would be tempted to do it.

Was the re-buy in under 30 days from the sale? if so then it may be considered a "wash sale" which from my understanding means you can't claim it but you can add the loss to the new buy so when you finally sell the coins, you would act as if you re-bought them at $850 so if you sold them at $900 you would only pay tax on $50, not $300.

It's fine for small amounts.   
It takes just one disgruntled employee to extract all the private keys and steal all the bitcoins and put them in an anonymous cold storage wallet and no-one would know who did it.   
If you are going to store any significant value in bitcoins then only you should know the private key.   
It may sound like a lot of work but it's worth the effort - just remember to laminate the USB drives and your PC and house as well - you can never be too safe :)

One of the big things with bitcoin mining is whether you can earn more in bitcoins than it costs in electricity to run the hardware so if your boss thinks bitcoin is cool you might be able to get away with running it at work instead of home and avoid that cost - just make sure your boss is OK with it, no point in losing a job over a few bucks.

China had a virtual currency long before bitcoin, it was called  "QQ coins" and you could spend them widely in China. It became huge and for a while, a significant percentage of all money spent was using the coins. The Chinese government made it illegal to accept the coins as it thought it was devaluing the yuan.

3. Log incoming IP when user registers (yay - now I know your IP)

Sorry - that's not what I meant, I meant if you send coins to an address hosted on an exchange like coinbase then they know the private key so can control the coins (lock it down by freezing the users account - since the user doesn't know the private key they can't move the coins while the account is frozen.)  
You are completely right though - once any coins are in your wallet that you created and only you have the keys to there is nothing anyone else can do to move them.  Which is why this guy probably won't ever see his coins again.

Transactions using bitcoin may be near free but using visa is only 2% so at best they could offer a 2% discount. I don't think many people would find that very incredible. The big benefit as I see with regards to shopping is that I can buy something without ever giving my credit card details which will be stored by the retailer and potentially stolen. It won't save me money but it reduces exposure to fraud.

How would you lose 20%? - I transfer money regularly between countries and never lose anything near that - at worst maybe 1%.   If you want to keep the money stored in Bitcoin then go for it but if you're using this as a way to convert Yen to NZ Dollars then this isn't a very efficient way.

These services hide extra fees in the exchange rate knowing that most people will never actually check the exchange rate they get with the real exchange rate at the time.

@_date: 2014-03-20 18:14:36
There a saying around here that is relevant for both regular bitcoin holders and merchants alike "don't hold more in bitcoin than you can afford to lose".   
Merchants don't want to hold bitcoins, they want currency they can deposit in the bank so they use 3rd party payment processors that do this for them. They don't want to wait until the end of the day and then convert it all manually on an exchange and then move it to their bank to pay their bills.  What if you accept bitcoin all day and at the end of the day the price has crashed?

Which is cool :).  
If you sell bitcoin you pay no sales tax   
If you sell a product and take bitcoin as payment then you do pay sales tax which makes sense. It would be interesting to see if a retailer could then pay their tax bill to the tax man in bitcoin since that's what the transaction was in. If the retailer bought their stock with bitcoin ad sold it to customers using bitcoin then theoretically they don't have the fiat currency, only the tax and profit in bitcoin. If they are legally allowed to accept it as payment then they should also be able to pay their tax bill with it.

No, it will be instant, if you look at  under the section Projected Bitcoins Short Term, look at the column titled BTC/bloc.
Sometime in 2007 it will halve - this is part of the bitcoin protocol which means more cons are created in the early stages and then supply slows down which is why we already have around half of the total after only 5 years of mining - the rest will not be fully mined until 2140.

Private keys are not bitcoins. Private keys are like passwords. If you find someones username and password for their banking website is it OK for you to log on and transfer their money to your account?    
Even if you legitimate;y bought the laptop but they had saved their password in firefox you can't just use it.

The interesting thing about bitcoin mining is that bitcoins are created at a fairly constant rate and that will decrease over time.   
So the bigger your operation the bigger the slice of pie you get but the pie is the same size so everyone else loses out a bit.
Currently, 6 blocks are created an hour with 25 bitcoins so a total of 150 bitcoins per hour shared across all the miners in the world.
In 2017 this drops to 12.5 per block or 75 bitcoins per hour. At that time mining will become half as profitable overnight.

With normal gift cards they are not activated until bought at the checkout so no use if stolen from the store.  With these that would not be an option, it would be like putting piles of cash on the shelf - people would pocket them or even just scratch and steal the codes and leave the cards there.   Even if they were stored behind the counter a disgruntled staff member on their last day could help themselves to the lot and it would be untraceable if they tumbled them.

It's not can I?, it's should I if I could?   
Imagine you are away at college and your parents decide to do some cleaning up of your room and throw away that old safe you never use - you know, the one with your private key paper backup in it they didn't know about.  If I find out the private key (legally) do I then own any bitcoins at that address? The blockchain doesn't understand ownership as related to people, as far as it's concerned, if you know the private key then the coins belong to you.

I don't think you should ignore someone just because you don't agree with them - you may be right, I may be wrong - it's not always about the destination, sometimes the journey is just as important.    
I apologize if I've offended you, it really wasn't my intention - a few years ago I had my wallet stolen from my jacket (it was hanging over a chair in the library). What I lost was not much but the emotions caused by the event were significant. It's possible that these coins were simply forgotten, in which case, good luck to the OP, an alternative is that some poor kid's life is about to be significantly impacted. It would suck to see a news story tomorrow of some kid who committed suicide because his parents accidentally sold his laptop with his college fund on it in Bitcoin.

Here's a possible future scenario...  
Let's say currently there are 200,000 people holding bitcoins - they got in early and invested and they don't want more coins, that would devalue their holding. They are the majority and therefore will not allow more coins currently. In a few years time when 10 million people have coins, the 9,800,000 people who don't hold many coins (because they are so expensive now) will be in the majority and will demand more coins to be produced (increased rate and total). The original 200,000 owners will not have enough power to stop them and many more coins will be made.

If dollar cost averaging makes sense for buying then perhaps it also makes sense for selling too.

Even if paypal adopted bitcoin on the back end it would still charge the same fees but make even more profit, they don't charge those fees because that's how much it actually costs them, the they charge what they can get away with.

I assume the $3.95 fee is set regardless of how much is loaded on to the card - it's the cost of manufacture and delivery.  And it can be reloaded or more added.    
Think of it like buying a Trezor at $119 and only adding $50 worth of Bitcoin - that would be a 70% "fee"

"bank hold all my money hostage" - No, I can remove it any time I want   
"loans it out without my consent" - nope - in the terms and conditions I agreed to   
"absolute minimal interest" - with bitcoin you get ZERO interest    
"insurance up to 100k" - a lot better than nothing and you can just split your money between banks if you need more.

OK, so if it's in a mall that's only open 10 hours per day then it's 7.25 * 10 * 7 * 52 = $26,390 just in wages alone - probably at least $40k including all the extra liabilities and costs and that's each year, whereas the ATM cost is a one off.  This is why banks put ATM's into malls instead of having people there.

Also "According to the annual reports published by the Wikimedia foundation, the total expenses for 2011-2012 were $27.2 Mn. This puts the daily cost at roughly $74,500"

If you're in the US then there are some very good credit unions with low fees. The problem is that they have so many regulations to adhere to they end up having to charge fees to cover them so it's not always as simple as banks are bad (some are of course), it's more a case of banking being an expensive system (currently).

Pretty much, however there were a lot of MtGox users making up a significant proportion of all crypto currency users so in theory, if they all got together and pushed this new currency in favor of bitcoin then it could have a big impact.
In reality it probably just wont work as many would also hold bitcoins in other locations so they would not want to do anything to harm the value of bitcoin.

It's probably just a signature detection false positive - many of the viruses they detect are based on a signature which is possibly an md5 hash of the file or similar.

Taking something that isn't your is theft - that's what theft is - of course it's theft.   
OP transferred the coins to a different address - that deprived the owner of their property.  We may not know exactly who the coins belonged to but one thing we do know is that it isn't the OP.  You can't justify stealing by saying there's a possibility that the person you stole them from also stole them in the first place. 
"sweep them and see how the seller responds" - How is the original owner supposed to be able to contact OP to get their coins back?

It's a better time to buy than it was this time last week :).  You could always spread the risk a bit and buy some now and then wait and if it goes down you will not feel so bad since you can buy the rest at a lower price and if it goes up you will feel OK since you got some at the lower price.

@_date: 2014-11-14 15:26:33


That is correct however knowing the private key does not mean you own the bitcoins. If you look over someone's shoulder (in public) and see their private key, do you now own their bitcoins?   
Imagine you sell your house and forget you hid a copy of a paper wallet in the attic but you still have another copy of the private key. Then the new home owner finds it and sweeps it - is that OK?      
If only one copy of a private key could exist then that's one thing however the last owner of this laptop may have another copy of their private key and think they still have their coins.   
This is theft, pure and simple - ownership of a key does not mean ownership of the items that the key unlocks.

Imagine I have $1000 USD and I want to buy a $1000 PC using Bitcoin via Coinbase.   
I convert my USD to Bitcoin and pay for the PC. Perhaps Coinbase makes 1% on the transaction. So they make $10 USD.   
It doesn't matter if I got 1 bitcoin or 1000 bitcoins for my $1000 USD, Coinbase make $10 regardless.   
Like cash, bitcoins can be user over and over so the actual value of one bitcoin doesn't necessarily limit the amount of revenue Coinbase can make.

This is theft - the coins don't exist in the wallet, they exist on the blockchain. You didn't find 61 bitcoins, you found the private key that allows access to 61 bitcoins.

The "value" of bitcoin is it's usefulness as a currency, i.e. the ability to send money anywhere, anytime. This value is now gone in China, therefore bitcoin now has significantly less value. Other commodities actually exist - gold, oil etc. and have other uses - fuel, jewelery, electronics. Bitcoin now has no actual use in China anymore. It still has value since it can currently be used in other countries, but that can change at any time on a whim by governments that don't want to lose control - i.e. all of them. One day there may be a global virtual currency but it will be created and controlled by governments.
