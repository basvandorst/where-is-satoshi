Setting aside the face that "Coin" the device and bitcoin aren't comparable to one another:  "Coin" isn't going to be viable long-term. Visa and Mastercard will be [switching to chip and PIN cards]( by October 2015.

Mike Caldwell of Casascius no longer sells "loaded" coins.  FinCEN shut him down.  Only blank aluminum coins are available.
