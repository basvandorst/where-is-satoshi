Probably not. They are likely primarily relying on exchanges and tracking the USD sent to/from them, though be warned this is just my own speculation.
They can't track "wallets" they can only track each individual btc address. Though it is possible to identify who owns what address if tyou post it online or if they get information from one of the party's involved in the transaction.

You realize spending bitcoin is also a taxable event if you realized a gain from the time you bought to the time you spent it right?

This is how most trading accounts work. You don't transfer the funds until you decide you want to, independent of your trading transactions.

The average redditor probably doesn't even know how to setup a wallet let alone how to successfully launder 100k on a publicly viewable ledger.

I never got it to work on my end either. Gave up because the interface is complete shit, and there is a limit of how many times you can submit each day of 6-10.
Switched to kraken and they let you upload an  image file (fucking brilliant right?) that you take using any camera/program you want instead of some shit tier java applet that doesn't even focus the lens.
Way easier.
