You're too weak, you're gonna be left behind.
Take your spear, sword or bow and fight back!

How did you arrive at that conclusion?
Anyway, the most efficient answer to that is: the spikes on the chart are correlated/linked/connected with the the event dates.
But again, it's no magic graph, it's just a nice little chart.

Well, my interpretation of this post is that you shouldn't listen to Warren Buffet if Warren Buffet isn't a BTC holder.
That also works for Homer Simpson, if Homer isn't a BTC holder, people shouldn't take his serious opinion into consideration.
You, people, I, me, my aunt, Bart, etc. = BTC holders.

They weren't necessarily searching for this Consensus summit. But if they were, yep, I would also call that madness.

The graph/chart has nothing to do with any price of any cc. 
You could nevertheless try to find some shy correlations with price evolution.

Let's see what effect Consensus' marketing will have.

Let's say it's a blockchain congress. It started back in 2015. Flashy one, but still a good congress.
If I recall correctly, there were around 300 attendees back in 2015; they're claiming more than 4000 for 2018 \(TBV\).

Yeah, I don't think Antonopoulos will be at @ Consensus.
I'm lucky enough to attend this year's summit \(from [indorse.io]( If someone want's to share a beer at the Civic vending machine, drop a message!

Are you an attendee??
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:35:04
Do you have any ''true facts'' \(as we say in Texas\) to share with us?
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:42:38
Quite simple my dear Watson:
1. Google Trends.
2. No mentions at all about currencies \- it's about keywords Consensus 15, 16, 17 and 18.
3. General web search on all our nice globe.
4. On a population that has a smart phone, a computer or a magic crystal ball that uses google search.

I guess it's a good analogy.
But I do think that for helping the ecosystem in general, a validation process like ours, on the blockchain, is a good thing. It won't eliminate all scams, but it can validate all the good projects with real teams and advisors.

**Decentralisation** is what some wanted and others got interested in. **Regulation** and the lack of it is another topic.
Scams &amp; horseshit can be partially fought by **validating** the teams and advisors of ICOs and blockchain backed projects. This is what we propose for keeping the environment healthy and safe.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:56:32
Yeah, I didn't want to talk too much about our project. 
1. We're proposing to blockchain\-backed projects to validate their teams and advisors by sign a smart contract on the Ethereum Mainnet. 
2. Any serious company can go through this seamless process on our platform.
In other words, we require both parties, company &amp; team/advisor, to sign a smart contract to verify their relationship. It's a first step to rule out phoney teams.

**Indorse**! I thought you knew about the project, sorry about that.

Nope, interesting podcast. Nothing more, nothing less. 
The title was chosen by Channel News Asia.
