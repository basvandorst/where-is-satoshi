That's exactly my point. 
You asked for one time it didn't.
"ALWAYS" is a big word, and it has not in every point in time had an all time high. I know it's just semantics, but still debunks your statement, it is - right now - the one time so far it has not recovered to a new ATH. At least not yet.

Well, during last week? Moron. ;)

If they helped me retrieve 20 BTC from "lost keys", I would happily pay tax on them. Or, say, 100 BTC while we're at it. Or wait, I think I lost private keys to at least 100 000 BTC. I may or may not have sold 2 pizzas. ;)

Sure. it's up "on average per year" - but not "each year", no.
The average of 2015 is lower than the average of 2014.

Patent is the exact opposite of Bitcoin.   
If Bank of America gets this patent on bitcoin wallets, it is practically the same as Bitcoin being banned in the United States. Who will afford to use a Bitcoin wallet in the US, if the wallet creator will have to pay hundreds of millions to the patent holder of this wallet technology in the US? Information wants to be free, but the United States is the exact opposite of a free market. Everything is monopolized and patented, it's like Soviet Russia, only difference that the americans actually WANT this for some weird reason. They have the highest medicine prices in the world, the worst public transportation in the world, and don't even get me started on the mass shootings...

I don't think so.
2014 :

No ambiguity.
Why would anyone in their right mind even give the time with alphabetical letters in it?
I don't even know when 12:00 AM is, is that 12:00 or 00:00?
You americans just really love to be ambiguous...

The importance is that in the United States, they have a tool for industrial warfare called patent regulation. You can claim patent for anything that anyone else invented, for example insulin for diabetes that was invented in another country, so that the prices for insulin is now between 10 and 50 times more expensive in the US than in any other country and people are actually dying from diabetes because they can't afford it.   
That is what the banks are now trying to do with crypto, to take Satoshis invention and register the patent so that whenever anyone uses it in the US, they make millions of dollars just for holding a patent. It's a scam. Patents in the United States is a joke, a cruel joke that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year only out of corporate greed.

I want to give US citizens the time in the same format they give us the date. Least significant digits in the middle.
A quarter (minus ten seconds) to midnight would then be 44:50:23.
Or exactly half past 8 in the morning, that would be 30:00:08.
Confusing as f*ck, just like their dates.

Do you mean the thousands of wallets that each contain ~50 BTC?
They are all too small for this list. :)

Those super weird local USA date formats; the 11th of Twentysixtember... 
What's wrong with ISO date format? Or at least, pick one order, from small to large (day, month, year) or large to small (year, month, day) - but to mix them like that, putting the "least significant digit" (day) centered... It's just stupid. Y U do dis? :)

I think next stop is rather 2.1 BTC, to have one in ten million instead of one in 21 million bitcoins. Sounds round and nice, and it's a smaller more reachable step. :)
