Once it was Circle, now it is Square...

I understand what you are saying about this promo being for SXSW, then you expanded it to the Internet.  That was a cool move. But...
What you guys did today was really, really shitty.  It should be a black eye and embarrasment in your companies timeline.  Telling people things on Twitter one thing (promo is extending), then not honoring them is weak.  Then, on top of that, saying only those who complained get the promo is a serious slap in the face to those of us who took your word and said it was under maintanenace.  This is embarrasing for multiple reasons:
1. You are stuck in a hard place, between maintenance and incompetence. Your company couldn't handle the load the internet put on your site today, and it crashed you guys.  This doesn't look good.  By calling it maintenance, you are saying "My company is full of morons and we schedule maintenance during a prime-time business hours"
2. Your PR is absolutley horrible.  If you didn't want to offer it to the internet, don't.  Or, say it's run out.  Don't say one thing, then do another thing.  Then, insult the rest of your customers, or potential customers by saying that people only get the promo if they complained when you told the same people NOT to complain by issuing status tweets.
FWIW, I use circle, and you guys rock.  You have an easy to use system, things move fast, and it's been reliable.  I've used for for 10-20 transactions and it's been smooth.  Just today, you screwed up.  And for some reason I feel like harping on it.
