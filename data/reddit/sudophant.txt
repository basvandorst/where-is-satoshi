"Bitcoin is a failure because there's no central authority that's able to manage it effectively".
I'm loving the game, for me it's the best game ever, I've had more fun with it than any game in a long long time precisely on the basis of all those things that you consider make it a failure. If I could improve it... I'd have variable biomes on each planet (between two and five, a hot/equatorial version and two cold/polar versions of the prevalent biome, and one or two further variants) I'd have more expansive ruins, and creature behaviour would also be procedural- based on simple rules that in combination may emerge varied and surprising outcomes. None of my wish-list features bare any relation to the things whose absence you think make the game a failure. 
That this game isn't for you is fine, why do you care if other people love it. Why not just shrug and move along?

Not everyone cares about multiplayer, I know I don't, and it was never promoted as a multiplayer game although Sean said it would be possible to see the other guy if you ever ran into him. Turned out server load or a bug prevented this from being the case in practice but it'll obviously be patched soon... hardly a priority though for a game whose followers don't have multiplayer on their minds. I'd far rather Hello Games made moons orbit their primaries... focus on that please Hello Games, I didn't hand other my money for multiplayer, if I wanted that I'd buy some other game or wait till Hello Games updates it to no longer be a single-player game.
However Sean has also said they plan to add multiplayer down the line. I don't understand though why people looking for a multiplayer experience are looking at No Man's Sky in its current form, when it has been specifically said that this is not a multiplayer game right now. Why not just go honour Elite or Star Citizen with your attention instead. It's like turning up to a football match to complain loudly that there's no pool, or going to a vegetarian restaurant to complain loudly that there's no steak, it's weird.
I agree that it has great potential though, I look forward to seeing how the game evolves with updates over time.

A lot of people seem to think it'll drop sharply tomorrow because of futures contracts being due to settle. So people looking to sell want to sell before then and people looking to buy will wait till tomorrow before buying. I'm talking only about perceptions and expectations here though, what might happen is the price starts to rise tomorrow if buyers don't see much of a drop and start to panic buy while sellers that wanted to sell had already sold. Who knows what will happen after this "everybody knows flag-pole".

Bitcoin is in the world, people are going to say things like "we need to have a think about this stuff", I've done it myself.

So is this that as the Roman Empire grew,  and generated more commodities for a bigger market,  their metals supply didnt keep up?  All that extra food grown by all that large scale slave laborin and such needing more coins to be exchanged between more parties but gold supply more or less same as always. In fact it would be the value of the gold market being a smaller and smaller portion of the everything else market.

"letting the poor go to college on the cost of society",  to me this is the nub,  your world view is profoundly different from mine from this point on The cost on society is precisely what poverty is,  a society that permits untold potential to lie in the gutter is a failure. When you think education is a luxery product it is no surprise your society will churn out milloonaire plastic surgeons while so much as a broken arm would be sufficient to bankrupt huge chunks of your middle class. 
I guess as we face an increasingly aging population society will start to realise the potential of its people is the only real value a nation can possess,  far too valuable to waste on redundant puritanical notions suitable to peasant farming. Fuck knows how many Einsteins weve lost to this shit, how many Ada Lovelaces or Mozarts or competent skilled nurses or engineers or well informed critical-thinking consumers/voters left to wallow on the wrong side of a wealth lottery. Thats the true 'cost on society'. 
I beleive bitcoin can be a means to change that,  to cut out a corrupt self interested centers of power.  Socially liberal society needs a good form of money suitable to maintain contact with its material base from which big picture solutions to poverty can be built.

I don't think you know what Marxism is,  easy mistake to make now that Capital has triumphed so dont sweat it.

Finally,  people who want to control others can also find bitcoin helpful, they buy an sell stuff too rihgt (weapons,  torture equipment, all terrain vehicles,  suits and ties and spectacles and so forth...) Besides,  controlling people dont necessarily pay like it used to,  mans gotta think about the later years.

I respect you judgement, I have the same opinion.

That's not true, it depends what the values are in which the machine has context. If one side wants the first motor vehicle ever to be about pulling ploughs across fields, then they are on a different side to those who want the vehicle to get to places real quick. Thus the question of "what sort of suspension do we need" or "what kind of engine should it have" or "what kind of infrastructure needs to be built" become different sides of a technical debate representing different values. In fact weren't Eddison the ruthless capitalist and Tesla the bright-eyed idealist on opposite sides of this kind of technical debate re how electricity should be delivered (AC versus DC)? Tractors or cars turn out to be different use-cases of the basic engine-chasis-wheels concept valued for different purposes. Technical discussions are defined by the value-systems behind different use-cases the same basic concept can be applied to. It goes further, uranium versus thorium as an energy source for example stretches off into the hazy reaches of ever greater and more abstract contexts (strategy, economics, history, politics, geopolitics, ideology, even philosophy).

I agree with this. Bitcoin isn't just software, it's a representation of wealth. Don't jimmy with ma wealth please, I'm not interested in new knobs and whistles and bells as per the latest fad. Just keep it secure and keep it efficient by avoiding feature/risk-bloat. I want Bitcoin to be boring, to be pretty much the same from one day to the next, from one year to the next. Let additional feature/risks plug-into it by all means. Those who want to coin-hop... sure, go do that. Just keep Bitcoin boring, secure and basically unchanging. That's what I want anyway... KISS.

Those who become unemployed for awhile,  or those who become or just are unemployable,  those who cant overwise afford an education,  or healthcare,  even the tragic commons upon which we all depend.

Sound money or not doesn't mean anything. Power is power, and any government is an edifice of Power. Gold, silver, conch-shells, people, feathers, greenbacks... don't matter what you use for money, or what the money is used for- wars, oppression, corruption, fanaticism... Money buys, sure- but Power takes. Money can buy more than Power can take because Power is only Power within its own territory. Still, Power is Power. You'll need more than just a bunch of bow-tie wearing Mises mumbo-jumbo to figure out how to take on Power. Power manages Greed and Fear, the stuff of the market. I don't see how "sound money" has anything to say about transcending the drawbacks of those two primal market forces that also move armies. Sound or not, Greed and Fear will always be Powers bitches.

Thanks for the effort you put into that, very clarifactory.
Personally I think Centralization is a kind of force of nature, like Thermodynamics or Gravity. As things get bigger, scale-up, lines converge and clusters form, increasing power has to be managed by increasingly more powerful structures. The important effect I think people want when they talk about 'decentralization' is ultimately *a core that cannot be captured* by special interests; economic or political acters. 
The way you've described the Core project sounds pretty un-capturable to me in that respect. Well, apart from by good ideas it seems.

I myself have no children, and to be honest- I'd rather that I did have a kid by now even from poorer days, than a future of millions but no kid to make it really matter. Nothing in life- not kids, not money, not life itself is guaranteed. So if a good thing comes along, why waste your time being particular about the correct order that good things should be expected to appear? Maybe you're just young (er than me anyway) and don't know yet how untidy life can be. A lot of people who have children wouldn't change a thing actually, regardless of when they had them.

I think Centralization is like Entropy, it's just in the nature of the universe that the bigger something gets, the more it coalesces. Greater scale of perspective leads to converging lines, more mass leads to denser clusters. There's just no stopping Centralization, it's a force of nature. But perhaps there's a way to work with that somehow, make the Core un-capturable.

RT news is actually pretty credible, they do a lot of solid reporting and pretty good documentaries although occasionally they'll have a crazed talking head on one of their debate shows just for kicks. Certainly they're standards are much higher than CNN, they don't bother with "anonymous sources" all the time for example. RT's problem is that because they're RT- everyone in the West just ignores them except for those that agree with their slant in the first place. I for one am glad RT is around, they don't hide who funds them, nor by how much, nor what their "slant" is. Fair play in my opinion.

I reckon that whatever it is you used to do for a living, it matters that you're looking at bitcoin now, that's the impression I get from your stated preference to maintain a *low profile* ("I used to be an accountant, lawyer, doctor, businessman, baker, candlestick-maker..." what would not be low profile about answers like those I wonder).
Therefore, whatever it is you used to do that you're so hush-hush and evasive about now, I consider your interest in bitcoin bullish.

"Free money", an interesting concept, like saying "free rationing points". You're not inside the logic of money when discussing money itself, you're outside it. Outside the logic of money is the greater context of the logic of power. every turn the dealer deals out the cards, but this time instead of handing those cards to the players called "bankers" to deal as they see fit, instead all players are dealt directly, and then "play on". I have no idea if I made any sense there but the bottom line is that money is not thermo-dynamics, it's a thing we make with political power and distribute via labor and ownership. When machines make labor increasingly obsolete, we find a different way to distribute these ration-points called money. "Free" is not really relevant, only the function that we use money to serve. Ownership still pays out of course, as bitcoiners have noticed.

I'd like the trains in my country to be nationalized again and run that way. The thing is that fiat can work any way you want governments to make it work, it doesn't have to be all based on shiny metal or the undertaking of obligations or even incorruptible distributed trustless ledgers. It does have to be a good government though, democratic and wise and all that good stuff. Likewise, the undertaking of obligations could work, having a sound business plan being effectively a license to summon funds into existence down at the local bank, funds that are destroyed on payback thus counteracting inflation. But at the end of the day human beings fuck things up, human beings always fuck things up. We need a system that's human proof and I don't think even bitcoin's that. Good effort though, an improvement.

Automation in this case becomes the process of replacing labor with capital. Therefore massive unemployment for the human population, labor falls out of fashion with no system to replace the means by which purchasing power is distributed (wage-earning through labor). Post-scarcity isn't the problem, scarcity of roles that a working class human can get hold of is the problem, when increasingly employers can dispense with human workers by replacing them with machines they brought (or leased or whatever).
The solution in my opinion at that point would be to treat welfare as it should have always been treated, the "job" of people on welfare; to spend state-funds into the economy, supporting it from the bottom up. My 2 satoshi.

Great post. 2x would create a vulnerability in Bitcoins political system as it were, which is as severe a flaw as something technical that's poorly thought-through or poorly implemented. Frankly I'm surprised the closed-doorers on this thing thought it would fly to do something like this. Did they learn nothing from the things Bitcoiners like to vent about?

The money-problem is derived from the power problem. A failing money-system is merely the symptom of a bad political system in any society. Institutional capture, foreign domination of markets, poor state to state relations, corruption, fanaticism, war etc. Money is only ever a reflection of other values.

So what, this sub is about bitcoin, not some guys problems with the law in relation to the drug trade and whether or not he tried to have someone killed, or whether some judge is 'anti white' or 'anti male'. I've seen racists and mysogenist bitcoiners posting their opinions here too and think the same of them- fuck off with your "world view", this place is supposed to be about bitcoin. Stop trying to make Ulbricht into some sort of bitcoin hero and go to The Donald for that other crap.

Yeah i wanna buy a house, I can bitford one too but it would cost too large a chunk for the kind of place I want. I figure when it would cost a tenth or less of my hodlings, then I could bring myself to do it as the cost would be relatively marginal. Money and wealth is ultimately all about the living of life after all (can't take it with ya), so it would be nice to own a good venue for said life.

About poor people, you have it backwards in many cases... you see- being poor is very expensive, being rich is far cheaper. Which is why so many poor people find it difficult to become rich, they can rarely afford to make the move because of the ongoing expense of poorness.

Agreed. Rumour has it that using an exchange that's used to large volume trades and is properly paper-worked (KYC etc) might be a way forward... also giving the bank a heads up about the incoming monies from assets you're about to sell and the CGT that will then be paid might be a way forward. Not speaking from personal experience mind.

"Bitcoin users as usual will be unaffected." 
Um... no, we don't live on some sort of Planet Bitcoin, we live on Earth. A major upset in the financial world will effect bitcoin, it may make hodlers a lot richer... but they will still be living in societies seriously impacted by shocks. I don't think the increase in bitcoin value in such a scenario can be assumed to be worth the wider effects generally, or on those close to you or on those you may still rely on for business. Maybe if you live in a bunker in Bhutan and grow your own food with all sorts of survivalist stockpiles and a high barbed fence and your own solar farm and lots of guns and ammo and... but then what do you even need money for in such splendid isolation?

What the hell is peoples problem with Social Justice ffs, it's a depressing sign of the times when a term for someone who fights for social justice is an insult now. If you want to fight and smash injustice and oppression... fucking do it, stand proud, and well done to you.

That may be, in my country anyone who voted Brexit is considered a racist idiot (the national de-programming has only just begun). I contend that to call people like that Social Justice Warriors is a misnomer (Social Justice Hypocrites, Social Justice Sellouts, Social Justice Prostitutes... would be far more apt). Why is it that terms that refer to people working toward things like progress, liberty and justice have been turned into insults? It's quite literally Orwellian in my opinion and I'm against it. Just my two bits.

You've used the word "entitled" a fair bit, which suggests to me that you have simply misunderstood the nature of the value relationship here. "Views" are the resource, it's not a matter of entitlement (god, rightwing politics has a lot to answer for). The basis of your post is that the process of those resources being gathered and monetized are interfered with by adblockers, which is fair enough. But too many adds will also discourage veiws. It's not for the funny cat video enjoyer to figure out ways to monetize his or her attention, it's for the people seeking out an audience to figure out how to monetize the attention, and in a manner that doesn't diminish said audience by exposing it to spam. To use your own favourite word, content providers are not "entitled" to expect people out there in the world to spend their time consuming spam so that said providers can make money. I agree with you though, the solution in there is still being figured out, maybe crypto will be part of the solution, but you don't charge the golden goose for turning up at your thing because you think the goose is "entitled".

It's like that animation of the silhouette of a girl with a pony-tail spinning around, a shift in perspective around that decimal point.

Bullcrap. There can be no understanding of what's happening in Venezuela without the geopolitical dimension...
