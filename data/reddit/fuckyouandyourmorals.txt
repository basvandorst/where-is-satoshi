That tongue lick, into slow clap, followed by 1000 yard stare into oblivion gets me every time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:44:19
I appreciate your sarcasm. Upvote!

Racist coward with internet access continues to ooze vitriol steaming from a lifetime of self hatred. 
Down you go. Where you belong...
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:54:37
Hoping for 1-2k.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:14:39
We get it. You like to troll...here’s a downvote....
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:51:59
Nothing to see here, folks. False alarm.
Site is up and operational.

Truly, sad. He is literally insane.
I hope he gets the help he needs before he hurts himself or someone else.
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:36:05
Yeah, fuck that!...
Unless people can turn a profit why the hell would they waste their time and money?
There needs to be more incentive towards running these other than just "kudos."
Down vote me all you want. That wont change a damn thing.
It's called truth and alot of people can't stand hearing it.
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:47:35
Unless you're working for some super high-tech startup what do you expect?
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:08:22
Wow! Super nice!
If I designed this I would include tiny and faint binary zeros and ones within the areas where the gold and greens streaks trail in the black background.
Super cool art dude!

@_date: 2018-10-02 04:19:14
Right on!.. 
Yeah I've just been thinking about it so much lately that I had to get those ideas out of my mind and share them with others.
I feel better now having had a chance to share my thoughts.
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:37:44
In so many words, it’s a new crypto exchange/index that’s being developed by ICE, the company behind the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
Perhaps one way to conceptualize it would be to say it’s the first official attempt from Wall st. to inject themselves into the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:15:17
Curious to hear opinions. What's it to you?
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:02:50
I hear ya!...

You think we’ve hit bottom?...
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:29:20
Clap your hands twice then look up at the sky and scream “bitcoin!” 
If you do it right, a person will fall from the sky and ask you how many bitcoin you want to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:53:53
He has it. He doesn’t have it. He forgot he had it. Who cares?

But just like clockwork, they’ll be back for more.

Man, I hope you are right....  :^P
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:05:06
Patiently waiting for it to fall back to 1-2k this year. 
My goal is to scoop up at least 5 more coins before 2019.
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:13:57
Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:56:32
You got it! Most likely to be done by end of this week.
It’s the least I could do. Thanks again...
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:00:11

Nah bro. That chart is informative. Your just a fucking troll

Good riddance! 
A fool and his money are soon parted.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:26:59
Bought some more this morning. Will by more once we hit 5k.
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:53:15
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:31:23
I also see nothing in your future.
@_date: 2018-11-04 17:04:15
I’m both.
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:14:08
Super dope! 
I would like to use it in my next video. Assuming you have no issue with that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:29:09
Glad I’m not alone on this.

Not a bad idea. 
Perfect time to scoop up a roadster too....
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:21:14
That’s the spirit. I’m patiently waiting too. Thanks for your input!

One of the best unibrows in the crypto game right now!

@_date: 2018-02-02 03:34:10
Sweet deal. Appreciate the leads here.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:42:00
I feel (hope) it falls to 1-2k so I can scoop up more. 
Now would be a great time to short cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:51:16
Excellent video!
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:51:36
This broad seems super dense but I can’t really fault her 100%, given the unusual proposition.
King Jibar be using crypto to spit game at chicks. Facts! �� 
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:09:43
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:11:06
This is fucking hilarious!
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:11:21
Oh shit! That sucks. Glad I don’t keep my crypto on exchanges....
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:55:16
It’s funny.
I’m sitting down currently but every time I see a drop like that it literally feels like I’m free falling! ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:54:59
Everyone’s situation is different. I’ve been fortunate enough to always have ample disposable income, so holding money over several years has never been hard for me to do. 
I just believe believe in bitcoin and the community.  Imagine bitcoin if there was no internet. The concept behind it wouldn’t work. I remember people asking what the internet was in 2008!  Only 10 years ago. 
My point is that we are in the infancy stage with crypto in general and to say there is more upside than downside here would be a tremendous understatement. Quite often the trade off here is that you can’t reach those kind of astronomical gains without crazy volatility. As a high risk investor, I’m fine with that. Regardless of the current climate I remain convinced that we will eventually see a 1 million bitcoin within my lifetime (I’m 27).  And that’s why I’m not the least bit concerned. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:52:11
Amen to that!
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:52:08
I’m trying to figure if they even need to know about it or not.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:31:34
Congrats! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:40:57
One can only hope. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:51:38
Ok, yeah - so your advice is lining up with what I’m seeing elsewhere. 
Appreciate the input...
Looks like I need to get work on getting some pictures up and for my ad. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:29:28
I laughed so hard when I read this! ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:33:09
I own some HIVE. Bought in at 2.15. They have a very interesting, almost like human centipede parent child business model which should help isolate them from a lot of the volatility in this space. Not to mention they also happen to have about 30% market share of Blockchain. We’ll see how that goes.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:35:35
I love Ethereum too. ❤️��
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:05:34
Nobody knows exactly when. 
Rumor has it the app is waiting for Apples stamp of approval. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:24:34
I agree, but I think we haven’t hit bottom yet. 
I’m calling a bottom of 1k by June.
Love Me some cheap bitcoins! 
I’m trying to figure out how best to short this continued downfall until then.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:02:14
Guys bat shit crazy no doubt...
My problem here is that this is an old video. 
Clif, you still alive bro?...
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:00:49
This! ^
We are pretty awesome, huh?
Fun fact: I enjoy smelling my own farts.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:31:06
Yes. 
1-2k then up from there. 
At that price I’ll scoop up as much as I can.
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:51:29
Yes 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:45:34
But the dip = hell yeah!
The bottom is in = Waaay too early to call that. 
Nobody saw 20k coming when it did. That  said, I won’t be the least bit surprised when we hit 1k again.  Will be too busy buying...
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:59:34
Link no worky 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:24:15
Such a beautiful woman! GOT DAMN!...
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:38:48
No. 
I had eight years of hearing the same thing from others who invested before me.
I knew full well how volatile crypto is. That’s what eventually drew me to it.
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:15:00
Of course it will. Just not anytime soon. I’d be surprised if it doesn’t break 6k by June.
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:35:42
I will feel better once we hit 1500
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:47:43
I am now. Just picked up some more shares. I’m still short Bitcoin until I see a reason not to be. 2018 has been very good to me to say to the least. 
Thanks for your comment! Happy new year
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:25:37
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:36:08
Glad I shorted
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:09:43
Time will tell. Thanks for your comment. Happy new year to you!
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:34:06
Perhaps. Appreciate the input.
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:51:17
I know right? Technicals only tell so much. Gotta go with the gut. Best of luck to you in 2019!
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:33:44
I see your point but how much of it is semantics? The fact that all that money went right back in when crypto is so low is very telling. Old money sticks with what it knows. This will change overtime as younger generations ascend the ranks. Thanks for your comment!
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:30:11
One can only hope...
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:34:27
Other than sheer hindsight, I have no way of drawing an absolute conclusion. But I see your point of there being other places for money to go. My bias towards crypto always wants to see as many people gravitate to the space ASAP. So when they don’t, or at least when it appears they don’t go all in, it’s a reminder of how much more time is needed before mass adoption.  
There is a part of me that still thinks once you can actually buy a Starbucks coffee with Bitcoin later this year that this will make the price of Bitcoin go bananas. Looking forward to that possibility.
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:03:38
I’m glad you mentioned that. Yeah, Wall St. Chad will ultimately nerf crypto. In other words, they will take out a lot of the 85/90% swings. Happy new year to you!
