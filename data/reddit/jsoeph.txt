Me too. $30 equivalent in BTC.

I am glad I stayed away then as 180 days ROI translates into 200% annual return, and there is no industry that can generate that sustain-ably without a Ponzi element.

What are their fees? I recall 15% upfront.

Your calculations make sense, and I would not expect extraordinary returns in the first year. The upfront fee is probably payable just the first year and is related to the extra equipment needed to generate the hash power you are buying and is a fixed one time cost. The daily fee of running the equipment is your variable cost. It seems your cash flow for the .10597 BTC investment are:  Y1: -.12754 BTC Y2: .083649 Y3:.083649. So you would be above break even some time in year 3. I understand difficulty and BTC prices can change in that time but you are assuming that risk by investing. ROI under 3 years is not bad, and I would not expect a firm like Genesis would be so successful in selling contracts if at least under the initial assumptions the terms were not favorable (3 year ROI is actually amazing return). When I looked at it, I did not invest as I felt I don't understand the risks to mining well enough as well as Genesis cost structure compared to other miners.

This is correct.

Price is determined by the marginal buyer and the marginal seller. A hodler removes a marginal seller for practically ever and a new one has to step up and fold. It becomes harder and harder to find sellers in an inflationary world where you hold a deflationary asset. Buy the dip :)

Hodling comes natural to me, it is actually encouraged by US tax law. Selling to buy lower creates a tax event which costs me about 40% of gains. Even if I could time the market the house edge created by the tax law makes it prohibitive to even try as I get to keep the losses and share the gains.

I think everything is a sidechain of Bitcoin but what do I know...

The tech problems BTC has are paltry. BTC can resolve them multiple ways and most likely will down the line. Altcoins have difficulty to offer value that BTC cannot take. I found below article helpful:

News are targeted. I bet your friends have different feed.

How long have you been watching it? Rates were relatively high lately and made sense to try to borrow cheaper for small mid players. Now they have come off and people seem happy to pay market. Also there are relatively less margin positions post recent spikes judging by the movements in BTC loans offered. I don't think that it is a very meaningful number anyway as borrowers generally pay market for lending especially when moving big volumes. 
Are you concerned by it and based on what?
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:06:04
These are just if you want to borrow at a rate below what is currently offered.
