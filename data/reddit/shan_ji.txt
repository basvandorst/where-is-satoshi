Certainly yes, but if he will keep on persevering,  joining many bounty campaigns, [gambling]( with the right and fair gambling sites, trading, and many more, he would surely gain more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:49:52
This is exaggerated, 5 days?  But yes, I get the point, and I agree. That is one of the reason why bitcoin is invented, and there are many more.
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:36:43
OK then, if you prefer it more then go. What we are only saying is that bitcoin makes payment method easier. Like this [site](  , that will absolutely change the way you see cryptocurrencies exchange because of the legitness of it and the speed of it.
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:34:31
I know this is a joke, but actually, physically yes that is somewhat stupid thinking but psychologically, that has an effect. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:56:28
Yes, he must not settle to that. He only needed perseverance, intelligence, right sites to [gamble]( with and to trade with, right companion, then he will absolutely earn more than that!
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:19:27
Nice start bro! Don't mind those negative people who are commenting here, it is indeed good to start low because you will not lose so much money and potentially earn not that much but if you are persistent you can make more. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 00:02:55
Now dream more!
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:46:08
It's true, sadly, many new bitcoiners only one to this industry because of the rise last December 2017, and when they have invested and they didn't earn much from what they expected, they now hate it. If you truly love something, I agree to the post, you will love and be with it not only to its good times but also to its bad times. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:44:38
Well there's only one underlying problem to all the points that are given, and it is the proper website to leave your money. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 10:57:08
I dont know, maybe go back to the store and ask the seller for photo or something?  Haha, sorry man, internet is full of fake news that's why even your post is true, many of the comments here didn't believe on your post haha. I will just go back   [gambling]( haha.  At least here I am sure of the legality LOL. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 07:38:52
Possible?  Might be but a very very small chance. My claim above is as legit as the fairness of the [gambling]( site I am using. It is because of how the system works man, search for it and you will see yourself what I am talking about. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 10:11:05
Is this a joke? Will you show the proof?  We aren't sure is this true, maybe you make it yourself. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:22:08
Agreed, and the answer is also on the given problem. Find the proper sites of [crypto exchange]( and store, trade, and exchange only to those legit sites then you now have the solution to the problem! 
@_date: 2019-03-26 06:45:19
Yes bitcoin can influence the world but not as much as what this person is saying. I think saying fiat money will vanish is just a wild prediction and it wouldn't happen. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:15:55
I can say that i am a bitcoin enthusiast now. I am now addicted to bitcoin [gambling]( maybe for the fact that there gambling site I am using is a fair site and my playmates there are really fun to play with. I regret the time saying that bitcoin is a fake haha. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 23:22:03
Yes, why not? If you have what it takes then go. If you know you are lucky, have a good thinking when to take opportunity,  and in the right [gambling]( site where there is a fair play, then you can do it even though you are a beginner. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 22:41:40
I think you must also learn other things here like joining bounties, exchanging crypto, gambling, and etc that can make you earn bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:14:45
Well, we can control ourselves, and what we must do is do the things that we can do. I am now joking, I mean we can do things that will allow us to earn money, not just holding. Try  [gambling]( with the fair sites or do trading, at least there you can earn money. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:40:40
It is always time for it, but as funny as the meme is, in reality we cannot control it. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:42:06
Last 2 years, I was like, is it true? I treated last 2 years like other fake online scams. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:25:27
Psychologically speaking, the more food you ate, (and a slower rate), will make your brain think that you ate much that is why if you want to eat less but feel full, you must ate slower. I became hungry because of talking pizza haha. It is fun eating pizza while [gambling]( , try it! 
@_date: 2019-03-23 09:22:50
Well yes, they are opportunity grabber, but again, you couldn't say that they are crypto lover. It is again, if you love something, you would stay to it even though it is going to its bad times. That is what a successful bitcoiner sets them apart to ordinary users. Me myself, even though bitcoin is not that high,  I still do [gambling]( using bitcoin, trade using it, join campaigns, and many more. I will and still will use it, even though it will decrease its value even more. Because I love what I am doing. 
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:53:55
Yes, but it take time though. If he needs money, he can do online gambling to [sites]( that will entertain him with multiple types of games and even risky, will make him earn money because of a fair play types of games. Well, it depends on him though.
@_date: 2019-04-08 04:32:40
The only thing that I can be proud of,  cause my whole life is an embarrassment, LOL.
Bye, gonna trade now LOL
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:52:49
One of the choices is odd. Cryptocurrencies and Mobile phones can coexist. But yes, I also think that after 5 years we can pay anything by just using cryptos.
@_date: 2019-04-06 10:53:34
Yeah, there are these online [crypto exchange]( sites that offers lightning speed, fiat and crypto payment gateway for online business, games, physical stores, lack of currency risk, automated conversions, and many more advantages compare to old payment systems which will make you go and use it. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:24:33
Well yeah, but you can try to learn to do cryptocurrency exchanges. Just try to find a [crypto exchange site]( that has good qualities like a site where it has no currency risk, lightning speed, concert small crypto dusts, a gateway to payment transactions like online businesses and physical transactions and etc. If you have to find a site like that, then try to learn now the basics of trading, then boom! 
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:35:34
I'm a long term trader and also do hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:51:13
The biggest factor is when it hits the mark and people see it as an opportunity to earn money and get rich fast, which as we all know, isn't true. They taught it is the easy way out, but not really. Me personally I hodl, join bounty campaigns, trade by looking at the statistics at the [best exchange site]( I know, I even do mining, but I am not yet that rich. Well, we cannot blame them, we also even doubled or tripled our money that was in hodling that time, we also become enthusiastic much because of the rise.
@_date: 2019-04-19 07:37:17
Dont be scared to new things that you have been encountering and the best thing to do is try to know things about it so that you can adapt to it. You can try to study about it,  know things and every aspect of it find the best partner in trading. Me personally I used  [darb]( because of its fast speed and very cheap fees. Don't be scared man, everyone of us encounter these opportunities, it is on us if we will take it or we will leave it go just because of the fear we have.
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:24:45
Then use the profit in gambling, it will bring you not just entertainment but also a potential money.
@_date: 2019-04-15 21:45:28
If there will be new applications or inventions that allows us to do those transactions on a single click, but it will take time for that to happen. For now, let's enjoy paying or doing almost the same type of transactions on this [site]( that allows us to pay online businesses or doing physical transactions with a very fast speed similar to what we are dreaming for that was mentioned in this post.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:30:16
Well, there's no problem waiting, but you can actually do something while waiting so you can still earn money. 
@_date: 2019-04-13 07:13:57
No, it will bring the opposite. Online gambling can entertain him. Just pick the best [site]( which has many types of slots and games, a site which has very fast transaction speeds, good customer care if you have questions, and a fair play, then he can now start it. It is like playing a game but potentially earning money!
@_date: 2019-04-21 22:51:03
Dont stop dreaming! Make your dreams come true trough perseverance and hardwork. Hodl and be patient but smart, trade with the [best exchange]( at fast speeds, no currency risk and allows you to transact with online businesses and physical transactions, doing mining,  and  joining bounty campaigns, that's the recipe to success! Good luck!
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:43:23
Like joining bounties or do online gambling with [sites]( that has multiple slots and multiple types of games that's make it so enjoyable and has fast transaction speeds and a fair play that will make you do it often?  I don't know, just do thing that will make you earn money or enjoy your time when hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:32:17
The problem you have is that you aren't yet knowledgeable to everything. The rule is that doing invest to something you didn't understand. My advice is to study first.
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:39:26
Amazing art!  Well, there's no problem in hodling, but for me you can at least do other things to your bitcoin for you to earn money when you are hodling.
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:48:38
Half of it, the other half goes to my savings.
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:51:08
There's no logic behind it, obviously just a lucky guess. A trader with that kind of thinking, I guess he's a poor trader. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:55:43
I mean, it's already, right? I have using it since I have known it. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:26:49
Well, we have different allocations for our money. Me myself the 50 percent in bitcoin goes hodl and I also do trading to the [best exchange]( I know because it assures me it has no currency risks and at fast speeds, I also do mining. We have different allocations but matters the most is if we are allocating it right.
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:02:10
But don't stop persevering. Do the best that you can, know things that will make you earn like doing trading like what I am doing, trading with the [best exchange site]( I know that allows me to exchange cryptos with no currency risk and fast speeds which will make me achieve my dreams faster, joining bounty campaigns but making sure that those that I will join are not scam, mining, e hodl, and everything I need to achieve it. Don't stop believing.
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:33:44
Agreed, if a trader trade recklessly and isn't on a good  [trading site]( (ultimate speed, no currency risk, gateway to payment transactions,  etc), then he's not a good trader, but that is not just the underlying assessment there. A trader that relies on lucky guesses just like the post mentioned, you can easily say that he isn't a good trader. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 23:56:40
Nice start bro, now do things that will make you earn more.
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:51:57
hahahhaha you got me there bro! Well don't stop dreaming and persevering, you can get a real limbo soon if you believe.
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:46:42
Like playing online where you will have fun yet you can also earn money. I totally recommend this  [gaming site]( where it has great selection of slot and multiple types of games. But beware, you can also lose money, but if you have the guts, then take it. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:11:05
Yes, but what I meant is that must not start if the knowledge he has is not that much for him. In his post it's obvious that he isn't yet ready. Me myself before, I make sure that I am really ready in trading when I'm sure that the knowledge I have is sufficient, I know the right [companion]( in trading which allows me to trade for a very fast speeds but cheapest fees, knowledge on when to trade by looking at the statistics and anything I need. We will face consequences to our actions so we needs to plan it and make sure we are ready for it because we are responsible for it.
@_date: 2019-04-21 21:57:48
Wow, cool!
