IS BTC DED?

[this is the kind of shit socialism countries have to deal with](
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:02:28
As long as you agree to pay 8-10 points above the market. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:24:15
short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:05:42
The title is a bit misleading. Sounds like bittrex is a scam.

@_date: 2016-12-04 18:40:24
Because my "salary" is in dollars.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:16:09
Not true. It will only be released the 500 at first. It will take time to release the rest of the other banknotes.
@_date: 2016-11-20 22:20:25
Very true can confirm.
@_date: 2016-12-11 11:25:02
Great talk!
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:31:50
I'm assuming you're taking about San Diego, Carabobo, right?
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:37:54
too small, sorry.
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:20:12
Thanks for understanding.

Do you know that in that past 3 month the government has printed 1.6billion in banknotes?  you're absolutely right
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:11:52
See? The credit card was an example of how broken the economy is in my country.  I live in the US, I have businesses in here as in Vzla. Will this affect me? Sure a bit.(not as much because my money is all in $ and BTC)  But the real people getting fucked is the mid/low hard-working class which is about 80% of the country's population living there. Those guys will NEVER be able to travel, buy a property, or even afford Healthcare.

@_date: 2016-12-09 13:05:13
Thanks.... now, I'll short all my BTC. -.-
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:01:26
the most important benefit from this will probably be taking away the power to the central bank; which is controlled by the current government. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:34:57
I did the same as you and ended up with 25k funding. Now my dad &amp; mon have a basic understanding of Bitcoin and, well , the also like the profit they're making with  the miners 
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:55:45
In Venezuela, people are constantly changing (buying) their money (Bolivar) to USD to avoid devaluation. In the black market
the current price is at 4200Bs/ Usd. However, there are 2 or 3 exchange houses that do Bolivar/Bitcoin at a rate of 3500Bs/Usd if you convert  BS-BTC-USD. 
My point being, people are buying way more bitcoins lately rather than dollars.  It's cheaper, safer,faster and more reliable than $.  
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:45:02
take my upvote.
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:37:12
Constitutionally, no. You won't see anywhere that written.  but you know exactly everything if Vzla is about the goddamn dollar. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:55:06
to erase the ink and print your counterfeit money? Sorry, no.
@_date: 2016-11-30 16:17:35
What does that do? 
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:23:05
soo much yet to know...
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:53:47
11-15% depending on the bank.  I should feel sorry for banks and CC, but no. fuck them.

Official Government Exchange Price: 663Bs/ 1 $   **(No dollars available. Only for corrupt/well-connected people)**
Black market price: 4500Bs/ 1 $
Last month the price when from 1000Bs/ 1 $ to 4500Bs/ 1 $ in the black market.
I own in credit cards 5 million Bolivares last month. Which would have been 5 thousand dollars. Now, I own the same amount (5 million Bs) but I only need 1 thousand to pay all my debt in credit cards. Since I can  sell $1000 for 4.5million Bolivares. 
This is exactly why my country would take advantage of bitcoin and move out of this none-sense economy. 
EDIT* 12/04/16
The government has announced the creation of new banknotes: 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 Bs. Let me remind you that the highest bill right now is just 100. 
It sounds like it couldn't get any worst, but back in 2005, ex
-president, Hugo Chavez, decided to take "away" the last 3 digits to all the banknotes in circulation in the country and in the economy itself. Making an old  5000bs into a "new" "strong" Bolivar of 5. This is like if you stabbed the economy several times and then pretent like nothing happened.
This means: the new banknotes that will be in circulation next week are actually of: 500.000, 1.000.000, 2.000.000, 5.000.000, 10.000.000 and 20.000.000 Bs. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 19:50:28
Exactly. You will be considered  mid-low class. And that's good. trust me. Poverty is a big deal here.
@_date: 2016-11-30 16:19:26
...yeah. Paper money sucks.
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:15:47
Tell that to  which EVERYONE will go first before selling you any good. Ex: Cars. houses, insurance. EVEN tourism is ONLY $.  
If you come to my country to enjoy, probably the most beautiful beaches in the world, you wont be able to buy Bs. You will be forced to make all your purchases and transactions in Dollaritos. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 21:07:02
exactly. and drugs.
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:05:49
..and someone dump.

I can't click that link. My body doesn't let me.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:47:49
All these memes will cause the price to re-test back to 7k. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:59:47
Le random hodler.

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:44:27
Yes! That makes the two of us :]
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:07:04

@_date: 2017-05-27 22:29:31
I would love to know where that image comes from
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:29:26
wow incredible
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:03:54
Looks like a Rothschild. Am I right?
