I remember when I got 5 BTC from a faucet each time. Good old times.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:54:21
Hats off to her!
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:44:26
Does it work that way?
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:37:18
Not our first �� market.
But the first one in this price range. Who knows what the price will be during our next best market.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:13:00
Same for me. Watching this thread.
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:34:54
Cutting out the middleman should mean cheaper products.
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:55:46
Great read! Thanks for taking the time, wish you all the best.
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:30:31
Monero pumping, COINcidence?
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:35:42
But they are most definitely also looking into PSD2 in Europe.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:31:18
Great summary. 
One question why will the volume be so much more? As I understand they will never hodl Bitcoin and the contracts will be settled in dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:17:08
Same here
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:57:26
Thanks, that is true. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:48:54
The banks employee don't have access to the box, it's a two key system. But the state has rights to open it given certain circumstances but I'm not worried about that now.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:55:57
Thanks for the reply, you are right. My next step is to get rid of the whole backup and go with the 3 part solution. I just can't do it right now.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:40:53
How much?
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:11:33
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:43:32
What app?
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:20:46
Sad, for them, but true.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:45:13
No one else got an email? I have gotten 30 in the last 50 min.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:16:51
Yes I believe so. 
I got 266 emails in three hours, someone was trying new password almost every minute. All of them failed. Must have been other people that are also affected. Check your stuff guys.
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:06:34
Check it out
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:17:02
I need this in my life!

Bitcoin is completely legal to own and mine in Iceland. Please update.
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:39:16
Someone poke it with a stick.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:45:23
Actually it is not true about Iceland anymore. The currency restrictions have been lifted.
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:37:28
For mining operations in Iceland I would think it's about 100%. They almost only use renewable energy but I don't know what percentage of total Bitcoin mining is going on there now.
@_date: 2016-12-14 22:35:42
Thanks although Coinkite is not in business as as wallet service anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:48:49
It's a nice idea, the new generation's money.
I gave my son 1 bitcoin when he was born around 18 months ago and the equal amount of our country's currency. 
The bitcoin is now 3 x the amount in his bank account. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 11:45:28
Thanks mate. Tell me one thing, how do you confirm the transaction with the Ledger?
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:20:58
Great clarification. Thank you so much! 
What I failed to understand before was how the security card came into play. It does not. 
So I tried it with 2-2 setup and it worked like a charm. First I signed the tx using my Ledger's PIN number via Electrum and then I loaded the tx into the other Electrum wallet, signed and broadcasted.
Still trying to decide which setup I should go with. The 3-2 multi signature consisting of (HW.1/Offline Electrum/Online Electrum) or just use the Nano S for everything. Distribution between them would be smart I guess.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:16:43
Yes you are mostly right but actually there are many mining operations based there because of low electricity and cooling cost. I don't have the percentage though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:41:21
Wouldn't the people who give out the perks need to know at least when the perk is used.
I'm not opposed to the idea just pointing out it could be dangerous ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:08:26
Why would people want to let others know they held that much? To become targets?
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:09:03
Maybe. But it's only $175,000 today. Who knows what it will be in three years.
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:20:25
Funny. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:34:47
Sure. Just saying. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:27:12
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:41:36
Yes, that might work. It's a good suggestion,, I'll try it. Bitcoin Magazine, Cointelegraph, Coindesk to name a few.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:44:46
Haha lol! 
Been here since early 2013 so it's not my first rodeo mister. It's not about handling the truth it's about filtering out what doesn't matter: The price in USD.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:39:23
Good work on spreading the word. How many are willing to accept the change in BTC, rough percentage?
BTW. I'm visiting Dublin on one month and will definitely need taxi service. How would I find you? Would pay in crypto of course ��
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:16:49
What if someone gains access to your email and sees your information?
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:10:58
Not sure this is very accurate.
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:31:19
Updated, took couple of times to get though but works well now. Nice work team Ledger.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:22:59
It's already built into Electrum and will be available on next version.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:28:02
You can call it whatever you want. For me it's: Noise.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:38:47
Summary. A lot of mining equipment was stolen from three different data centers in Iceland in December and January. Equipment for around 2 Millions USD. 
Four people were arrested, two of those are still in solidary. Nothing has been found so far and the police day there could be an 'illegal' bitcoin mining farm in Iceland and it's probably part of organized crime.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:42:50
No. I don't know why they use that wording in the news article. I'm definitely isn't illegal. Maybe they just say it since it is using stolen equipment.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:53:44
Yeah, so not such a great idea ��
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:42:17
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:27:40
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:18:46
Yes very much still in development.
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:46:10
I actually did win couple of times. Tried to withdraw, wanted to also test receiving but found out it wasn't doable.
Just played until everything was lost then :-)
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:58:40
Anyone tried this? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:33:51
Ok, you know how I can fix that in Eclair, my channel state says Normal.
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:27:04
Here is one article and a one video with explanation from Elisabeth Stark.
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:07:26
No I didn't. The LightningSpin website showed me, payment received. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:54:20
I did also. Paid but no M&amp;Ms delivered. See now it has been fixed. Will try again in 1 minute. Watch.
@_date: 2018-07-14 23:01:06
Great advice and never repeated too often. Cheers.
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:43:27
It's actually a really strange case. Police knows nothing, this guy escapes and he has a website only containing GPS coordinates.
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:41:31
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:07:04
Thanks for this idea, I like it ��
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:52:32
My mistake. Just pasted and forgot the posted in another sub, sorry. It's a quote from btc.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:02:02
Mine too

Bitcoin.com pool developer here. We haven't stopped signalling for Segwit2x. We just haven't deployed the signalling to all our servers yet.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:08:47
Yes basically!
Should I have split it in seven pieces in stead ��

Great idea. 
You created an image and printed it out and then keep the digital version somewhere save? Or am I misunderstanding?
I know a little about steganography, correct me if I'm wrong but you always need the digital version as well?
