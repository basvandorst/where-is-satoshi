There is one box for promo codes and another for referrals at signup screen. Promo code gives you extra badge, free meals etc and if you put an ex-players' name in referral box they will get a Recall Pendant and the new player will also get a gift.

you don't need a code to signup just your email address but if you add reddit as promotion code you will get a free meal in Rashan and a reddit badge. :)
I hope you like the game.

remember you can always sell items for btc to other players (item created by using crafting/breeding pets).

There is a warning at the level 3 barrier reminding players to take their stuff before leaving cherry tree area. You can change the price of any item you have. Just click on the item and change the price in gp and btc. You will see by looking at the trading network what other players are willing to pay for some of the items. One of the player recently sold more than a dozen portions of Amrit for 0.001btc each to other players.
Thanks for liking the game.

I can only see a cooking pot outside the chestnut inn.

Cant see it anymore someone must have picked it up.

That is an epic maze and enemies on the other side are tougher to fight. There are warnings before you enter the maze. But I know it is difficult to resist :)

We have increased and decreased turns and the rate of regeneration in past and after some balancing this rate seems good. But if most of the players feel that it need changing, we can look into it again.  
You must be enjoying playing as you want more turns :)
