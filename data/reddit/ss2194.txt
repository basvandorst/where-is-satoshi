They dont have your private keys so yes its safe.  Just be careful for fishing scams once they have your email. 
I would recommend creating an anon spoof email to use and you can pay them in bitcoin.  
If you pay with a CC they will know who you are and if your email is John.Doe they will know who you are.

I suppose you could try to sell the balance on openbazaar. They make the payment for you and you send them the bitcoin.

Buying Bitcoin for a buddy is one thing, but if you start getting multiple customers and start making legit money, you will need to file proper paperwork with the Securities exchange commission and federal government.

Thanks for the clarity.  Yeah its definitely not worth the headache for really in a grand scheme of things not a ton of money.  Plus I would hate to ruin a relationship with family or friends. 
I am going to just teach them how to buy on coinbase and recommend a hardware wallet for long term storage.  If they dont want to follow through on their own, then I cant help them.

Yes they probably are if the price continues to go up but that doesnt mean you should do it.   
Just realize what you getting yourself into. Be prepared for Hardware and software troubleshooting, Cooling issues &amp; Fire risk, security, and the pain around tax reporting (if in the USA). Its far from something as simple as set it and forget it and watch your wallet grow fat.  
If you are wanting to mine bitcoin do it because you love the business model and it matches your personal interests or else your going to end up wasting a bunch of your time and selling it on ebay at a possible loss.  For most people, buy and hodl is the way to go.  However, you can possibly gain some great skills mining and learn a ton about the inner workings of bitcoin and cyptocurrencies which will be great skills for the future.  
Bitcoin is up from $700 to around $6500 in the last year.  If you had purchased $2000 in mining equipment on Nov 13th 2016, then factor in the 2-5 hours per week in maintenance, and used that time to work for $11 an hour at startbucks putting all your money into bitcoin you would be well above $20-25k profit at this point.   Which is way better than most best case scenarios for those who mine since most are plagued by troubleshooting issues and dont work 100% of the time.

Had you bought 10k worth of VFINX index funds on this day 17 years ago, that would be worth $25,300 today or about a 5.4% return.
A 10,000 item in 2000 would cost 1400 today.  So your real returns are only about $11,000, or just over 3% growth... before taxes.  
Index funds are risky places to store wealth, but not great places to grow your money.

Depends on risk tolerance. Aside from bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and ripple are all worth a look. 
If you want to gamble a bit more zcash, monero, NEO are riskier option. Anything smaller than that and you are really risking losing everything. 
Personally I dont gamble on any coin that I cant store on a hardware wallet.  No point in taking all this risk if you cant store it properly.  If you dont have a hardware wallet I would say dont speculate on any coins until are storing your current funds safely.

We are at 4300 right now. Its 9am on the east coast in the USA.  I wouldnt be surprised to see new bitcoininers that we recently picked up over the last bull run sell off and us end up in the mid 3000s

Want to invest in real estate? Buy a home some day (hopefully after your a millionaire)? Get a decent rate on a car or auto loan or lease? 
Sure you can rent your whole life (I actually think this is a great idea) but are you prepared to cough up 2x or 3x security deposit because your credit sucks? Or buy a home cash but you need 300-400k to not live in a shit hole... and now you got 300k tied up in a shitty asset called a single family house. Same for a vehicle.  
Banks are not your friends or your enemy.  As you said they are a for profit corporation and if your not an idiot you will learn that you can make money off their services just as they can make money from you.  Its possible to be win win.  
Smart people use leverage to maximize profits and cash flows, usually that leverage comes from a bank or private equity.  Either way credit score matters.  One day you might need those services.  Don't burn any bridges for credit card points of sign up bonuses.
