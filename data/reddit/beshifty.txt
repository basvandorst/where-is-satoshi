Earning bitcoin by wearing out your personal hardware and/or using electricity sounds a lot like the first part of bitcoin mining's story. Why won't it quickly be overtaken by dedicated farms due to the economies of scale as mining has?

You've just made a false dichotomy: Either everyone should be entitled to NOT share anything, or everyone should be entitled to everyone else's information. My stance is somewhere in the middle; there is information that affects people that those people deserve to know. 
Not sure why you feel the need to dispute that merit as a concept is valid. I'm not interested in debating that here.

That's the funny part! Her business, on Oct 29-30th, was being a panel moderator. Part of the job of a panel moderator is to ensure that the audience of the panel is fully informed on all aspects of the discussion, including the relevant history and experience of the members. So you must see the reason for people to say that they **deserve** answers: when they paid 150$ to enter the convention, they rightfully expect professionalism from the staff, including the panel moderator.

As I said, regardless of whether their username is public domain or not is irrelevant; the association between this message (not intended to be public at all) and the username is not public domain. I didn't even say that this would be a case of doxxing, I just used that as a point to illustrate that connections between information are also pieces of information that can be harmful if exposed.
Finally, a reddit username provides whatever personally identifiable information that a user wishes to provide through comments and subreddit subscriptions. By choosing to use the private messaging feature of reddit, the user specifically didn't want either the content of the message or its association to their reddit account known.

Notice that it explicitly mentions **publicly** available databases. As in, the information is already public, but the act of collecting/exposing the association is what's considered doxxing.

The financial reason not to use cold storage makes complete sense. The whole point is to air-gap the system, which means the cold storage accounts require more human interaction.

As I read it, he's interpreted the downward slide to indicate that public interest is waning or at the very least, not growing with our expectations. He's saying that the advantages of bitcoin are not intriguing enough for many people in the general public to wade into the issues of security, etc, which ARE currently left to the end-user (unlike GPS). He also feels that the advantages of bitcoin aren't grasped, or deemed worthy of the additional levels of trust in "technology" that they don't grasp. It's still a valuable post if these issues haven't been solved yet.

You're being sarcastic right? Companies pay millions for that data from Facebook or wherever, and now that we've got an transparent and public blockchain that everyone likes to go on about, companies can get that info legally and for free. Why shouldn't they take advantage of that core Bitcoin feature now?

Just because two pieces of information about a person (the username and the message) are public knowledge does not mean that the association between the two is public knowledge. In many cases exposing that link can be considered doxxing.

Overall. One user can expect to make 10 cents, since that's about how much a mobile game makes per user from ads. Maybe if they were video ads or interstitials they'd make slightly more.

Unfortunately that would violate Apple's policy on external payment systems (all IAPs must go through the app store), but the developers could implement standard purchases and then transfer their cut to the BTC pool.

I read the context as being that the public's current opinion of Bitcoin is that it could help fix many perceived problems in finance, but the implementation details are so out of reach of the general public that little discussion can be made. So the punchline is revealing that although Peter is quick to suggest Bitcoin as a solution to his financial problems, he doesn't really know enough about it to back up his original statement with any concrete explanations. In my head the joke was that Peter suggests things without fully understanding them himself.

Then run a bitcoin transaction! There is no specialized hardware required!
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:31:57
So their micro-payment solution is to subvert Bitcoin's fee market in order to force their own transactions into the blockchain? And only in the blocks their pool actually wins?
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:44:55
Wouldn't you just use the bitcoin testnet for that?
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:29:44
By plugging in their Bitcoin Computer of course!
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:40:06
So mining in their pool isn't opt-in? Isn't that a centralization risk if they do achieve their dream of becoming a large percent of mining power? And let's say they do miraculously take over 30% of mining with this army of USB miners. That means there's a 70% chance that the next block isn't mined by them, meaning your micro-payment doesn't go through. You probably have to wait 30 minutes to get a 0-confirmation transaction to go through.
This also ignores the fact that they're now undermining the fee market in bitcoin (a major requirement as mining becomes less and less lucrative).

So it's a $400 license to get access to the software? 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:17:53


You mean your regular computer's resources? Why not download software that you input your public key for and it facilitates the resource sharing?


Why is the locality necessary? Wouldn't it be easier, cheaper, and safer to run this service through a regular server and have the drone follow instructions from it?


What do you mean by process transactions? If you're just giving the user a digital product for bitcoin why can't you do that by calling up the wallet on their device for payment? Silbach's android wallet has had that API for years (request payment, receive callback on success).


This seems to be a purely software-based task that many companies have already achieved.
At the end of the day, I still don't see what the hardware enables you to do.
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:03:44
The more companies that get in on this, the less likely your micro-payment goes through since your company's pool is the only one that's going to include your zero-fee transaction.

Bitcoin Plus?
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:08:39
All you need to receive bitcoin payments is an address right? So if I wanted to sell my system resources wouldn't I just download SharedResourceMarket.exe and input my address? How does the chip help with that? And how far are those mined satoshis going to get you on the network? Wouldn't you be much better off not buying the hardware and just getting 200$ of bitcoin on the market? Or are you thinking more of non-financial transactions like document signing? Either way the exchange will be better value right?

Since when did TCP require trusting anyone?
@_date: 2015-09-23 22:23:45
Even a 20% share of the network means they mine 1 out of 5 blocks for an average first-confirmation delay of 30 minutes.
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:39:46
Whatever hypothetical micro-payment network they've come up with would be much better and more popular if it was hardware agnostic. The entire thing is vaporware at this point anyway. 
If this were on a drone, you would want to disable the mining chip since that just drains battery. That leaves your requirements at "a computer". And any network issues you have with your server you'll have with the whole bitcoin network. Negotiating wifi hotspots sounds interesting but the trend is towards more unified access (entire cities getting free wifi, widespread satellite internet) rather than segmented (small pockets of hotspots each managed by different companies). And I wouldn't be willing to leave the financial transaction up to the chance that there's a nearby hotspot anyway.
None of this discussion is aided of course by the fact that 21inc is just leaving us to speculate wildly on the functionality and purpose of this device.

You could probably draw a better analogy with a "Microsoft Office Computer" and Google Docs.

The Bitcoin computer is 2 steps back.

Why not just run all your code on one server then? The system reaches consensus by which event request the server receives first, and every "node" syncs up with the server's master event list periodically. If you wanted to tweak the "rules of consensus" your server logic just changes slightly, without any client changes.

That time you borrowed from the cloud - possible parceled out to millions of other devices - was paid for by a tiny fraction of the 10$ in Bitcoin that Apple/Samsung/Other Phone Manufacturer preloads their phone with.

The ATMs that are popping up are mitigating your 2nd point immensely. I had BTC in my phone wallet a couple hours after depositing the cash.

I was a customer twice. Went in on the 2nd day it was open and it was a bit shaky. The first time, the exchange went down and I had to wait 5-10 minutes. Then I fed in my money, scanned my address, and my bitcoins came through after a day. The 2nd time I went I didn't have to wait, and my bitcoins came through after an hour. I was pretty satisfied.
