And I think with age it is starting to become a problem.  Being disabled (hence the age because it progresses with age) - I hate that i'm dependant on others so I think subconsciously I try to "repay my debt". Everything I do is not good enough for me. I have been tracking Bitcoin since practically its start but managed to overcome my "inner voice" only by the end of the last year (yeah I know ..) when my friend gave me courage. I waned some independence but now if it takes off again or it drops I lose. Probably the healthy thing would be to ignore the charts and go on with my life but it is starting to become more difficult (because it is interesting not even from investment standpoint but everything else). Stupid but perhaps I waned to vent where no one knows me.

Well that is what i wrote. 
Even tho the money I lost  I will earn back and it is not such a big of a problem, but somehow I feel guilty that that money could have helped someone. It is stupid because it is my money. Is there a term for money spending guilt? :D

My crappy exchange lagged at the time (somehow it ignored my set price) and bought huge chunk @ ATH. messed up my average cost.  I was 50%~ down  manage  to Decrease the loss by selling/buying  in some extent. Then my family member lost his job. I sold  my coins  just before the last "dip" to 6k 
Was planning in re buying sometime in the future but had to stay away from the charts for a couple of days for health and other reasons .. then boom 12th spike happened. Now I got my paycheck and re bought some. Hoping it will reach the price I need to cover my losses at-least. But with my luck I think it will dump again :|

Yey sold all at a heavy loss while it was going sideways (exchange does not have a stop loss) .. due to a family member losing his job and I waned to help.
Now I'm watching it rise .. 
While it was falling I was not so stressed.. but now I feel that I will lose out by being out.
