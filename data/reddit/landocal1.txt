Hitted 
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:08:45
Support?  More like DPS.

Future = moon

I don’t like him.
@_date: 2013-02-13 10:48:25
Any day now!  I can't wait!

Al Qaida, North Korea, and Congolese warlords have the most to gain by using bitcoin.  The governments of USA, Germany, and Japan have the most to lose.  I suspect as soon as people start using the b word (rhymes with villain) to describe the number of transactions, bitcoins will be maid illegal and governments will fund heavy handed measures to stop those having bitcoins.  All they have to do is find the heavy hitters.

If it drops below 25 again I'll start buying but I'm not holding my breath.

How far behind schedule are they?  What was the first date that they told?  Wasn't it December 2012?
@_date: 2013-02-03 10:45:32
Sorry for the late reply but as the difficulty goes up no one is going to be making $300 a day.
@_date: 2013-02-03 22:46:57
too be expected.
@_date: 2013-02-11 13:46:58
Close friend.  White knight.  Bad idea.
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:49:15
My biggest concern is that Ill move before they ship.  How many Avalons have shipped?
@_date: 2013-01-22 05:17:16
@_date: 2013-02-03 22:48:27
Oh that's fantastic.  If the difficulty only goes up slightly by the time my BFL unit ships, I'll be quite happy.  Hopefully the BFL unit will be superior to the Avalon in reliablity as well.
@_date: 2013-01-21 06:35:21
I'm starting to believe.  Let us see the benchmarks.
@_date: 2013-01-22 21:44:33
I kind of trust Avalon will release their product.  Right now they have the most credibility among the ASIC companies. 
@_date: 2013-02-07 17:50:57
Wait they are still designing this thing?  May as well delay it until April.
@_date: 2013-01-31 22:38:27
$300 a day. Not bad for extra income.  By the time I get my BFL kit Im sure the gold rush will be over.
@_date: 2013-02-03 18:52:11
I'm that guy alling off the skateboard. QQ. The Avalon guys have probably already paid for their mining rigs in new work.
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:25:26
Stay the course; don't cut and run!
@_date: 2013-03-02 12:47:22
You mean these merchants arent money laundering schemes!?
@_date: 2013-01-22 01:04:46
Yeah this one is pretty terrible and misinformed.
@_date: 2013-02-22 03:50:56
News Stories drive up.  It'll contract again once this latest wave of news stories settle down.  That's when I'm going to buy.
@_date: 2013-02-28 22:30:56
They should call their podcast the two idiots podcast.  They really don't have a clue.
@_date: 2013-01-22 09:24:06
Definitely not the prettiest piece of hardware
