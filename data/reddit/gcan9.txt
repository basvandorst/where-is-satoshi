Sounds like a plan ;) let’s say you have 1 BTC.. how would you go about cashing it out? Exchanges have limits, big brother will surely want his taxes or wonder where this cash came from suddenly.

So you mean the only way this (or anything similar) could happen is if USD gets heavily devalued? I mean, btc is at $7500 now and it was under $2000 last year. The value of USD as such is still pretty much the same.

My assumption is based on the fact that this happens daily on thousands of markets (of course not in the extent 7.5k to 1M that this post assumes for entertainment purposes) without any price movement at all on unrelated goods. So when I go to McDonalds and buy my Big Mac it still has the same price every day, even though gold went +10%, my VEEV stock +20% and my XYZ microcap crypto +600%. 
I agree that there will have to be reactions on other markets as well, because for example suddenly a LOT of ppl will be able to buy the Lambos they dreamed of, but this will surely not be instant and not 1:1.

Oh, it is indeed. My point is now completely crushed. 
According to cmc, BTC-fiat volume is 30-60% of the total volume on all major exchanges. If you add LTC and ETH to fiat as well, that percentage increases significantly. OTC trades are inherently even more fiat-centered than trading on exchanges, but even at 50% of the volume my point still stands and it would be easy to get rid of billions of USD worth of BTC. 
What’s your next argument?

It’s not a matter of comprehension difficulty. There’s no need to accept another person’s loose hunch as if it is an absolute fact. 
The whole point of Dark Pools is that they’re.. dark. You wouldn’t find info on the liquidity available in these markets. That’s why it’s difficult to comprehend their trade size capability. And thus difficult to debate about. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:18:06
Actually I found some info on the trading volume of dark pools.  How’s 10b in 24h for ya? Enough?
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:55:39
Your argument is equally unverifiable. Or did you give any facts/sources for your claim that it’s difficult to move “2000-4000m” OTC?

Awesome, you managed to find another thing. Congratulations. 
Who’s talking about USDT? Bitstamp, Gdax, Kraken - all USD/EUR/GBP. Also Bitfinex and Kraken have their own dark pools, and don’t come with Bitfinex using USDT on there too. 
The comparison using the volumes was to show that there IS fiat volume, no matter how much you want to play it down by saying crypto-crypto is a whole different story than crypto-fiat. 
So back to my point, there’s obviously enough OTC fiat volume and the 10b example was only the 24h volume on ONE new dark pool that had just started. Now, Kobayashi’s sells were made over a period of more than 2 months. So considering there are several OTC markets and pools worldwide and the fact that the sells were made over a long period of time (we’ve been using 24h volumes as an example) again, there would be plenty of interest and fiat volume from OTC clients.

It's possible to predict with pretty high accuracy because the discussion is centralized and the market is still very concetrated, the traders are few (in comparison with the conventional stock market). So processing these few, and concetrated discussions can yield good results. This will of course grow more difficult as the acceptance and the market widens.

Although I find your project very intriguing and clever, it seems the posts are just really there to stir up feelings (anger, disbelief, fear (I here mean those other miners who dont want you making encouraging posts about mining), and mainly jealousy) so that you may fish out a couple of ppl who want to call your bluff and then finally show pics and take their btc. Otherwise you would just post the pics directly from the start. 
But I find the idea very cool! Didn't know that the best way to grow lettuce is with artificial light. And using solar power for that somehow makes these lettuce heads a perfect match for an ironic generation ;)
On your other point; I too have noticed - since the first time I considered btc mining, back in 2012 - that the community as a whole is discouraging ppl from mining because it's not profitable and so on. That's the reason I never got into mining, which ofc is my own fault for not researching better. So yeah, I can confirm this observation of yours.

You seem to confuse opinion with accusation. I stated my opinion about your motives. I may be wrong or right. Of course it is virtually impossible for me and for you to prove what your motives really are, so that is not a discussion I'm going to enter. If it was possible I'm sure you would wanna bet though. Probably me too. Anyone care to escrow?

So you going all in on BTC shows a clear confidence that the UASF/UAHF story will instantly be positive for BTC? Otherwise you would stay out of BTC and await the dip after August 1st to buy in. Hell, if you are so afraid of ETH then it is even safer to stay liquid in fiat. Interesting, but I can't imagine how the upcoming BTC fork can possibly be applied without a severe crash (even if it is only because of hesitation and fear). Bitcoin will recover, I'm sure, but it will take time.

I've had better luck with coinbase. Verification took couple of hours. Not so advanced like kraken, but at least I can get some BTC and ETH now.
