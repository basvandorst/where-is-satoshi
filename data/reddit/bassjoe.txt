I honestly don't know why this isn't actually a bigger deal outside of the bitcoin world. 
The most powerful financial regulator in the state with the most powerful financial industry in the country is jumping to the private sector after passing a flurry of new rules (the BitLicense isn't the only set the DFS has pushed through in the past couple months) to advise companies on these rules.

It's literally impossible to have a floating surety bond requirement like that. Surety bonds are insurance policies protecting customers against a company's default. You can't have an insurance policy that changes day-to-day as no insurance company would agree to give you one (because they won't know exactly what they're insuring).

This is a total failure of the Greek state and the EU. Its default should have been foreseeable over 15 years ago, yet greedy, power-hungry and/or "United Europe"-obsessed politicians in Greece and the rest of Europe willfully ignored the problems.
Greece shouldn't have been allowed to join the eurozone to begin with. The Greek government in power at the time fabricated the books to get in. None of the financial information about the Greek state -- its budget, its tax revenue, its deficit, its GDP, its inflation rate, etc. -- that was reported to the EU had any semblance to reality. It's shocking nobody at the EU discovered the fabrication. 
But being part of the EU provided Greece with access to cheap loans to finance oversized government worker salaries and pensions while allowing it to do nothing about galling levels of tax evasion and public corruption.
The Greek government in power afterward discovered the fabrication, reported it to the EU and... nothing changed: Greece was not required to pursue any meaningful structural reforms and was not reprimanded in any way. Greece WAS, however, still provided cheap loans.
2008 rolls around. Greece's economy -- nearly completely reliant on tourism and shipping -- tanks and repaying the loans it shouldn't have received to begin with became mathematically impossible instead of merely extremely difficult. Instead of letting Greece go and hurting the "unified Europe" movement, EU desperately offers Greece bail out after bail out in return for reforms which Greece is structurally incapable due to rampant tax evasion and corruption of following through upon.

Why wouldn't you pay with a deflationary currency? You still need to pay for housing, food, transportation, medical care, etc., and you're not going to stop just because your money might be worth "more" next year. Deflationary currency probably prevents you from spending on (too many) frivolous items and actually thinking about buying quality items... which likely isn't a bad thing. Inflationary currency is effectively a tax on those who save -- supposedly the ones who are more responsible -- and encourages consumption (which smart people debate is a good or bad thing). Caveat: there hasn't been a deflationary widespread currency in modern times and we have no idea what will happen.
It's impossible to quantify "lost" bitcoins. There have been estimates bounced around but literally nobody truly knows. People may not know coins are lost; my buddy literally just found a hard drive with a 150 BTC wallet on it (he was happy). The network will have no way to know when a coin is lost (just because it hasn't moved for a decade or two doesn't mean it's not in a retrievable wallet).
The Dogecoin protocol will allow new coins to enter the economy forever, making it slightly less deflationary than Bitcoin and as a way to counter the lost/destroyed coin issue. Which is fine and, who knows, sometime in the future, the Bitcoin network could come to a consensus that it's better to add coins for whatever reason.

Not necessarily. It mostly depends on their total outstanding liabilities. An individual customer's funds are somewhat protected by the US Bankruptcy Code (nowhere near to the extent of some of the customers' losses, however). If a customer lost "only" two-three thousand dollars worth, s/he'll receive the same priority as tax debts (which are generally hard to get away from).
Also, bankruptcy will protect a company merely accused of CIVIL fraud. If the company or its execs are forced to pay restitution as a result of criminal prosecution, that is completely different and the company will most likely not receive protection from those debts in bankruptcy.

Yes, it seems that way. The transaction will automatically be credited back to the user on MtGox's system. 
On top of that, the network will reject transactions out of hand if they even have a satoshi that was already transmitted. When you get a large enough percentage of coins which the exchange thinks are not spent -- but actually are -- no withdrawals happen because nearly every transaction will include double-spent coins.

Not only that but Bitcoin ASIC mining is extremely specialized and only a few vendors produce the chips currently. In pure computing strength,  yes, the Bitcoin computing power is 256X the top 500 supercomputers; but since much of that strength is designed JUST FOR the the Bitcoin network, it's probably much more than 256X stronger in practical terms.
If the government WERE to try to get a huge number of ASIC mining rigs online to bruteforce the network: 1) it'll have to take a LOT shorter time than the normal government procurement process; 2) if they worked quickly and went to the "normal" vendors to get the necessary amount ASICs, people will immediately realize something is up as an already-tight supply will disappear completely overnight.

Is it possible that MtGox's wallet is so badly corrupted with coins it thinks are not spent -- but actually are -- that much of its holdings are for all intensive purposes frozen (i.e., already-spent coins are intermingled in a large portion of their wallet's addresses, making it impossible to transact from those addresses, too)?

If the government simply seized Gox's private keys, they'd have no way of knowing the copies they have were the ONLY copies and they could end up losing the funds.

Exactly. Let's consider gold. The only reason it's worth as much as it is is because so little of it is in actual circulation. If suddenly holders of 50% -- or even 5% -- of the world's gold decide to sell tomorrow, the price will absolutely collapse. The reason gold is valuable is because so few people want to sell it. Saying that there $X amount of value in the world's gold is a bit inaccurate because the only reason there's that much value is because a tiny percentage of it is ever actually being transacted.

@_date: 2014-02-21 20:30:52
Not really. There is SOME luck involved.
As I understand, MtGox posted its transaction data publicly as soon as it was broadcast. Say the attacker withdrew X.12344321 BTC. The attacker's bot continuously swept MtGox's data for a transaction with that output, and immediately transmits a new transaction with a different transaction ID. Only one of two will be confirmed. 
I don't know how exactly the attacker could make it more likely that HIS transaction will be confirmed but I'm sure there are ways. The person below speculated having access to a mining pool could do it.
Instead of submitting a ticket to MtGox complaining about an unconfirmed transaction, the attacker just waits for the automatic credit.

Having such a hostile attitude to other peoples' viewpoints is not helpful to growing Bitcoin's acceptance. It is not helpful for taking on the banks' hegemony.

Do you work for MtGox? This is pretty much a TL;DR version of their BS press release.
Bitcoin doesn't have to change crap. MtGox has poor code that allowed attackers to take advantage of a "flaw" that was known for years and for which there is a completely viable workaround. MtGox execs were too busy counting their money rather than updating their code, perhaps thinking it was impossible for a large scale attack using the flaw. That is their incompetence.

I am unsure of how the bankruptcy process works in Japan, however I have extensive experience with US bankruptcy.
This is going to be a very contested bankruptcy proceeding. MtGox will have to prove to the satisfaction of the court that: a) its restructuring is feasible; b) that it is not hiding any assets; and c) its creditors are being treated in accordance with bankruptcy law. The company and its managers can go to prison if they're willfully hiding assets from the bankruptcy court.

It is a US-licensed NY-based broker/dealer that specializes in secondary transactions that are tough to value (see  for more info). 
Barry Silbert of SM has been interested in Bitcoin for a while now and started the Bitcoin Investment Trust in the latter part of 2013 for high net worth "accredited investors" (it's easier to get government approval for things if your customers are rich). Using investors' fiat, the Trust has purchased about 70,000 BTC I believe to date.
I don't know how many complaints have been filed against SM's license over the years but such things are public record if serious enough. Generally, I would say it has a good reputation for a broker/dealer.
SecondMarket has the banking relationships and the necessary license to potentially start a US-based exchange.

Terrible idea. 
Who would determine which coins should be blacklisted? Network consensus? What if the network makes a mistake? How does an innocent person with frozen coins "prove" that he isn't who the network thinks he is?
How far back can coins be blacklisted? A day? A week? A month? What if during that period coins were thrown into a mixer and dispersed throughout the economy and suddenly 1000s of people have a little bit of "bad" coins? All of the "clean" coins in their addresses could be frozen, too, since they won't be able to do a proper output.

We have no idea of MtGox's expenses or how much its shareholders have been pulling out of it as dividends over the past 3.5 years. That office in downtown Tokyo ain't cheap and who knows how much they've been shelling out to lawyers lately (it seems like the seizure in May 2013 was related to Silk Road; lawyer bills will be astronomical if they're fending off a criminal indictment for drug trafficking).
Yes, MtGox has raked in a TON of bitcoins since it started as a BTC exchange. But, remember, for most of that period, a single bitcoin wasn't really worth that much. It had $5MM (most likely customer money) seized by the feds which was reimbursed.
Honestly, insolvency probably isn't THAT unreasonable to assume as the base reason for its current troubles. It is very suspicious that yen withdrawals are no longer happening and they're taking many days longer than the other exchanges to get BTC withdrawals working again.

Eh, it's not JUST Bitcoin companies. While I do think banks have a negative outlook to Bitcoin generally (somebody smart in the bank's corporate chain of command knows auditable decentralized ledgers can and probably will kill them some day), federal regulations over the past decade have made it extremely onerous for banks to work with any MSB companies, regardless of the strength of their KYC policies. 
Essentially, if a bank's MSB customer makes a mistake and allows a narcoterrorist to use its services, the bank can get in regulatory trouble for having poor internal controls. Which essentially means banks need to spend the resources to closely monitor the activities of their MSB customers. And most banks simply don't want to.

The bankruptcy court in Japan will hopefully conduct a thorough review of the company's finances before proceeding with any rehabilitation/restructuring or liquidation. Gox's customer-creditors will have their say against the company in court.
On top of that, both Japanese and American authorities have indicated they are going to investigate what happened at Gox. If there was criminal-level negligence or malfeasance, it will hopefully be prosecuted.
Lest we forget, pirateat40 headed up an (alleged) Ponzi scheme using Bitcoin in 2012. The feds are currently prosecuting him for fraud (he lost a motion to dismiss on the novel theory that bitcoin can't legally be considered money).

It's totally relevant. MtGox is pointing, saying "look, all the other exchanges are having problems with this issue". Which is, at best, a misrepresentation. The DDoS against Stamp and BTC-e was an attack that did not exist until AFTER MtGox claimed "malleability" was the reason it was shutting down BTC withdrawals... which means whatever MtGox has been suffering from was something unrelated to the DDoS attack the other exchanges dealt with.
"Malleability" comes in a multitude of forms and it's been worked on by the Bitcoin devs for years. There are easy workarounds to ANY form of malleability MtGox could have coded to make sure it wasn't a victim it like, for instance, check to make sure bitcoins actually went to the withdrawal addresses they were supposed to go to before crediting a user's account. Other exchanges and services did that; MtGox didn't do that and is now having the fucking gall to blame the protocol for its own incompetence.
Anyways, Mr. Karpeles has been all over the fucking map this past week. He continues to blame the protocol for MtGox's problems while at the same time admitting (in an interview last week) that MtGox's engineering team missed an update.

Main takeaway: these incumbent companies are only looking at what the tech can do TODAY, without taking into account innovations on top of the protocol that can add stability/protection/etc. for merchants/consumers.

Bitcoin is too slow for most brick-and-mortar transactions right now, yes. It's fine for sit-down restaurants and online purchases, however, where waiting a couple minutes is not a problem.
You have to remember that even though CC transactions SEEM nearly instantaneous to the consumer, they really aren't.
However, much of the focus right now on the merchant-side is creating mechanisms to allow for nearly instantaneous confirmation that the coins aren't being double spent. Waiting a few seconds is sufficient time to verify without needing to wait for another block.
Regarding consumer protection, that is true. The Bitcoin protocol does allow for escrowed transactions which should be instituted to protect consumers.

Japan has a treaty obligation to assist in US money laundering investigations.

It could take months/years for legalities to be worked out for Japan to actually do anything substantive but the US seizure was 9 months ago and who knows how long the US has been going through the Japanese procedures.
Edit: the May 2013 seizure used money transmission violations as a pretext; the seizure was a result of a Silk Road money laundering investigation.

Yes. There was a proposal a few weeks ago to do exactly that. Instead of a reward being awarded every ~10 min, the reward will be done such that 25 BTC are awarded over ~10 min. (There were other elements to the proposal; oddly enough, changing how mining works was almost a side effect to those other elements [which included vastly increasing the number of transactions/second], not the goal.)
It would require a hard fork in the blockchain, however, which would require the vast majority of miners to sign off on before it happens. However, individual miners should be able to see the benefit to no longer relying on pools.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:38:34
In response to your first edit: at this point, yes, BTC today is far more useful as a payment processing method, NOT a currency. It is simply too volatile at the moment to be used as a currency for the exact problem you're noting.
As such, if the customer chooses not to purchase BTC price protection, it still makes sense for your company to accept in BTC and return in USD.
However, I think your company should look at the benefits of the payment processor option (at least for now). How much does your company pay to Visa, MasterCard, AmEx and Discover in processing fees? You can cut that by 75% by using BitPay or CoinBase.

Does he even know what is actually going on in his own accounts? If -- IF -- what twobitidiot says is true, MtGox may have never done a proper audit between what it holds in its wallets and what it owes customers.
If it has been a fractional reserve for years (as Kraken CEO theorized) and has been trying to replenish their reserves through fees/self-dealing/arbitrage, then there would have been no real point to even doing an audit because the numbers would always be off and the ratio would be constantly changing. On top of that, it is actually conceivable that a "hot wallet leak" would go unnoticed for a long period of time as no one was actually paying attention to the numbers.
They needed an accounting firm that specialized in fractional reserve banks to actually keep track of this crap during these years instead of MK looking at the hot wallet and going "hmm, time to go to my safe deposit box".

I wouldn't do that. For one thing, banks don't really like other financial or quasi-financial companies piggy-backing on their KYC protocols.
Debit card transactions can be reversed while BTC transactions cannot. You would risk bankruptcy if, say, victims' debit cards of the recent Target hack were used at your ATMs (assuming the victims' banks didn't cancel the cards fast enough). If enough questionable/reversed transactions occurred at your ATMs, Visa/MasterCard/STAR/etc. may also choose to simply stop allowing transactions through your ATMs.
Edit: I'm not saying it's not possible. It most likely is. But there are hurdles and risks (duh).

If he can't make a legitimate non-speculative argument for *any* financial harm, then a court will strike down the provision.
That said, it is a *brilliant* strategy by him to make a quick buck. A $25K dispute is not enough to go to court over for any company actually going through the time/expense to file a patent application. Even if they could get the provision declared unenforceable, it'll cost them far more than $25K.

It's not their website, unfortunately; it's *your* wallet, which is decrypted and running completely in your browser. I don't think BC.info actually has access to anything in your wallet in a form that can be read by BC.info (probably an attempt to completely avoid financial regulation issues and to make the claim the company has "no access" to your wallet). The problem, however, is that a bug in the wallet software running in your browser which causes user losses can't be properly audited.
When a white-hat attacker managed to scrub a lot of bitcoins from an improperly coded wallet software update a few months back, BC.info couldn't confirm which of their users actually lost money without information from the affected users.

Eh, it's arguable that Bitcoin, etc, violate current CA law. As the article says, state law currently states:


Bitcoin isn't "issued" or "circulated" by anybody, technically. There are companies that process Bitcoin payments for merchants and there are exchanges that allow people to exchange fiat for Bitcoin. An argument CAN be made that Bitcoin miners are "issuing" new currency but simply using or facilitating the use of the currency in commerce is not "circulating" as that term is generally understood to mean.
I think this amendment is meant to protect Facebook, Apple, etc. when they issue/regulate their own private currency rather than Bitcoin, per se. (Of course, it will provide less uncertainty to the Bitcoin industry as a side effect.)

OP's headline is horribly inaccurate. Ripple Labs, Inc. did *not* freeze funds due to its control of the Ripple Network. RL convinced a partner, Bitstamp Ltd, to freeze its IOUs of a customer whom RL has a problem with. Big difference. To be sure, from what has been publicized, I believe Bitstamp had no right to freeze Jed's funds based on RL's demand that it do so.
At least one person below has claimed that RL had the right to attempt to freeze funds if Jed breached the contract. I'm not sure where these people got that idea: that was not alleged in Bitstamp's interpleader action nor in the RL blog post that announced the Jed-RL agreement back in August. Even if it was, Bitstamp would still have no right to freeze Jed's funds based on a mere allegation from RL that Jed breached a contract as that's a clear violation by Bitstamp of Bitstamp's Terms of Service.

Exactly. I have seen a FEW articles in the economic press that understand BTC, as well as understand the structural weaknesses of the protocol, which I believe are its greatest danger. There simply isn't that much growth possible if the protocol is incapable of breaking past 7 transactions/second (and the only current way to increase that amount could easily break the entire system; a near-revolutionary fix needs to be implemented).
Most articles focus on meaningless stuff like: "it's just computer bits!" (WTF do you think your precious dollar is?); "it's only used for drugs!" (well, it's not... and if it was, so what?); and "it has no intrinsic value" (what does that EVEN MEAN?).

Point of story: if you have some "eff you" money you want to buy BTC with, just buy it whenever the eff you feel like, don't wait for the price to become "affordable". Go into it thinking you'll never get your money back, ever; that makes buying it at any price easier.

In a way, this is not surprising. While China COULD have chosen to dominate the BTC market, using the might of its adoption to essentially undercut the Western financial system in the process, such a theoretical benefit does not outweigh the obvious risk to its system. 
Remember, China has some crazy capital controls in place; it's nearly impossible to get any substantial sum of money out of there legally. BTC made it possible for massive amounts of wealth to leave the country in a blink of an eye. China has been encouraging domestic saving for decades now, in no way does it want those savings to disappear.

Get them into a paper wallet. You have to be careful with paper wallets; make sure if your paper wallet is stolen, just reading it will not give the thief access to your coins (i.e., include some randomization elements only you would know how to decipher). I would say not to use pass phrases, as well; only use private keys generated on a computer disconnected from the Internet.
Also, when I say paper, I don't mean "paper". Get it etched into some metal, stone or (at the very least) plastic with multiple copies. Keep one or two for yourself, give another to a (very) trusted friend or family member, and place others in safe deposit boxes in two different banks (preferably in different cities).

There are several problems with BTC which people in the sub understand but which rarely come up anywhere else:
*the extremely limited transactions per second. If this isn't fixed, or enough nodes resist the fix, then transaction prices may skyrocket, destroying the strongest selling point
*whether miners will be properly incented to continue mining once the reward drops to 12.5 BTC. This also has to do with the transaction fee structure and number of transactions per second.
*the number of coins being sat on by the early adopters -- Satoshi included. Whether or not they're trustworthy is besides the point; BTC needs to be more distributed for this project to work.
The arguments that are otherwise brought against it are largely baseless. It's not a Ponzi scheme for multiple reasons; "intrinsic value" has no intrinsic meaning.

This doesn't seem right. You weren't in breach as you did everything you were required to. The major delay involved a bank you had zero contractual relations with and couldn't interact directly with.

Welp, if Google Translate offers at all an accurate translation of that article... that's definitely not good news coming out of China for BTC. First the banks were told not to directly engage in BTC (which still potentially left the door open for a BitPay-type business to emerge) and now the payment processors are being told not to (which essentially means no BitPay type business can emerge).
While the notice from a couple weeks ago provided a regulatory pathway for China-based exchanges, how long before BTC China is forced to close simply because it's impossible to get yuan in?

People do get paid wages in BTC. Not many, though. Coinbase emps have the option of being paid in BTC, presumably converted post-tax earnings, and so do Internet Archive emps (at least a portion). Until more things are payable in BTC - especially rent - then it'll be hard to convince most people to take BTC as wages.

If you don't have an address, I hate to be harsh but... good luck. Every "legitimate" exchange has to comply with anti-money laundering guidelines if they want to stay open. AML customer identification programs MUST include a current verifiable address.
On top of that, you also unfortunately live in a jurisdiction that is considered "high risk" by the FATF. Compliance will likely not want to add a customer from a FATF "high risk" jurisdiction.
I know, it sucks. But do you think AML laws were created to HELP people in 3rd World countries? Ha!

Okay, the FinCEN director mentioned this word soup yesterday about how other countries are also interested in regulating.
Look, it's not the AML, taxation, etc., stuff that we care about here in the states (though that causes problems on the banking side, unfortunately). It's the state money transmission laws. Getting 48 licenses is just simply way too big of a burden for startup companies; ironically, the only companies exempt from these burdensome regulations are the EXACT entities Bitcoin is trying to get away from -- banks and licensed brokers/dealers.

Duh. BTC prices will go through absolutely wild fluctuations, especially when: 1) it's in the news (positive or negative); 2) a government announces some sort of regulatory regime for it (happening more often these days); and/or 3) when one of the relatively few whales sells out. Or for a variety of other reasons.
WHICH IS COMPLETELY OKAY. We may be in the middle of a "bubble". Others have happened in BTC's life and... who cares? Nobody here expects the recent gains to be "permanent"; we're just sort of in awe and wondering how far up it'll go before it drops again.

If the Chinese government cracks down on the BTC China OR if it allows for vastly more capital flows out of the country, Bitcoin is in for a serious shock. Much of the recent surge in prices is due to Chinese demand, possibly from the rich attempting to launder their money out of the country without going to casinos in Macau.
Fortunately for BTC, the Chinese government seems uninterested in cracking down (and even seems to be embracing the protocol) and may even view it as a useful way to keep track of capital flows out of the country (if it's going to happen, might as well know about it).

I don't consider BTC to be the "first-mover" in this space. There have been multiple attempts to create a viable Internet currency but all had one extremely fatal flaw: centralization. BTC is only the first to be completely decentralized.
I'd say BTC is like Google and, say, e-Gold was like AltaVista in this space. Could something come around and kill BTC? Most definitely. But BTC has properties that make it revolutionary when compared to previous digital currencies; everything that's come after are merely building upon the path BTC blazed.

Totally agree. There is NO effective way for Americans to get BTC today. Unless, of course, you're rich... then you can just wire $500K to SecondMarket and they'll do everything for you.
Everyday American consumers have to choose between a CoinBase that can be inconsistent, exchanges in foreign jurisdictions (some with not the best track records), or meeting somebody at Starbucks. There are other options such as Coinsetter but it's just getting started (and God knows how long its mystery bank will keep on working with it).

The important takeaway from that is that it will be impossible to get **new** funds into the exchanges. The money currently in the exchanges is extremely tiny, relatively speaking, barely a speck in China's economy or savings.
The risk they're looking at is when China's rich class and growing middle class figure out how to get their savings into BTC and out of the country. Right now, the only way to do so is through heavily regulated channels (i.e., expensive) or money laundering through Macau casinos (i.e., even more expensive).
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:18:30
Are you sure the IRS will take that view? So far, two federal agencies have chimed in on Bitcoin: neither have called it currency. FinCEN created a new category out of thin air and the FEC is proposing to treat it as an "in kind" asset donation, similar to stocks.
It makes the MOST sense at this point to treat XBT as a security or commodity, regulated by the SEC/CFTC and the SROs. At that point, long-term capital gains rates should apply if held more than a year. Of course, whether the IRS goes along with whatever the SEC/CFTC comes up with is an open question.

It's probably not your bank making this call. The vast majority of banks at this country "bank" at the mega-banks -- Wells Fargo, Chase, BofA, Citi, etc. -- and this includes banks with a few branches to larger regional banks spread across multiple states. Your bank was nothing more than a pooled account at a mega-bank with consumer banking services on top of it.
When the mega-banks tell their enslaved lesser banks to do something, you can be sure those lesser banks will do it in no time flat. Losing their pooled account (along with all of the other services the mega-bank provides like ACH, Fed wire access, etc.) will just simply be catastrophic.

There is more to the DHS action than just the warrant. The warrant was just going after low-hanging fruit, so to speak: actions so blatantly in violation of the country's money transmission laws that the DHS did not have to make a detailed showing to a judge to get the warrant. We do not know how long the DHS has been investigating. The confidential informant could have done his deed last year for all we know.
It has been known for some time that Mt.Gox was facing regulatory pressures. The WHOLE point of the CoinLab deal was to find a way out of their regulatory mess in the States... it could have even been strongly suggested by DHS that Mt.Gox take that route. It can't be just coincidence that these DHS warrants were issued days after the CoinLab very publicly fell apart.
I do agree that the warrant has nothing to do with bitcoin directly. Every government is worried that a completely unregulated bitcoin is a godsend for money laundering and terrorist financing (they have a point); to live in the fantasy that bitcoin can survive unregulated for any length of time once governments start targeting choke points that don't follow their financial regulations is a fantasy. This warrant proves that.

A "zero trust" publicly-available decentralized ledger in which it is extremely difficult to erase past entries has the potential to revolutionize multiple areas of today's society we associate with private corporate or government activities. 
Imagine being able to record real property transactions not in your county recorder's office but in a blockchain... for a fraction of the cost. In fact, this can go for ANY property transaction where an auditable proof of ownership is a necessity. Instead of wading through a government bureaucracy to get the needed documents -- in which each governmental agency has a different method of storing similar information -- you can simply query the blockchain.
Remember, finance is simply a ledger of information. Ledgers before the blockchain were controlled by companies and governments, who kept information -- especially information people required for business/life -- behind a bureaucracy and/or paywall. I don't think we've ever before seen a truly trust-less decentralized auditable ledger and I don't think we can imagine the impact.

"Get a money transmitter license"
This is REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY difficult. It's not one license that's good for the entire country; nearly every state has money transmission laws and require their own licensing, bonding, etc., and a biz can't legally do business in a state without an MT license for that state.
It is atrociously difficult to get licensed in California. California rejected Facebook the first time it applied (whatever you may think of Facebook, that's just ridiculous) and has been sitting on Intuit's application for 8 months.
MT licenses are a sham, especially since the Internet makes it easy to get customers EVERYWHERE, not just in your locality. Most states have remarkably similar laws, a standard Visa/MC lobbyists got passed by lining the pockets of... er, providing generous campaign contributions to... legislators in order to prevent effective competition to their monopoly (they learned their lesson from PayPal). It's a crime to engage in money transmission without a license in a state -- even if your business is not located in that state -- which means, at the very least, the business will receive a very threatening cease and desist letter from the regulators.

All of the different permutations of the use of "bitcoin" that can be trademarked make it inefficient for one person or group to attempt to apply for all of them
Also, some people may have narrow / legitimate trademark applications using the word "bitcoin" that could be harmed by an overzealous attempt to trademark everything as broadly as possible. 
In essence, it's better (and cheaper) to just keep an eye on the Register and challenge inappropriately broad or illegitimate applications.

Eh, the regulations surrounding MSBs in the USA are actually quite onerous. If you're transmitting money -- which is vaguely defined -- you have to get a license for every state you have business operations OR customers. Each application has different requirements. In CA, for example, your company needs to essentially have $1,000,000 in the bank, a $1,000,000 (or more) surety bond, among other crazy requirements.
On top of that, it's extremely difficult to find a US bank that'll work with an MSB. And you need a bank before you apply for an MT license... but any banks working with MSBs would prefer you have a license first.

The amount of trust this community provides to pseudonyms on the Internet who say the rights things is the disturbing thing here. A flashy website, a hesitancy to provide basic information like a verifiable business address or a real name, "guaranteed" returns, etc., are surefire hallmarks of a scam; however, bitcoiners have lost countless coins by trusting these exact sorts of people.
Remember, this is (so far) a largely unregulated marketplace. Regulations -- whether enforced by the government or a trade group -- exist for this exact reason. It's impossible for most people to verify the person with whom they're doing business is trustworthy (and even with regulation that's a tough prospect, but at least an injured person will have some recourse). Sure the "community" may trust a person because he has a months-long track record of trust but that doesn't prevent the person from simply walking off one day.
The safest thing to EVER do, even if/when the Bitcoin market is regulated: trust only yourself to protect your coins.

Interesting concept. 
But no state agency currently recognizes anything "filed" in the Bitcoin blockchain as "proof" of anything (other than maybe a transaction involving bitcoins). 
Also, there is no such thing as a "stateless" corporation. As of right now, corporations and other limited liability entities exist ONLY within a legal framework defined by a state.
Ergo, you do not have the state-sanctioned protections of an incorporated entity. All you have are some words embedded in the blockchain.
To be sure, this is great as a concept. It is what governments all over the world will learn to fear the MOST about Bitcoin (wait, I can record necessary documentation concerning the transfer of property that is 100% auditable without having to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to the state?)

Importing other trading books is not unique. Nearly all exchanges have done it, especially when they were just getting started to provide at least the semblance of liquidity. It's tough to attract customers when you have .01 XBT available for sale.

Not going to happen. Just beyond the technical aspect of it, if the miners can show that they can join together and deny certain transactions that they as a group don't approve of, that will be quite frankly terrifying. 
It will seriously undermine any sort of trust people have traced in the currency and trust is the only thing that gives Bitcoin its value.

I wonder how many BTC are lost forever... 
So many were mined when it was literally funny money, worth a few cents at most. Who bought thousands for $15-20 back in 2010 and threw out the computer the wallet was on a few months later without thinking? I would guess more than quite a few people (they probably hate themselves now). On top of that, wallet passwords get lost/forgotten, paper wallets aren't properly taken care of, coins are accidentally sent to incorrect addresses and lost in the void, etc.

Your logic has flaws:
1) it's only BitPay. We have no idea how other payment services did on that day, nor do we have any idea how many people directly accepted BTC without going through a payment service. Regardless, ANY payment service transferring .005% of the total value of an economy in a day is having a great day.
2) Bitcoin's market cap does not mean what you seem to think it means and so is an irrelevant point of reference
3) a 6000+% increase from a year ago is extremely fucking good, a point which you seem to be missing.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:07:24
Yeah, to put that in perspective, another 6000% increase in Nov 2014 will be approximately 360,000 transactions... which is sort of starting to mean something. Unfortunately, that means BitPay alone will be handling approximately 50% of the total BTC network bandwidth (assuming it stays at 7 transactions/second).

At the end of November 2010, if you could find a seller (which was hard in those days), you could buy 1 BTC for two shiny quarters. For those that are (really really) bad at math, that's a 2000X increase in three years, through multiple crashes, relatively long periods of static movement, etc.
With my less than 10 BTC, I would be... happy if it increases another 2000X by Nov 2016.
Chances of that happening? Meh. Likely close to zero. But I have already considered the amount I "invested" to have been burned in my BBQ.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:52:28
I'm sort of curious where the floor to this correction/crash will be. Most of the frothiness in the market since the beginning of November can be traced to Chinese "investors" hoping to get rich quick. There was zero infrastructure in place to support a BTC economy and little to no chance one was going to be built without explicit approval from the government... which was always unlikely.
If this eliminates another nexus of volatility, great!

He may be wrong (he has been wrong about many things). Or he may be right (he has been right about many things). There are many other economists and financial experts who disagree with him. Don't put him on some sort of special pedestal.

What? The Fed is NOTHING like Chase or Wells Fargo. I can't go to the Fed to open an account.
It's "privately owned" only in that it is "owed" by its member institutions. It is managed by presidential appointees, however, and the federal government has control over who gets to be a member of the Fed through the FDIC.

I used to live by a Whole Foods. Yes, prices for many of their things are atrociously high; I stayed away from their prepared goods ($9/pound for salad? What?) for this reason. However, their 365 branded goods are generally very good quality and affordable.
Edit: if you go there only occasionally, you will suffer from sticker shock and you will hate it (which is understandable). However, I went there 2-3 times/week purely out of convenience and was soon able to learn how to buy there.

He called bitcoin nothing more than digits on a computer server. Um...isn't that where the vast majority of fiat currency resides? You send a check to someone, when he deposits it, digits are changed in your bank, his bank and in the central bank databases (assuming it was different commercial banks).
The fiat currency network operates with consensus, with the central banks possessing the only keys to the master ledger and maintaining it in secrecy. The major difference with bitcoin is that its ledger is public and distributed. There is no inherent reason why you would trust the central banks to maintain the ledger fairly -- they have a poor track record of doing so, after all.

What do you want exactly to instill you with confidence? A 1,000,000% increase in transactions for a company that's a little over a year old?
Also, lackluster Black Friday sales according to whom exactly? You? With your marvelous analysis of ONE METRIC? BitPay is not the only BTC payment processor; we have no idea how CoinBase did. Nor do we have any idea on how many BTC were transacted purely p2p without any payment processor in the middle.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:02:51
I'm genuinely curious: How will the bank cover its risk if it has a fractional reserve of BTC? Who will insure the bank against losses? 
The bank can't go to any central reserve as a back-up if/when there's a run on BTC since there can't be any "new" BTC to bail it out... unless there's an entity out there that possesses a substantial portion of BTC in existence and is willing to take on that role. In that case, what's the upside for that entity?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:17:29
Well, yeah. Not quitting your day jobs UNLESS you can afford to is always a great idea. "Wealth" in a volatile relatively illiquid asset like BTC can be extremely illusory.

The US government does not -- NOT -- have any constitutional ability to directly restrict currencies used within America's borders. It can appoint a currency (or currencies) to be legal tender but that essentially means you must pay federal taxes in that currency (and it just becomes easier for everything else to be paid in that currency, too).
The US has taken down previous currencies by aiming counterfeiting and money transmission laws against them.
