The only items restricted are listed above, with regards to drugs we believe that every human being has the right to choose what they do to or put into their own body so we do not restrict vendors offering substances that are maybe deemed illegal in some jurisdictions. If our users do not wish to have access to these sections of the marketplace there is an option to opt-out.
Accessories for firearms are acceptable, what we do not allow is the sale of either the projectile or any item that would fire a projectile using an explosive charge.
If a buyer or seller wishes to break any of their local laws, that is their decision and not something we would ever police.

That is why we are waiting for any major developments and increase in volume etc on the relevant exchanges before we commit to integrating further options.
The vendors can ultimately decide which currencies they will accept for each listing. However we won't add just any random currency.

Huge = tldr or its a positive reaction.
Hopefully the latter

There is already BitBay however its not overly successful, we do have an auction module being prepared for future release but it would only receive negative comments from vendors in the early days after our launch whilst we are building a core userbase due to listings receiving too little bids or not making their reserves. So we are not going to rush the release of that module until we believe traffic is sufficient to sustain such listings.
With regards to separating ourselves from Silkroad, whilst some aspects are similar we have strong beliefs that we have improved on those aspects for both the buyers and the vendors and many other aspects of the website vastly differ to what is currently available for crypto-coin users.
We have also taken steps to help increase accessibility to the site for those people who are less tech minded than the average crypto user. Hopefully this will help increase adoption which also benefits the entire economy.
We have no wish to offend anyone and everyone is entitled to an opinion on any subject matter.

Yes there is a list of restricted items. We are not solely based on the contraband market, the best way to describe The FreeMarket is an amalgamation of SilkRoad, Freelancer.com, LocalBitcoins and a few others. Hopefully people will agree that we have made improvements to each of the existing platforms.

It will be a little like ebay (when we activate the auction module), silkroad, freelancer.com, localbitcoins all rolled into one package with additional functionality.
We will be posting in all the relevant subreddits soon enough however we were just wanting to gauge interest and gain feedback.
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:29:22
It maybe only talk, however to gauge a wider range of feedback and by allowing user input, we can adjust the website prior to launch which will positively impact on the user experience.

A list of 5 areas that we do not wish to allow on our marketplace is not that many in reality.
We have already covered firearms in other comments.
Weapons of Mass Destruction, is a not something any sane person would want to obtain.
Chemical Weapons are just plain nasty.(would you want to be on the receiving end?)
People who want childporn are more welcome to hang from a tree than on our website.
The restrictions will be subject to review before launch, nothing is 100% final yet.

If we could viably ensure/trust that the buyer would use the firearm/gun for something other than bringing harm to another human being then we would not restrict this type of item, however it would be impossible for us to do so, hence the restriction. Its not an issue with the gun/firearm itself.

We can add other crypto-currencies easily at the time the final decision was made TRC had come to standstill, we are actively watching to see how this develops to ensure no further problems occur on that network, we are also waiting to see how FTC develops over the coming weeks/months.
We can implement any coin, ultimately the vendors still have the opportunity to choose which currencies they wish to accept.

Thanks, keep an eye out for future updates.

Thank you for the good luck wishes, agreed it is not the gun that is the danger, it is the person behind it who pulls the trigger so the sale should be made following a structured decision process (of which we cannot guarantee).
