i'm not sure i feel the same...."be greedy when others are fearful" :)

ugh...that sucks. the sanctions have been in place since 2014 ([see here]( so it is likely this is in response to someone knocking on ChangeTip's door recently. Perhaps all accounts are under scrutiny...

Pretty sure that, by posting this on twitter right now, his bid will wind up being above market tomorrow...

where's the 50x leverage? here i am trading 20x like a sucka...

i used to CPU mine, youngster :P
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:31:55
lol...could be
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:26:05
he knew they were drug money bitcoins. him knowing that they were makes it money laundering IIRC.
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:03:49
i would actually love to know as well...it's a legit question
@_date: 2014-11-14 05:48:25
Fantastic. Wasn't expecting the 'this is gentlemen' at the end. totally lost it at that point...
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:40:46
did they ever publish a list of what all the bids were?
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:48:58
how do you get these graded? i have a bunch of 1btc and some 25btc ones. all are the original run with the misprint. i know nothing about coin collecting. do i just take them to a coin shop and have them do it for me? what do i even search for/ask?
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:23:48
and a corollary to that: investments are high risk, be prepared to lose your entire principal
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:16:17
lol...inside ask at 1337 now...bunch of jokers...
@_date: 2017-02-25 04:55:24


i was around for this too. we all talked about how paypal charges $0.30 + % (or whatever) and how that will never work for developing countries and how this new bitcoin thing was going to make such transactions cost $0.01 each. but, whatever....
anyhow, getting back to the pizza, you are right on point. Bitcoin had no value. You could start the reference client and it had a cpu miner built in that would spit out 50 bitcoins every once in a while. Literally worthless stuff, just bytes on a computer. 1BTC = 1USD was the moon! I remember, shortly after the pizza, there was a glitch at one of the early exchanges (i think it was bitcoin-market or bitcoin-central, i forget the name now) and some 'poor sap' wound up getting his buy order filled at $0.93-ish when the trading range was $0.05-0.10. The exchange rolled back his transaction to great fanfare. Silly to think about in hindsight.
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:15:28
i guess none of us had basic knowledge then...sorry
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:33:06
doesnt really matter to him. by that point he was probably up 50000%...
@_date: 2014-10-25 02:49:34
fee page too complicated. if i can't understand it, i'm probably getting screwed :) seriously, tldr...shorten that up
@_date: 2016-01-25 20:25:56
That said, who else would you have other than the people who know the business best? Would you hire me and you to run the FDA? People would be dying in a week...lol
@_date: 2016-03-14 02:09:56
A few things:
1) an ios app only product? what?
2) 1% fee, paid monthly...is that 1% per month or 1% annual (so monthly would be 1/12 of that)
3) what happens when btc changes value
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:34:52
why not a web app though? this does not seem like a thing that i would urgently need on mobile while out and about.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:33:41
the thing that you linked is not that. its the period on the chart...and the chart shows daily blocksize since dec 2015. If you want just the last two weeks, it's 960/998k
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:45:12
i used to think that correcting people and giving them facts is helpful and good. over the years i've realized that people have to come to their own conclusions. Correcting/informing them is just wasting your time.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:14:55
dude...you know what i'm shooting at...give the other side something and things will work out...
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:34:53
at this point i'm hoping for an ETH/ETC style hard fork. BU one way, Core the other way. Then we can all move on.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:49:58
ok...then we stay where we are...i would bet money that segwit wont happen this year
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:26:56
lol...are you seriously taking the average over the last YEAR?
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:00:50
ok..i deleted my comment.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:51:06
patience is great...but we have a problem currently of full blocks...something has to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:49:32
you know it's not about the size but the mechanism....you also should already be aware that it's no longer about the technical aspect but about the compromise...i really don't see how else segwit is going to happen in 2017...
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:15:23
cmon...progress is better than stalemate
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:25:24
would you be ok with segwit not activating for the next year+? because i dont think it will with the current environment...and that sux
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:18:01
he hasnt done anything lately...did you really miss the point?
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:06:07
I disagree...but what to do...
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:05:12
Sorry dude....not trying to troll...see reply to your comment. Summarizes my view of it. However, in the short term, 2MB is quite reasonable.
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:02:34
It's not my preferred implementation to get the result. I, like others, feel that the block size change is a technically simpler fix and that the arguments against it don't hold water. Also, i believe there is some conflict now in the community over the target usage of bitcoin. Back in 2010 when i started working on bitcoin, the prevalent vision was the payment network, not the settlement layer that people are talking about now. Maybe it was all pie-in-the-sky stuff, but i'm actually somewhat sad that the project is taking this direction. Or maybe i'm getting old and sentimental...
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:47:50
i dunno, Gavin Andresen had a pretty strong technical grasp of it and he got nowhere. Roger seems to have the fortitude to take beatings regularly from all sides.
@_date: 2016-12-01 11:53:41
you know, people used to say "bitcoin -&gt; clown"...
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:13:10
A bunch of us want bigger blocks. Roger, for better or worse, is representing us. He's not perfect, but it is what we have
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:30:43
oh, i see now. we are talking about two different things...i was talking about the overall cryptocurrency market cap, at top of the page. The alts add $700m on aug 1
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:00:15
huh? i just clicked it again and it shows the number above ($4.7B). It was a cut/paste when i put it in. How are you seeing differently? odd...
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:12:31
website is down. trading api still active. ddos?
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:19:24
yes, of course. small amounts. Since OP was talking about arbitrage i was assuming large volumes ($1M+), which is not possible
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:38:51
nobody can exchange bolivars-&gt;dollars at official rate. only select providers of core goods in venezuela...i checked already :)
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:57:17
i'm going to hijack your comment to state: the best way to fight is to ignore!!!! The fact that this post is top on r/bitcoin right now is winning it for the spammer! any pr is good pr. even fuck you messages...
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:17:53
not individuals...companies that import essential goods, like toilet paper, food, etc. In effect, yes, the government is subsidizing them (perhaps to keep appearance of currency stability)
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:02:36
who is behind onebit? names... background...
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:34:08
why wouldn't they, if you are in a jurisdiction that has legal gambling? or is this issue more complicated than that?
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:43:27
well, it is already all bitcoin, but i guess i could send it over to bitmex and 100x leverage it for more coins?
@_date: 2015-11-24 14:49:28
i think that was sarcasm. don't downvote ppl!
@_date: 2015-10-25 05:43:10
I helped take out the bearwhale! I was there! :)
@_date: 2015-10-19 02:15:32
it's not just him. his might be the most 'advanced' case, but i have already seen some of the same stuff happen with my account/withdrawal for the last 3 weeks now.
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:05:22
fyi....transaction malleability is a non-issue. the other exchanges are dealing with it just fine. There have been no delays on the others.
And qwerty1223, why are you so quick to defend Cryptsy in this, and several other comments below?
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:06:45
who is pushing an agenda? i'm having a problem with my withdrawals and am wondering if others are having same...
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:50:17
Yea, worth a shot i guess. Will try that next if this withdraw comes back from pending.
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:41:39
Their website is horrible, but i love the idea! Tell you what, if i get my money from Cryptsy, i will send you a budgee!
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:10:20
what mechanisms do other exchanges have in place that cryptsy does not?
@_date: 2015-10-08 23:38:26
"attack is a non issue on other exchanges."
i don't have a problem withdrawing BTC elsewhere
@_date: 2015-10-27 12:15:03
isnt Gandi the registrar that Amazon Route53 uses
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:05:38
where did it say that BTC withdrawals were halted?
@_date: 2015-02-06 02:14:38
Actually, in NYC, that 180K number is kinda low for what he described. It is very common for a good software architect to make 200, 300 or more in the NYC financial sector, with all the perks he mentioned.
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:12:30
i said "non-trivial" amounts. if i was an exchange that had a problem with my books, i would fill as many little withdrawals as i could. That way, a large number of users would perceive no problem.
btw, i could not find that tx hash on an AnonCoin explorer. maybe i messed something up? send me a link
@_date: 2015-10-25 03:19:11
it's true...that said, bitstamp/bitfinex/etc are exploding too. that is legit volume.
@_date: 2015-10-26 05:50:47
i was okay with my 8% :-)
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:39:08
Next...week? Sold 20 minutes later at $325...
