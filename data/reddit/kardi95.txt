What has this sub become ... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:51
I agree. In it’s current state, Bitcoin seems broken due to high fees and slow transaction time. It just has a popularity bonus because of mainstream media, that’s why new people invest in Bitcoin instead of altcoins.

Sorry, no begging allowed ...

The term is called bubble, because the system will pop at a specific time. A few will make huge profits and many people will loose a lot of money. This will hurt trust in BTC extremely.

Just finished it, it's quite interesting if you are new to the topic 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:15:08
But what if the price stabilizes in the future? If its volatility is low, and it's not used for transactions, doesn't that mean Bitcoin at all is pretty useless?

Sad that IQ option is just a shitty binary option broker ... tried it a few times

Die Dokumentation “Banking on Bitcoin” erklärt BTC und die Technik dahinter ganz gut. Gibt es auch in deutscher Sprache auf Netflix ����

You need to understand that there is not “the one” moon for everybody. Everybody has its own moon.

This literally screams „scaaaaaaam“

Can you post a screenshot?

Or sell your Bitcoin while you can

If you can invest over 10.000$ in mining tools and wait over a year to gain your money back then mining might be worth it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:33:01
How do you know this is not the bottom? If it is, selling will cost you money. The reality is: Nobody can tell. I know that I'm a bad trader, so i just hold.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:45
Nobody can tell. If your friends invest in BTC and it drops even more, how will your friends react when they have suddenly -20% of their money because of you?
Never give them tips when to buy. Give them hints, but research and the decision to invest should come from themselves 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:34:49
Bitcoin has to succeed? Oh hell no. There are so many coins with their own Blockchain, if governments really want to adopt the blockchain technology, they will just design their own blockchain. Don't get me wrong, I also hope that BTC will succeed, but the Blockchain- technology doesn't need Bitcoin to survive. It's the other way round.

Look at the mempool.

Don't give your friends investment tips. This can easily destroy friendships.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:23:28
When it falls to 2500$, yeah you can buy cheaper. But if it stabilizes and goes back again up, you loose even more money.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:01:54
But there is shilling all over the sub. I think this is the reason for panic selling. Positive hype everywhere and negative thoughts get downvoted. This is how beginners start to believe BTC is a bulletproof investment and when the price goes down, start panicking and sell.

You will get problems. I guarantee.

Funny. If you say "buy buy buy!!!!!!!!!!" it's okay but if you say "sell" people will bash you. This pump doesn't look healthy.
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:33:34
This is your first post. Just sayin'
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:34:59
No. The fees for one trade are already higher than your starting amount of BTC
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:23:55
30 BTC are 81.000$. Are you crazy?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:20:27
If you buy BTC with money you can't afford to loose, you are indeed an idiot.

Meh, ever heard about China ? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:58:42
You will make not even 1$ in a year. Minus the electric cost. So no.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:01:27
Nice. But... why? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:32:42
There are also people who bought at top and do whatever it takes to drive the price up. It's the same behaviour, only in the other direction. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:24:25
Where are you from?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:13:15
The one and only true answer: Nobody knows

Bist du schon bei irgendeiner Exchange verifiziert? Sofort BTC zu kaufen ist leider nicht so einfach möglich. Meistens muss man seinen Ausweis hinterlegen oder sein Bankkonto bestätigen lassen.
