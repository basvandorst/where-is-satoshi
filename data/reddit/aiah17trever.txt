So how do you do it?
@_date: 2014-10-25 03:27:47
Nice try.

@_date: 2014-12-26 16:16:02
look at the infograph, watch the video. It's pretty straight-forward.
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:29:26
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:39:04
True. However, bitcoin is not commonly SPENT, only TRADED.
@_date: 2014-11-27 04:39:49
Yeah. Coinbasee is best. PayPal may terminate ur account, as they don't want you associatibg with their competition.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:29:15
I know that, but why don't people use it to buy shit instead of just purchasing them and selling them for profit?
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:54:38
How do you tip?
@_date: 2014-12-26 16:14:46
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:48:16
Good thing nobody has donated.
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:08:33
That was so funny that I'm giving you 25 bits @_date: 2014-10-11 01:37:12
Shit... I am looking at addresses linked to this, and I am seeing thousands of btc...  This is crazy. Thanks, OP!

I'm just gonna use the tor browser... just so the NSA doesn't think that I'm a terrorist.
@_date: 2014-09-03 11:03:10
Maybe they just didn't understand bitcoin, and simply threw out the paper.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:29:03
Party like it's 1929! 100 bits
@_date: 2014-10-11 01:31:51
How do you know it's him?
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:31:05
Dafuq. How does this happen.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:19:15


how about no.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:50:34
Keep us updated, but you should provide proof. this looks like a post, so have evidence. We could crowdfund or start a petition for you, maybe set a precedent.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:14:26
sounds cool! 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:32:45
My computer is giving me some random shit. Has anybody guessed "password" yet?
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:18:58
Yeah, it shouldn't.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:17:09
But now we'll have to download it.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:29:06
Oh, now I get it... It's a challenge. pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:46:11
Very generous of you to try to restabilize the price of bitcoin, just like JP Morgan during the stock market crash. I hope this time, it goes better.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:50:50
eriously? Can I turn my computer off nd on? Also, can I shut down Bitcoin Core while it's syncing? How large is the blockchain anyway?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:44:48
thanks.  felt guilty because I already have a changtip... I hope the gold is fair compensation.
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:46:53
bitcoin nostalgia... fucking great.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:34:55

It accepts bitcoin to send anonymous faxes.
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:16:41
RemindMe! 1 year "Is BTC worth $10,000 yet?
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:29:34
The trolls are strong with the comments. Don't listen to them. do your kids understand Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:18:40
Sounds a bit too technical for the average person.
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:23:18
 Post the public key!
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:44:12
Nice! 250 bits

Me please! 
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:06:32
I'll send a telegram to the FCC.
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:37:49
If you have to send a fax, but can't. Or send an anonymous fax.

Ability to loose btc forever. I once lost 0.001 BTC, and it still haunts me today. I think about it at night.
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:39:39
That is what it was MADE for. It was (and still is) a joke currency. It's meant to pock obvious get-rich-quick schemes like paycoin and litecoin. It's users don't invest more that a couple dollars, and they certainly don't expect it to become the world currency.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:36:12
I mean, the bitcoin client.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:43:31
Are these owned by the marshals, or the guy who bought the btc?
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:50:05
you can also post short strings of text here, too.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:42:44
Are those all of them?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:13:50
Neat! I donated 0.001. Does she know much about Bitcoin? Is her private key secure? Will she loose it easily?
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:46:48
Why not generate your own wallet and use that instead? No middleman.
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:31:35
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:52:54
So, someone tried to trademark "BITCOIN"? Damn. You just did something that would've taken millions of dollars and several years to carry out.
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:42:31
nice! 150 bits
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:37:23
So provide the following information.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:50:51
Woah! They've been moving a lot!
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:08:07
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:31:53
bitcoin lost around 75%.
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:27:56
I like dogecoin because it mocks alt-currencies made by get-rich-quick scammers.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:17:03
Thanks! 150 bits
@_date: 2015-03-01 00:00:07
Im sure that happened. /s
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:20:49
Well, I don't want a deflationary one, that's all. An economy can't work if everybody is worth buckets of gold.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:23:53
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:32:28
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:34:58
yep. On apple macbook pro, can see capital B with line through it. Using Firefox.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:18:27
Isn't that a problem?
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:52:25
Bribe the guard in BTC. Easy way out of a waterboarding.
