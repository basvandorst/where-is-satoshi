Is this wallet hd, building keys off a seed or do you have to back up keys digitally?
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:29:00
The list remains unpopulated.

Is it Electrum 2.0 with a Trezor plug in?

Could dust be the result of miners creating more work for themselves?

Great app
Here are some suggestions -
Give an option for bitcoin denomination
Give an option for fiat denomination
Paid version without adds

I love this android wallet.
It would be perfect if it was updated so you could generate additional receiving addresses. Currently you have to transfere coins to a number of accounts within the wallet then gather the receiving addresses if you want more than one address.

It would be great if you could create extra addresses on mycelium. If you want extra addresses you need to make new accounts and transfer coins to make more accounts and then gather up one new address from each.

Check -Bitcoin Balance 
in the google play store.
Accessing the app with a vpn should keep you fairly anonymous. Being so conscious of your privacy I'm sure you already have one. Private internet access can be brought cheap with btc.

Just hope the don't charge back the funds and leave you with neither the coins or the cash. I think payal might be getting a little better a stopping this now but why risk the headache

Forepost is great.
But why the recent dropping of transaction through CBA?

Please also intergrate the 25th seed passphrase for trezor. Trezor will finally be able to access tor.
