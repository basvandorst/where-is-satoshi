Software implements standards and proposed standards. See this for details on the different terms used to describe crypto applications and standards in this context:
I also described [here]( why GnuPG is perhaps the most important of all implementations of OpenPGP: all GNU/Linux distributions (including those powering our router) depend on cryptographic signatrues to install and update securely the software they run.

[Bitpay]( can be setup in minutes, with minimal validation. It's also its main mission - so their focus is on making the experience for merchants better.
I also use [Bylls]( to spend the Bitcoin instead of converting them.

What operating system are you using? 
The projects you mention are all freely licensed and open source. Have you filed bug reports about this or asked their respective developers?
I noticed you didn't mention Electrum, which was recently packaged in Debian GNU/Linux and is written in Python. I tested it with the Orca screen reader and it was not supported. It should be possible to make it accessible in under the Gnome accessibility guidelines. 
I have no idea how to do this nor am I involved directly in Electrum development, however I know there are several active maintainers for Bitcoin packages in Debian. I filed [a bug report for Electrum]( to raise attention to this.
I also tested Multibit in Debian Jessie ("testing"), it had limited support with the Orca screen reader, after using [this configuration option to re-enable OpenJDK accesibility]( (disabled by default).
There is also Bitcoin-QT but I lacked the time to test it in Debian (it's not available in the testing environments I have).
The bottom line is all the pieces are there, but they need some (significant?) effort to be put together, tested, and made freely available. If there is enough demand and if this is aked properly, it will happen as more disabled/blind/etc. users request it - perhaps even finance it.
The first step, of course, is asking the developers directly about it :)

What did you do prior tthe attack? Sounds like your Windows host was compromised, but this also seems like someone who knew about your setup. 
Putting more effort into securing your Windows host seems pointless, specially if you already know about GNU/Linux. In any case, if you keep using Windows create a separate user, and store your VMs in encrypted disk space that you only access when needed - just a suggestion. Also favor using freeopen source software - replaceVMWare with VirtualBox.

Op you should update with the last comment in this bug report:
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:52:51
Bitpay's webpage should have refreshed and shows "This invoice has been paid." Didn't it? Bitpay is not "downloaded". It also generates a different address for every transaction (although they are re-used). Also, why would you show blockchain (specially knowing their recent problems) to verify a transaction? Showing your own wallet (assuming it has confirmation info) would be enough.
If you've used Bitpay before, you'd know that (and react accordingly). I encourage you to open an account and try it for yourself.
In any case thanks for this report, I'll be launching a service for merchants, specifically aiming at making Bitcoin setup an easy experience. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:40:54
Actually, I've tested Bitpay with several customers and have had issues with delays or stalled transactions. Their support will take some time to answer by email, so I recommend going with a paid plan if you want faster response times (and phone!).

It depends what software / services you are using. The more layers of payment providers and peripheral services you use, the more lattency  you'll introduce. 
I often show the basic scenario of paying through the free open source Android App but going to blockchain.info to check the transaction, it's almost immediate. Add BitPay, you'll add a few seconds to the transaction, but gain a nice "invoice has been paid" confirmation scren etc.,etc.

The integrity or verification of any application on iPhone (or Google Play) is quite irrelevant to me. The problems of using any Apple product (or Google Play-enabled device) and the control lost on my data when doing that are just not worth it. It takes but only 2 minutes of explaining this and anyone will agree and decide if the learning curve to act in their own best interest is worth their time or not.

@_date: 2014-01-05 03:37:38
Thanks for asking about this.


I think so, yes. Bitcoin is a the crossroads of several subjects that will have a great impact on kids that understand (or not) them (read below). 
The best part about learning about Bitcoin is everything you learn is useful in IT, finances and security, in general, even if you decide to never use Bitcoin again. I'm very lucky to be a direct witness of this as I've given [quite a few Bitcoin workshops]( as part of my work at [the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal](
I've spoken to young audiences (as a mentor with the local board of trade, as a volunteer, etc.) and most kids immediately ask about "how to hack a bank and be rich", "how to make games and make money", etc. Bitcoin is an interesting way to address the same interests in a more positive, constructive way, with practical examples that can be used in real life w/o restrictions and with immediate results (and by results I don't necessarily mean only "money").


* Be very careful about "promoting Bitcoin" vs. "educating on virtual currencies/IT/economics". Validate this with colleagues/principal/legal as appropriate. Some parent will probably raise concerns - do you see anyone teaching kids about "Facebook" or "Social networks"? Use that context for guidance.
* Maybe use Testnet - by removing money from the exercise you can teach the same w/o the complications (criticism, risk, etc) associated
* "Do your own research, here are some pointers" should prevail in all your material - don't put yourself in a position to be the recognized expert/only resource, specially as a teacher. Try to be an enabler/facilitator.
* Origins of Bitcoin - give them [the original PDF Bitcoin paper](bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf‎) and read it along! I've found it to be surprisingly short and readable by many.
* Why software freedom (and not just "open source") is essential to Bitcoin: security, trust, availability, no restrictions.  and  should help.
* Security: backups, encryption, privacy -&gt; made easier with software freedom (GNU/Linux, etc.) - I use Debian and Trisquel, I stopped using Ubuntu
* Personal finances: Bitcoin is disruptive to the established banking practices we have - but there is more to it too e.g.  Also important to highlight all the stuff Bitcoin can't do now that banks do: mortgages, loans, etc.

**Any** kind of code, much like Google Play: tracking, geolocation, ads, stats, etc., it's just business as usual. I don't use Google Play on my main Android devices. 
F-Droid provides an interesting way to side-load apps effectively, and keep them updated. [Even the server is free open source software]( that you can setup to distribute and maintain Android apps.
It's the minimum level of transparency / access / autonomy needed to distribute any free open source applications. It's kinda what Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on and why they took off.

From [GnuPG's website](


GnuPG is used to sign, encrypt and verify email (via [Enigmail]( in [Mozilla Thunderbird]( for example), and most notably, to sign and verify with digital signatures every software package distributed for installation in GNU/Linux distributions.
If you use the Internet, you are using infrastructure which would not be possible without GNU/Linux and its distributed, cryptographically-signed and verified packaging system that provides secure updates. Starting with your home router, and going further through more specialized and complex equipment, including servers, file storage, etc. lots of such equipment runs a system that relies on GnuPG for installation / updates.
Here are a few examples:
* All aspiring Debian maintainers / devs [are required to be identified by an OpenPGP key, signed (trusted) by a Debian developer](
* [Arch Linux wiki information on package signing](
* [Checking a RedHat package signature](

It now has an option " PIN to spend" setting, as well as paper-wallet sweeping, making it as feature complete as a personal / "minimum security"  wallet gets.

There are other low-hanging fruit, but I agree making Bitcoin part of the platform would mean a lot.
I'd advocate to get F-Droid in there first, though, I am not sure why it's not part of CyanogenMod.

Being based / having started in Montreal, it's bilingual. It's an effort to build a free autonomous mesh network. I asked a few days ago if it woul dbe interesting to take Bitcoin at the nodes in exchange for access, to self-finance/monetize the infrastructure, only had one "meh" response.
Sometimes when someone show s up with an actual technical implementaiton the discussion picks up again and it may accelerate things. Sometimes not, but I'd rather link the missing pieces together.

I am wondering why all the surprised, shocked posts about this... it's business as usual!
Even on Android my personal recommendation is to use [F-Droid]( or download direct to install the Bitcoin Wallet app. **Don't use Google Play to install any Bitcoin apps**. Don't use non-free, non-open-source Bitcoin apps. **Check very carefully the permissions required by this new, shiny "Bitcoin rates widget"**!
If you rely on a non-free OS, and use a non-free App Store / marketplace etc. AND rely on a private company to decide what apps you can run on your computer / mobile device, etc., you should not be surprised whenever restrictions appear or are enforced.
Use [free software](
Bitcoin got started, is built on, and depends on free software, at all levels.

Thank you, I haven't looked nor do I consider myself technically knowledgeable enough about Firefox OS to even have an opinion like yours. This is part of what I wanted to know, and share with other potentially interested developers.
 
Considering real functional hardware backed by huge mobile phone companies is now available, I don't expect Firefox OS to remain unkown or "new" for very long.
This, combined with the proliferation of abusive, expensive and inefficient banking services, should make it a good environment for Bitcoin to thrive.

I just tried this and it worked *exactly as described*. Lots of steps, and back-and-forth between QuickBT, Interac, and my bank, but it just worked. Instant BTC in my Electrum wallet from my Canadian regular check account (1 confirmation within a few minutes, still pending full confirmation).

Apple or Google blocking useful Bitcoin apps from their apps marketplaces is *business as usual*.
When you give up control of your applications to a non-free, closed, profit-oriented application manager, you can't expect it to be fair to any competition.
This doesn't make Bitcoin impractical, if anything it makes *iOS and Android + Google apps* (as installed / updated by Google or their manufacturers) unworthy of trust &amp; practical use.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:45:07
You could take free open source software projects like [Unicenta POS]( or [Lemon POS]( and finance Bitcoin integration into them.

That's a great idea. I suppose the same could be implemented on mobile tethering devices. In the meanwhile, if I may add this suggestion, being able to connect your Raspberry Pi to get connectivity by USB tethering to my Android phone (or other) 3G connected device would be nice.

I don't use the Google Play store and/or ** Android-/phone operator-provided Android versions**. They are non-free software that implement automatic updates, audits and modifications of Android and any apps installed through their own mechanisms. They essentially would give all control over my phone to Google if I used them. They also facilitate installation/automatic updates of non-free software which increases the probability of security problems in that context.
I only install free open source apps from [F-Droid]( on CyanogenMod.

When I look at any of the above, none satisfy my criteria of using a 100% free operating system, and method of installation - except  or  if you're taling about one of the [GNU/Linux distributions recommended by the FSF as 100% free]( 
An example of acceptable risk vs. convenience for a semi-cold wallet for me would be a Trisquel GNU/Linux LIveCD + LUKS encrypted USB stick holding your data + Armory installed manually from a .DEB checkesum'ed and stored on the encrypted key.
The LiveCD provides the assurance it's read-only and won't change/be compromised, can be used offline, and will decrypt automatically (provided you know the password) the USB encrypted key when such key is inserted.
There are many variations to this but when you start exploring them on a Windows or Mac OS system, or an Android device with Google Play, for example, you are trusting a lot of third parties and accepting their restrictions (or future restrictions) and complete control they have over your computer. I'd start eliminating that, then the safety probem is easier to manage, IMO.
If this sound over the top, consider it a fair exchange of what you have to do now (manage your own security and control your own computer system/devices) instead of paying a bank or financial institution to do it for you.

The Blockchain.info iOS app is well done, I am not saying remove it or don't use it, but you can use any other online device (cheap Android / older iOS phone) to verify the status of recent transactions *without actually setting up a wallet*.
You won't feel much pain if you loose such a verification device while being distracted on a busy day/noisy place etc., as opposed to loosing your main phone! Of course it could only be a cheap netbook properly secured (wich a Kensington lock etc.) - there are a  million variations to this.

Not specifically. Once in Debian, it will get in all its derivatives on time. If you have specific suggestions, I can look into it. Regrading desktop distributions right now my focus in on Debian because of the impact it has (trickle-down effect on all derivatives).

Please do setup the secondary password on Blockchain and read about its security features. I hope you don't leave your hard earned Bitcoin on Blockchain.info, consider moving them to a more secure (and encrypted) desktop wallet. For medium risk I'd suggest a secondary user if using Windows / Mac OSX.
You don't actually need the phones/devices to collect payment, just a printed QR code. You can, however, use such devices to verify payment (just enter your Bitcoin address in the search field at blockchain.info).
Good luck and come back with more stories!

I am personally working on engaging with other major free open source projects to let them know about Bitcoin and help them reach the same decision as [The Document Foundation]( (stewards of the LibreOffice project) did.

An old phone is also easier to replace + get back operational. Its parts are built + tested to work together, and the camera is an important part of the wallet (spending) functionality. NSA point taken, in my scenario it would have no GSM or GPS drivers and the Wifi driver would be on demand-only. Also, no Google apps / play.
