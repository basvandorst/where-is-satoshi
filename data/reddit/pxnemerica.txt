Not really sure what kind of regulations you have to follow but is this something a minor could do in trust with a parent?  
More specifically, would the regulations allow you to have the parent create a trust account, with authentication for each person. That would make sure both parties are there to use it. Then have that account change to a normal account belonging to the now adult on their 18th birthday?

Being pulled away from your "vacation" to trade doesn't make it a vacation anymore.   
He makes plenty sense, especially if his vacation entails separating one's self from those luxuries.

Stripe will randomly shut down your account citing Tos violations. Little to no recourse.  The first response was that they won't be replying, repeating the vague reasons.  
We had this happen a few weeks back with a video streaming site  that we use stripe for subscription payments.   
They closed the account without warning, issued an email after the fact stating we broke some vague terms. My understanding is they had a complaint that we did not have license rights for the content we offer, which is not the case.   After weeks of email back and forth, they admitted it was a fault in their system, nothing was done for the inconvenience. We had to show proof we had licenses for the content to get reinstated.  We have had to implement multiple payment gateways since to avoid service disruptions for our customers.
Stipe is as vulnerable as  a service as any other provider.  They do a great job on the API side of things though.
