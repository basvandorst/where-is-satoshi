The best part is where  the banker says banks in Holland agreed to implement instant money transfers... in three to four years! LOL!

Globo has pushing bitcoin on its agenda...c'mon! What have you been smoking? Furthermore Brazil is a backwater where new internet technologies lag for years. Facebook was already massive when Brazil was still using Orkut. And its 200 million people live in an economy that grew a meager 2.2% over the last year. Do a little research will ya?

I don't think Marc Faber and Peter Schiff are billionaires, but they sure do have a lot of money!

Once again a statement that says nothing at all.

I have had three iPhones and switched to android a few months ago. I won't ever go back, the iPhone is great, but I prefer to decide for myself which apps I install or not.

I've been euphoric for several weeks now already. I might take some profit this week, but I'm afraid to miss out on more profit. So there's a lot of greediness in the market right now.

Kinda reminds me of when my father appeared on Facebook. When your parents dive in take care!

Thanks for your input. The paragraph on which you commented was taken from SatoshiDice's prospectus for it's IPO though. I guess you could put it differently, but we should take care not to get too technical at this stage. Maybe later on when the article grows..

please do

Thanks, no I know that I will never use bitcoinx.org

"It's a decentralized currency that only goes up in value." This bubble will burst soon...
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:55:19
I sold a bunch of bitcoins I bought at $14 for $42, thinking it was a bubble and would crash. Just because it looks like a bubble doesnt mean it won't go up even more. You have to always consider how much money you can lose if bitcoin crashes and also how much money you can lose out on if you sell and the price goes up even further.

It didn´t talk about the advantages for people in Portugal though. And it stressed that it is very speculative and deflationary (as being something negative).

When I told a friend about bitcoin he said: "Like as if you're gonna get rich with bitcoin." At that moment I knew I was gonna get rich with it! Considerably richer already, cashed out my original investment and riding the bitcoin wave now. IN YOUR FACE!

I'm referring to a specific forum post though to verify this statement.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:19:48
That was me, I posted such comment on the original post. Which I think is now deleted.
Just take a look at their "trading platform" It is designed in a way that makes it impossible for a trader to get the information you need to set up a serious trade. Look at the position sizes you can open, they are extremely inflexible. And the alternative views of your trades are what tops it off: this is designed for people to consider trading to be a game. Look at their bonuses and affiliate deals: this comes straight out of the online gambling industry. I would be very wary of any broker that offers you a bonus to deposit money or offer such rich commissions to their affiliates! FX brokers normally don't do this.
Trading is not a game, it is already hard to make a profit on a decent trading platform, with eToro it's just impossible.
And how can a company be successful at that? Look at all the gambling sites that are out there. People love to gamble, 95% of traders or more are not profitable. BTW if I remember well, eToro is affiliated with 888. I can't find the information anymore though.

I think we'll get a correction back to about $32. People are very enthousiast right now, volumes and prices have gone through te roof last week, this week has failed to confirm the excitement. Little problems like delays on mtgox and a fork in the blockchain have managed to cause serious drops only because bitcoin is overbought at the moment.

They spent $873 million on marketing in 2012. I don't think your 2009 numbers are correct as they spent $964 million in 2010. Puts some things into perspective indeed!

I remember thinking that I was seeing exponential growth at $45 and sold some btc to recover my initial investment. Just to show it is very hard to see what is unsustainable growth and what not. 
Also, you are forgetting some of the good news: the secondmarket bitcoin fund, Bitpay having over 10.000 costumers, the shutdown of silkroad that created a lot of buzz... an me having just payed for a flight home with bitcoin! ;-)
btw: you're not a long term holder if you bought less than a year ago at $80!

In other words: small party, in small country accepts bitcoin. Being Belgian, I had never heard of this party up till today.

I'd say "online gambling company eToro", there's no way you can make decent trades on their platform. Everything is focused on making people loose their money as fast as possible.

We have a lot of currency controls here in Brazil. Taxes on foreign credit card transactions, taxes on money that you bring into the country, just transfering money from my bank to another IN BRAZIL costs me 14 reais (about 6 usd). So bitcoin would be really good for Brazilians, unfortunately most here are very illiterate especially when it comes to economics.
