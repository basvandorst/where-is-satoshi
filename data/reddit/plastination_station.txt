For real. Yes Bitcoins are shady if you take a step back, but if I had some money to play with I would buy BTC when they reach their low. As far as I'm concerned, buying BTC are nothing more than buying stock in the INTERNET. And even though I've been a bit of a Dogecoin fanboy (c'mon theyre fun!) lately, I know that the currency(s) of the internet will never die.

Perhaps you are forgetting the golden rule. If so let me refresh your memory.

Great timing I was about to jump in missing some key ideas.
1) is there always a buyer for BTC and likewise is there always a source to buy X number of BTC? I know it takes a bit of time to confirm a transaction but if I wanted to buy or sell a cache could it be done very quickly assuming it's not in the middle of a bubble burst or and period of steep change?
2) I'm worried that I'm going to fuck something up between all the numbers and addresses to send BTC and anonymity of it. What are some of the major pitfalls to avoid getting screwed out of potentially hundreds of dollars worth of BTC? Or is it idiot proof?
3) Just because I'm curious my game plan is not to use BTC as currency but as a stock. Do you recommend this and why?

Ok I sent 10 BTC to that account just be sure to put the money you owe me back to my bank account with my account number being 906278954267 and my pin being 1567 (dont tell anyone!) also if they ask my social security number is 341-02-7675

I dont want to make you write an essay but could you briefly expand on the difference between PTP and blockchain? I get lost in the BTC terminology

Thanks for the awesome info buddy. Just one more question; if not Paypal then what? just straight credit card to BTC transaction? I thought the point of Paypal was to make that shaky style of internet transaction safer?

What is the method of BTC to determine what is a "meat-space" transaction? for example, if two people linked on Skype could they mimic a meat-space transaction? how about Facebook messaging?

Wow man thank you. So did the blockchain just create a temporary wallet for me to store that until I transfer it out?
And thanks for the 5 internets complete with a GoT gif.

Ahh yeah I remember I researched this a while ago the blockchain is the security from scams and it requests transaction verification from a few random points to make sure nothing fishy is happening. Does every transaction go through this population "screening"? I think at the end of the day the best way to learn this is to just buy like $10 worth and see what happens im going to try this tonight.
