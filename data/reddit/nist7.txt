No worries man, we're all missing on some great investment. 
I remember there was a guy on a bitcoin forum that was trying to sell 10,000 BTC for $50 and no one bit......imagine that. 10,000 BTC for 50 bucks.....this was back in like early 2010 though I think
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:05:28
Holy damn, 100-200 a day....wish I knew and paid more attention back in 2009/2010....sigh
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:21:57
Yeah. Cause Satoshi is/are worth an insane amount if he/she/they still hold and have reportedly 1M BC.....
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:24:23
Cause big money from wall st are getting in. There are guys who are able to buy in the millions of dollars and unload quick for super fast gains.

How much do exchanges take as their cut when people buy/sell BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:34:48
Ahhh very very true and good point! Hope our dear friend has taken that into account. Something like 15% right on capital gains
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:42:55
Yeah would be interesting. The real challenge is physically locating it. They'd need the landfill to keep accurate records of where it could've been dumped given the day (problem is I read about this guy before and he doesn';t remember what day he threw out the HDD...only a vague idea that it was sometime possibly in the summer). 
So that would be impossible difficult to find. Need a team and govt cooperation to somehow search the landfill which is gonna be virtually impossible I would imagine.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:04:47
Interesting. 
One thing I was curious about is that since BTC is the prototype of decentralized currency, wouldn't it be easy to simply bypass the formal exchanges and do private peer to peer transfers? with of course needing to still use a secure escrow service to handle the money in between. 
I assume going through the big exchanges they take a cut of the amount of BTC being transacted.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:58:04
WOw that is incredible. A redditor actually took out a 100k personal loan to buy BTC. 
Out of curiosity, would he have to report that on his taxes as income of 100k and would there be taxes owed?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:34:53
Indeed. With how peer to peer and decentralized BTC is purported to be...can people actually do direct peer to peer BTC sales/buys so as to cut out the middle man?  These exchanges are making massive money with each transaction.

Look dude, not to rain on this or put this down at all....and I super commend you and your wife for saving habits.....but bitcoin is NOT a good investment if you're just starting out to look toward savings/retirement and is trying to get your financial house in order. 
You should build up a 6mo emergency fund first, then max out IRA and any 401k you have, and THEN after that you can look into taxable investments like bitcoin or other mutual funds. Check r/personalfinance for more details. 
Keep up the savings habit more and more though, that's great.

As a BTC newb, do people still have "cold wallets" where they have kept their BTC completely offline for a long time? Would this be counted in this?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:40:52
Dude, its been lost for 4 years in a public landfill...the chances of him going alone in the dark to dig god knows how deep and where to find a hard drive.....he's gonna get injured/killed before he gets anywhere close. Theres basically 0 chance of him going alone and able to find this thing now
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:33:01
Yeah I mean it is not 100% impossible....but the amount of effort and cooperation needed from the local govt to let ppl access and dig around the landfill would be enormous. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:29:00
Right very true. You do need a service like an exchange to connect interested parties together 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:17:43
Exactly. Not all of them are actually usable BTCs with stories of people losing them. 
Also, as a BTC newb, do people still have "cold wallets" where they have kept their BTC completely offline for a long time? Would this be counted in this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:46:35
You're very welcome. Just trying to help out and caution others who may be caught up in this crazy bitcoin frenzy
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:21:12
Yeah just read about their ETF plan. Fucking genuis. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:08:57
Yeah I read more of his posts...and he didn't even have a plan of how to pay back the principal. Very bad sign indeed. 
Literally going against what this subreddit's sticked post in green says in bold letters about investing responsibly. 
But yeah this is basically like gambling/drugs/alcohol....super impulsive action that could have big negative consequences.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:44:27
Yeah that's probably the hardest part. Allowing them to give you access to rummage through. All kinds of legal and safety things to consider
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:54:21
Hear hear. 
If you're a working middle class...sorry buddy, you gotta bootstrap yourself and it's your fault that you've succumbed to predatory lending and the tons of corporate advertising bombarding you every hour of the day trying to get you put more on that credit card of yours. You need to take more personal responsibility.
If you're a massive bank/corporation?....Right this way gentlemen, how much tax break/subsidies can we give  you? Oh you pretty much fucked the entire financial system and millions of people are out of a job/house? Well, how much billions do you need to keep operating? Here's a blank check. 
Fucking disgusting.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:23:10
Could be man, woman, small or big group. And who knows if they still have 1M BTC. Maybe more maybe lot less. A techno guru may not be investment guru and for all we know they may have cashed out a bunch at 1k or $100 or $5000......we'll likely never know the truth....
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:42:34
Yeah. Even if they immediatelly stopped the landfill and meticulously combed the entire place with hundreds of workers....it may take year or more.....heck years potentially. Landfills are no joke and it's 4 years. 
Hell, with how much BTC is worth, it MIGHT be worth it if he can front the money to hire 100 guys for month to month contracts to loook for this thing
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:35:56
Dang. Is that 400k in cash or a cashier's check? Maybe it's the form of money that may take some time....
