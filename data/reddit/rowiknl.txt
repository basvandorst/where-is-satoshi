Asia started selling TRON for bitcoin. We'll just have to wait and see.

bought at €600, sold at €1200. Profit! now it's just one off those altcoins again..
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:37:58
Yeah, i'll just have to trust them
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:38:17
Yeah, i really have no clue what to do to secure both my BTC and BT2. That was actually my first comment on this subreddit. Coinbase said to be safe. But i dont know.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:11:31
Why does it?
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:26:37
I believe coinbase does, you'll need to wait 24h if im correct.

How much money do you own?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:50:57
I would recommend to look into altcoins
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:36:14
any cryptomarket would do i think?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:41:07
just paid 12 euro's in fee to transfer 0.04 btc to a wallet. with low-fees option... Its useless for payments and stuff like this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:38:57
Now Coinbase has your keys, not you. Remember that.

You're not ready for the real dip now..
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:50:12
Just dont panic when the price drops, dont sell when a dip cones, it will go higher eventually.
