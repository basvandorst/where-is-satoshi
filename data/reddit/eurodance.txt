"SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road...". Shots fired.

how about a closed letter bitch
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:48:06
this has nothing to do with bitcoin

My chart looks a little different.

No. Log scale is rarely used with stock prices, unless looking at a whole market over decades.

dam aint that sum shit

Ah yes, the veritable behemoth that is "Optima"....
Wait. Who?

Your appeal to authority is troubling.

Some random guy who made his own monopoly money a couple years ago. Now people want you to think he is important

What documentary? You mean the one nobody has heard of, knows nothing about, and mystically appeared on Vimeo around when this scandal occured? Oh, that one. Yeah, it's bullshit.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:35:58
This is a fake documentary created to make it seem like Craig Wright is the creator of Bitcoin.
Fucking brazen. You scammers have no morals.
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:42:04
Who the fuck is this idiot "JVP" who keeps popping up in defense of Craig Wright? And there is no  fucking "Tulip Trust" unless you believe laughable PDF's written in Calibri.
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:54:49
THERES NO COINS LOST WITH KLEIMAN. NO KLEIMAN CONNECTION. NO FINNEY CONNECTION. IT'S ALL FUD.

Obligatory "what weed are you smoking?" reply.
But maybe in this case you should actually try smoking. It would make things clear and show how wrong you are.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:30:16
You actually believe there is a "Tulip Trust" based on a flimsy PDF?
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:16:45
Everything said by that account, Ian Grigg  and "JVP" has this really stupid mysterious tone to it. As if we will believe it because they sound so mysterious and as if they know something. Fucking scammers think they can fool us.
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:50:06
Even the "Dave Kleimann" "connection" is completely non-existant. 
Unless you believe the "Tulip trust pdf" which was written in fucking Calibri or something.
As far as I'm concerned, he was some random dead IT guy who is willingly/unwillingly part of this scheme.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:23:04
This only matters if you're assumption that "David Kleiman" was involved with the creation of Bitcoin, is true. Why are you even looking at anything related to David Kleiman? The Wired report has proven absolutely nothing. As far as we know he is just a pawn in the scheme. The Wired "leak"/article is pure noise/misdirection as far as I can see. Digging into this shit would imply that the David Kleiman/Craig Wright link was real, which it isn't. Just based on some faked trust pdfs and emails.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:45:59
You sound troubled. Seek help.
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:38:01
Nailed it.
Satoshi Dundee porked this crypto groupie. She recruited the paid shills, Grigg, Matonis, JVP (aka the yoda charlatan), CIAndresen. Parlor tricks and PR agency soon followed.
I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:27:17
cuz he's a weak minded mark-ass bitch

Why not investigate leads? Because they are wastes of your time and mine. And no, I have nothing to hide.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:24:06
Because I am curious to find the true nature of the current situation, not spend hours searching obscure, un-linked connections.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:26:39
It must be nice to be as smart as you think you are. Hint: You're not very smart.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:31:05
Actually you can find the private key in seconds, pal. You just likely won't.
