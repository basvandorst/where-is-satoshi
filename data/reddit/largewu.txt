No, the problem is that, allegedly, tether wasn't bought with anything, it was created out of thin air, but it can be exchanged for bitcoin.

This is the key stat right here. The crypto market cap is outrageously out of sync with its actual value that could conceivably be liquidated. When bitcoin dropped 50% from its high, does that mean that all that  market cap value was turned into USD? Not even close.

What would probably happen is that somebody sees that WuCoin is up 400%, and then offers the previous buyer $10 for his WuCoin. Now the market cap is $1000.
But don't get distracted in how markets respond here; it's a contrived hypothetical example. The point is that the market cap is a huge multiple of the actual amount of fiat that have flowed into the currency.

Except the scam here is that, allegedly, the tether wasn't bought with bitcoin; it was created by Bitfinex out of nothing, and then exchanged for Bitcoin.

Here's an illustration of how that can happen:
Let's say I have 100 WuCoins, which I created out of nothing, and initally value at $1/each.  This makes the market cap $100.  Then, some guy comes along and says "I'll pay you $5 for one of your WuCoins". So now the price of WuCoin is $5, and the market cap is $500 ($5 x 100 coins), but only $5 fiat has exchanged hands.

Yes, it is a scam, and no, not with bitcoin specifically, but because bitcoin is used as the vehicle for which this tether is exchanged, it is inherently caught up in it.

Except the idea here is that all this (potentially) worthless tether was converted into Bitcoin and other crypto. This effectively creates infinite demand for crypto, which causes prices to rise artificially. This is econ 101 stuff here.
