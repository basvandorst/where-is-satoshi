Each of these is a separate, independent paper wallet. There's no connection between them. The popular paper wallet tools just create multiple on a single page for no particular reason other than convenience.

How important to the network are non-mining full nodes (i.e. ordinary users or businesses running Bitcoin Core with appropriate ports open). Would Bitcoin be just as secure and trustless if nobody but miners ran Core?
I understand the advantages of running a full node to an individual or a merchant - being able to personally verify transactions without trusting in any third party - but I have recently seen some comments from people who argue that the *only* nodes that really matter are miners. They argue that "hash power always wins in any dispute", so miners are the only nodes who can contribute to a consensus, therefore non-mining nodes have no power and thus aren't important.
This doesn't sit right with me, because surely a currency only gets its value from those who use it; miners get no real world benefits from mining a fork that nobody else on the network recognises as legitimate or valuable. But I'm still not 100% convinced either way, and I'm struggling to visualise how a situation where an attack by "dishonest miners" might play out in the real world, and whether the existence of a large number of full nodes *really* does anything to protect the integrity of the network as a whole.
Any insights or links to further info would be welcome. Thanks in advance :)

Super detailed and clear response. Thank you.

Create a BTC wallet using the seed from the BCH wallet and you should find your funds there.

You get the first fee back. Or rather, you never spend it. The new transaction replaces the old one so it's effectively voided.

I recommend you [read this post](

1. In a "bitcoin world" nothing will stop banks from providing secure bitcoin storage services. I would imagine that most normal users will probably happily pay a small fee for such services to store their life savings securely (and also provide insurance against theft).
2. You can't send to an invalid (malformed) address, it will fail. Sending to a *valid but wrong* address, either by accident or by being tricked, is a real problem though. (And [not one that's restricted to crypto]( There are software solutions to this, though. For example, [Payment Protocol]( allows merchants to invoice users without the user having to scan a barcode or enter an address.

Well when they're created, they will all have zero balance. But they are completely separate from each other - if you only deposit funds into one of them, only that one will have funds.


You would spend your bitcoin by importing the private key into a software/hardware wallet. It's recommended that you transfer all the BTC off the paper wallet in one go when you do this (also known as 'sweeping' the balance).

Any time the price hits a nice round number there are going to be a greater-than-average number of investors who try to sell at that price, just because it's a nice number. You can visualise this by looking at the depth chart ([example from bitstamp BTC:EUR right now]( - large volumes of orders at key prices appear as big steps in the chart, referred to as *walls*.
The price won't increase beyond that until all of those sell orders have been filled, so an increase in demand is needed. This is why it can often take a while for the price to push past a milestone.

That's a really nice resource. Great work!

Send it to the 1bitcoineater address for shits &amp; giggles.

As I understand it, you're correct. Both ends have to fund the payment channel for two-way transfer of funds to work. In your example if Gemini haven't funded the channel with Starbucks then your payment would have to find another route.

Yes, you can use the same seed words in any wallet that uses the BIP39 standard. But remember that anyone with those words can steal your bitcoin so only enter them into software you trust.

So did I, but I definitely think this edit is biased. I'm not defending Ver at all, though. He acted like a toddler.

Have a look on blockchain.info and paste that block hash into the search box. This should take you to [this page]( As the other poster said, it says it was mined by BTC.TOP. You might find some way of contacting them on their website, but it's all in chinese...

Fascinating (and sobering) story.
For reference, here's [original post about losing the coins](
From his description it certainly sounds like the discoverable keys were generated by blockchain.info's code.

It's a nice round number milestone. Milestones are interesting to people. Like birthdays.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:04:09
I'm not much of an expert really, but as I understand it the only way anyone can be 100% sure they're safe from something like this is to write the code to generate the their keys themselves, or personally audit the code they used.
Second best option would be to use a wallet that is open source and widely used, in the hope that other people will have audited the code already.
(Edited for clarity)

Some bitcoin software, somewhere, is generating private keys that look secure and random but are actually 100% deterministic and derived from public information in the blockchain. It's unclear whether this is malicious or buggy code.
The result is that the private keys can be guessed by anyone who knows where to look.
People are using these addresses to store BTC and then having their coins stolen.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:16:35
I can hook you up with some bitcoin doge.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:31:11
That's one hell of a misleading headline.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:33:21
The merchant generally pays a fee and absorbs the cost, but no way it's as much as $10. It's about 1.5%.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:44:09
I think you're thinking of bitaddress.org? That's the website that you can download and use to generate wallets offline.
Blockchain.info is the site that offers both a blockchain explorer and a web based wallet. It's their web wallet, which has suffered security issues in the past, that this guy apparently used.
Edit: [blockchain.info posted here]( and say that they can't find any evidence that the vulnerability originated with them. So it looks most likely that it was an issue with his original paper wallet.

That's some... creative editing

Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.
If you have $70 in your account then I'd say that means all of it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:14:59
I very much doubt that old bug is relevant here. I believe that all of the addresses involved were taken out of service and users received warnings never to use them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:47:52
Bitstamp works well. Wherever you go though, you'll have to go through some sort of verification.
