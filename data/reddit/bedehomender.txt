The fact that both LN and POS give a return on capital does not make the former into the latter.

Refunds are no longer required now that we have checklocktimeverify activated, and that also solves malleability issue with refunds, and makes things simpler in general. Implementing refund negotiations, in particular with multiple parties on one contract, gets involved.

I may be wrong, but I don't think this actually improves upon privacy in OpenBazaar in a significant way. Zeronet uses BitTorrent, which has clear IPs, like OpenBazaar. The only difference is that it allows other people to host your store, but if the point of that is for you to sell  illicit goods, then I dont think a lot of people will be willing to do that. I'm not sure, but perhaps Zeronet can run over Tor, while Openbazaar cannot at the moment, but that will change when they switch to IPFS. But in all cases, you could always host illicit stores over Tor, so not sure what the novelty of any of this is for that particular purpose?

Messages sent is not something you need distributed consensus about, there are plenty of great p2p messaging protocols out there. Bitmessage does not use a blockchain, it uses POW as an anti message spam mechanism, at least last time I checked.

Great news, but this is not the first Bitcoin company in India by a stretch - as the article claims.  is an established, large and growing exchange which has been active since 2013.

*relief*, I read that and couldn't grasp what the novel claim was.

Bram has publicly stated that he does not think this integration is useful, but we are working at it (
