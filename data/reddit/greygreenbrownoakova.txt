You moved away from selling houses, onto selling bitcoin?
You claim understand economics but your struggle with a most basic concept: opportunity cost. Nobody is going to loan something to you if it's doesn't return roughly the same as other investments. 
If I loan you money to sell you my house, it had better be a risk/return equivalent of selling it outright and investing the cash. Especially the added risk of non-payment or house destruction.

Seriously though, what you are describing is a reverse mortgage, it happens all the time. Unfortunately, for the privilege, you pay a premium. 
Whether it's interest, a higher buying price or deflation on the principal, it's all the same in the end: No free lunch. If you are in the business of offering free lunches, you miss out.

Because you could sell it outright and invest the money elsewhere, earning a profit.


you are offering a zero interest reverse mortgage. This is stupid, because you could instead sell 5% reverse mortgage.


I'm trying to figure out your methodology, since you think people are going to loan you an asset with no rent/interest.

@_date: 2018-08-19 00:03:39
You've already agreed to a rate of installments before the sale, which will include a profit, unless you're an idiot.
Of course none of this matters. Nobody is going to sell their house this way for the same reason nobody lends money to their house buyer today: risk management. A bank can spread the risk across several thousand homeowners. 
If you sell your house to somebody and they stop paying, you're fucked. Repossession takes a long time and costs money. Additionally, any wear and tear they do in the meantime comes off your end. The part ownership  means you're liable for all the taxes,  insurance etc. If they burn the house down in year one with a meth lab, insurance won't pay out and you lose 98%.

@_date: 2018-08-12 01:12:41
There is no such thing as a free lunch kiddo. Inflationary or deflationary, you are still paying a premium for getting the house now.
In a deflationary economy, you will get pay cuts, not pay raises. After 20 years, you'll be paying 30% of you income for the house, instead of the 10% you started paying. By the time the house is paid off, the seller will have received the equivalent of 10 years average salary for a house worth 5 years average salary. That's interest.
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:01:38
