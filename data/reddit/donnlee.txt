Agreed. I switched from gAuth to LastPass Authenticator and now I don't have to worry about backup codes, especially out-of-date codes that I might have invalidated by generating new backup codes.

OP edited.  Thanks for clarifying

Consumers were used to 40MB hard drives, then 1.6GB, 80GB, 250GB, and now 2TB.
For the same reason there aren't ads for 2000000MB drives, I hope I won't see a t-shirt sold as ".0000000563" BTC one day.
The problem is that our number system is going down: milli, micro, satoshi, and most consumers aren't used to that.
Even so, I think merchants will be motivated to display numbers that look aesthetically pleasing on a webpage, phone, menu, chalkboard, billboard, etc so this might be a problem the market will self-solve. As long as the number system exists: milli, micro, satoshi.
Perhaps the good news is that people will be used to tipping (and other micropayments) in the *next*, upcoming smallest unit, so there'll be a period of familiarization of seeing &amp; using uBTC when most goods are priced in mBTC.
If the most aesthetic unit to price a t-shirt in is satoshi, then bitcoin will have won, IMO.

TechCrunch is so lame. They didn't bother checking reddit yesterday or doing a blog search to learn that the first ATM was installed in Albuquerque on Feb 18?
Twitter universe thinks the first ATM = Austin thanks to this TechCrunch error.  Tweet the author at  and ask him to change the title of his article.
And upvote this for visibility.
 Maybe change the title of this link to: "TechCrunch thinks the first ATM was installed in Austin"

Yes they will be rolling out to the other locations

Thanks for the suggestion. I tried on iphone and coinmap wouldnt load, crashes mobile Safari. Will do on laptop when I get home.

I'll try to explain:
The emergency codes given to you by Google give you access to your 2FA-protected Google account *only*.
I am using Google Authenticator (GA) for more than just my Google account. For those NON-google accounts that are protected with GA, the google emergency codes are useless.

Knoxie is correct.  I don't want to give out my cc because I need vpn only for a few days (until olympics is over).  
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:55:04
Good points. Shouldn't fungibility be built-in the core protocol? I'm not comfortable with leaving this up to wallet implementations because it seems like a quick-n-dirty fix. 
I think Andreas said we didn't do it right with TCP/IP, and now we're paying for it.

I'm rather relieved his whole argument depends on several altcoins becoming as useful for buying real goods as bitcoin. Next. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:29:17
Really looking forward to CoinJoin integration! When?
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:16:44
Oops, indeed. I actually pay for both vps &amp; vpn every mo. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:11:25
Edit: oops, misread vps as vpn
I used cryptovpn.com and had no problems.

If i want to do this for a social event, what smartphone app should be used for the newbies? Mycelium on android and blockchain.info on iphone?

I linked my secondary bank to Coinbase for this reason. Didn't want anything to disrupt my primary banking/billpays/autopays. 
Sad though this is happening

Estonians become intensely curious about this bitcoin-thing. Adoption surges. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:36:03
I get coinjoin (&amp;amp; zerocoin) but it's manually applied (unimplemented). Based on my research, bitcoin-dev aren't actively working on it or too cautious about changes like this or not taking built-in mixing seriously enough. 
Why isn't the community more serious about having mixing/coinjoin *built-in* and automatic for every transaction? Let's do this thing the right way, before mass adoption, no?

At most banks only the owners can access the safe box. Also your family needs to know your box exists and where it is. Do you know how to access all the safe boxes owned by your family?
Boxes full of jewelry &amp;amp; other goodies are sent to the state's Unclaimed Property Division because people die and their family never knew about it. 
So add a family member to the list of box owners. They will know the location and be able to access it when they find the key in your house. If they dont find the key, they (as co-owners) can pay for the box's lock to be drilled &amp;amp; opened.

So the bitcoin ATM running in Albuquerque is not a bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:32:21
I'm pretty sure blockchain.info's wallet supports BIP38.  So do an import of the private key, it'll prompt for the paper wallet's password and import the paper wallet (private key).

k8poker has at least 4 freeroll tournaments per day. I play there. The biggest (&amp; oldest?) seems to be sealswithclubs.

Some things I've done:
a. Have Google Authenticator running on my ipad and a family member's iphone, in addition to my iphone.
b. Wrote down on paper the key used to setup 2FA on all my accounts.
c. Verify I can restore 2FA by deleting the account in Google Authenticator (on my ipad) and recreating it using the setup key, then comparing the generated 2FA 'passwords'/numbers to my iphone's Google Auth app (should match).

sweet. Can we get a redditor to post some pics from that location, pls?  
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:01:15
Thats very odd indeed. I doubt someone like Wells Fargo would have done this. When I did cash deposit they emphasized it would be available to the receiver "immediately". Maybe because the credit union network isnt the same as one organization? Each CU is under separate management, training, culture, etc
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:08:47
Yes, i need BIP38 if this is to be a cold storage wallet.  Because: 
I put verso card in safe box.
Wait 5 years. 
Greater confidence that BIP38 will still work at that time. 
No offense to Verso specifically; just the state of the nacent bitcoin industry today. 
Good luck with your promising product!

Very nice
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:20:00
This is what I do (bip38 with password my family can figure out):   
Has to be simple as possible. USB flash drive, truecrypt, wallet fragments, and other layers will confuse them too much. 
Also, I've had usb flash fail on me before. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:02:25
same boat. i used bitaddress.org js client on an offline laptop to decrypt BIP38 to WIF. then sweep btc with electrum and import BCH with electrON. emphasis on "...ON".
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:55:59
Here's what I did. Decrypt BIP38 paper wallet private key with bitaddress.org (on an offline laptop). Copy the WIF key. Sweep BTC off paper wallet.
Now BCC steps:
In Electron, create Standard wallet, "Use public or private keys", and paste WIF key. Now electron has control over the BCC.
Importing additional keys: You can just import more private keys from electron menu Wallet &gt; Private keys &gt; Import.
