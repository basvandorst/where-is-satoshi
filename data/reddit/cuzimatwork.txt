It's not rocket appliances, they're terminal settings.
I guess I'm the only one in here who grew up on BBSes?

for mining with 2 cards?  a board with 2 pci-e slots for 2 gpus and a psu powerful enough to run it all...

In old tyme pre-dialup internet days, we would use analog modems to dial each other directly.  In order for both computers to communicate properly you had to set up both sides of the connection with the same terminal settings.  It's kind of like having 2 computers connected to each other with just a serial cable.  You could have the ports configured in quite a few different ways.
The settings in the magazine simply tell the person with a modem how to set up their terminal so when they connect to the service so that the two devices can communicate properly.

LOL I archived it just in case, that post was pure hilarity.
It was also at 150 updoots when I first saw it and  on @_date: 2017-11-12 15:01:10
dari will flip -

How the fuck is this at 38 points &amp; 74%.
Google this shit, turns up nothing.  Where's the link?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:21:50
You're talking like a shill.  When "rog" pulls the trigger again (and there's no doubt that he will), we'll just see the same shit happen again, BCH will be more profitable to mine at first, difficulty insta ramps on BCH, difficulty drops on the BTC chain, miners realise that it's now 3x more profitable to mine BTC, flip.
It's all about the DARI.

$30-35 maybe doing cryptonight and equihash 24/7.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:01:45
lol salty shills this morning.  I hope you bailed when it peaked, ain't going to hit those numbers again for quite some time.

Acoustic coupler?!  You're older than me!  Mine was a 1200 baud cardinal external for my 286 :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:18:22
If anything this weekends events proved that the flippening CAN'T happen unless miners are willing to take a loss or if the value of BTC plummets so low that even after the difficulty change DARI stays positive for BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:29:58
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with grinding out $150-200/mo worth of mBTC with a couple of cards on your gaming rig w/ nicehash :P

fuck you commie anti-trumpers, can we keep you off this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:53:46
oh, i can play the link game too - 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:54:50
Warrant to dig into the financials of the clinton foundation maybe :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:34:17
Just like no one can take you far left anti trumpers seriously anymore?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:22:04
I'm a Canuck, I'm just tired of anti-trump rhetoric.
And show me the proof of collusion.  Don't you think if any existed we'd have seen it by now?  This narrative has been going on for more than a year now...
