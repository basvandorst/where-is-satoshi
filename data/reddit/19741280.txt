Never tell her you have bitcoin in the first place, everybody’s entitled to have a little secret. Better yet, stay single and act like a goddamn child your whole life, stay young, become rich and never have to give up half. ;)

I didn’t reverse it. Let me explain what happened. A friend of mine send his bitcoins to me and i gave him my bch address instead of my btc address. I exported my bch private key and imported into a BTC wallet, and there it was... smiling at me ;)

A lot of people nowadays, still don’t have the knowledge. ��

But if the scammers bought an advertisement @ google, it must be traceable i guess. Did you reach out to google?

It worked like you told me, thank you again. Keep up the good work!

I use multiple wallets, but in this case i used Electrum, a standalone portable wallet to import the keys and transfer it to my original wallet

Don’t worry, Mark Zuckerberg has 17 Billion reasons to start accepting crypto ads again..

It’s totally possible to retrieve those coins. I f-ed up myself one time with btc to a bch address and got the whole 1800usd retrieved. So please don’t listen to people saying it’s not possible. Good luck the answer is already given to you.
