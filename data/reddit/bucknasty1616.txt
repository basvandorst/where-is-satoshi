Great use of pictures. I still prefer the graphs that show a constant escalating trend.
My prediction is 5 million by 2025 for 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:06:08
It's great you're only down a thousand dollars. Keep buying more! This is the lowest price bitcoin will be moving forward. Look at 2014 this stuff is obvious. 
Own 2 bitcoins and you're retired by 2020. 2025 you retire on your own Caribbean island. 2030 you'll have yachts, castles, fleet of private jets... whatever your heart desires!
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:40:12
People on here believe that the price will increase exponentially forever and that bitcoin will be the only worldwide currency one day.
I come on this sub to just offer a little resistance.
Yes it's a risk, a huge risk! Your Dad sounds like a smart man.
I see on here all the time people telling others they need to buy now because it will go up again for sure. People putting the majority of the paychecks in bitcoin and thousands of dollars!! I use to do read this stuff because it was funny to me (same reason I would seek out and read flat earth stuff) but it got way too real.
Good luck to the nuts who think it is the only way to invest and the only currency to own.
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:53:37
Good job it's a super safe bet. 2014 the price of bitcoin fell a little but then it skyrocketed 3 years later. Price is a little lower right now (still amazing compared to 2014) but exactly 3 years after 2017 there will be a big exponential run up for sure!
Reality is anytime is a good time to buy bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:13:42
Why are you so negative? Look at all the upvotes!!
This sub is amazing because bitcoin can allow you to do anything you want and fixed every single problem in the world.
500 bitcoins could fix Africa in like 10 minutes.
40 bitcoins will give women equal rights in the middle east.
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:38:24
70% of your paycheck put into something with a high exchange rate to take a gamble on a currency that isn't widely accepted. 
I'd say keep doing it.
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:36:47
I'm confused, I've seen so many anti-visa and Mastercard posts in this sub.
Does this mean you will all think that banks are just fine if they start having crypto accounts and giving crypto loans?
@_date: 2018-09-18 01:54:53
Just like when people quote Warren Buffett "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful" and they relate it to bitcoin.
Problem is both Dalio and Buffett are not speaking highly of bitcoin.
This is just an example of confirmation bias. You have a belief in something and anything you read you will just twist it to fit your narrative. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:44:44
Definitely! That way they can get a lower buy in price. I mean just look at 2014! By 2020 it will be worth around $500,000.
Only up from there!!!
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:25:24
Great article. Really lines up well with a lot of graphs on this sub.
This situation is EXACTLY like 2015 so by 2020 we are in for a real treat. I hope everyone here is ready to tell everyone who doesn't own bitcoin how stupid they are! 
Oh man I can't wait until we are all so rich!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:10:43
Just a temporary dip. All cryptocurrencies will be back at ATHs by 2020, they are the future.
It's so obvious we need bitcoin as the major currency though. There would never be any problems.
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:59:19
I agree, you should spend a lot more than. 25,000 on useless traditional currency that is backed by absolutely nothing. 
Unless 25,000 is all the money you have, then good job.
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:20:20
Well it's obvious bitcoin will be the only currency one day. I'm talking world wide of course 
It just needs the support of other very useful cryptocurrencies to help it get rid of that traditional currency. 
Once that's done and everyone looks at their phone and is like "man bitcoin is so much better than all these other coins" then it will just be bitcoin. It just does so much more for so many people yah know?
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:57:35
It's really the only currency worth owning. Every government and big company knows it.
Give it 5 more years, everything dealing with traditional currencies will be abolished and bitcoin will solve all of the financial problems.
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:25:08
Am I the only one who thinks these doomsday scenarios are a little crazy? 
Especially when you are basically saying bitcoin is the only thing you can really "own".
What happens if the government starts taking all your stuff? Why don't you start with the chance that every day you can die from some sort of an accident, force of nature or murder. Then work your way all the way down to the government taking you things.
What a way to think.
Hold that bitcoin close if it makes you feel better.
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:49:17
Oh for sure! There are so many great cryptocurrencies out there, it's the future!
There will be constant price run ups for all coins and then one day traditional currency will not even exist! Just a bunch of awesome cryptocurrencies!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:32:24
1 bitcoin should be worth like 500,000 by then! Maybe more!!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-03 14:21:23
I've heard. I think if something happened that made everyone turn against their governments we have a lot bigger issues than currency. Being a doomsday prepper seems to make more sense lol
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:59:26
Yeah what a shame. Such an obvious and easy way to make a ton of money. I wonder why everyone doesn't do it.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:32:36
They would buy bitcoin from people who have it and are willing to sell it?
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:05:56
If the feds are hunting it because you're not allowed to use it why would more people want to buy it?
Bitcoin isn't weed where it actually does something for you, it's a currency that people also think is a good store of value. If the feds are hunting it you won't be able to buy like anything with it. Also, why would someone use something the feds are after as a store of value when they can just put their money an index fund?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:39:16
You're **
I am doing very well financially. Just turned 30 with no debt and 95k in savings. You're so brainwashed by bitcoin that you think it's the only way to make money and invest?
You don't have an answer or justification for what I'm telling you.
The truth is you have no idea what you're talking about. You makeup numbers and stories, hiding behind what others have said about bitcoin and it makes you feel important. You have to be careful attaching your identity to one thing because if you lose it (or in this case bitcoin doesn't continue to grow exponentially in value) you're finished. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:22:36
The more documentaries the better! The only people who do not own or believe in bitcoin just don't understand it yet.
Once people see how amazing owning bitcoins is all they will want to do is spend their traditional crap money on more and more bitcoins!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:24:03
When does the government just take your money? Taxes? You're still gonna have to pay that even if bitcoin is the new standard currency.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:35:25
I wish the best for you
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:33:25
You're ******
Great example of two people who won't sell their bitcoin. They must be the two smartest people in the world.
You say to follow the chart and the patterns repeat themselves, you know past performance has nothing to do with future performance right? Check the Google searches for bitcoin from the little jump in like 2013 compared to 2017. A lot of people have now heard about bitcoin and the price is going down. People are not buying it because it doesn't add any benefit to their life. It's just a gamble that it will be worth more in the future. Some people sware by penny stocks too because they have made a fortune off of betting on them.
"At this point, you wouldn't even buy Microsoft after seeing it in every exchange, you wouldn't buy Samsung seeing it in everyone's hand, you wouldn't buy uber or Lyft even though you take one every day. "
Once again you prove your ignorance much like your first post, lol. I own Microsoft stock and I pay for office, I am using a Samsung phone right now and I use uber instead of taxis. How could I buy uber or lyft? They are private companies you silly kid.
Want to know why I don't own bitcoin? It's because it doesn't improve my life in any way. The only possible benefit is what you're trying to preach; There will be more and more exponential run ups in price. 
Someone like you pitches bitcoin as a get rich scheme based on previous run up in price. If everything returns to all time highs then why not just buy every stock that has dipped. How soon before blackberry is back to all time highs? Maybe we should invest in that too.
It's a good thing you avoided talking about you "investment teacher" and those ridiculous numbers and inaccurate timeline.
I've heard a lot of people talk about bitcoin and you're just a silly kid trying to sound smart. Keep trying to prove your point with more examples, it only makes you look worse.
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:34:46
Nice graph!
The graphs made in this sub are always awesome.
So it's going to have another exponential run up in price again right??
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:30:11
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:54:22
Venezuela is a great example of a stable government and country. Once they fully adopt bitcoin I'm sure others will follow.
That 1 article was from Jan, how has the price of Bitcoin done since then? I wonder how happy they are with that deal now.
Did banks say bitcoin? Or blockchain? I know they are investing a lot in blockchain technology but that doesn't mean they are trading bitcoin. 
Also, you sound angry
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:20:50
I hope english isn't your first language.
Not once did I say anything about the death of bitcoin.
You still have not said how your investment teacher made 375 times his money in under two years. I guess he didn't teach you.
I've missed out on a lot of different investment opportunities, bitcoin isn't the only thing that has skyrocketed in price in the past lol.
I make comments on this sub a some resistance to the insane idea that it's just a matter of time before bitcoin becomes the global currency. Also the idea that bitcoin will continue to have exponential growth forever. People like you telling these things to people without someone like me stepping in is insane because you don't know that. There are many things that could happen with bitcoin.
You can try and be condescending all you want because I'm not a bitcoin believer but the bottom line is that you can't predict the future. Based on our convo that is full of contradictions, lies and stupid examples I don't think anyone should take your advice on anything.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:17:33
Kinda seems like an ideal world for someone who owns bitcoin.
Solely priced in bitcoin?
So you honestly believe that every country, province, state and business will ditch traditional currency and bitcoin will be the one and only world wide currency used?
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:38:36
You got me, checkmate. 
I'm convinced bitcoin will continue to be adopted and eventually take over with the evaluation being hundreds of thousands or millions for 1 btc. 
Thanks for the examples and article you provided.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:46:58
Is it assumed that Bitcoin will always be going up in value over time? 
Is that the best use of owning bitcoin, that it is worth more in the future?
I still find it hard to see how it could be adopted by the masses. I buy everything with a credit card. It is fast, easy and I get free stuff for doing it.
Bitcoin doesn't seem to solve any problem in my life currency wise.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:08:54
It has worked out as a good investment and store of value so far, but that gets back to my original point of people just expecting it to always increase in the future. 
Sounds like a cool idea, but I just cannot see all nations measuring their value against a crypo currency.
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:15:00
Seeing different people on this sub say that traditional currency is "play money" shows how stupid you are.
The entire economy runs on it. Does that make every major company and government fake? 
Everything is fake except bitcoin!!! Lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:00:59
You don't know this as a fact, you're just throwing numbers around.
Also your greatest investment teacher made 375 times his money in "stocks"? Which stocks? The majority of companies didn't have that big of a dip. So he made 375 times his money in less than 2 years? It's less than 2 years because there was no 2006-2007 crash, the crash happened in 2008.
The only way he made those returns were through options which is basically gambling. Just like buying bitcoin is gambling, your teacher had good fortune but there is absolutely no guarantee that bitcoin will return to 20,000. By 2040 bitcoin could be worth next to nothing.
You seem like you're full of shit. Just like a friend of mine who is huge into bitcoin saying that 17000 was the dip and everyone should buy now. He just posts how everyone needs to hold (hodl which is the dumbest shit lol) because he knows it will be higher in the future.
TL;DR- You don't know what is going to happen in the future, by predicting it and using BS examples shows you don't know a whole lot.
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:11:16
I look forward to that conversation. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:21:00
Right and that changes all the time. Getting back to the first comment of "having control over real money". It is difficult to have control when your real money is changing value all the time.
If Bitcoin is the only value you believe in that's fine but the world prices things based on currency. If they accept bitcoin as payment that will be based on the currency, not how much bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:56:54
It's the power of groups man
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:11:44
Oh bitcoin isn't worth anything in US currency? 
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:08:58
Lol, you might also be interested in penny stocks.
Last paragraph is the best financial advice I've ever seen.
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:58:34
I hope it works out for yah, I'm blown away that people like you invest that much money in bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:08:08
I live in Canada and the currency is treating me fine I guess. I get paid for my work and I pay my bills and save for retirement.
I'm 29 and the answer is no to every single question lol.
Identity never stolen, no one has put up a direct debit setup without my permission, no one took money from my account or a bank stopped me from buying anything.
These billions who have trouble transferring wealth I'm guessing live in 3rd world countries who have basic needs issues that come first before a currency issue.
Also how does bitcoin solve your problems? If by some crazy chance the entire world starts using bitcoin instead of currency, companies will still be lending bitcoin on credit, which means there will be a bank of some kind.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:26:08
You're avoiding my question.
What's stopping extremely wealthy people and corporations from buying as much bitcoin as they can.
Then that artificial money becomes the bitcoin that you think is going to fix corruption problems and the most powerful people and corporations stay powerful. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:27:58
Of course no one knows what will happen in the future.
I think if everyone was honest with themselves they wouldn't actually believe bitcoin will continue to skyrocket to insane evaluations of hundreds of thousands of dollars and bitcoin talking over as a world currency.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:58:09
I understand that argument for sure.
But bitcoin is worth actual traditional currency, so won't it always be affected by that?
@_date: 2018-08-03 09:48:40
Do you put all the money that you would invest in bitcoin? 
If you know the market is in a bubble and will go down why don't you just buy a bear market etf? Sell it when the bubble pops and use that money to invest.
You really put all your money in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-26 02:30:31
It's mathematically impossible for the top  1% of traditional currency holders to buy up the vast majority of Bitcoin available and stay rich and powerful. 
I guess I'll take your word it
@_date: 2018-08-03 02:00:40
This is a lot better than a lot of charts and articles people post on here.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:04:21
That's a good point.
But that's also a bet that you can use your bitcoin to buy a lot of things. Slowly you're seeing it accepted but it is far from mainstream.
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:27:13
Yeah CAD's value changes compared to other currencies but so does bitcoin! A hell of a lot more than CAD I can't believe you used that as an example. 
I can't see developing countries using a digital currency paying for stuff with cell phones. Agree to disagree there I guess.
Your car can't have a bank account? I don't know what point you're trying to make here. 
I will agree that we are lucky where we live. But as far as your choice in currency, I really hope you don't lose thousands of dollars betting on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:55:37
Oh they do? Imagine this massive shift if currency happening and silly people like me don't even know it's going on. So large corporations, banks and governments trade across boarders using bitcoin now?
How long before I get paid in bitcoin I wonder
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:38:13
The new technology is blockchain.
Your investment is a currency which is bitcoin. 
Blockchain can change how we use money and become very popular and the price and use of Bitcoin can fall drastically at the same time.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:01:54
If Bitcoin is worth traditional currency what is stopping the wealthy people and corporations from buying more bitcoin that anyone else and keeping things corrupt in their favor?
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:39:04
Almost everyone, including the majority of bitcoin buyers because they are just hoping it's worth more "shit money" in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:11:03
I'm confused....
What's stopping people and corporations from buying as much bitcoin as they can and owning way more than anyone else?
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:30:33
That's a tough opinion for people who think bitcoin can end corruption regarding currency.
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:17:11
No I wouldn't want a digital currency that's worth an insane amount of my country's currency. It's a huge risk to just assume it will be worth more in the future or actually useful to buy things.
Microsoft to bitcoin is not a comparison at all. The best example anyone has given in this discussion is bitcoin being easy to transfer across boarders. What if that problem gets solved with traditional currency?
Your hope is that there are drastic changes in the world so that almost everyone decides they want to get paid and buy things with bitcoin. All businesses and government. That is a very risky thing to bet on.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:48:27
Yeah but we're talking billions of dollars that these people and corporations have. The more the value goes up they more people who own bitcoin are going to sell.
Even if they get rich selling their bitcoin, around half of the people will be declaring bankruptcy in a few years anyway, like lottery winners. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:38:35
LOL very good point.
I blame Clinton to be honest. People are sick of typical corrupt politicians.
Why not give the angry creamsicle a crack at it and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-05-26 02:33:25
No need for local currency in your future ideal world of everyone using bitcoin.
We obviously need it right now. Whole economy revolves around it.
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:20:24
There is no way I'm smarter than everyone else when posting in a bitcoin sub reddit or forum. Everyone here has figured out the future.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:22:31
We'll see what happens lol
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:12:23
That's what I see people post all the time to people who critique bitcoin, "you don't understand it".
Well I've seen a lot of arguments and articles and even a documentary on bitcoin and it really boils down to a belief that many people will adopt this as a currency or a very good store of value.
The technology behind it is blockchain and blockchain does not mean just bitcoin.
So yes it is a huge risk because you're gambling on the idea that it will become a major currency or masses of people see it as a great store of value.
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:26:01
With a valuation that is fluctuating like crazy no one in their right mind would make large transactions with bitcoin.
Businesses just can't run that way. They buy something that is worth 100,000 in their currency in bitcoin and then next month it would be worth 70,000.
The accounting would be a mess.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:54:52
Now you're saying "crypto heads" diversify but earlier you were bragging about how two people will not sell their bitcoin after it made them billionaires.
You also bring up a scenario where bitcoin dies and it makes no difference to you because you're so rich and diversified in your investments, but your original post was saying that bitcoin will be going up in the future for sure. You said it would pass the previous all time high and someone who invests now can retire in 2040.
You keep talking about what you think that I would do or that you know me in some way. All I've done is give you resistance to your foolish claims. Now you're jumping all over the place and contradicting yourself lol. The examples you give don't make any sense. 
Tell me more about the stock market crash in 2006 and 2007. Explain to me how your investing teacher made 375 times his investment in under 2 years. Oh, I would also love to invest in Uber, the publicly traded company lol.
You seem like a very honest, genuine, intelligent person with great advice. Of course I believe that you're a millionaire at 25. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:02:12
Venezuela and Zimbabwe have a lot more issues with their country than their currency. 
If you think bitcoin can help countries that are in a lot of trouble that's fine. A lot of comments show that people predict it will replace all currency world wide.
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:58:24
Oh yeah definitely. It really is tough tapping a machine or typing in numbers online.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:32:10
Share price and currency fluctuations are 2 different things. 
If you think volatility of the money they spend or that currency isn't a significant part of a business well then I don't know what to do tell yah.
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:09:52
I have an interest in adding resistance so that when people are reading about bitcoin it is possible that they don't get brainwashed by the wacky ideas that get thrown around here.
Took no time at all to write. I got fast thumbs lol.
I heard about it around 2010.... maybe? I actually figured out what it was and the details about it when bitcoin was like $100.
It may surprise you, but there are a lot of stocks that I've heard of over the years that have exploded in value. Yeah bitcoin is an investment that I missed out on, but I've missed out on a lot of investing opportunities over the last 8 years. Bitcoin isn't the only place to put your money yah know lol.
Pulling up a timeline of a potential investment and saying "I should have invested X amount right there.... then I would be rich" is just stupid.
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:29:21
Yeah right on. I'mnot saying is that there are no issues with the current system.
Just because there are problems doesn't mean that bitcoin is the one and only true solution.
I'm repeating previous comments but the opinion of this sub is so delusional when it comes to bitcoin. It's insanity to read how much people are buying bitcoin with their hard earned money because they are so brainwashed.
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:29:18
I comment to offer resistance because this place is like a cult. 
The general theme of the sub is - 
Bitcoin is the answer to anything and you need to buy as much as you can with a 0% chance of you losing money if you hold long term.
People are telling others who are asking to buy now and retire in a few years (anyone with this advice obviously isn't worth listening to).
First world countries will follow Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Turkey. Traditional currency (useless paper as I've seen it called on here) will be worth nothing one day and is backed by nothing. It's backed by a global economy. Changing currency isn't just going to happen in a few years. Every government and major company would have to be on board.
The confirmation bias is so strong that everything you believers read is somehow twisted to make it seem like bitcoin is the greatest thing ever. I see Warren Buffett and ray dalio quotes on here to support bitcoin ideas when they both do not believe in the currency. It would be like quoting Hitler for world peace.
You have your words and phrases that are repeated like other cults - hodl, to the moon etc.
You just believe that you're smarter than everyone else because you figured out this one thing.
It's not guaranteed to go up in price in the future. It is not guaranteed to replace any banks and it sure as hell isn't going to end corruption. Rich people and companies can always just buy more bitcoin than you and stay in power.
Go on..... tell me what I always hear "I just don't understand bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:33:41
Sure. Spend all your traditional currency buying bitcoin, it's the only way.
@_date: 2018-10-21 13:05:19
This sub is only going to be posts of atm machines if that happens lol
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:30:05
Most of the stuff I read on here is pure insanity.

@_date: 2018-10-05 12:18:00
I think people on here are more like doomsday preppers than conspiracy theorists. 
They say shit like traditional currency will be worth nothing one day, banks will be useless, you don't really own anything, the banks and government do and will take it away from you at any time. 
Bitcoin is the only thing that can truly be yours and it will solve all problems.
Then there are the people who see it as a get rich scheme. The price will continue to increase exponentially forever because...... it just will
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:30:51
The sun rises in the East and sets in the West.
What does his question have to do with the creation of the IRS?
He's asking if people think there will not be taxes if bitcoin is accepted as a currency.
Next you're probably going to reply about inflation or Venezuela.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:27:21
Mock someone for thinking they know the future and then make a statement that the majority of people will adopt bitcoin.
This bubble is a lot different than the last few. With the crazy price it hit a lot of people have now heard of it.
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:09:00
He didn't ask "what's the federal reserve?"
He asked if bitcoin was the currency wouldn't the government still be collecting taxes.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:28:45
This type of stuff works great when the price is flying high but you gotta take a step back and listen to yourself.
You sound like a stubborn conspiracy theorist or someone in an MLM.
You have been fed information that you believe is the truth and there is no discussing it. Everyone else isn't as informed as you are.
You have found the truth and know the future.
Deep down you know traditional currency isn't play money. Your currency beliefs currently lie in digital money created by people lol.
Bitcoin crashing to 0 would be the best thing for your life as a lesson. You could look at things more objectively. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:17:05
Play money as in fake money right? Traditional currency is behind every economy world wide. You can say it's corrupt but calling it play money is just dumb.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:07:56
We are not talking about the history of money. What is being debated is whether or not traditional currency is "play money" and it's obviously not. It is the backbone of every economy. 
Why are you talking about gold?
This tactic people use a lot. They go off topic and say something correct and then think that they made some great point. Yes other things were used as currency in the past but that's not what I was talking about at all.
Thanks for the history lesson though.

Worthless paper

Right so $1200 in 2013 and $20,000 in 2017.
2021 should be well over $100,000, closer to $200,000. 
2025 definitely a million or more.
Make more charts. HODL, lambos and the moon. 
Most people don't understand the technology and every post about blockchain means everyone is investing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:54:42
It amazes me how bitcoin supporters can keep picturing this ideal world where the price keeps going up and adoption keeps going up until it's mainstream.
This bubble is different, it would be cool to see some statistics from Google about the amount of people searching for bitcoin info compared to the previous run up in price. Basically everyone has heard about it at this point.
It's a belief that the price will continue to go up and there will be mass adoption, not fact. If Bitcoin was truly as amazing as people on this sub think it is the masses would all want to buy some, but the vast majority have heard of it and don't care because they get paid in traditional currency and buy things in traditionally currency. Having bitcoins doesn't do anything for them.
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:25:57
Okay.. I said was the currency he said accepted as currency. Not sure that really changes things 
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:29:01
I already missed a huge opportunity to make money with bitcoin because I heard about it years ago. You could say that about any stock that has had a significant run up, especially penny stocks.
Hindsight is easy that way. What if bitcoin takes off another 200% in 5 years but several stocks have gone up over 1000% in the same period? Looks like everyone who invested in bitcoin missed out on those stocks that went up even higher!
Yes if bitcoin takes off I missed a huge opportunity and hundreds of other opportunities from stocks that have taken off at the same time. For that reason I wouldn't feel anything because I'm always missing big investment opportunities because no one actually knows what's going to happen!
Your logic is the same as me going to church every Sunday and pretending to believe and serve in some God because there is a chance that heaven is real and oh, what if I miss out?
If Bitcoin can make my life better in any way I will jump on it. As long as it remains just a pure gamble that maybe it might take off in value again I'm staying away. I would prefer to take the risk on a cheap lithium stock or something like that lol... which I won't because it's not how I like to invest my money.
Your whole post was about the price increasing, what about the world wide adoption? Seems so rational you just need basically every major company, state/province, and country to be on board.
Instead of listening to any other opinion about it you chose to read articles that are from a website with bit or crypto in it to develop confirmation bias. 
Did it occur to anyone that maybe these few companies accept bitcoin because barely anyone will actually use it to buy stuff but the supporters like you are so brainwashed that it is the basically Jesus so you will support that company? Now their regular customers will buy like normal but all these crypto freaks will only buy from them because they support their belief system. Instant and easy way to get a few more customers.
But don't listen to any counter arguments. Keep using your terms like hodl, to the moon and lambos. Bury your head in the sand and keep that dream of being rich. You found the get rich quick scheme in front of everyone's eyes and now you can laugh at them since you have so many bitcoins you can buy anything because that's all the world accepts as payment now! The gutters are full of poor bums holding tons of useless paper that was traditional currency as your lambo flys to the moon.
If only fools like me would have listened... this will be a reality by 2020? 2023? 2025? The predictions in here of when bitcoin will be worth hundreds of thousands/millions/billions is another thing that makes me laugh every time.
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:09:12
Well there yah go. So now that so many people have at least heard of it why don't people care to use it?
As an average person I don't need it so how the hell is it going to be adopted as a mainstream currency.
You can't tell people what they should be doing. If your business has a good product people will buy it/use it. People quote that bitcoin gives them real control over their money and other stuff well the vast majority of people are not on the same page, sorry.
Buying it hoping someone will pay more for it in the future is a foolish gamble.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:20:31
What am I afraid of? 
Look at how long it takes for things like electric cars to be adopted. Imagine a digital currency to become mainstream world wide.
Read your post again and then think of everyone who thought 2012 was going to be the end of the world.
Your mentality towards bitcoin is not unique. You sound like everyone else who has been brainwashed in some way.

I never said bitcoin is not a store of value, my whole point is that, that is the only thing bitcoin and gold have in common. Also a lot of things store value so the saying "bitcoin is like gold" is wrong.

Yeah there is a difference that you need a bank for, but you changed your argument. First things you said were no different.
Don't you need things in place for bitcoin as well? Or does it just magically fix every currency problem on its own.

Lol! Yeah traditional currency can't do any of those things. 
Point proven, well done

From the 3 things you laid out earlier,  yes you did.

How does bitcoin replace a bank lol.
One is a currency the other is financial establishment.
Hypothetically bitcoin takes over as the only currency, are people not going to need loans anymore?
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:28:49
You don't need an atm or bank to transfer money because everyone uses etransfers now. Yes, transferring to other parts of the world may not be easy but no one needs a bank or atm to give someone else money. You can do it instantly from your phone via etransfer.
That's why the example is stupid.

I do think that buying bitcoin is like gambling as opposed to a long term investment.
I know what it is, the post talks about gains. I'm just saying gains are not guaranteed. A lot of people here think it is for the long term, insane gains, like a get rich scheme.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:55:47
Within 10 years bitcoin will be worth 10x its previous all time high lol.
Very real possibility, sure. I mean it's pretty conservative compared to a lot of the predictions on here from rational people.
10 years from now it could be worth next to nothing. 
I've seen so many graph predictions on this sub it's hilarious.

I love bitcoin being the car and traditional currency being the horse and carriage.
Of all the benefits he just listed of paying with a credit card.... somehow in the future bitcoin will be vastly better?
When new, great innovations come around they are obviously better. The only real people arguing against it are the people who make money off of the old way.
A lot of people heard about bitcoin in 2017, yet no one really uses it. It doesn't even come close to being as good as buying things with a credit card. You don't even have any good example of how it could be, besides using an analogy of cars and horses.
This change you're hoping for isn't going to be as easy as transportation. Every major government and company is going to have to agree to do away with traditional currency and start accepting bitcoin for it to become fully adopted. It isn't nearly as simple as people adopting the automobile. Cars could fit more people in and transport much faster, it was obvious.
I know someone is going to mention it so I'm just going to throw out that most countries are far better off than Zimbabwe and Venezuela. I know that's everyone's favorite example on here but to compare them to a first world country is like apples and oranges.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:38:14
You are hilarious. 
Oh yeah I'm making absurd over-generalizations and falsehoods. This sub predicts the future value of bitcoin in the hundreds of thousands of dollars consistently. Many different people, all the time.
They always say the price will go up, not might. 
You're wrong, bud. Your defense falls short when it's clearly all over sub. Nice try to swoop in and just tell me I'm in the wrong. It's all in writing in the history of posts on this sub.

See this is the problem with a belief, like your belief in bitcoin. You don't have any real solid argument why people should use it. You have belief, the whole thing is pure speculation. 
You're main point is that it can be broken down into tiny amounts and traditional currency can only be one cent.
Show me one person in the first world who has a penny on them who isn't willing to part with it for something. Then, that same person would be willing to pay half a cent because 1 cent is just too expensive.
Your point and example lacks logic.

@_date: 2019-01-29 14:53:13
I hear the store of value argument but that only really works if the price does not continue to drop over the long term. Bitcoin could become worth next to nothing, whether people on here want to believe that or not.
You're speculating on the future use of payments with bitcoin. For this to happen that would mean that people would have to find a way to buy and use bitcoin. You're underestimating the resistance people have to change. People work for most of their lives are not going to be excited about changing their currency and figuring out the best bitcoin wallet to use when they can just buy things the same way they always have.
Visa and Mastercard are huge companies with tons of money, check out their stock price history. They have made investors money for years and years. Even if there is a benefit to paying with bitcoin it faces the huge barrier of people actually adopting it, and then these gigantic companies not offering lower fees and competing to keep business going as usual.
The widespread use and bitcoin going much higher in price is not going to be nearly as easy as you think.
You have to realize you're talking about changing a currency here, that's a crazy thing to change. Traditional currency has so much behind it with banks and infrastructure. 
People taking their hard earned money (which a lot of people don't even have much to any disposable income as it is) and changing currency that is not backed by any bank or government, just to buy things when they can just buy it like they always have, is just insanity to me. 
Young people with a lot of disposable income may give it a try but that's few and far between.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:23:39
You're counting on people adopting this, so difficult and taking a long time is not exactly ideal, right?
Please explain to me how instant micropayments with bitcoin are better than someone paying with a credit card.

I've been posting in this sub for awhile in attempts to offer resistance.
So many people here truly believe bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme.
It is terrifying to see people comment on how much they invest in bitcoin, you could lose everything.
Bitcoin becoming almost worthless is significantly more likely than first world countries facing the same issues as Venezuela and Zimbabwe. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:17:13
Yeah but most people need a loan.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:41:25

@_date: 2019-01-27 14:49:19
I did! Lol
I saw bear market, shares of companies and just skimmed the post.
But, bitcoin may never go above like 5000 US ever again. So many people make posts on here that make it seem like a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:13:12
I can't see it being a main stream thing.
I also can't see people only using bitcoin as currency so I guess my hypothetical situation doesn't really work in my mind to begin with lol
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:04:08
That's only smart if the price increases in the future.
People on this sub are so sure the price is going to sky rocket again, they talk like it's a get rich quick scheme.
There is a risk that you will not make any gains.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:13:26
I don't see why those things would need to be less than a cent, lol. You could get or tip or whatever 100x before you reach a dollar, which isn't that much money.
I do not see the need to cut a cent in half or more. I don't think anyone really thinks 1 cent is a significant amount of money. I would walk past pennys on the ground all the time as a kid.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:33:57

Do you read this sub? People talk about the price sky rocketing all the time.
It's not very few based on the posts on here, it's definitely the majority.
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:59:12
Get away with it in the sense that your money is gone.
Your point is fair enough in the second paragraph but that really has nothing to do with bitcoin. 
Are you saying that bitcoin is going to reshape the financial system and we as consumers will be offered things like credit cards made simple? Except instead of traditional currency it is bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-06 00:51:05
You can't pay for things or hold money without a bank?
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:16:39
Take it from a typical, every day person. I see no way bitcoin can make my life better.
I pay for everything with a credit card and get thousands for doing it. I just transfer the payment from my account to the card and never pay interest. I send money via etransfer or direct transfer if they use the same bank.
I've read a lot on here and bitcoin is complicated and unnecessary. People who believe in bitcoin seem to fall into two categories -
1) The belief that the price is basically going to increase forever into astronomical levels and buying bitcoin is basically a get rich quick scheme.
2) The belief that the whole financial system is going to fall apart and people all around the world will choose bitcoin as their currency, then it will become the world's currency. Basically, a doomsday prepper.
I don't believe either will happen. This sub is filled with hilarious nonsense of pumping up bitcoin. The huge price rise in 2017 had a lot of people talking about bitcoin. Basically everyone knows what it is now. Next to nobody actually wants to use it.
The terrifying thing about this sub is that I think a lot of people have been brainwashed and are spending a lot of money investing in bitcoin. They listen to only bitcoin supporters for confirmation bias and truly believe the price can only go up in the long term.
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:27:23
That makes sense but I'm sure that's only a few sites.
What's the other part of your decision? I can't see any logic behind it. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:19:58
Why would I want to pay someone a half cent?
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:23:29
I agree with some things but don't pretend that someone is going to steal money off my credit card and get away with it. The argument could be used against bitcoin because people have lost tons of money on exchanges. Visa and Mastercard will help you out if anyone steals money from your card, who helps with the stolen bitcoin? I know, I know - proper wallets, it will be better in the future, yadda yadda. But that's why it is confusing to people now and bitcoin is not superior for folks.
I've seen many young tech savvy people say they don't care about bitcoin. Don't paint a picture that the young people in the know all support bitcoin and as soon as others understand it, it will become mainstream. 
As I said before money is already digital, I never use physical cash. This is something that I constantly see on this sub, you talk about bitcoin as if it's the only digital currency and traditionally currency is still just paper, physical transactions.
If traditional currency can become cheap to send to different countries then all bitcoin really has going for it is that it isn't tied to any particular country or region. 
Bitcoin is a bet that in the future the masses will want to use it over traditionally currency. But if traditionally currency continues to be more digital and improves with transfers etc. People like you are going to have an awfully hard time convincing others to ditch what they have been using forever and to use bitcoin.
What about major corporations and governments? If they don't support bitcoin is it the masses who are going to demand bitcoin as the currency?
There is so much that would need to happen for bitcoin as a main currency to happen. It is a long shot and a tough bet. People on this sub all talk as if it's a guarantee.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:10:43
I hear you, but is it possible to improve the things mentioned with traditional currency?
I understand there is room for improvement with payment processing, accounting, transferring across borders etc.
What if that is improved with traditional currency? 
If you don't see mainstream adoption in he next 10 years then this bitcoin investment is a real, real long shot.
There is new technology developed around it, sure. But existing financial institutions have a lot of money. Bitcoin doesn't look good to me for such a long term bet.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:41:54

I don't have any debt. I'm 30 and have approximately 115000 saved. My wife is debt free and well and has a good amount of savings.

@_date: 2018-11-21 17:01:48

If you want people with 0 knowledge begin to understand bitcoin you should say it's a digital currency.
Saying like gold is going to make people think bitcoin is a tangible coin.
Talking about different interpretations is just like how I said bitcoin is like a painting, try that analogy instead of gold lol
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:35:49
I would be interested to hear why you're invested in bitcoin if you don't fall into either category. 
Well, I heard about bitcoin a long time ago and once I figured out what it was, I was not interested. Then, the crazy rise in price in 2017 I was reading about it a bit more, joined reddit soon after.
I've always been interested in investing and the things posted on this sub have always been pretty funny to me. The talk is very similar to people who fall into groups. A lot of logic gets thrown out the window and it becomes just a big circle jerk, lol. There was a post about how a Tim Hortons location would not accept $100 bills and that's why we need bitcoin, lol. As if debit and credit cards do not exist. It was upvoted and had lots of comments supporting that "logic".
I like to post on the sub to offer resistance because, like I said earlier, the amount of money some people are pumping into bitcoin is terrifying. It is a speculative investment, the price could fall and be worth next to nothing. 
So I come for a laugh, offer resistance to the idea that bitcoin is the second coming of jesus, and hope to put doubt in the mind of someone who was going to put a lot of their money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:08:56
That's not a bad explaination at all lol
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:32:37

@_date: 2018-11-21 17:31:30
The points I mentioned were the 3 things you said in a previous post.
It's not like gold at all. It stores value, that's it. You can come up with all the long winded explanations you want.
Paintings store value, houses store value, antiques store value, diamonds store value, lots of shit stores value and is nothing like bitcoin.
Gold is not like bitcoin.

When you have that amount of money, safe investments with a small return is still a crazy amount of money. A 3% return on a billion dollars is 30 million dollars.
You think institutions are going to put billions of dollars into a currency that isn't used for a whole lot. They are also going to hope that this extremely volatile price is going to continue to go up over time?
Why not? I mean it's only billions of dollars if it doesn't work out. Also, their* billions.

Why do people keep saying bitcoin is like gold, it is nothing like gold.
Gold is a tangible asset that has many uses besides a store a value.
Bitcoin is a digital currency.
They both store value, that's it. With that logic you could say bitcoin is like a painting lol
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:18:14
Why would they drop it? What would make them accept it again in the future?
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:04:37
The charts you folks come up with are nuts lol.
Well done, another one for Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:57:14
Oh so that's why the stock has gone down so much
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:52:33
Lol! Bank cards won't work but your bitcoin will!!
Just a heads up the entire financial infrastructure is set up to take bank cards and not bitcoin. So not only would it have to basically be the end of the financial system, there would have to be a completely new financial infrastructure put in place. 
Also, if the financial system in first world countries collapse and you can't buy anything with traditional currencies, you're much better off investing in living off the land than in bitcoin. Every business would shut down and there would be complete chaos.
Companies are not going to continue to ship food and goods into cities if they are not getting paid. Crime would run rampant and who is gonna put their life on the line for peace? The cops or military? They aren't getting paid anymore so they are just going to try and save their families.
Your doomsday scenario would be like a real life horror movie, not a victory for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:27:19
Why would it take balls? It's basically guaranteed to exponentially increase in price forever and be adopted as a world wide!
It takes balls to hold onto useless paper known as traditional currency, am I right?
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:00:37
People have lost their bitcoin, there are tons of articles of people losing a lot of bitcoin. It might be basically impossible to "hack" but it doesn't mean it's the most secure currency.
Do you think that if bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency that people will stop using credit cards? I saw a few threads on here celebrating Mastercard thinking about using bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:50:30
If they had bitcoin there would have been no issues.
Now that they are buying bitcoin it is fixing all of their issues.
Wanna know a way to die of alcohol poisoning? Drink everytime someone in this sub brings up Venezuela lol
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:19:44
You contradicted yourself in an explaination and then called me ill informed and ignorant. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:06:48
No you don't understand, this guy is talking about the entire financial system collapsing so that bank cards don't work anymore. So there is no more traditional currency. That will send the world into complete chaos. You won't need to buy anything anymore. No way everyone is just going to unanimously agree that we should just replace traditional currency with bitcoin and make the infrastructure changes.
It will be chaos, crime, murder, lawless. 
By live off the land I mean go somewhere safe, get shelter, grow, forage, and hunt for food. Try and find a good water source.
No one is going to ask for bitcoins, the financial system has collapsed and no one can buy or pay for things anymore.
This is a realistic doomsday scenario. Everyone being peaceful and adopting a digital currency that the energy grid can't even support isn't a reality. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:47:35
Three months! That's a great timeline. I love when bitcoin believers give timelines and price predictions. 
I didn't mean it was ridiculous because it wasn't true. 
It's ridiculous because even if bitcoin becomes a worldwide currency there are still going to be a lot of people in the world who can't use it. This isn't even taking into consideration the insane amount of energy that would be required in this hypothetical world.
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:52:15
You can say I'm not informed all you want but just like the other guy who made a similar claim you're basically contradicting yourself.
-"More people using bitcoin does not mean more power used."
Okay this is your opening statement.
- "In fact all evidence points to the contrary, that bitcoin is actually very good at pushing renewable energy. Bitcoin miners always want the cheapest electricity and the most efficient miners."
Immediately you make an illogical statement. The contrary of energy used would be energy conservation. You think that renewable energy is the same as conserving energy? You realize that energy would be used for something else if it was bitcoin mining right?
- "Sometimes the problem with electricity is that you got too much of it in one place, bitcoin mining allows that excess (usually very cheap) electricity to be used by moving the miner to the source"
This is so dumb, it's kind of hard to believe. Sometimes you have too much energy so bitcoin mining is good because it uses that excess energy right??
Tie this back to your opening statement, I hope you can see that you contracted yourself. You said more people using bitcoin doesn't mean more power used. Then you explain that it uses mostly renewable energy and mining can be done in places where they have excess energy.
So it does consume a lot of energy, you're just saying it can consume it in the right places.
To use bitcoin you need miners. 
Bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country right now.
If billions of people started using it every day like regular currency there would need to be more bitcoin mining. 
More mining means more energy used. Going from basically no one to billions is significant. 
That's all I'm going to say back to you. Much like the other guy, the more you said the more it became obvious you don't even know what energy consumption means. You seem to think that renewable energy and electricity prices have something to do with consumption.

These posts are my favorite part of this sub, makes me laugh every time.
So you're saying the price could go up or down? Thanks for providing numbers and years.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:04:19
Great so that's everyone on the planet. Great news for bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:11:45
The use of bitcoin is next to nothing if it was a world wide currency. You're comparing mining and use right now when basically no one uses it.
If you don't think complete adoption of bitcoin at a currency is going to require more mining then there isn't a point in talking about it.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:16:38
Also 7 is ridiculous. 
If bitcoin becomes a worldwide currency that means everyone will have access to it? 
This sub puts their foot in their mouth all the time. Bitcoin is like Jesus to many people on here. Just a miracle that can basically do anything.
Feel free to tell me to leave this sub if I don't think bitcoin is the greatest thing ever. It's never healthy to have opposing views.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:06:10
Deliberately obtuse.
Oh don't wish me luck, you just basically admitted to gambling (assuming you own some bitcoin). 
Good luck to you!
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:23:43
Yeah depends. 
Basically no one is using bitcoin to buy anything and it uses a lot of energy, as much a small country. 
The change to billions of people using it every day is going to use a lot more energy.
You say "depends".
From basically no one to billions of daily transactions. 
Sorry dude, it will use a lot, A LOT more energy.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:39:40
But..... Around 3 months or so. Let's say 2 months to a year to be safe.
Doomsday prepper mentality for sure. It's almost a guarentee that there will be issues in the future, I really like listening to Ray Dalio. 
The idea that everything is going to collapse and only bitcoin is going to be left standing. All the people will then buy as much bitcoin as they can as the price skyrockets and people like you are now super rich... This is not going to be a reality. 
Bitcoin is barely used for transactions and look at how much energy it uses. I'm in energy management. There is a reason why utilities and governments offer energy management programs. We need energy conservation to offer a reliable grid. How the hell is bitcoin going to be the mainstream currency?
Bitcoin somehow becoming a mainstream currency is the real doomsday scenario. There would be an energy crisis trying to support this new money system.
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:57:30
Yes it does. The obvious reason is more use bitcoin (basically no one to billions of people world wide) means more need for mining. Mining uses a lot of energy.
I just explained to you in your other comment that you don't know the difference between energy conservation, renewable energy and energy prices which is kind of shocking.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:29:20
You sound mad
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:39:54
It's not a long post, I hope you can figure it out.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:28:58
It would for sure, 100%. Basically no one using it to billions using it daily. This is the most obvious thing that you're debating me, it's ridiculous. 
Why does it matter? Our current financial system doesn't use nearly as much.
You compare Google to bitcoin? Look at how much people and companies use Google every day! It has changed the world! 
At first I thought you were worth talking to. The more you post I can see you're not worth the time.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:51:26
Of course not. More people buying and using something wouldn't make it more valuable. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:03:25
Okay so if everyone in the world is using bitcoin that will not result in more bitcoin mining and more energy use?
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:42:25
You sound really smart.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:17:59
I never said bitcoin was a scam. My post had nothing to do with the price of bitcoin either.
I had to double check that you actually replied to my post.
I have no idea what point you're trying to make lol.
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:18:30
That's because a lot of people see bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:35:11
-you live in chaos.
-you're always ahead if everyone else, leading edge of society. 
-you have already been through a financial collapse and it's not that bad.
-not a big deal because at the end you're all happier and healthier.
Oh and it's going to happen in other places too? This is too much lol. You're like a narcissist trying to sound like religious preacher.
I do wish you well though, especially if your country has gone to shit.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:47:56
Zero risk get rich quick schemes are hard to find.
