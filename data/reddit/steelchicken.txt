I was into Bitcoin way back then, mining and everything.   I was using Mt Gox before their first incident.  I don't even remember the year.  Right after the first $20 bubble?  They got hacked around that time.   Terrible security posture.   Once I got access back to my account "whew!" - I sold almost all of it.  Oh well.   
@_date: 2016-04-07 14:33:33
People downvote the truth.  Mt. Gox was known as Mt. HAX for a very long time before the final meltdown.

A bunch of spoiled kids who didn't have a job and could afford to hang out all day and protest "the system" with no clear goals, no agenda, no plan and basically just sat around complaining for two months until ordinary people trying to make a living called their politicians and said "enough of this bullshit clean it up."
Those guys? The ones who had ZERO actual impact on anything?  The ones who just made themselves look bad?  You don't change the world for the better by bitching about the current state, you make it better through actions and giving people options.   Whether or not Cryptocurrency will do that remains to be seen.  All it has done so far is make early adopters rich and provide an alternative financial system for those who need one, but we won't know the long term impact until things settle down.
Right now Bitcoin is the trailblazer, but it most certainly is not the best solution for a long-term viable financial system replacement as it is today.  A few minor code changes won't fix that.

Any of you morons who had anything to do with Mt. H4X after the original security issue way back in 2009/10? or whenever, *deserve* to have your shit lost.    The evidence of their incompetence, lack of concern or care about, well anything was there right in front of you.  Even after that big original snafu, Mt. H4X continued to fuck up and screw up and not give a single shit about you or anything else.    
Bitcoin was and is, the wild wild west.  There is no government to come and save you or regulate it (which is what you wanted! Well, you get it!)

One incompetent company buying another.  What could possibly go wrong?
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:24:25
Meh it depends.  I bought 6950's when I could, and then bought some 5830's for $100 when the 6900's were gone.  If bitcoin tanks, ill keep the 6900's for my main rig and sell the 5830's for whatever I can get for them.

Im not bailing out of bitcoin altogether, but once MtGox is back I will be removing all my assets out of MtGox and continue mining.  Ill then wait and see what happens with regards to trading sites.

Dont forget to play with the aggression flag as well.  Also, keep the card cool!

You don't want the 6970 BIOS, because it ups the voltage.  You just want to unlock the shaders via BIOS mod.  This pin thing you are talking about is bogus.

The thread you linked to is more than sufficient.

America tried isolationism once, which is in line with our older national character.  God-damned Euros wouldn't stop dragging us into their squabbles.   Now the US is a MIC beast, born of out of perceived necessity, right or wrong.

I see more barter in everyone's future.  Figure out how to tax that, you government pricks.

Good luck tracking it.

More noobs come along every day that need to be warned about Mt. H4x.

Thats been their M.O. from the beginning with just about everything, including security.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:30:01
They had traffic and security issues and they still haven't learned how to scale or deal with surges in activity.

Love you or hate you? Actually neither.  Narcissist.

I don't think so.

99.9% of ATM withdraws in the US are free.  I don't know why people keep taking single points of data and extrapolating that nation wide.

You've been sucking for 3+ years.  When are you going to get your shit together, if ever?

People make mistakes once in a while.  Mt. H4x makes mistakes consistently...and somehow people continue to trust them.  Boggles my mind.
