Meanwhile if you hedged 50% at 500 and then bought when it crashed to 170 you would be better off. Sell high, buy low, not the other way round.

Can you predict exactly the moment it drops or to what level?
If no, then it's a good idea to secure the profit in less volatile resources.

Because every bubble bursts at some point. BTC is quite volatile and you should hedge your investment.

I'm not trying to predict future, I'm just saying what I think is the value without the hype.
Dinosaur is cool too.

I think you misunderstood. What I mean is ignore the exponential growth parts, look just at those linear. Another user linked a chart in response to my comment which shows what I mean.

No, for non bitcoin stuff you have to:
turn 180 if it's NASDAC, turn 90 degree right if it's odd day and it's FOREX, turn 90 degree left if it's even day, it's FOREX and the sun is overcast. Look at the chart in 7th dimension if Cthulhu has returned.

It is, that's why I'm not telling anyone to hold, buy or sell. IMO Bitcoin is still overvalued and will be for some time.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:42:52
Or sell and buy back when it's lower.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:00:23
Meant buy *back not buck, and long time ago... With how fast price changes one would have to watch the value 24/7 to do it at the right moment.

The price is the black market willingness to use the bitcoin (but that'll be getting smaller as cryptos more focused on anonymity enter), and willingness of people to pay the transaction fees, and profitability for the miners I guess. 
I wonder what will transaction times and fees get to when miners shift to easier coins if bitcoin goes below profitability for them. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:09:21
Yep, more or less that IMO.

Look at the 3 or 5 year chart. Find the moment it goes exponential. Draw a line that aligns with the growth that's before the point you found. You have more less your real value.
That big exponential bump - that's pump and dump and boy did they pump with all the articles in news outlets.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:34:02
The thing is I'm not trying to predict the future, I tried to answer what's the actual value of bitcoin, IMO currently without the hype/pumping it's in $2k - $3k range, so I'm not going to invest in it now or until it gets closer to the line on the chart posted. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:45:24
No, my assumption is that exponential growth is caused by pump and dump.
The long term growth remains more or less linear, nothing remotely close to what we've seen.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:09:24
Dammit, you're right, linear ends up lower. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:47:32
Yes, yes, hodl whatever. Trading basing on memes is even worse idea than trading based on charts.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:39:54
The articles I've seen were only talking about how quick the value is going up and how to buy your first btc. It was the same around $350 in 2014 IIRC.
