Did you even read my comment? I am only saying that backups on removable drives are better than backups on the cloud. I don't care about the rest of it like whether bitcoin is ready to go mainstream or not.

Nah the US would simply engineer a regime change. I doubt a single shot would be fired. Remember the US has bases in Saudi Arabia. The threat of sanctions and military force should be enough.

Are you aware that electrum is free and the people developing it are all working for free? That's opensource for you. It takes a long time for user friendly open source software to come about. 
Consider the browser you are using. If it's chrome or firefox then it's opensource but it took many many years for it to evolve into its current user friendly shape. The fact that there was a revenue stream (firefox) or a rich sponsor (chrome) helped a lot.
If you are willing to fund the services of a UI expert to work on electrum or another wallet then you could get what you want soon. Otherwise you will have to wait for volunteers to do it.

You mean it wasn't available all this time? I thought they had started this months ago. There was a price rally and everything.

It is easy and not beyond their capabilities and I believe those who care about their money will do it. If they don't then they have no one to blame but themselves if they loose money.
Again I will point out that deterministic wallets only need to be backed up once. That backup can be in the shape of the mnemonic written down on a piece of paper that is then put in a safe place. With electrum you have to do this as part of the wallet creation process. In other words you cannot avoid making backups. You have to do it from the get go.


I don't agree with this. Every computer system relies on users not screwing up. Even in meatspace we rely on people not to screw up.

No not eternally lost. A future civilization may be able to harvest the energy of entire suns using dyson spheres and use that to power a mega super computer. They could generate a corresponding private key. 
Or somebody could get lucky before that. Really, really lucky.

What if the world ends and we all die? What if the bank goes under and you loose all your money? I don't really get your point. If you don't want to use bitcoin then don't.

What a horrendous mess this is!
What if you choose to not participate in their instant confirmation thing? 
What happens if you choose not to move your funds? They say no transactions will be allowed. Are they serious about that? It means you can't use greenaddress for long term savings of any sort. Even short term if you get sick and wind up in the hospital or something your funds might expire and then you are screwed.

Bitcoin as a whole is directed at sophisticated people. Have you tried bitcoin core? It's pretty sophisticated. Electrum is considered one of the easier clients.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:45:39
Difficulty adjusts to changes in network hashing rates. Difficulty adjusts to ensure that the network generates one block on average every 10 minutes. If mining becomes too costly compared to the revenue miners make network hash rate drops and difficulty drops along with it. 
In the future transaction fees will be higher to compensate miners for the lack of block subsidy but difficulty may be lower too.The downside is that a lower network hash rate does mean a less secure network.

If they need handholding they should not use bitcoin or wait until someone they trust provides that handholding service for them. Bitcoin may never go mainstream and I don't mind if it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:59:36
Why is reserving different than buying? I don't understand.
This is what I think:
- Most western consumers are not using bitcoin yet so that is why he needs to work on adoption at home.
- You still need a 3rd party like bitpay to take bitcoin. The currency is too unstable to hold for long. That 3rd party will still be in a western country because that is where you have the most developed banking systems and all the big bitcoin exchanges. So you have the same problem you have with getting CC merchant accounts where an African hotel has to prove itself worthy.

The rest of the world is even more invested in the USD than the US itself. No one wants to see the dollar collapse. If there is to be a "regime change" at the international level then it will be a quiet gradual one. Just like how the British passed the baton to the Americans and then gradually the sterling gave way to the dollar in central banks' reserves.

You..are.. joking... right??? All computer parts are made in China. The computer you used to type this message in is made in China. I've been waiting for a cheap Chinese trezor clone for ages. In time there will be reputable Chinese brands of these just like with everything else electronic.
SatoshiLabs needs to outsource manufacturing to China and lower prices if it wants to survive. The Trezor was always overpriced. Competition will push them to lower prices.
And LOL at we don't need cheaper! Maybe you like spending more than required. But for most consumers cheaper is good.

Storing your private keys online, encrypted or otherwise, is foolish. Blockchain.info wallets keep getting cracked even though the only thing stored on blockchain.info's servers is an encrypted copy of your wallet. So how does that happen? The encryption get bruteforced because people suck at picking passwords.

It's unlikely a bank is going to invest in bitcoin because it would be like helping their enemy. But if they were to invest then:
- Believe it or not they have banks in Slovenia and China too. I bet there are JP Morgan branches in both countries. It is not unheard of for banks to send money across borders. In fact that is one of the services they provide to their customers!
- There were alternatives within the US. Second Market's dark pool for instance.

From the 3 in the list I would buy bitcoin. If I had the option of doing whatever I wanted with the money I would just save it.

Hate to break it to you but mining is already very centralized and nothing bad has happened. There must be like 2 or 3 large pools that have the vast majority of the network hash rate.

Haha ha! Pumpity pump! Dumpity dump! There goes another fake pump and now a dump! The truth is now starting to come out that it was all a lie. 
First it was 25 states. Then 24. Then 14 legally and another 8 that "have told us we don't need licenses" for a total of 22. Now one by one the states are saying we didn't authorize this! First CA. Now NY. Which one is next?

White man parachuting in to lecture the locals about how they should live their lives before helicoptering out. NGOs and consultants have been doing this for decades. It's a lucrative gig but rarely leads to any concrete changes. The biggest problem is the foreigner has no idea about the problems and constraints the locals face and frankly does not care. He thinks he knows everything. Arrogance!

No it just means that the sort of software that would make it "accessible to more people" hasn't been created yet.
Electrum's next version is going to be even more complicated. It's going to support bip32 HD wallets which is a complicated concept in and of itself. It's going to support multisig. It's going to support cosigning.

Yes. Why is it so hard to copy a file to a USB drive or write down some words on a piece of paper? Lay people use USB drives all the time. They use pen and paper all the time too. With deterministic wallets you only need to make a backup once and it's good forever.

Ok this builds on my previous comment above about hotels targetting western tourists. Work on adoption at home and get western consumers to use bitcoin.

You must be mistaken. I bet there is a lot of regional trade and it is mostly in cash. That's how things get done in poor countries. Cash.


How would bitcoin help hotels? They are targetting western tourists and people in the west prefer paypal and credit cards.

A play store app means lots of possibilities. Google doesn't do a very good job of keeping malware out. Certainly they are not going to keep a look out for bitcoin stealing malware.
Here how to narrow down the possibilities:
- Have you installed an app recently? 
- List your apps here and when the other victims google for this sort of thing they can compare their apps to your list and see if there are any common ones.

Sorry I'm not very familiar with android. It maybe that permissions are set up so that the wallet file is not accessible to other apps.

By now it's obvious that bitcoin is a great deal for merchants. Are these merchants going to do something to make it popular among consumers? If they offered discounts or sponsored a few of the open source wallets they could make it more attractive to consumers.

Sorry about your loss mate. The encrypted wallet file is stored on the filesystem and probably every app has access to that. A short pin isn't much protection.

Yes it's a push tech rather than pull so you can't take advantage of consumer inertia. But it's cheaper so there's that. Hosting companies have been big adopters:
