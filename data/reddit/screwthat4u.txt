Not true, the price is only affected by trades, so if no one moves that 3600, it does not affect the price. Sort of like when people say inflation is directly proportional to the money supply.

People's wallets can get compromised by viruses or lost by computer crashes, if you lose your wallet's private key you can no longer move that money and it is stuck there forever. So a paper backup is good in case your computer breaks. Keeping them on a computer that hasn't been online is good in case you download some crappy software that steals your private key

Another chargeback from a car rental place that tacked on insurance fees months after a rental where I said no insurance

Encryption relies on multiplying data by large prime numbers, one is public the other is private. It's easy to multiply both prime numbers together, but near impossible to factor the two numbers after they are multiplied.

Really hashing is random, you could hash outside a pool and still get lucky. As mining gets harder people will get discouraged leading to less miners and then easier mining. It will find a balance between the cost of mining and the value provided

Say Ben Bernake decided to use his powers to buy bitcoins and destroy them. This would raise the price of bitcoins per USD and make bitcoin holders very very rich.

Reformat your computer. You most likely downloaded some bitcoin related software that was tainted
@_date: 2012-11-04 03:33:58
Depends on your hardware. When you mine you repeatedly create 256 bit hashes of data looking for one that is below a certain special number. The first one to do this gets 50 btc. But most people mine in pools (groups of other miners) and split the 50 btc between everyone based on their hash rate. (mining outside of a pool could take months before seeing any return) A pool like bitminter.com has no fees and gives you a nice java application that hashes using your video card. Different video cards have different hash rates resulting in different payouts that happen continuously as you mine with the client.
Google around for expected monthly btc rates using whatever hardware you have available. My 7970 can generate about $40 bucks worth of bitcoins a month
You may also want to go to the official bitcoin site and download the bitcoin-qt application to create your bitcoin wallet that bitminter.com will send coins to

Miners want money, so they create bit coins and exchange for cash
Drug addicts want drugs, so they exchange cash for bit coins
Investors want to make money, so they invest and hope to cash in on an increase in value (or merely maintain value as they fear the dollar will crash similar to the reasons why people hold gold and silver)
Foreigners who are tech savvy use it to avoid fee's from wiring money back to family
A few use it as a medium of exchange to buy things on bitmit like video games and girl's used underwear

escrow is how it is done on bitmit... You send the coins, they see it in escrow, they send the stuff and sign a release, you get the stuff and sign the release, escrow gives them the coins.
I guess you could keep the stuff and not release the coins, but you already lost your money at that point. And with feedback systems that would be the last time anyone sent you anything

You dont need 6 confirmations, one should be sufficient. I wouldnt take a zero confirmation payment though, as a high priority double spend could destroy it. Eg: pay with no fee from an account with lots of input addresses, leave with zero confirmations, transfer from same wallet to another one of yours this time paying the fee

Let me try again then, to change the algorithm one would have to change the mining software / protocol and have some sort of consensus among a majority of the miners to use the new method over the old method.
Say ignore everything past block xyz and start with this new algorithm after that point.
But if no one mined and used the new changes it wouldnt go anywhere as they'd just keep working away with existing methods

My computer is always on for folding and I already had a Diamond HD7970 (I just wish I started mining sooner as I bought it on launch day)
My electric bill before mining ~$58 after mining ~$64 (5.06 cents per kwh, ~200w usage from 7970) [Calculated power cost is $7.52 a month]
I started mining on november 1st 2012 and made about 7 bitcoins. I bought Rage steam gift for 1.4 bitcoins from bitmit and sold some bitcoins on two seperate occasions:
11/26 Sold 2 btc @ mtgox for $12.46000
$24.77 in bank after fee's from dwolla and mtgox
1/9 Sold 3 btc @ mtgox for $13.79881
$41.14 in bank after fee's from dwolla and mtgox

The blockchain is a public ledger of account numbers with debits / credits to accounts. Once bitcoins are in your account everyone knows about it as public record. (It's anonymous in the fact that no one knows account number abc belongs to you) Here's mine for example: 
To send payments from your account to another you must first write up a transaction, digitally sign it, and then send it out to a p2p network of miners. They verify that you signed the transaction using your public key, perform computational work on your transaction as well as other transactions received to generate a magic hash that starts with certain amount of leading zeros. A hash simply translates a lot of data, into a smaller number using standardized algorithms. Whoever generates the magic hash key and reports it first wins, and the transaction is added to the block chain and the miner gets some bitcoins for the effort.
Edit: "there's no out there with his finger on a button waiting to recall everyone's bitcoins"
It would be like if someone tried to put his face on everyone in the movie 300 and expecting people to fileshare it like the original
"then that means it can be changed"
People that run the p2p software want to be paid, that incentive means they don't want to waste time using a different method, if a worm went out modifying the code as it ran somehow they would have to infect 51% of all miners at minimum in order to alter the block chain as the majority consensus wins

Get a wallet.dat file and public address first from the bitcoin application and get comfortable with the fact that you send money to the public address and you need the wallet.dat private keys to actually move that money out of that address. Buy like 0.01 bitcoins just to get something to your address as practice.
Then when you feel comfortable with that start buying 20k worth, I'd transfer it over in 1k chunks and sell them through the course of a day. The longer you leave money in campbx the bigger risk you have for it disappearing into some random address if you somehow compromised the security of your computer browsing nefarious sites about bitcoin.
Enabling two factor authentication is also smart, as a password and cellphone help stop any would be hacker from accessing your account. But also do all transactions from a safe computer, not one that has malware or cross site scripting craziness going around on it.
