Sigh such a true statement, it hurts my heart.

Its getting kind of interesting looking at people's stashes and wondering how much they can actually off load.  Yes Ulbricht stash is today worth 1.9b but its not like it can be unloaded instantly.  Hell most exchanges are taking their sweet time getting fiat into accounts.

Dan4334 you make a  number of valid points.  I'd like to add that bitcoin is the vicitim of its own success at this point. With long as fuck transfers times, rediculous fee's and people are simply not using bitcoin as intended. Which is going to result in the coin eventually hitting its real market value, which will be dictated by how one can use a bitcoin.  That real world impact is minimal at best, at this stage.
  
Right now Bitcoin is at where it is due to speculation, painting the line trades and new investors willing to buy the smallest amount of coin for a premium. Not many people are selling entire coins to other people, its mostly small translations laden in fees.   
Bitcoin has value don't get me wrong but until it starts to go beyond speculation and hording its going to lose its luster. It may stay above 8k but if people don't buy and people don't sell its value will just sits their holding its dick, hell even if the value stays above the 12k mark is it really 12k if no one is buying and no one selling?  Being able to unload it and getting it in fiat or in some form of tangable good will allow bitcoin to flourish.

That is smart, turning a speculation market into a gold market.  I see a bright and above all secure future for you brother.

Yeah the 10k max for coinbase is ridiculous and its not to far off what other exchanges have for crypto to cash.  So yes the stash mentioned in the post would take many accounts, with many fee's, over many months perhaps even years to get out into fiat. Once again its funny people think their stash of coins is worth something when they can never take its full value out ASAP.  This is why its important for the horders to at least trickle out some coins. Cause if they don't when the market corrects or takes a massive shit (like all markets do, either short or long term) those hoarders will not be able to liquidate fast enough to offset the market taking a shit on their stash.  
To each his own but people are forgetting to calculate how much a market will absorb and how that asset can be turned into usable fiat.  Hoard, sell whatever just remember the cap and make adjustments accordingly per exchange.

You're missing the biggest concept here.  That being Bitcoin isn't capable of buying apples in 99% of people's grocery store.Hell bitcoin has zero impact of 99.98% of people's daily spending habits.  Meaning you're analogy is fucked since I can't buy an apple with bitcoin.  Right now Bitcoin is being propped up by speculation, if Bitcoin doesn't start branching out to more daily spending avenues its going to be nothing more than a ticking time bomb for the person holding the bag.  
 
Right now Bitcoin needs to strike while the iron is hot and move into more areas of spending before it loses its speculation bubble.

Got to love how this article shows a kid worth 6m throwing away all his money on garbage.  Good for the kid but his spending will leave him broke by 25 and he will be sucking people off in back alleys to afford his cars oil change.
