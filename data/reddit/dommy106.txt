I was under the impression that was the overt signal to gain praise from common farmers, but the bigger scale scam was buying illegally labeled Cambodian or Vietnamese rice as "thai" for a significant price premium. This reaulted in billions being siphoned from thailand into the businessmena pockets rather than the poor thai farmers.

Hypothetically, if the fiat monetary system collapses, there is a good chance most of the utilities will go down or be very spotty for the duration. 
What is the threshold of computers in the bitcoin network will be needed to maintain the system? Assuming most computers don’t have their own backup power supply off grid. Can there be a theoretical scenario of a handful of offgrid private computers coordinating trying to take advantage of this blackout period?

I was less concerned about debating the issue of whether power/water would go out or not, but more concerned of a scenario of if it does, how the bloc chain is affected.
In a worst case scenario, pretend all major grid power goes out for an extended period of time. How would the bloc chain function? The only computers online would be the ones who have off grid electricity sources or batteries and an internet connect, correct? Is it up to these computers to keep writing and verifying the bloc chain?
What if a majority of these computers are owned by a single person or a group or nefarious characters working together. Is it possible for them to start creating bogus transactions and verifying them to add to the bloc chain? 
I don’t know enough about how the bloc chain functions, just morbidly curious of worst case scenarios.

Short squeeze would also send the price temporarily higher than normal as that will need to buy (close their positions asap no matter the price)
