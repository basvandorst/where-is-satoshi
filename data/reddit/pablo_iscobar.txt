Price would certainly collapse, given nothing significant has changed at that point.
Right now, fiat backs Bitcoin as sad as that sounds. People are not directly trading BTC denominations.

Hopefully this will clean up the school break onslaught.

Someone said it will connect to the node of my choice, is that so? If that's true, then why are you talking about PoW instead? I'm a bit confused about this. I don't remember setting up which Bitcoin nodes to connect to...

I'm a OpenBazaar n00b so I can be completely wrong, but I don't remember setting up which Bitcoin node to connect it to. I set up my OpenBazaar server, and it connects to other "OpenBazaar nodes" (I assume it's the same as OpenBazaar servers). My OpenBazaar client connects to that. Edit: I mean, it connects to my OpenBazaar server.
So, what Bitcoin node is it connecting to and how did it choose it? This becomes a concern if it could just go in a different chain with different valuation to the one I may be understanding as Bitcoin at the time.
It's complex enough as it is.
Edit: honestly this is shit if I even need to worry what other people consider to be BTC and they may disagree with me or between themselves. There's money on the line. I'd rather transact in any shitty alt provided they at least agree to what it is and its market price.

If you mean for Android/iOS, I don't know of any. For the desktop, I think Electrum does (but I don't use SPV wallets at the moment).

So they could just switch to BCH later on? What happens to balances?
