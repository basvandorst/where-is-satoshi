And now it's back up because it was taken down by mistake.

Oh, your  bullshit doesn't for anywhere else but here?  Wonder why.

There no such thing as a good cop.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:37:28
None.  There's no corroboration of that claim. Everything points to the cops making it up.  The guy who made the claim was convicted of stealing bitcoins and fabricating evidence, so that alone should set off as alarm bells.

Bitcoin, according to the white paper is P2P electronic cash.  Anybody who says it shouldn't be used like cash has an agenda.  Lightning isn't going to save the day.

BTC Core works to ensure crypto never reaches the masses.  BCH works to make P2P electronic cash.

So the article isn't mostly about bitcoin cash?

Fucking retarded jarhead.

I'm just pointing out that this is an article about an altcoin, and were it positive it would be removed.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:24:49
So it's an article about an altcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:41:21
So we can talk about altcoins as long as we also mention bitcoin?  That's not what the sidebar says.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:59:01


Well, I am now!

Yup, that's about the level of discourse you expect from a moron jarhead.  Go play with an ied.

Coinbase is a broker.  GDAX is an exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:35:02
Altcoin discussion.  Mods, why is this still up?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:15:06
This isn't an article about Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:12:27
Do you know what a broker is?  Do you know what an exchange is?  Do you know how they're different?
