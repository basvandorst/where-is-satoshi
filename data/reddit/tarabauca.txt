taxtation IS theft, I'm brazilian and have not declared nor will declare a single satoshi that I bougth

As a Brazilian I find this very funny and sad, but true nevertheless

The limit is BTC, when btc start being the price and not dollar converted into btc
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:03:04
I'd love to see a day (hopefully soon) where Bitmain will sell their BCash for BTC, that would be a fun thing to see
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:53:50
As a Brazilian I strongly doubt it, it will be a conservative president elected on the unrest of the population with socialist party, or the fragmented left get together to elect another socialist (very unlikely)
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:49:57
MBL are more to a minarchist than libertarian, but they do endorse right/conservative standards, mostly duo recent socialist/communist uprisings

Not legal, but also not illegal

No problem, I'm glad that I could be of some help

I've held BTC since it was $2k
I didn't sell at $4k
I didn't sell at $10k
I didn't sell at $20k
I don't care about the fiat equivalent to BTC, that's how strong I am
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:24:33
First question - that's because of the demand in those countries, when there's more people wanting to buy BTC with JPY, but there's less people wanting to sell their BTC for JPY, the ones wanting to buy will have to offer more than the people wanting to sell, that's offer and demand.
Second question - that's because BTC is normally the gateway to cryptos, it's way easier to buy less know crypto, ICO and tokens using bitcoin than the currency of a third world country, so the variation of BTC heavily affects the others
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:04:39
A good initiative, wish you luck
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:19:28
That's probably the main reason
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:53:45
I know that felling, I've been dealing with stocks for 4 years, and got on crypto 2 years ago.

Same here, and considering the current situation, a lot of people in this sub may need help now.
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:46:47
Just think, if you sell a piece of land and invest all of it in BTC and if you lose all of it, would that make you starve? If yes, don't do it, if no, do it.
 
Remember the 3 rules of investment:
 
1-only invest in what you understand
 
2-don't invest more than what you can afford to lose
 
3-buy low, sell high
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:12:06
imagine if he invested that on BTC
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:33:39
It actually depends on your country currency, to Americans it's a neglected factor, but to Venezuela, even with the ATH to now, they are up in value
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:56:42
As I already said in this tread, btc should go up when people started seeing the falling market not as "just a correction", but a as "systematic risk", let's watch and wait
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:51:30
If you're North American, just use coinbase, if you're from another country, please tell is what country, so we can try to help you

He said long term, it's 72&amp; in the short term, not even a year since then.
I'm sure that people in 2014 were thinking just like you, and look at the price then and now.
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:04:02
for me it's a mean to a goal.
A goal that for me is the en of the State as we know, the begining of the AnCap society

Larry can buy bitcoin under 50,000 more than 1 time, like 3 orders of 45,000 and then send the bitcoin to you or other address.
The smart thing to do is buy bitcoin slowly and under the radar.
Let's say Larry in China needs to send 1 million to Jerry in USA without attracting prying eyes, I'd advise Larry to do a lot of small values using different means, like "local bitcoins" and exchenges, do that repeatedly over a course of time, months if possible, make it the norm to buy it weekly, so it looks like a private retirement fund at first sight, let's say Larry buys 40,000 in bitcoins every month, but only 15,000 using exchanges, the other 25,000 are bought using less tractable means, it means that if you not consider the devaluation or valuation of bitcoin, Larry would need 25 months to amass the 1 million needed
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:31:16
True, I bought a few times during 2017, and am still up from my initial investment
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:54:32
Well, i have a theory (not really mine) that btc would go up when people started seeing the falling market not as "just a correction", but a as "systematic risk", let's watch and wait

I read somewhere that the foremost date is February 27 - 2019
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:20:20
Sorry for the dumb question, but what could be the effects of it? Wouldn't it mean the Btc would be kind of centralized?
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:36:20
Yes, I agree that they are for now irrelevant to the volume 
@_date: 2018-07-21 11:25:29
That was the most complete answer that I have read in this sub
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:43:11
cough - theter - cough
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:15:00
Just use coinbase, it's one of the most trusted exchanges, since I'm not North American and don't use coinbase I can't help you much, I'm brazilian by the way

I'm ar 1.14 and day trading with bots, been doing that since december
