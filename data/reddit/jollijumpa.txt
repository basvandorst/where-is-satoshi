Legend also has it that people once saved more than they earned. Not being able to save 1.1k is pathetic if you are living in a developed nation. Try cutting back on your consumption or free time.

Get off Reddit and get a job

They have a Nintendo Switch and live in the UK. Let's face it, most people in the first world waste money on alcohol, entertainment, take out food, goods and services, Uber, junk, and aren't starving. Privaleged? The mean income in most of these developed countries is over 30k per year, surely saving 1.1k of that isn't unobtainable. And yes, I have shelter although I am not privileged and earn around the median wage in my city.

Work more, find another/better job, upgrade your skills and save your money. Its sad that 0.1 BTC is unobtainable, that's about the price of an i-phone or less than a months work at minimum wage in most first world countries. It's about 1.3 ounces of gold (sad I know.) Stop being so dramatic, lose the attitude, stop wasting time and 0.1 BTC won't be unobtainable by any measure. You speak English, can write and use technology...

They have a Nintendo Switch, which is 500 bucks and lives presumably in the UK as he discussed its value in GBP...smarten up, it's obvious he's from the West. I was talking about user from developed nations. If he spent less time playing video games and on Reddit 1.1k us wouldn't be difficult to obtain.

It's probably the Japanese or Russians

What confuses me is that the FBI and the media 'know' expert Russian government backed hackers hacked things but they don't know who Santoshi is. Give me a break.

I know many people who don't have coinbase accounts

Meant to say saved more than spend. Also he had a Nintendo switch and lives in a country where they use GBP. Probably England. And yes I am aware most people live in developing nations.
