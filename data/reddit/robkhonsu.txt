Well the author is delusional in thinking that either of these events have anything to do with currency rates. Trust me, Scottland could leave the UK and Baltimore could form their own independent district. Hell, the entire South could leave the Union and people would still value their respective national currencies the exact same.
It would take a disruption in the actual national treasury to cause a devaluing of the currency. OP is just some libertarian fanboy that wouldn't know free market if it threw him under a bus.

Yeah, but not being able to use conventional credit cards is probably a pain in the ass.
