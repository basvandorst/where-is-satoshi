Would you rather send a letter to a friend or an email to communicate quickly?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:58:42
I would file a police report then hire a private detective.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:13:51
Yay my taxes are going down! I can buy more Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:09:04

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:46:03
Oy vey! Bad Goyim!
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:46
No, you have a backup seed.

I have used both and they were instant(debit and credit card).

LIke Jews who run most media are going to portray it in a good light.

Bullshit. I’m not rich but I have been saving and investing my money for 16 years, I started at 20 years old. I did the same as OP. $11k was only a small portion of my overall portfolio. I also make about $70k a year, not much but have no debt, no car payment, house payment etc. I grew up on welfare and at one time I was homeless. So fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:34:49
Yes, keep going! Time to buy.

Man bro, you seem like a nervous wreck. Look, only invest what you do not care to lose. Bitcoin makes up 10% of my total portfolio and, although I believe in it, I do not care if it drops to $1k tomorrow. I believe in the tech, many people do...and I like to give a finger to all the central banks out there.

People have been asking this question from every price point: $10, $100, $500, $1k, $10k. People will be asking this question once it hits: $20k, $50k, $100k etc. You need to learn about what Bitcoin is and why it’s revolutionary, you probably will have your answer to your question once you understand it’s the internet of money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:37:10
The same could of been said of any big revolutions that took place. Give it some time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:05
oliver, gross.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:42
I don’t believe this shit for for a second. How gullible are you people. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:56
Of course.
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:42:44
I will admit I am a long time Newegg buyer. After seeing this I am going to have to check out Tiger.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:55:09
Yay we can invade maybe China, Africa or Japan now. I hate having to use passports and follow another countries laws.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:15:45
Yeah, def going mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:25:24

@_date: 2018-03-18 18:36:09
O wow someone who trusts the government. Ok lad.
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:12:33
Where have you been hiding under?
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:23:13
Not going to happen. Unfortunately all the white countries are being invaded by shitholers. Good luck with a peaceful society without white civilizations.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:35:11
Don’t listen to this retard ^

People's greed are clouding their judgment. It will crash, the bubble will pop. Eventually Bitcoin will fade away.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:28:51
No it's not. The price is relevant.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:37:19
It's reddit, what do you expect? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:58:54
Yeah, I knew about Bitcoin for awhile now. Almost bought in April. Bought some today with money I don't mind losing. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:32:32
Why don't you read up in economics and finances in general. You probably don't have a single investment or know what you're doing, obviously.
