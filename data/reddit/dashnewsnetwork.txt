Shut up government bitch.  Shut up and be patient while Bitcoin liberates you from the IRS slave plantation.  If you could stop dragging your feet and kissing the jackboots, that would be great.

Every night.  Dreams even sweeter than your frosting, my little cupcake.
Enjoy your day at work tomorrow.  I'll be sleeping in until I feel like getting up, just like every other day.

Ha, over the years these APMEX jerks ignored 1000s of our requests to support Bitcoin.  Use an early supporter like Provident, silverround.com, jmbullion.com, gainesvillecoins.com, or silvergoldbull.com instead.
Reward them for being early, not APMEX for bending the knee a bit too late, when they clearly had no other choice.
APMEX didn't accept BTC until today, yet they sold products mocking Bitcoin as fake Ponzi money.  DIAF plx....

This is why woman should not be allowed to vote.
They have no business deciding things best left to males who are willing to take risks.
Ovary logic is for inside the home.  Outside in the real world, courage and having the balls to take risks with new things is the key to survival.

No, but you can blame people for being fat, smug, and arrogantly waving their fiat joobux around in the faces of someone trying to do them a huge favor by conferring very valuable advice.
That foolish ham-whale lady represents everything wrong with ZOG and its client cultures, economies, and narratives.

My colorful expression of contempt for your government bitch ass is totally justified.
But yes, thanks for recognizing my IQ places me well into "rare breed" outlier, as do my substantial crypto holdings.
Now cry more, little pleb.  I'm sure the IRS will comfort you with paperwork and a continued servile tax cow existence.
You don't even own a single Bitcoin do you?  Sad!

'member when the Bcash team tried and failed to steal the BCC ticker from Bitconnect?
They will likewise fail in this attempt to hijack and dilute the Bitcoin brand.

That's right, degenerate into random non sequitur.  Good day, government bitch. 8D

I can't believe you're still crying about that, but it makes me happy.
For the last time, when you attack Bitcoin expect Honey Badger to tear you apart limb by limb.
You don't get to attack Bitcoin without consequences.  Deal with it.

Warn all tax agents they may be held personally responsible by people with very strong anti-coercion views if they persist in their attempts to steal property under color of law.
Bitcoin at $20k buys a lot of street justice....

Roger Ver isn't the Jesus bCash needs, but he's the Jesus bCash deserves.

You're dealing with an intellectual who started stacking Bitcoin when it was under $100.  Sorry you missed the boat.  Try not to be so bitter, OK?
And yes, my academic credentials are impeccable.
Have fun attacking my intellect for not joining in cucking to your IRS slave masters, you grade-A government bitch.

In totally unrelated news, a 600 BTC buy wall just appeared on Polo's XMR market....

"withdrawal via MONERO"
Nice.  Unlike Bcash, Monero is fungible.
BRB, going to make physical Bcash featuring famous tantrum faces.

All those 1000s of commits by Zander to Bclass.
So much time and effort, with nothing to show for it but bitter defeat.
Thrown under the bus by his own toxic community of contentious hard forkers.  Which was entirely predictable.
And nobody even comes to Classic's funeral.
Classic dies not with a bang but with a whimper.
REKT MOTHERFUCKER.  REKT.
