Bitpay and Copay are not responding to support on their wallets either. I had a wallet with 25+ transactions that some were 15+ days to confirm and they were just pending. My balance has not been fully restored and is a mess. I am very ashamed of a company not having the resources to at least answer questions or help with the issues. Shame on you Bitpay:( 
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:39:17
Yes your plan could work to get a cash out. That is the simple answer. I am pretty sure I get what you're asking. It's annoying that a person who is new to bitcoin and even states so in the question they are asking, is getting the smartest people in bitcoin responding with nothing but negative answers.

I am still standing firm with what I have said since I first learned of bitcoin. Bitcoin is here to stay and will fix things we think are not able to be fixed. I am very proud to be a HODL'r:)

With all of this negativity going on about coinbase, I hope they at least address some of it here on Reddit. We are Coinbase as a whole as a community and we deserve to be communicated with when we hear stuff like this. Too big too fast. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 10:51:51
I'm just not smart enough to understand what this is. But I can tell it's a game changer. Not sure how I can tell..? I just can. Congrats and good luck! Oh and thank you! 
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:28:06
I also received the same questions and I answered rather swift as well. The next set of questions were prying and I answered but told them that I was furious about them asking me. To be frank I just told them what they needed to hear to shut them up. It worked and I'm still using them. I cannot imagine my reaction if my credit union asked me the same questions.? I would probably leave them. If Coinbase didn't have such a sort of monopoly going then they would not have the balls to ask this stuff. Obviously they are becoming too big too quick. Shame on this corporate monster for trespassing in our community. IMHO

I can vouch for cryptothrift.com as I have been a seller since day one and have had nothing but good luck. They are EXTREMELY fair on the escrow system and any issues that may come up. If you havent tried yet give it a shot. Super easy to use.

How do you figure? I am buying mining power instantly that is available and being rewarded for mining. I am not sure why so many people hate on companies like this. They even came out with a statement about the 51% fear that they will NOT allow that to happen and that if they stay close they will direct mining to other pools. So tell me why I am wrong and shameful please. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:01:26

@_date: 2014-05-25 18:24:42
I'm not sure why you people keep posting this fud? It has been said many times by ghash that if they get near 51% they will channel mining power to other pools until it goes down. They're a great "miners" pool. Best payouts and easy configuration. I'm staying and adding more power monthly.

UPDATE:::10-8-14  This has now become a major issue..I have waited for almost 4 days now for coins to be released even when the seller has cancelled sale and released funds. It says now when I go to get refund insufficient funds..? If it was truly in escrow wouldnt it be simply released? I am getting nervous that they are not going to release funds. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:04:34

I own 1 antminer and you are right..however the fact is that to achieve 1 TH you have to overclock them to get the full 200Gh unless you buy an extra one and you will use a LOT more electric. So if electric isnt an issue or space, or heat then you are correct.

Rock out bro! I hope you get super fuckin rich and the haters all lose value in their precious fiat wealth because coin takes over. It's up to you though to make sure to spread the word of importance of mining and such. Get some contacts at some of bitcoins most popular companies such as coinbase, bitpay, BFL, and any other halfway famous bitcoin company. Maybe they can sponsor you or make you a spokesman? Maybe you can write songs for them to use in commercials? I'm not sure if you are a true crusader or not..? But if you are good luck kind sir:-)

@_date: 2014-04-12 21:37:20
Needing banks? Needing registered businesses? We are just now getting those 5 years into bitcoin. They are not needed. For the first 2-3 years of bitcoin it had zero of those things and it survived and flourished. So I beg to differ. However if bitcoin is going to keep growing then yes you are correct. The fact is that bitcoin is not going to vanish or fail anytime soon and if you believe it is then maybe you need to go to a conspiracy reddit. I am just a realist that understands the core and I know that no government or group can make bitcoin fail simply because they try or make it illegal. I am not sure if you were involved years ago or not, but if you were then you will completely understand what I mean. The tor network is probably what made bitcoin what it is today and there is zero regulation or law there.

@_date: 2014-04-11 17:37:26
Youre right..So can anything. Chances are extremely slim though. You would literally have to shut down every mining computer in the world and make every single person involved believe that it is worthless. It has been at its lowest lows when it was worth .10 cents. It will be very hard to make it fail. I for one will not let it so it wont. As long as I still use it and mine it then its ok.

Do not sell! You will be happy! I had a friend that I talked into spending $20k when they hit the all time high of $260 in April and he almost sold and lost $5-7k many times out of frustration. Of course I felt like crap for having him buy. Guess what he sold at $1000 and thanks me daily! So be patient and it will work itself out:)
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:47:27

DO NOT SEND BITCOINS. If you do decide to take a chance only use paypal! Please! I almost fell for it..dont do it..but I am glad he used my advice on using a NOTARY at a UPS store.

Coinbase has become the sort of company that you love to hate because they do what they do so well. I mean if all companies had the look and feel of their site we would all use them as well. Unfortunately there are not too many large companies that look and feel good that are actually great. I have read so much negativity about Coinbase lately I'm even second guessing the when I've had no real issues other than them prying into my personal finances just to use their service. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:25:42
Exchanges are way to unregulated and do not have any history of doing the right things yet. We are yet to see an exchange that doesnt allow "GREED" to be the determining factor for most moves made by the admin. Unfortunately in the current state of BTC we need them at this point if we wish to trade for fiat or others alts. As we have seen with large banks and financial institutions, "GREED" is the absolute ruler of all things money. So therefore until BTC is in complete control with complete decentralization influence , nobodies money is safe in another person or places possession. Just my opinion. Good luck on getting your coins back OP. Regardless of how you obtained the coins, I hope you get them back. Oh and also I hope you learn a great lesson as well. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:26:26

Gemini has been sitting on my ID verification for over 90 days and every time I ask them I get no answer. So I wont recommend them. Circle was by far the easiest. RIP
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:15:06
Great:) 
@_date: 2015-08-28 14:30:02
I think its a lot better than the one that is there now. Good job imho. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:21:18
Thanks:) Have tried but not a ton. I will try some more. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 00:33:30
I'm very surprised that nobody brought up mycelium for iOS it's actually the best wallet in iOS in my opinion, and I have used them all. It is a very simple wallet with a little bit of color to it. It also has all those same features that bread wallet has I believe. I've been using this wallet for sometime now, and I personally prefer this one over all of the other wallets that are available on iOS. Although it doesn't make it the best because I like it, you might not like it, but you should give it a try.
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:21:45
Thanks:) I will use some more. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:20:59
Thank you. I have used it a few times and I will try a bit more. I have had good luck so far but just have not used it that much. I will let you know if I have any issues. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:17:35
Thank you for your input. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:05:48
Zero worries. If you want to send me the remainder of the unused card I will make sure it is directed to the right spot.
@_date: 2015-04-02 12:15:20
Great:( I have the same problem and I've deleted the app now. I'm hoping I can get it back in another wallet. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:17:30
OK thanks! 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:52:04
I thought Reddit was the new btctalk anyway? 
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:54:44
Does anyone have any valid points as to why the wallet they chose is the best? I am a reader who was also interested in this question and I have not gained any knowledge from this post that makes me want to download any of these wallets. TIA:)
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:58:35
I agree completely:) Plus its paid for.

This happened multiple times while using breadwallet and coin payments as the timed out processor. Only in the last few weeks has this happened to me though. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:33:32
It will be a great film as long as the information they report is received correctly and from the right sources. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:56:07
I had the same issue yesterday but today I received an email saying that my card transaction went through and it will be mailed to me soon. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:58:12
Wow..that's crazy! I've been waiting for a while on 3 other transactions and all of a sudden they went at the same time! Here is the first of 3 that sat for a while.  
@_date: 2016-10-17 10:35:25
I guess I have to apologize because I guess I don't understand bitcoin as much as you do...it says 12 minutes but I'm assuring you it was three hours from the time that I hit send. Maybe I need to restart my phone because I rescanned the Blockchain at least five times while waiting. Thank you for your comments.

As an avid user of crypto thrift over the last two years I can tell you that it is one of the best trading platforms out there. It is an amazing market with amazing potential. I have been I've been buying and selling on that market for two years and if I ever have an issue it is solved immediately by the staff. I really hope with this new branding of bitify that it takes it to the  next level
@_date: 2015-10-23 14:26:36

@_date: 2019-05-26 15:00:17
After the restaurants we passed in the last 4 hours and finally finding this one while hungry af, you just may have changed your thinking:) I know I did! I even pulled over and picked non ripe bananas to cure the hunger before this place. Food was actually pretty good though:)
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:54:48
This is a great option. I have used for months with no regrets. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:51:55
I think that the way that you can buy bitcoin and then by stock with it that normally couldn't be bought with fiat.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:40:36
Thanks I will attempt that..
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:45:15
I paid $200 and I received 1.90 coins at $102 a coin. Not too bad overall.
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:23:47
The second one is still unconfirmed but I think I know why..Thanks
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:54:36
Unreal..they couldnt even build 1 prototype for the worlds biggest bitcoin event??
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:35:41
Ive sent the coins:) What is my next step? 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:38:44
Yeah! I posted last night about it..I had my coins using a debit card at wal mart before I left the counter!
@_date: 2013-05-18 02:13:14
I am starting to hate that I see the best in everyone..I just want my 3 singles ASAP!
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:48:54
They didn’t end up even taking bitcoin:( menu was also not what was pictured, but after a long day we ate anyway. Lol
@_date: 2013-08-08 17:41:48
It would be very cool to see this take place. I am not happy about the current fees they charge for the wallet service, but if bitcoin was implemented I may pay. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:47:01
bitinstant or btcquick
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:10:06
Sounds like a traders haven? 
@_date: 2013-06-13 18:13:26
I am glad it worked for you!!
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:24:58
Mine did as well! I am so happy they started this!
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:17:56
Very good answer! Rock this project out! I hope this ends up being the one for you! 
@_date: 2013-05-11 02:37:52
I have a buddy who has 15k in there..add that to the tally..he is not on Reddit..
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:03:48
Thats awesome! I am happy so far with my returns!
@_date: 2013-10-14 18:19:55
HMMMM Now theyre offline..? Seems fishy to me!
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:38:17
I have had no problems with them and I have done about 3k worth of transactions with them..the only thing that I dislike is the waiting period and not being able to set a buy order at a lower price. 
@_date: 2013-07-13 23:36:30
Not sure..I am surprised no more people commented.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:40:12
I just received a support ticket saying the transaction was never made?? But now I am banned!..WTF
@_date: 2013-06-27 20:26:04
I am not sure..they just released this way in the last few days..I am sure eventually they will release an android app..but for now the only quick way to get coins that I know of is btcquick.com unless you deposit cash at wal mart for bitinstant. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:28:41
they should be there soon..they just hit 4 confirmations
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:42:10
I had some coins stolen within my account without my normal email approval. Now they banned me! Also they will not answer me! One reply that I did get said in Russian that the transaction never took place? Wtf! 
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:18:51
OH my bad..it was 1.7 btc when I received it.
@_date: 2013-06-13 10:53:33
How much?
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:18:14
Mine are gone!
@_date: 2013-07-05 14:49:24
Mine works fine! All 3 singles are mining in KC at BFL headquarters now. Lol
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:53:21
Don't! They have not made a way to reimburse us users and most of the world also has no ways to get money out. Big big big mistake if you do.

I had the same thing set up however they didn't need my authorization to withdraw the coins as they usually did they actually took my coins and now they've locked me out. I only have regular login though I forgot to put 2F a this account. It's so weird but from what I am reading most people are saying that with two FA are not having problems maybe that was my biggest mistake
@_date: 2013-06-13 11:00:43
Coinbase has been my go to lately, however I have noticed that after I've bought my first 10 btc it is now taking a few extra days to clear..? U got me..
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:38:27
Not everyone wants to go to a place to meet a person to buy a Bitcoin. I am not going to waste my time, gas, or missed connections for the chance of saving a small transaction fee. I understand you wanting bitcoin wanting to be as "organic" as possible with using services like localbitcoins or mining them ourselves, however that is like saying dont buy corn in a can for $1 when you can grow it at $1 for many cans. I for one am very ok with paying fees to get them fast!
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:07:58
Yeah I am sure thats it..

Whats up&gt; 
@_date: 2013-06-29 13:31:33
I know its not cool that it has been removed..I am hoping that its just that the system is so new that they took it down for a day or two because of a bug or something. I know that coinbase is soon implementing a similar system.

QUOTE FROM BITCOINTALK.ORG
One of our group members in Chinese community had an interview with Friedcat today. Above is the brief introduction of what Friedcat has done and planned to be accomplished in the next months.
To be short:
1. 1000T would be released around Nov 7th. These chips may be sold or deployed, depending on the situation then.
2. 2nd Gen chips have already been developed long time ago. But they were delayed to deploy considering the unsatisfactory performance.
3. 3rd Gen chips were also under development during that period. It is already developed now but still under test. It is expected to become a mature product in Feb 2014, which means its key indicators would be much better than those of its competitors. It is estimated that the network hashing power would be 1000p then, while Friedcat would deliver several hundred of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:10:30
I wonder if they have any plans on mining
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:55:02
I believe there are people on bitcointalk.org that will make one for you with the chips. I have 100 chip credits if you find someone and are interested in making one. I will sell the rights to those discounted chips very cheap because I am not going to use them. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:42:36
That is an awesome price! It will make my stock fly! Also it will only take 36 days to get your money back! I dare you to find another product that will return your money in a little over a month and keep making money afterwards for less than a hundred bucks!

Nice job!! It's so stupid that assholes say things like"you'll never make your money back" dude the fact is that you have one of the only things in front of you that does both things. First it helps cure your curiosity about the whole hobby of bitcoin by mining and giving back. Second due to contrary belief you are actually mining money, period. Great share bro.
@_date: 2013-07-01 20:27:43
I am ready to make you feel as if you should be asking me to buy bitcoin:) I'm a marvel at selling and I pride myself in winning over anyone I meet. I will be working for the commission on this one.

I'm sure it'll affect the price. I'm not sure if the Silk Road dictates the price so much that if stopped, bitcoin would crash..? However I guess I'm curious as to who "they" are that are saying that the FBI is about to crash or catch or whatever they do to get the Silk Road..if would be interesting to hear the "insider" tips and what the "plan" is..

@_date: 2013-06-21 18:21:01
I'm sorry if you felt that was directed at you. I am just getting tired of people getting on here and being negative about stuff. I believe that we have forums like this so that we can be proud and happy of things we accomplish without someone always chiming in and saying things that are negative. I wasn't referring to anyone specific though so please don't take my negative comment personal. It was simply to see how many down votes I could get:)
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:31:14
Dude you need to sell at least 50% of all of those points right now! You will be so happy that you did and then figure out what you're going to do with the rest. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:42:48

Are you getting facts straight? We're you aware of the Silk Road or a user before the big media boom? Are you going to use a censored version for a movie or will it be raw? Ie: using true stories and or first hand accounts.

At $102 a coin I spent $200 and got 1.90 coins. So the fees are not too bad. I hate the fees anytime also, but its like a gas station buying milk. It can be cheaper somewhere else but its worth the small fee for the ease. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:58:25
Yeah it is..but its pretty cool to see them trying new things

Yes this is true. You have to look further than just bitcoin to understand what Friedcat and Bitfountain have in view miles ahead. It was the swift and quiet way they initially invented asic mining. Now its on to the next level.......

I dont have 2fa on there only because I was trading small only. I am thankful that I didnt lose it all, but I am still pissed. I logged in after I received the withdraw email and saw that they had been trading my coins for US dollars and then bought PVC or some coin and then withdrew. Sucks.

Right..I for the first time had the BTC sent to a wallet..I had an issue that was easily explainable when I used Mt. Gox as the payment to part..There was a code hidden in the email they sent me when that happened.

@_date: 2013-06-21 10:54:11
I've spent 3-4k on coins in the last month or so and have had no issues. My only complaints so far are the wait time to get coins after purchase and the fact that when you buy coins you're not allowed to adjust the price for a buy order. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:09:59
There's a lot of complaining in this thread lately, which is understandable, considering large swings in stock prices can cause strong emotions.
I just wanted to put this whole thing in a bit more perspective: about 16 months ago, Bitfountain collected about $100k from investors to complete some chips. Today, they have a large warchest of savings, a steady income stream, and they are working in parallel on the 3rd generation of chips, liquid cooling +++, and the company is "valued" at approximately $100 million (not to mention that investors have already collectively received payouts of about XBT 240k, almost $200 million at today's prices). In light of this, my personal opinion is that we should at least keep the discourse respectful.
From my point of view, the company has plenty of promise and is busy fulfilling the promise. Competition has grown stronger, but anybody surprised by that is a pinhead - it was obvious from the start there would be an ASIC price-war/arms race. But there will be several winners, and AM is well-positioned to be one of them: well-funded, well-located, experienced and (dare I say?) visionary.
I'm not trying to talk the price up or anything (I don't care much about the flavor of the month), I just wanted to point out that, in my humble opinion, AM has delivered magnificently so far, and has staying power for the long term.~Quote from bitfair on bitcointalk.org~

@_date: 2013-11-13 12:20:28
You should never get all of your information when making investments from one source ever. Before I invested in Bitcoin I jumped around from website to website to website learning about it until I was able to make my own well-informed decision. It makes me cringe when I see people asking for financial advice on Reddit. Make your own decisions based on what you've read from sources point

No I do not.I have read many posts about it though. Apple does not allow ANY retailer to sell their products as low as what they have them advertised and theyre also not listed as a retailer for Apple. So I guess go ahead and be careful.
@_date: 2013-06-12 12:34:35
I have to partially agree with you about how hard it is to actually buy a Bitcoin. I have no idea why it is so hard especially if you've been verified or any of that get a Bitcoin right now. It is a hassle. I've even been verified through all of the exchanges and it's still a hassle. Unless you're willing to go to the store and deposit cash it is virtually impossible to get a Bitcoin instantly.
@_date: 2013-07-22 04:11:56

@_date: 2013-06-26 19:36:04

Nope..Same company...There was a confusion about Activemining at one point because they were trying to use AM as a stock symbol on btct.co but AM is ASICminer.

I can tell you this I have lost many many dollars with holes of those and I am not happy either. At first when I first started messing with Bitcoin it was kind of a game, now it's more of a real thing and I wish I had all those Bitcoin's back. I guess that just goes to show that you can't trust scum bags no matter what currency it is.

I've been both very fortunate and unfortunate at the bitcoin stock game. Mostly fortunate. My advice is dont let one bad apple ruin your ideas of investing, I've personally been turned off by things that same person posted. However with the thousands of dollars I've made it seems I've won.

When you start a new transaction you will have the option in the dropdown box to fund from a bank account. When you do that it will give you the option to use the zipmark app.

Because the market goes down and up. Theyre volitable as they have always been. I hope that you can get some coins soon! They have dropped today and I can actually sell them for $1000 now. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:24:03
Best bet is to get a coinbase.com account which includes a wallet and also you can sell them directly from there once you've mined.

I also wouldnt buy a fuckin product over the internet without some protection such as an escrow. I cant stand people that lie, I was told on the phone when I ordered I would definitely have my miners buy July and I did not. So therefore its guys like you that are hilarious, guys that think its so coooool that bitcoin cant be charged back. I get it. its a feature that is cool..but I am not going to live my life around a currency that offers no help in getting treated right as a consumer. I hope my non made up story made your day.

If you have an unlimited amount of money to invest and you are not familiar enough with bitcoin to know where to invest, then I suggest that you start out small and buy some ASIC machines that are already on the market and ready to buy. I mean find someone who is willing to part from a BFL asic or maybe an Avalon or maybe a ASICminer blade assembly. I am sure that you can find some available on bitcointalk.org or maybe even on ebay..However be VERY careful in the world of bitcoin because SCAMMERS are all over the place. I am available to broker a deal if you are interested. Inbox me for details.

It's a classic Ponzi scheme, they are still making up new investments before they have even began to make a chunk in any of the old orders taken that need to go out. I am not ok with the way they're reeling in more money from new products not to be seen for months or years before they can even make a dent in the old preorder log. Sad

I am not looking to get rich off them..I am not sure how it works as far as on my end..but as long as I dont have to spend a lot of time or effort on them I would let them go for next to nothing. I would just like to see someone be able to use them. Maybe if I am lucky the person would return the favor once they started mining with them and throw me a coin or two. Let me know if thats you...I would actually not mind getting a few litecoins for them since I have none and I think theyre going to go up after MtGox starts carrying them. Thanks

Thanks..I got those transactions figured out and raised my fee in which still is slow..oh well..Thanks for your advice!
@_date: 2013-08-27 13:53:45
Boy it's gonna get big!
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:31:10
Its such a shame!
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:21:02
why did someone get money back?
@_date: 2013-07-17 23:52:15
I am pretty sure it was a mistake of somehow the coins got deposited into my account..I am not going to argue tho/
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:44:49
I see that..it happened right after I posted..Any clue as to why my transactions are now taking hours when they used to take minutes? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:29:16
I was just hacked on btc-e for 1.75 litecoin and 29 namecoin! Get you coins out and stored away from online. This makes me want to cash out now. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 04:01:52
Even though I can't think of a specific bank, nor have I had an encounter. I just thought this should get some attention. I think any person that should ever be trusted with your money should have absolutely nothing to say about what you do with YOUR money. Whether you spend it all on bitcoin, or drugs. It is so weak of us Americans to just let some asshole-that we pay to even know us-tell us what we CAN do or NOT do with OUR money. So to all of you individual assholes out there enforcing this should also be blacklisted. I hope you get my point. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 13:55:57
I am excited~~
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:11:44
Thank you for the heads up

They have about a 180 day ROI. But they are a great place to start!

Touch the btc amount to turn it dollars. Should work, thats how in ios7.
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:56:17
I have another one that is taking toooo long as well..I have changed the fees and I am not sure why this is happening..? Can you look at it? 31b40ef64ee083ef4474375117fc0ebe2de16baea3847ef48a55580009c03f3b

I have shares in ASICminer that were bought when it was less than 1 a share. I also carry a few Labcoin, bASIC mining, Activemining, and several others. I also carry some litecoin stocks. I feel bitcoin will go up because I watch the trend and I have seen it moving upwards. Difficulty goes up and more ASIC miners hit the market it is almost inevitable that it will rise. There are only 21 million coins they have to go up eventually. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:32:08
It is so hard to tell anymore, there are so many companies that are taking orders for units that may or may not ever have a ROI. I personally bought 3 singles from Butterfly Labs and at the time I ordered they would have made around $4k each a month. Now I will be lucky to get $1k each a month. Its so crazy..I wish you well but I think to make any money out of mining it is probably best you spend $10k with cointerra or BFL or Butfury or another company. Good luck. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:59:14
Yes!!! I am super excited to buy coins from you guys!
@_date: 2013-06-28 03:28:58
Dude you are really a dick. You have so many down votes and you just keep chiming in, I wish after 10 down votes you were just removed from a topic.

If there's profit in it you sell. I have made a bunch of mistakes lately waiting to make more profits when I should've cashed out when I had a lot of profits. Perfect example is ASIC miner two weeks ago I could've cashed out at 4.70 a share. Now I can't even get 3.65 share:(
@_date: 2013-07-01 20:28:55
Please update me or start a new subreddit for this and let me know. This could be huge!

Try to call them and get it cleared out..I am not a rep for the company so I am not sure how it works..Good Luck!
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:14:08
BFL is a scam company. I recently had to envoke my right to charge back a credit card purchase of 6 grand. Many others have had the same issue. If I were you I would find an asicminer from asicminer. In the mining game the trick is ONLY buy from someone who has it in stock.

Its so crazy because I actually sent 1.70 from somewhere else and it got refunded..irony,..I wonder if it..?

I guess Bitinstant is not for you. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 10:30:25
Hi send email to Coinbase complaining about how long it took for the coins to free up. I received an email yesterday from them telling me that very soon it was going to be an immediate purchase, they had a new thing it's going to start where as soon as you buy them you get the coins in your account and you can use them.  Let's hope that that is true.
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:32:37
Anything that I can currently buy with a debit card.

I respect all of the comments here. I am getting serious and I am going to start putting together a few key points as to why this is a scam. I think first and foremost if you compare this to any other ponzi scheme, it looks very similar. The similarities are that as soon as stuff starts to get real scary on their end they cool off a lot of mad investors and try to persuade them with a bigger return for no cost, just keep your initial investment so they can get more people satisfied. The fact that they treat us like "customers" and not like "shareholders" which is essentially what we are, is so ponzi like. I am for one about sick and tired of all of the loss I have seen in the bitcoin world because of late shipping, loss of income, higher difficulty, etc....I think its worth a try and even if a law office gets most of the winnings at least the ponzi can stop.

I only say that because I completely agree with what you say but it is a free world.  And reddit is a very great example of that. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:45:38
I agree..I am sorry for the mess up..
@_date: 2013-06-15 19:55:18
it should have a spot in the top area that says BUY...I just logged in and looked so I know its up...Its a pretty easy verification process as well. Good Luck!

WOW I had an issue earlier..maybe theyre done for a few..

I lost about 5-600 usd..I was logged in and trading and then I logged out and received an email about 20 mins later that said my withdraw was successful. I was receiving emails that needed permission to withdraw and for some reason I filed a support ticket and they said the transaction never took place..now I am banned and I cannot login to see if in fact it did. I am not getting any response now and I am banned. So I am not happy.

I am buying stock with bitcoin, I am not worried about bitcoin itll go up. The stock I buy is more than likely going to go up as well.

AM is not dead. It is a very valuable company that will always be in the lead of the pack and has had such a head start in bitcoin it will be impossible to be completely dead unless friedcat starts being an asshole and stealing.

Did the same thing a while ago. When you get the first confirmation email from bitinstant it will have a mtgox code to redeem within mtgox. It's rather easy, I way over thought it. Good luck!

Not sure..
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:16:17
I had the same question about six months ago when I ordered three singles from Butterfly Labs. I still have not received one nor will I until the machine has basically been rendered useless. So my suggestion to you is buy some  Bitcoin's on Coinbase take them over to BTCT.co and invest in some stocks you will  have way better gains than if you mined your self. I am only $4000 out, but still it sucks because $4000 would have went along way playing the stock market

@_date: 2013-10-19 14:38:55
HAha.....Please sell.
If you need convincing of the long-term future, and are willing to listen to strangers with no credentials, and are worried about risking $155, Bitcoin probably isn't the right sort of investment for you. I had to steal this and say the same thing!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:32:55

I only bought these coins 2 days ago as an experiment for a few buddies I am trying to show how cool bitcoin is..trust me I am holding on to the other coins I have..I had over 100 this summer and now after my amazing ASICminer ride I am sitting around 30 so not too bad I guess:) Fun game! I however do not believe fiat will ever be replaced in my lifetime but other currencies are welcome.
