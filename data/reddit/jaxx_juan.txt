Hey, did you store your back-up phrase?

On jaxx.io you'll find the option to "view source code" on the upper right hand side, which contains the connectivity code for the current (and historical) versions of Jaxx. Also available is the option to download the extension version of Jaxx, which necessarily includes all of the source code. You can also decompile the android version and go through the code.

Hey, we saw your post on r/jaxx, can you submit a support request on jaxx.io?

Hi, the Jaxx codebase is viewable on jaxx.io. You can also scrutinize the code for our Chrome extension by enabling Developer Mode, right-clicking anywhere on the app, and selecting Inspect. The Android .apk's code can be unpacked and scrutinized in full as well. So, even though Jaxx is not open-source, its code is visible.
We are not open source for a number of reasons, one of them being the multitude of cloned open-source wallets surfacing here and there, including app stores. We do not desire clones of Jaxx (malicious or not) to be floating around; both for protection of our users and our own brand. Cloned copies lead to issues and confusion and we are trying to find a balance that; so we make it difficult to take and distribute our code while still allowing it to be audited by those that wish to do so.

Thanks for the kind words! As Anthony mentioned, we do have an integration on Slack that sends alerts. That being said, Anthony and the Jaxx team are quite involved with the community and regularly check/participate on subreds. Let us know if you have any comments, questions, issues, etc., we are always looking for ways to improve.

Hi, I'm Juan, COO of Jaxx. The "open-source" debate has been covered before in r/bitcoin and other subreds so I won't go into that. I do, however, want to address your recommendation to avoid our app and why we are not open source. 
Jaxx is not open source, although the full code (minus UI) is visible on the website.
We have seen a myriad of cloned wallets surfacing here and there, including app stores. This is due to the code being easily available, copied and distributed. We do not desire clones of Jaxx (malicious or not) to be floating around; both for protection of our users and our own brand; cloned copies lead to problems and confusion and we are trying to find a balance that makes it difficult to take and distribute our code while still allowing it to be audited by those that wish to do so.

Hey, can you submit a support request on jaxx.io? There are a number of issues that could be causing this, e.g., low mining fee.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:01:04
Hey, I updated that response and am handling this directly. I'm not on Reddit all the time so it's better to keep the discussion on support.

Hi, can you PM your ticket number? I'll take a look at your issue. Also, I'm sure you are aware that the entire industry has grown substantially in the past year. Many companies, including Jaxx are, of course, excited about this growth but are also going trough growing pains on various levels. Our customer support team has already doubled in size and is hard at work clearing tickets; however, the large number of tickets has resulted in longer than desired response times.

Hey, did you set one up during the wallet creation phase? PIN will show up when trying to view backup phrase, private keys and move funds.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:36:08
Thanks for the support!
