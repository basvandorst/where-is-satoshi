Does this prove the USD was used as the currency to measure off?  10k 10k crossover is in white paper? Part of the mathmagic?

I am pleased we have real discussions like your comment and not troll speak... this is something I genuinely want to understand 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:54:44
That the crossover is happening right now!

That USD was clearly the currency of choice to measure a Satoshi in

So do it in AUD it’s in the 13,000 now?

That was my upvote... thanks? I get it now... and yet to witness the 10k barrier is still ��.  One more thing... this is where eventually those of us who own a a full Bitcoins, they could be worth the number tossed around 1mil if 1 Satoshi gets exactly equal to 1 usd or 1 Aud or 1 euro?  I suppose that’s why people project this number so often not 300,000 for example... I know I’ve heard the other reasons too.

Maybe this is a naive question but.  Why the Frick was the ruling decided that the value of the BTC at the time of the theft would only be returned????
Solution   Return the 1 BTC for 1 BTC
Solution  if this is Currency then pay back in the same currency that was stolen.... why convert it to the Fiat equivalent????
MT GOX unfortunately will have the boomerang effect that could equal as much if not more of an effect than the original Damning theft in this space! 
Disclaimer: I haven’t read the ruling, and comments about this... so I might be echoing as “captain obvious”. 
The trustee has acted irresponsibly and really taken mass adoption backwards!  Maybe that was the point
Obvious point  someone with that many BTC creates centralization, at least Temporarily.... pisses me off!!!

Mostly because of all these Altcoins ICO that I am pondering the thought, Market Cap is a great example!

It is only a currency in an economic environment.  It needs two or more people to agree other it has value, and it exchanges for goods.

Ant Shares is an interesting read, kinda surprised the mention of certain Altcoins that are baked into the technical languages... not sure If I were the writer I would tie the fabric of the history of the coin to them.  The living document might allow one to delete some that might be obsolete or less relevant or even had major missteps.  It is a little bit of a flag for me.

It is similar in that your dollar in your pocket won't fluctuate if Bitcoin hits $1500 on 1 August, but if I have tether staged to buy @ $1500 and the cash in hand still needs to onboard... might be slower to get your next generation BTC when the dust settles due to complications of conversion vice trading...
U might finally get your bitcoin later at $1700 
 Make sense?

Flat or Fiat?  Tell me what you mean by flat design

It is a buyers market is all I see. Just try not to "catch a falling knife". BTC is the gold backing of the crypto market and the future of the current state is in question. It will get worst before it gets better, but I love me some air out of the bubble. It will correct as soon as the SEGWIT proves to be a programmers paradise and a regular BITCOIN spender's nightmare and the increased blocksize becomes the practical coin.

What a mess... that time when you see church activities differently due to your new awareness!

This is an interesting coin to post when the question was Altcoin... basically it is a bit of a trick question. My understanding without getting to geeky and political is that the developers have come up with a soft fork option for users and holders of Bitcoin to convert the tokens prior to the Forced Hard Fork August 1st... thus the Pseudonym UASF or user activated soft fork... 
 
For me this is humorous that u put this in a comment for Altcoin because your BTC will be somewhat of a Altcoin from its previous form in my opinion

Not the point here... I still am long in my favorites, I'm offering a solution to new money coming staging and in steady mode until the savings are best... I'm not bringing my new money in and "catching the falling knife".
