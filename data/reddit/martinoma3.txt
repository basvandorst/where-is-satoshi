not too sure about 10,000 bitcoin Users In Kenya Seems too high , being some one who helps  friends family adopt and in turn  buy bitcoins to add  to their investment portfolios and their kids trusts , there is very little Knowledge about Bitcoins only meet one person who Knew what it was and that was after a LBC local trade . 
and about the volume of trades IMO LBC does not really count as Bitpesa is way cheaper and Much more convenient for anyone buying BTC in kenya , thus LBC may show 10k a week but bitpesa may have 20-50k a week (IMO) however long way to go for bitcoins to become mainstream seeing as MPESA is alive and very strong. !!

i think what could actually damage bitcoin is if the Us government where to say that ISIS are using bitcoin to fund cells in and around the world . and i dont mean like their previous attempts at this but a out  right statement . and its quite possible in the way things are escalating in IRAQ at the moment

@_date: 2014-06-05 16:12:43
@_date: 2014-08-02 05:24:49
but then wouldn't it be possible to say that for bitcoin become mainstream we need to create an even simpler way of making the Masses understand it .. ?  
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:02:50
yes it does 
in the sense that if you get a bit pesa account and you have a coinbase account where you can buy the bitcoins or even localbitcoins.com then you can dirrectly send bitcoins to your bitcoin wallet on bitpesa which then sends derectly to the kenyan phone as all kenyans have mpesa .. i do it all the time as i dont like buying my BTC on bitpesa and then i send them to my house staff in kenya takes 15 minutes to arrive on their phone Magic 
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:49:22
could they not just get a xapo card?
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:10:25
pre loaded paper wallets that you can buy at a shop with 0.1 ,0.5 or 1 BTc loaded on them. whilst including the private key and everything so people could go to buy something at an electronic shop and buy these cards with the seller defining the price when he checks it on his till. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 10:40:29
no idea ..actually.. havent checked

@_date: 2014-09-04 19:29:00
i hope you sold your coins :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:46:21
No but americans (not all ) but large majority believe what they are told and if a relatively important person ie president was to say we going to scrutinize bitcoin transmitters.. All bitcoiners would be seen as terrorist helping .. 
an not saying this is likely but it is quite possible seeing the current situation in Iraq and how it might progress bitcoin would make it much easier for the terrorists . 
Bitcoin has Many great Uses and any one can make use of this. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:32:52

@_date: 2014-08-04 20:21:24
so if i know someones address i can look it up there and i have his Private Key . .. doesn't make bitcoin sound so secure 
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:45:10
So we will never Know who he is .. am sure if BTC adoption does go super mainstream .. he have to tell someone 
"Oh you're using bitcoin, yeah well i created it "
how can a Human being create such a Breakthrough and Remain anonymous at one point he will have to tell someone or it will have to be revealed by Human Error  ?

Miners are Extremely important to the Bitcoin Future , as they are the ones who confirm our transactions and make it all work 
but what is there really to stop them moving onto another coin?   seeing as most of the Gh's come from Big mining operations shows that BTC mining is for profit (and a few is for hobby)
What's to stop them moving onto a Government endorsed coin that may be seen as more profitable and What effect would this have on the Bitcoin network if it was to happen ? say it lost like 20-40% of Mining power .. 
finally if  there are any miners who read this, within your community of miners what are your BTC views? you must surely understand all the BTC benefits to society ect. but is the Bottom line $$ and the Main and most important motivator?  
i Just Dont want you guys to Leave/stop if the price keeps dropping :(

actually i am in the process of making a Youtube channel based on bitcoin  and all its wonders but with a teenage and young adult audience.. just finishing up the script (maybe ask for some proof reading later) Launch early October

@_date: 2014-08-22 12:23:48

@_date: 2014-08-22 13:06:54
dont worry i get one when you release the 100 onwards and ship it to a friend in the states or via ship shipco ... i have a feeling that if you do remain and sell only 2500 that these may have quite abit of value in the coming years. seeing as they are only 2500 made ..let alone with whatever price bitcoin goes up too . 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:10:46

* Friend sent me this link --&gt;   
* I gave all my details 
* Then i received an email stating the price per btc  that they had about 247$ (At the time Btc was about 241 or so) 
* I proceeded to deposit the Money on my MPesa 
* Then they sent me the paybill number (Where my money needed to be sent via mpesa )
* I SENT the money 
* 5 minutes later i got an email saying the coins had been sent 
* 10 minutes later Coins on My wallet 
This has made buying BITCOIN in KENYA SO so Easy !!
Thank You Bitpesa
