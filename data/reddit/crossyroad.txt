Pretty circlejerky to be honest. Step 3 is a good move, but step 4 is a mistake. Do your research. Monero is sound tech and so is Ethereum. They each literally do things Bitcoin cannot. Yes, there are a lot of shitcoins. Yes, Bitcoin may someday implement these features. Until then however, you're talking out of your ass.

A thinly-veiled insult. But it doesn't matter. As long as Bitcoin successfully bootstraps the cryptoanarchist revolution, the whole world doesn't need to think like me. 
All that is needed is to render the government powerless. Market forces will take care of the rest. A few people who were intelligent enough to seize the opportunity at the beginning will be fine. That few is us. Stop caring about anyone else. It is not in your best interest. 
"How do you expect us to maintain our roads, hospitals, military, schooling, subsidised farming, welfare, social justice, world policing, brainwashing of children, and environmental initiatives when we can't tax people anymore and nobody cares enough about those things to give money freely?"
To which I answer, if nobody cares about those things, I guess they aren't that important after all. 
It's like that scene from that Bond movie where he's strapped to the gold laser thing.

@_date: 2017-12-02 22:12:49


I am, right now. Hello person!


No no no, you were doing so well. Sure I harbour hatred, but does that make me ignorant? I am fully aware of how the world works. I just don't *care* about the same things you do. In fact I am full of a lot less bullshit than most conservative people.
I just like living my life and minding my own business. 
I fully see that tobacco causes a drain on society, but I like my cigars.
I understand CGP Grey's argument that human-driven cars cause inefficiency, injury, and death... but I like driving. It makes me happy. If the government survives long enough to make self-driving cars mandatory, I will be sad.
I can understand that guns are used for killing innocent people and that sucks! A lot. I like guns. They are pretty cool, and useful for defending my property.
For various reasons, the government wants to tell me I cant have all these nice things. I don't like governments.


Why do I need help? Maybe you need help? I think you've a lot of damn gall telling me I need help. 
It is really easy to take the high road when you probably drive a car. You probably live in a home with running water. You have Internet access and are probably typing on a cellular phone. You probably ate breakfast this morning.
Each and every one of those things you did had a cost. You did not pay that cost. The car was built by a machine that put someone out of work. That phone was built in a Chinese factory where working conditions are so terrible they had to catch people trying to kill themselves in giant fish nets so that they could fire them before they die on the company clock. If you had any meat for breakfast you are killing our planet. The money you pay for your Internet access could go to a child to feed them.
Every luxury you enjoy is paid for with the suffering of animals and other humans. At least I am honest that I don't care. I mean maybe I care a little, but I can go play a video game and forget about it and feel better.
Maybe it isn't okay to enslave successful people against their will to solve the problems of the weak and lazy. 
Maybe the value of human life expectancy and quality isn't equal or even objectively defined.
Maybe the liberal mindset is a coping mechanism to help people believe that if they use distributed legitimised violence to steal money from people, these problems will go away.
I don't want to pay for that experiment.

 It doesn't have to be a fork; you could ask this question about completely separate cryptocurrencies ("altcoins") too. What use is saying the upper limit of bitcoin issuance is 21M if you can launch an unlimited number of new coins? 
I am not an expert in economics,  and crypto has sort of turned the whole field on its head anyway, but here is my educated guess of an answer:
Money requires two things to be worth anything: scarcity and demand. Bitcoin is scarce because of its consensus rules putting a limit on its creation. But why is bitcoin in demand?
All bitcoins, no matter where they are today, were created for the same purpose: to compensate miners for securing the network with their computational power. Each block reward is a decentralised manifestation of that collective computational power. We demand bitcoin because it enables us to transact on a decentralised and (conditionally) immutable ledger. 
We are tempted to forget, however, that there is a condition to its immutability. If at any point there is enough centralisation of hash power to take over Bitcoin, and it becomes profitable to do so, then some actor will emerge to perform that action. This goes for any coin too, not just Bitcoin.
I believe that the check against runaway inflation by introduction of new coins is this: that the underlying scarcity of any cryptocurrency is provided by the actual scarcity of actual computational resources... not just a number in a  on Github.
It may take the market a while to include this information in price discovery, but I believe that is what will happen eventually. Coins will be valued  as a function of the amount of computational power securing their networks. 
**TL; DR**: IMO, the price of each fork/coin will be rebalanced continuously to reflect its actual tangible value in terms of network security (and other factors which affect demand).

We would seize the means of defence, form uneasy alliances, and defend ourselves like free men once did.
Oh and remember-- one of the important parts of this is that we don't go around getting involved with other people's affairs. If we don't piss anyone off,  they aren't likely to have a reason to invade us. Much of the "defence" budget is spent on "defending democracy" around the world.

Interesting opinion. In my view, one of two situations is inevitable:
* we reject UBI and the class gap continues expanding as smarter and smarter people simply run out of jobs to do
* we accept UBI as a sort of "necessary evil" and figure out how to enforce it in a world with untraceable, plausibly deniable cryptocurrency (e.g. Monero, or Bitcoin if it adopts privacy technology before it's too late, but that's another discussion).
You are suggesting a third option which is to sort of take the Industrial Revolution and shove it back into the Pandora's Box whence it came.
Can we even *do* that?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:28:45


Isn't it our turn to be on top? Do what we want. Enjoy the luxury those people have enjoyed until now at our expense.
We only live once and the prevailing theory is that there are no gods or afterlife. It is clear that some people just "win" life, and some people just "lose". There are not enough resources for everyone to be a winner. Don't you want to win?


Hopefully at that point the poor will be unable to stop cryptocurrency for the same reason the government is-- you can't kill math or put it in jail. 
You can destroy infrastructure though-- perhaps that is the check against all this. A neo-Luddite movement, perhaps?
Perhaps Bitcoin is only the first, anarcho-capitalist phase of the revolution. The resultant dystopia will drive the new poor to destroy cryptocurrency by means of simply destroying all technology. From the ashes of this holocaust will rise our new, perfect socialist society.
Or something like that. I probably won't be around to see it if it happens.

Dude, this person understands cryptography more than the average bitcoin enthusiast...


He or she is asking about whether these deterministic wallet seeds leak any amount of data about themselves over a long period of use. As a crypto enthusiast with several years' experience, I understand the question and assume that it is not a concern, but from an information-theoretic perspective I am unsure of how to answer the question without further research. This is an advanced concept and deserves a technical answer with some depth. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:45:45

Then I go to a hospital, get fixed, and absorb a  life-changing amount of medical debt. Please explain how taxation has prevented this. Oh wait-- we have taxes and that still happens.  


That is the liberal understanding of my goals, yes. I consider it a step in the right direction. Every tax dollar denied to the government is money returned to the person who rightfully owns that money. I don't much care about the consequences. They are none of my concern. Myself and my family, if I have one, will be fine.


I pay taxes like every other person. I just root for the people who don't. They have more balls than I do.
The good thing is that cryptocurrency is nearing the point of critical mass where it will be unstoppable. Privacy-centric coins like Zcash and Monero are being introduced. Over time fewer and fewer people will pay taxes, and the government will lose power slowly but surely. The government will attempt to stop it at that point but they will already have lost enough power to render that effort a failure.
The collapse of the liberal theft-based economy is nearly upon us. I cannot wait.

Heh. All the permabearish shitposting that goes on here from known trolls, and it's your friend who gets the axe.
Ah well.

If it went back up he'd get his money back; if it went down he'd at least have company in misery. 
I actually think a lot of trolls here are like that. In general as someone who has been in the Bitcoin scene for a long time (since back when Gavin was still taken seriously) I really roll my eyes at all the price commentary on both sides. I'm getting antsy. I am ready for Bitcoin to do what it set out to do... end government control of money.

Fine. Here is some truth: I hate the government and everything it has done to steal from me and my loved ones. I want to watch it fall apart. I don't care what happens. Someone else's problem. I will be long dead or at least gone before anything bad happens. I would just like to have more money.




Yes and not really. At least when I was young and dumb I didn't know about the gigantic government dick about to bend me over. Now every time I consider cashing out part of my investment that I *earned* and that they had *no part of*, I have to think about how I am going to have to pay thousands of dollars and then probably go to jail anyway because I overlooked something.


I developed the skills I use to keep myself alive without the help of federally-mandated programming. And honestly, fuck school. That shit was the worst. It's already clear that I don't like people telling me what to do-- imagine teenage rebellion on top of that. I spent 13 years waiting to escape that hellhole.

I'm not just going to hate on you like everyone else here, but the reason you perceive hatred here is not because of your analysis but your gloating.
Obviously you have quite a lot of interest in Bitcoin's failure. But the  and that  shit you did just now is why people hate and downvote you, not because you're giving bearish analysis. That and everyone hates TA here, partly because many people think it's bullshit, and partly because it belongs on not here.
There is little to no reason for you to be here gloating about your calls if you don't hate Bitcoin and crypto as a technology. You would do a lot better over in where the people who hate Bitcoin are.
I have been watching and holding Bitcoin for a long time. I have developed a *bona fide* interest in the technology and recognised the potential for blockchain tech to do really cool things. All those cool things can work at any price. It just seems like you are sitting here rooting against this thing we are all trying to build.
You are free to do that, but why would you feel wronged by downvotes?
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:25:03
Szabo's writing style matches Satoshi's almost perfectly and he was working on precursors long before the birth of BTC. Hal would have immensely benefitted from (if not actually needed) collaboration with someone able to grasp the concepts enough to write about them faster than he could with his disability. The NS/SN thing reeks of that thing people do where they just can't help but leave a sign. 
I choose to believe, but hey, if it was all  Hal that's even better. Best thing Satoshi ever did for Bitcoin was create it; second best thing was disappearing without a trace.

**There are five lights.** Bolding your statements won't make them true.


Let's say this is possible, because it is. While Bitcoin fucked around for years with silly infighting over scaling, Monero was building the future of fungible digital cash and Ethereum was building the world's most successful smart contracts platform.

I believe there is an upper limit but I don't know what it is, and my gut feeling is that we have not hit it yet. My prediction has more to do with structure. I think Bitcoin will stop hitting these parabolic ATHs and the last one (which we may have already hit but I am guessing and betting not) will collapse to around twice the previous top and stay there.

Whatever value the market places on it. As I write, that value is 7.4k USD per.


To an extent, I believe this is the case.


In contrast, many of us believe that this would be its main **feature**.


The government's ability to stop cryptocurrency is limited to a degree by the extent to which they are willing to deny citizens the right to do mathematics and share their results.


"Fiat" is, roughly, the Latin for "by law." This type of currency is backed by the "full faith and credit" of the government issuing it. This means that monetary policy can be set by politicians who think it is a good idea to print more money when they run out. There is no asset of "real value" backing it.
If you want an example of what happens when the illusion falls apart, take a look at what sloppy monetary policy did to Venezuela. They measure their cash by weight now. Children use bundles of banknotes as building bricks. You go out with a grocery bag full of money to buy a loaf of bread and some eggs.
Everything is relative, and you may be surprised to know that crypto has become a sort of shelter from inflation there. When you are losing 100000% per year sitting on your cash because of inflation, 70% losses are nothing.


On the contrary, I believe corruption arises when only a select few are above the law. When **everyone** is above the law, it will be a different story. It will be scary. It will be dangerous and exciting.
But there is no use avoiding it because I believe it is inevitable.
Good questions. Hope I provided some answers.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:45:34
Well, I think you are mostly right... but I would not be surprised to see some  activity closer to the decision, and an immediate selloff with the denial.
If it were "miraculously" approved there's a decent chance of a reactionary bull run. I would not trust it though. Markets like to do the opposite of what people expect. If a lot of people are expecting it to go up but nobody actually *buys*... well, I think it will go down.
That's the one thing has on us... it is true. For bitcoin to keep rising, someone has to be willing to buy it at a higher price than we did. It's just math... which is why I believe bitcoin will eventually settle not at an ATH, but in a boring valley, after a huge "bust" cycle. We could be seeing that final stabilisation now, or it could be next time, or the time after... Many people will get "screwed" and there will be no new ATH to "HODL" for unless they wait *years*.
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:06:40
I notice this pattern where if more people are betting on a certain thing to happen than are betting on it not happening, the majority gets screwed.
Is it possible then, that since all this margin trading has become so fashionable, the logical thing is that both sides are going to get shat on? I mean if I take out a long, and you take out a short, then it jumps 200, crashes 400, then jumps 200 again, we both just got screwed, and the people who were trading the volatility took all our money.

Why does there need to be one? For the record, I think there will be. Gut feeling. No chart analysis because I don't believe in giving my gut feelings names according to vague shapes. I save that for watching clouds.
But why do we need another bull run? Bitcoin has proven its worth to the world and maybe, just maybe, this is and/or was the "dot com" crash. Know what happened after the crash? That's when the Internet *actually* blossomed, and changed the world forever.
Money is just money. I make plenty to live. But you don't often get to watch this kind of innovation take off. Last time we saw something like this was after a wicked crash some 15 years ago. The tech giants of today took a whole decade to return to their ATH valuations. 
If this dude is right and this is it... maybe it's time to focus less on HODL and more on BUIDL.

The most recent dip started almost exactly as that news was released. My theory: people who thought like this panicked at the news and dumped hard. Regardless I think this is the same as a lot of things: by the time it happens, it will already be priced in.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:57:15
That's why it's important to use these early times to our advantage. Now is the time to get the "old guard" invested heavily enough to create a strong interest for governments not to ban crypto even though it would be in their long term best interest.
If you have doubts about this, check out what the all-powerful governments are doing about climate change. :P that's right; nothing... because it turns out there is a lot of money tied up in ruining the world for everyone.
I believe we are already there to a degree. Banning crypto is a dangerous game. It's a race into a new industry and a government has two choices: 1) ban/regulate it and stifle innovation on their own soil, giving other nations the win, or 2) deal with it for now and get violent when the time comes.
Naturally I am hoping for 2, and when it comes time for the endgame, the armies simply have no account to draw their paychecks from.

Oh... no no no. I don't wish death on anyone. It's a natural side effect of humans being really shitty creatures. I truly hope we are better than that.


Yeah... unfortunately, government is only sustained by using violence against dissenters, which is unforgivable. Believe me, death is better than life under a gun. You are likely privileged enough to scoff at this. Good for you.


In all of history there has never been a free society that did not collapse... including this one. You are living in the remains of a collapsed one today. But this is the nature of societies. Just as oppressed peoples rise up and destroy oppressive governments, the privileged don't understand the freedoms they have until they're gone.


I'm not interested in namecalling or ad hominem attacks.
Yes, I think cryptocurrencies are a great step forward and a weapon for the people against a tyrannical government.
No, I am not concerned with the price manipulation. Price manipulation does not impact cryptocurrency's ability to evade taxation and censorship, literally starving the state slowly to death as it finds itself powerless to pay its enforcers.
Although I do not personally involve myself with illegal activity, I am very, very excited about the impunity cryptocurrency can provide to those who fight for freedom on all fronts.

Tether news, while not really news in the first place,  should put a sock in the Tether FUD that has plagued us for months.
Also in the interest of transparency, I was banned for 7 days for joking about a potential 6k suicide pact during the most recent crash. In my absence I did some soul-searching. I learned yoga, went on a vision quest in the desert, and tried mushrooms for the first time (not the magic ones). 
I just want to say I am truly sorry. I am aware that the moderators in no way overreacted and that joking about suicide is never OK, because someone out there may have been teetering on the edge, and hearing such a suggestion from someone with such massive influence and clout here may have convinced them to finally do it. I will try to be better.

I don't make any attempt to debate that ASICBOOST is good for Bitcoin. In fact, I want it fixed.
However, I feel that it is not constructive to frame its use as an attack on the network. In crypto, code is law. If ASICBOOST is possible, it is only possible because of a bug in Bitcoin. It isn't the fault of the people who take advantage of a vulnerability that the vulnerability exists.
This is further complicated by the fact that Bitcoin literally works **because** miners are all trying to screw each other out of money. Let's fix the bug, but let's cut the bullshit artistry about how Jihan is "attacking" the network. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 06:25:56
Full disclosure: I support patching out ASICBOOST due to patent concerns.
Calling ASICBOOST a cryptographic attack is absolutely silly when you consider the frame of reference. 
The algorithm under "attack" is Bitcoin's proof of work. This is not your traditional use for a hash function. It doesn't play by the same rules. The Bitcoin POW is itself a partial collision attack on sha256. 
Throwing the word "attack" around haphazardly as if it is some moral wrong won't do us any good. Instead, let's talk about the real problem with ASICBOOST and why it must be destroyed-- the patent and its associated risk of further mining centralisation.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:48:17


Yeah. Don't. Nobody gives a shit about CP anymore. It's the current year. We have bigger fish to fry. At this point after the multiple decades of crackdown operations we can be safely sure anyone still producing CP has a death wish. All those people just draw Japanese cartoons now and say they're 4000 years old aliens from Planet Alpha-Loli IV.
We should probably be more concerned about giving encryption and ease of communication to terrorists who want to kill people, not basement neckbeards who have nothing better to do than jerk it to old pictures of "kids" who are probably actually like 30 now.
But the answer to that problem is the same as this one: we aren't going to do anything about it, and we shouldn't. Not because it's not atrocious to kill people or to exploit children, but because **the alternative is far, far scarier**. 
This is why, squick factors aside, we should have never, ever started down this slippery slope of "illegal content" in the first place. It was a mistake.

Yep. Your address is a hash of a public key. Your public key is derived from your private key.
So the same private key will always make the same address. When I send bitcoin to an address, I am really saying **the first person to prove they own this address can take this money.**

So this is right on paper, but the causality flows both ways. The miners are the origin of Bitcoin's value. What is a bitcoin? I guess you could say it is a token that represents a unit of work done to secure the blockchain.


It's self-balancing. If mining gets unprofitable, miners will quit and mining will get that much more profitable for those who remain. So yeah if everyone suddenly decided BTC is worth *nothing* you may right. However, that is a really unrealistic scenario. It is far more likely to be worth $1.00 than $0.00..

You've a right to your opinion and I respect that, but this scares me. All it takes is for enough people to agree with you and we will lose our right to privacy forever.
The ability to communicate freely and privately is the last glimmer of hope in a society collapsing into fascism. We don't need privacy now because **everything is good**. When everything stops being good, it will be too late; that hope will have been long snuffed out.
It's often suggested that the privacy nut has "something to hide." I would redirect that by asking: how bad would things have to get before we *all* had something to hide? We don't live in a movie. There is no guaranteed resolution; no *deus ex machina*. We must prepare to be our *own* salvation.
If the government knows we will yield our rights in the face of danger, **they will manufacture that danger**. The government must fear the people, at least a little bit, or we risk complete dystopia.

All right. My apologies. Thanks for being a reasonable person on the Internet.


I think the problem I am seeing here is that we have to be careful with cryptography and law. The fight for cryptocurrency, at least for me, is strongly tied to the fight for strong encryption.
The strong encryption debate is very black and white, although many politicians like to downplay this. Countless world leaders have proposed "compromise" on strong encryption. The problem is that there *is* no compromise. We either have the right to encrypt, or we don't.
I must be very clear with my viewpoint here, and if you don't share it that's fine: **There can be no compromise on civilian privacy. The preservation of life is not an excuse to invade privacy without due process.**


I think so. Once there has been due process, I have no problem with any restrictions the government may impose, **so long as they do not infringe on the privacy of innocents** in the process. "Innocents" here means those who have not been **found guilty** of a crime.


My opinion is that money laundering should not be illegal in and of itself. In fact, privacy in our finances should be a right, not a crime. It is a lazy tactic used when there is no evidence of real wrongdoing. So we slap on a structuring or money laundering charge.
I believe in liberty and I am willing to be less safe in return for that liberty... and it is a choice I will continue to defend until my death. In the perfect world, we could choose to live in a society with our personal optimal balance of liberty and safety. 
Unfortunately, I don't find a lot of common ground with most "reasonable" people. I prefer the liberty setting turned up to 11. Whatever happens as a result is none of my concern. What's the worst that could happen? **We all die?** 
Better than living in an authoritarian hellscape. Sure roll your eyes now, but I am not offering to be a martyr for private ownership of bump stocks. Just remember that it's harder to gain freedom than to sign it away for false promises.

Honestly it's laughable but also makes me sick. Statist cucks panicking about the inability to enforce capital gains tax on crypto. It's just money moving around, changing hands.  Society did nothing to facilitate that, and it's not like those things  you mentioned will hurt because the government didn't get as much free fucking money as they fat-fingered into their calculators.

PoS has some pretty interesting problems of its own. I think most people believe PoW is, in terms of battle-tested network security, the best way of doing things right now. Of course there are people who argue.
Look into DPoS. That's a pretty interesting way of doing PoS. You incentivise the miners to not attack the network by giving the stakeholders the ability to "vote them out of office". Interesting to say the least. I don't know if it is as solid as PoW, but I think it's better than straight PoS.
In the end, markets don't care what's good for the environment. So if we want an environmentally friendly solution we will have to build one that is better than Bitcoin. I think we can do that.

It's okay. I'm sorry too.
I tried years ago arguing with people saying what you're saying. I tried so hard to help them to understand that BTC would eventually do exactly what it did in December last year.
Around January, I started getting excited messages. "So I finally bought Bitcoin." I screamed internally (and externally at the closer ones). 
Actual retardation. Who the fuck thinks that kind of growth is sustainable and a good thing to buy?
I would have told them to wait for the bulls to leave. Wait until a day when despair coloured the air, blood filled the streets, and Buttcoiners filled our daily thread. It is their time now.
"This, too, shall pass." Not just the bear phase. The whole thing. The back and forth. One of these days, the bears are going to "win" for good. But Bitcoin isn't going to zero. It's just going to 10% of its final ATH... and staying there. 
I hope for my friends' sake that we've got one more in us. But thanks to not listening to dinosaurs and scared liberals 5 years ago, I am much better off today than I was when Bitcoin was first declared a "scam." 
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:42:16
Some decent questions. First you have to understand that Bitcoin's intrinsic value and its market value are two different things.
Bitcoin's intrinsic value cannot be accurately determined. The work the miners provide is absorbed in there somewhere, as is the ability to move money without answering to a bank or government. But do they add up to the market value? I suppose that is subjective.
You mentioned crime. I think it is important to mention that not all crime is bad, and not all government is benevolent. 
Black market demand is still demand, and many of us see that as a good thing for Bitcoin. You may think Bitcoin removing the power of governments to seize money is a bad thing. It certainly sounds scary from the statist perspective. But please look around and through history and see all the horrible things governments can do. Virtually all serious atrocities have been committed by a violent state with unchecked centralised military power. The Armenian genocide. The Holocaust. Tiananmen Square. All the shit Israel and Palestine have done to each other.
The environmental concerns aren't really useful to talk about when determining value. So while the concerns may be legitimate, just like in the "real world," if there is money to be made, someone will be there to make it.
Hope that answers some things.

Monero has more to offer than just privacy, such as a community culture committed to ASIC resistance, but you start venturing into the controversial there. 
The thing about 2nd layer solutions is that it has the same problem as Zcash. The government can just tell you not to use shielded transactions. You can't use Monero at all without being private and contributing to the anonymity of others. It won't let you.
Until Bitcoin is reworked to provide forced privacy, Monero will remain the king of privacy coins.

They'd just find another way to put the data there, for instance you could generate garbage addresses and send dust to them in sequence from a single address. Then reconstruct the data by building a tool that looks for data stored that way. The single address could serve as the filename. 
There really isn't any way to fix the problem permanently, and it's going to be quite the chore to get everyone to agree to fork. 
Illegal numbers present a weird sort of problem because you almost always need an algorithm of some sort to reconstruct the human-readable content from the number. But the algorithm is a number too! So which number is illegal?
The answer is really clear cut when we are talking about JPEG (the file is illegal) or writing a program that finds CP in the Constitution (no, idiot, your program *is* the CP)... but it is a little less clear cut in this situation.
I think the answer is to fix the law in order to make possession of that human-readable content illegal, rather than the number. That's what we care about, and that's what's enforceable without disrupting technological progress. 
Or burn down the whole thing. But I don't think that's productive.

You seem to really hate Bitcoin. Not just from this comment but from looking through your history.
I have been part of the cryptocurrency movement for years. There are bad people in here, but most of us aren't scam artists. Most of us aren't bad people at all. Most of us are just sick of losing our freedoms bit by bit because someone else thinks it's a good idea. Others are just sick of the liberal government assisting the bankers in robbing the middle class. 
You think Bitcoin is bad because it stops the government from being able to do things they shouldn't have been able to do in the first place.
You are going to lose. Cryptocurrency  cannot be stopped. It may not ever regain its all time high valuation, who knows? But it has been created, and it will exist. Humans will suffer and die as a result, as they have for years. 
But the ones left alive will be *free*. Hopefully you can one day understand how important that is.

So your argument is that Bitcoin is unfair. I am asking... *again*... what action do you want to take to fix the issues?
You could:
* make it better 
* convince people to stop using it
* make it illegal
I have thought and thought about these problems. Take a look at this (almost certainly fictional, but chilling) account of the future we face: 
What can we do to stop that from happening? Humans are not altruistic, nor are we proactive. The current system's imperfections are an expression of that.
Cryptography and cryptocurrency are Pandora's Boxes. They can't be uninvented.
My view, and you won't like it, is that we won't, and shouldn't attempt to, solve these problems. They are provably unsolvable without  discarding our humanity in the process. I would rather die human and suffering than lose my liberties or have my tendencies forcefully modified.
Our best chance is to allow the period of instability and chaos to happen naturally, which will in the process destroy the technology that enables Bitcoin to work. Hopefully we will survive the downfall but eventually the human race will come to an end. This has all happened before, and it will all happen again. Check out the Great Filter theory:

To make matters worse, "people" can be singular (technically it used to be 100% of the time, but it changed). So I can say "the Venezuelans are a troubled people" and be technically correct, like people would wonder why I am talking like that and didn't just say "The Venezuelan people are in trouble."
Worse still, because of the older way, there is another plural for "person" which is "persons" and this sounds weird to us even though it is "correct".
Then again, we can also say "peoples" to mean "multiple groupings of persons on a cultural or ethnic scope". So you may say that "our mission is to build peace among all the peoples of the world."

"My ideas" don't need to be convincing or powerful. Bitcoin is unseizable and unstoppable. Monero is even untraceable for fuck's sake. 
Make it illegal? Fine, let the legitimacy melt away. Let the price fall to a fraction of its all time high. Neither of them need to go (back?) to the moon to fulfill their purpose as a means of exchange outside the government's control and oversight.
Faced with these breakthroughs in  technology, the state's days are numbered. Without the power to seize money or intercept communications, a government is effectively powerless.


You keep saying this like it's true.

Then I read this shit and I'm like.... fuck. This doesn't feel good.
This place is full of assholes. Sorry for your loss.

Holy shit. Some shorters are going to have a bad morning. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:15:55
I look at this like sports betting. Those shorters... they're betting against Team Bitcoin. 
Some of them have a bigger gambling problem than others. Some lost their lunch money, others might have lost their house.
That sucks, I guess. But am I gonna cry about it? Nah. They were rooting for the bad guy.

Lots of toxic folks. Everyone has an agenda. Please be safe.

Libs love peddling these doomsday scenarios. Man I kinda hope this shit comes true because then I'll be one of the people on the top.

Do you write books? I do not agree with many of your viewpoints, but it has been a joy to read your perspective.
Let's leave the philosophical/sociological realm, which appears to be your area of expertise, and venture into the technical for a bit, which is mine. 
You envision blockchain technology becoming a vehicle for government-backed assets.  This is possible. However, I do not believe it is technically possible to make it work in a decentralised manner without incentivising the miners in some way. 
Many people who do not understand blockchain technology do not grasp that blockchains are actually really disappointing in almost all technical areas. As you might say, they have many unfavourable qualities. 
They are slow. They are inefficient; they require an ever-increasing amount of energy to sustain. They are immutable, and ever-growing. You can't throw away old stuff.
The singular thing that blockchains are good at is getting thousands of people who have every reason to hate and defraud each other to co-operate and agree on the state of a database.
Any central government or entity has no *use* for a blockchain, except to leverage its trustless qualities. Those trustless qualities rely on economic incentivisation, by allowing the miners to issue themselves new tokens. So, while it is possible to issue centrally-minted assets on a blockchain (see Ethereum), it is impossible to eliminate the underlying asset itself (see ETH). 
So the government has no reason to use a blockchain. Arguing that decentralised cryptocurrencies are a passing fad is to argue that blockchain itself is the same. There can be no divorce.

Come on. Luke Dashjr may be an irreversibly indoctrinated cult victim who is taking longer than "the rest of us" to deprogram, but there is no way he thinks the Earth is flat.

Luke, could you provide some insight on the 1st point? I am having trouble calling what is being done an "exploit" since it results in blocks which are compliant to the protocol rules and add to the overall security of the blockchain.
For the record, I have believed since the early days that nodes should simply block empty blocks. I just am a bit surprised to hear it so brazenly declared an attack. If we want to get technical, mining itself is technically an attack on a hashing algorithm. So is it honest or productive to call ASICBoost an attack simply because the protocol was not designed with it in mind?
