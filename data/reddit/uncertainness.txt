Exactly, if I don't want to serve black people at my privately owned business then I shouldn't have to! /s

Depends if it's a public business or a private organization.

I don't mean to be contradictory. If you're pegging me to only one view, I would say subjective morality exists.
Subjective morality exists in that the human mind is capable of rationalizing anything and everything. We're just a bunch of matter interacting with other matter whizzing through space.
But objective morality exists in the sense that that is how humans can reason and function in a society. It's dependent on the well-being other people.
The best analogy I have heard is that morality is like chess. The rules for chess are completely arbitrary. They're human-made. But once we have the rules of chess, we can objectively determine what is and what is not a good move.

You can believe in absolute subjective morality, but still believe in an objective moral framework.
Not sure what that has to do with bitcoin, though.

Seeing it as a spectrum is a good way of putting it. The question of government always boils down to, “What should we allow other people to force us to do under threat of violence?” Because ultimately, if you don’t do what they say, it will eventually lead to incarceration. 
Stealing your car or burning down your house are obvious things that should be banned by the government. But what about pouring one drop of bleach into a river? A gallon? 100 gallons?
What if someone owns a business and doesn’t want to serve Asian people? Or disabled people? Or gay people? If minorities have other choices then that’s fine, and (hopefully) other people will realize that that business owner is a bigot and will stop giving you business. In an ideal world, the free market would weed the bigots out.
But what if everyone thinks like them? What if the choices for certain groups of people are substantially diminished due to irrational actors? Clearly it’s unethical to not service people for qualities those people can’t control… but is it unethical for the state to enforce that morality?
Should there be laws against things like this? Or should we leave it to be a civil issue where you can sue for damages? Or should it just be allowed under any circumstances?
I'm not going to pretend I have all the correct information to make a determination, but I can understand the well-meaning of the government's actions with regards to discrimination.


I think that's something can both agree on!

You're right, I've never had to deal with it. Sorry, I don't mean to seem condescending. 
I was just curious as to the problem with other commenter. The government needs to step in at *some point*, right? Otherwise what's the point of a government?
That is to say, the justification for state violence is a given, so we should argue the merits of each potential policy.

No. Not in the world we exist, although you could create a horrible situation in which it could be.

We need a government to enforce rules. I don't see the problem here.

That's the rub though, isn't it? 
I think most people agree that the government should intervene when there are market failures. And while people are rational actors most of the time, there are many cases where people aren't rational actors (drug addicts, racists, homophobes, those with mental illness, etc.) 
 and won't act in their own interests to maximize their own happiness, *or* the cost of maximizing happiness does unnecessary harm to society (pollution, slavery, exploitation, etc.)
I think that the entire reason the government intervened with the Civil Rights Act was that there was a huge market failure, and a lot of efficiency was lost due to irrational actors. An entire segment of the population was not being served due to this and so the nature of people's personal preferences led to unnecessary harm to racial minorities. I think I can agree with you that it's an interesting moral question, but I can understand why they did it.

Upvoting just because this is hilariously misplaced.
