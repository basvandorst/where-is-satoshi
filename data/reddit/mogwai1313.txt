Thanks for the input. I will take a look at the link and maybe re-assess that portion of the activity then.

Oh no! I was just saying that what some people consider investing, others consider gambling. I am in the former camp. Sorry for the confusion.

I see bitcoin more as an investment rather than a gamble. Investors can buy and sell foreign currencies and commodities with hopes that the price fluctuates to their advantage, I don't see this as being any different. 
I do agree though that the line between gambling and investing can be a very thin one depending on how you approach the opportunity, be that a craps table or a hedge fund.

I am intrigued about those aspects of the currency as well but I think it may be a tad too much of a technical slant for the lesson that I am working on now. This is getting implemented in an economics class. Your idea would be an excellent one if I ever create a lesson for some of the more computer oriented subjects at my school.

This is great input! Thank you so much! 
I really like the analysis of bitcoin idea and that will be getting incorporated in some fashion. 
I don't have a problem investing some of my own money and then divvying it up between them but I do not want them to have to use their own money for an educational activity. I am going to look into the bitcoin faucet idea, that may be a better way to start this all off. 
Thanks again!

That is an awesome site! I have used a similar simulation when teaching about traditional stocks but never knew there was one out there directly relating to bitcoin. I will definitely be using this site as a backup if I can't figure out a safe way to let the students play with the real thing. Thanks!
