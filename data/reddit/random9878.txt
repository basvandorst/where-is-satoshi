Is Namecoin a sidechain?

Congrats, and thank you.
Are there other exchanges doing this as well?
@_date: 2012-04-30 04:09:23
Yup, you guessed it. Any particular reason they do that?

Before you've even assessed the situation and can say with any shred of confidence what exactly went wrong?

How about a vBulletin/PHPBB/IPB add-on that lets webmasters put an arbitrary amount of btc on the line, which would then be "earned" the active members of the community, based on:
* how active they are
* how many visitors their posts produce
* how high their reputation (karma) level is
or any other metric which would encourage people to post quality content and help the site grow. Basically, a profit sharing plug-in for forum systems.
Just a random thought!

Yes, I am a Django guy. I used Codeigniter for a while. Those were some dark days. I haven't got any Ruby experience, and I'd have a hard time leaving Django, just because of how great the community support is. But hey, I'm not averse to learning new things either.

Python developer here. I'd love to help. Most of the work I do is related to schema design and web services. Not so much of a front-end guy.
