As important and awesome as LN is going to be, it's still confusing as shit to so, so many people. The increase of bitcoin adoption comes with easy to understand technology. Think of how many people don't already understand our current banking system.
I say this because learning about Bitcoin has been hard work. I would rate learning sufficient Bitcoin practice as equal to at least one college course. Learning about the semantics and inner workings of the LN has been just as hard itself. If I'm going to trust this new system of transacting, I want to be sure that I participate in the most secure and informed way.
All that said, Billcoin thank you for this infographic. It really helps explain LN in a general scope.

Have no networking or physical connection to another computer. Air gap as in the whole system should be surrounded by air without any signal.

Mt Gox did it (Quote from Mt Gox Wikipedia)
"In October 2011, about two dozen transactions appeared in the block chain (Block 150951)[31] that sent a total of 2,609 BTC to invalid addresses. As no private key could ever be assigned to them, these bitcoins were effectively lost. While the standard client would check for such an error and reject the transactions, nodes on the network would not, exposing a weakness in the protocol."
But as you said, any legit wallet at this point has a failsafe built in.

I used to tell all my friends to buy bitcoin, back when it was in the $2000 range. They didn't listen. As soon as they heard the news of it hitting 15k+, they were asking me all about it. As soon as it became a mainstream affair, I stopped talking about it.
I really hate when other people tell me how I should spend or invest my money. Especially everyone who tells me to sell during a crash because "it's going to zero!"
Every man for himself, I'm not giving you investment advice for shit.

Mad respect to Charlie Lee.
The guy holds no financial stake in either, yet continues to improve the technology because he believes in it. Anyone who doesn't want to listen to the guy, go ahead, but know that he is a key part of bringing the technology of crypto to the future.

Might I add that "finance experts" have the most significant stake in the outcome of the system they created.
Banks do not exist for the mere benefit of people, banks exist because they can produce significant wealth for their proprietors. Bitcoin was created following the banking crisis of 2006-7. There is a core issue in society, and that is that banks hold all of the power of money. Look at how the US government responded; They bailed out the banks but told the people to go fuck themselves.
Bitcoin is the solution to that problem at the very least. It takes money and control away from the government and puts it into the hands of the people.
I trust a computer scientist to be more subjective than a finance expert, and that's why I have an interest in Bitcoin.
