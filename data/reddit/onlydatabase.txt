The info about the alleged email is from the wired report, where an unknown person (..CSW) "leaked" information about CSW being Satoshi. There is absolutely no information, that this "email" actually exists. It's unbelievable how the BCH community is falling for that con man.

This time already has been last year when fees were over $10. You really think people will pay for $10+ each time they want to top or close their LN channels?

Bulletproofs are no scaling solution
Schnorr only gives about an extra of 25%
Sidechains seem to be not a viable solution

["I don't care much about (public) sidechains as more than a research project. They make trade-offs that I think are very hard to accept for production use (the miners can steal sidechain funds)."

Even the LN paper states that we need on chain scaling for off chain solutions (LN) to work for mainstream adoption (133mb). This is absolute "no on chain scaling" mindset which is the consequence of opposing the NY agreement is exactly what is driving people to bcash..

We have seen at the end of 2017 what can happen to the network already, even though we are ages away from mainstream adoption: It becomes unusable for every day use (fees over $20). Completely neglecting the fact that we will need further on-chain scaling beyond schnorr signatures is not realistic.
