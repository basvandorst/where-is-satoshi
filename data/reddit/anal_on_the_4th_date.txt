I assume by "lost", you mean in the last week - the last time this question was asked and answered.

Only Americans refer to themselves as "land of the free".  Everyone else knows it's bullshit and has a silent snicker.

I have a fucking house in Tokyo, and I don't even pay that much.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:35:47
New, higher fees - same shitty customer service that doesn't reply to inquiries.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:12:57
Awesome.  ;0)  Thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:43:42
So while I'm traveling here, I shouldn't be able to access my fucking account to spend Bitcoins at Yodobashi camera?  That's some seriously flawed thinking you've got there.
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:30:29
If only they had support staff that could answer questions like that..
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:42:22
Nope.  App doesnt work.

Read the title to this thread once more.
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:16:10
From the explanation, it sounds like someone accidentally pushed the "block Japan" button and didn't realize it for 3 days.  I think we all give them far too much credit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:29:44
This shit is broken, and greed wont allow it to be fixed.  Thanks for the good times dudes, but I'm selling all and going 100% ETH.  The time its taking for transfer confirmation to coinbase is only reinforcing my decision.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:09:21
I just did $1 about an hour ago transferring .3 BTC, and my transaction went in the very next block.
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:45:27
Awesome - but shouldn't this be written in Chinese?
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:33:11
I have a bit of both.  Why cant everyone?
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:29:15


Did you see the screen cap I posted?
Do you see the link at the bottom that says "add a bug report"?  The link goes to a submission form.  That's how.
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:39:05


I dont think thats his goal.

Coinbase is headquartered in San Francisco.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:33:15
It works!  Sorry - was about 3am when the fix was applied.
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:07:13


Did you already forget that the coinbase.com site doesn't work from inside Japan?  So no - it can't be looked up.
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:38:07
Its 2 months on reddit, not 2 months on earth.  Some of us have been here for years, but delete our accounts every few months.
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:05:09
Same here - In Japan, and have been receiving this message for ~2 days now.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:05:48
Undervalued at the moment.  And infinitely more useful.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:07:49
I don't expect any help from you lot... I just want to get it high enough to get acknowledged by someone from coinbase.  What exactly do you believe you could do for me?
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:10:21
Give who "until Monday"?  Coinbase?  The problem has already been fixed.  They admitted they goofed.  It had nothing to do with Golden Week, and I don't even understand what point you were trying to make.
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:13:30


You're not really familiar with how all this works, are you?  I realize its cool and all as a teenager to "rage against the machine", but when there's real money involved, people don't want to fuck about.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:51:15
pssst.  They're in it for the money.  They charge what the market will bear.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:09:08


Why?  Give it a few months, and they'll convert you themselves.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:24:32
Go for it.  See you at the top.  ;)
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:23:20
Where did I write that I didn't?  
Read again:  In Japan, we cannot access the coinbase website.  No requests for information on why this is happening have been answered.  That is all.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:21:20


Then why dont you have any money?
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:35:48
yeah - I bought dinner for my colleagues at Two Dogs.. Was no doubt faster than paying with cash.   The owner showed me the QR code, I scanned it with my coinbase app, and we were out and on our way soon after.  No delays.

Now is the time to get cheap coins.  Don't even think of selling.  Wiser, richer men than you know how to play this game.  I can't afford to buy any at the moment, but theres no way in hell I'm selling.
@_date: 2017-06-09 06:14:57


I just used it yesterday to transfer some coins.. How, or by whom is it not supported?
