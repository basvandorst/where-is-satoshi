that's a good point haha. for one, it seems like the overall value of BTC is constantly increasing, dipping eery now and then, but how soon will the value just stop increasing, maybe even declining? i read there was a limit set for the total number of bitcoins, but how soon would we hit that limit?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:13:54
you're a fucking idiot if you think that was the point i was trying to make. super hypocritical on your part.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:50:26
why does bad grammar and math mess with you so much? welcome to the Internet - people don't talk formally here.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:54:45
i just want to say thank you to everyone who was genuinely nice in their comment, i really do appreciate it :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:16:18
and you're too ignorant to realize that all i asked for was the "simple equation" because i couldn't remember how to properly set it up or how to word the question properly in a search to find what i was looking for. so please just stop being such a dick about me asking for help. thank you.

i understand that you are REALLY into Bitcoin and think very strongly about it, but why does the motive for investing, number you've invested, and profit you've made even apply to my question in any way at all? i was asking a simple (by your logic) question that i didn't quite understand after trying to research it myself, so why would getting help from others that are more knowledgable of the subject (such as yourself) be in any way at all "stupid"? nice people that genuinely wanted to help answered my question within minutes. i think it's the most logical step to take after trying to look it up and failing, as Reddit, for the most part in my experience, is pretty reliable in helping others with difficulty. you've obviously proved that belief wrong, though.

just because i don't remember how to do something that i learned once YEARS ago, does not mean i can't do anything else that requires even a little bit of intellect. im not stupid and i enjoy learning. i just dont remember something I learned a long time ago. like i said before, math isn't my strong suit, and honestly neither is my memory. and while i don't doubt my ability, i only planned on doing things such as making small investments in crypto currencies like Bitcoin, doesn't sound too complex to me.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:41:42
thank you so much, as stupid as it sounds this is pretty much what i was trying to figure out :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:59:23
yes, i think i get it now. thanks
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:22:32
i guess lol i just really think it'd be easier overall for people to understand my situation in here, as not many people are acquainted with what BTC even is. thank you, sorry im such a dick to disrespectful people. thanks again.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:07:17
im just going to add to the act that this argument is completely fucking invalid. losing your phone is not comparable at all to finding a specific equation. using Reddit obviously wouldn't be able to help you find your phone you ignorant fucking douche. and if your point is that "ya, you can't" then that disproves your other insinuated counter point that i can't find an equation using Reddit, because surprise! you can.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:51:34
thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:00:42
don't belittle someone if they don't understand something, educate them
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:56:50
there's a difference between me being lazy, and me not understanding something. there is nothing wrong with asking actual people how to solve something you're struggling with in real time rather than googling it. especially when you don't know exactly how to word the question. it's easier to de Reddit in my particular case, as within minutes some nice people that genuinely wanted to help me out came along (and a couple of stuck up douchebags as well). people on Reddit are a LOT more likely to understand what I'm asking as opposed to googles search engine. it would show no useful results. i can tell you LOVE to assume things, but you're completely wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:40:21
thanks for trying to help, but maybe i just didn't word my question right. so I'll try to explain it again. so the current price of BTC is $4585.85 and has decreased $25.16. my current wallet has 0.00498859 or $22.88. using this information i guess I'm trying to find a proportion. i want to be able to see how much the value of BTC has increased, and use a calculation to figure out how much my BTC wallet would be worth. (for example: "BTC value increased by $50, so my wallet must be worth _____") thx if you understand what I'm trying to say lol
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:31:18
clearly you don't know what the fuck im saying either. by your logic, because you don't get me, I'm on a whole nother level. i guess my intellect is just too superior to yours, because you just don't get what I'm saying. but in reality, your just an ignorant idiot that can't hold any logical conversation. also, real original statement at the end their by the way
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:47:18
thank you again for helping
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:38:50
do you realize that that is a very common phrase used in the real world? 
do you realize that i clearly stated "by your logic" before saying that im superior? 
do you realize that you're getting nowhere with your arguments?
clearly you can't grasp the fact you think you're amazing, but in actuality you're just being an arrogant asshole that can't answer a simple question without being degrading and stuck up about it?
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:50:17
so right now we're basically in like the golden age of Bitcoin? Is that why it seems like there's basically no downside to investing rn? (btw, if their are any major downsides to exchanging for Bitcoin, please let me know) and thanks for the info above also
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:08:10
you'd be surprised about what people in the real world forget. you're telling me you've NEVER forgotten something simple? there Is literally a term for it - forgetfulness - like you set your phone down, or keys, and forgotten where you've put it? never? oh wait, no, of course not! because you're a perfect human being right? you can do no wrong! you are superior to everyone right? because no one is as smart or perfect as you! you're a fucking joke. you've resulted to insults to get reaction out of me. you hide from your insecurities by lashing out at others, trying to make them feel pathetic, feeding your ego. hope you have the time of your life being an asshole to nice people for no reason, good luck out there
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:24:19
im sure your intent was pure and you really were just trying to save me from other "mind numbing" questions. mind numbing to you is useful information to me. i couldn't remember the equation, but it seemed mind numbing to you because you already knew it. it's completely subjective. you just need to open your narrow mind and realize that not everyone knows what you know. overall i've gained nothing but pity for you from this conversation.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:15:58
i can comprehend the fact that you're a hypocritical douchbag on Reddit who can't understand something as simple as someone asking for an equation. pretty ironic
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:53:21
you weren't being a dick at all. im sorry you feel that way about me, thanks for the help :(
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:45:17
there you go again with the insults haha. and what the fuck kind of 3rd graders do you hang out with?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:01:05
i was pretty much parodying your alpha style approach to trying to prove yourself right, which obviously didn't work out, as half the stuff you assumed is not even close to correct.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:16:11
i have caps off because i like the aesthetic, it emphasizes funny tweets and such, having absolutely nothing to do with my grammar capabilities. and at what point did you find that i can't do basic multiplication? that was literally never discussed. you literally never once gathered SOME kind of evidence that i can't do multiplication. once again, you're not helping your case here. and, again, the problem was not that i can't google something, it's the fact that i can't search for what i don't know, unless you expect me to literally reinvent the formula myself, because according to you, getting help is a big no no. have you ever heard the phrase "you don't know what you don't know"? this statement perfectly describes the situation i was in, yet you still don't get that somehow. and don't just write off the statement either, it actually means something if you use your head for a minute and think about what im saying.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:58:39
okay this helps me understand the setup for it a little better, thx
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:26:50
thanks for nothing
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:45:57
can't tell if you're another person being an asshole for no reason or not but thanks for trying to help i guess
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:59:32
clearly you’re the ignorant one if u truly believe that in 5 years everything will be fine and dandy, when in reality u have no actual idea what bitcoin will worth or even be around at all. no one does.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:43:36
i try to stay optimistic aswell, but i also understand that anything could happen, regardless of what people are “predicting”. who know where bitcoin or crypto in general will end up, only time will tell i guess
