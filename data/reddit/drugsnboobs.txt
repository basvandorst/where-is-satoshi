If he bought a Versace suit I doubt it would look so awkward and ill-fitting.

You're missing the point. You could be taking this as an opportunity to improve the technology and making it more user-friendly. Instead you're insulting people and making vague appeals to "the injustice of the system."

Email is more convenient to use than mail, while bitcoin is less convenient to use than cash/card.

Which in turn makes it potentially better for privacy.

But it's not a "threat" to Windows/Mac it just coexists. I could see it gaining market share, but that's about it.

Well this really gives me faith in the bitcoin community.

Why would bitcoin be a threat to banks when it hasn't been a threat to the banks in the past 7 years?

This isn't an inherently bad thing. Also we (the US at least) live in a democracy so if we wanted a gold standard or if we wanted the interest rate controlled directly by the people, we could do that. 


You're right, but gold can be mined which is worse. It means the inflation rate is dependent on privately held mining companies. 
Bitcoin can be inflationary by nature if users decide they want it.

That's not a common use case.

Exchanges want high prices because they get a percentage-based commission.

And gold loses out to treasury bonds.

How on earth are people chained by having a banking account? And why do you think we're going to get widespread adoption of bitcoin by insulting potential users?

Oh cool, so I guess the only reason you could want anonymity is if you're a criminal? I guess buying a drink at a gay bar in Kenya makes you a bad person.

How are they 'parasites'? Taxing capital gains has been done for awhile. Currency traders pay taxes like anyone else.
