And that is why bitcoin was created to somehow, have an alternative to the current currency that we had created. Not because fiat has flaws, bitcoin also has flaws but it is somehow if not better, good and much more secured and decentralized than paper money. 
Tbh. Fiat is getting a little bit useless nowadays, from transactions to depreciation to taxation and so on. 
Bitcoin is limited, since its limited, its value will go higher and higher, until every pieces of bitcoin has been mined. 
Somehow, this current generation had seen an opening for a new opportunity and life changing solution/s in one of our problems, and soon more solutions will come. But for now, I hope people will accept this type of currency not because for money or whatsoever but rather a change to the old system that the government had created, and somehow that system had created chaos across the society. 
It is time for us to understand and look forward and innovate the old system that had been created in this planet for better and freedom of each and everyone. Just imagine a world without TAX, DEBT and everything is DECENTRALIZED. Just think about it people.

Very sad. Value is just made up, everything is made up. Fiat has no value. Same as gold , fiat have value because we “speculated” value into it. Same as bitcoin.  So please. And fiat is 
fucked up, you know why? Cause the government can just print it every single time, while bitcoin is limited.

Honestly he deserves to be clowned. I mean come on, the dude doesn’t understand how computer technology works. All he cares about is making money rather than making the world a better place.
I challenge him before he dies I want him to donate 97% of his money to technology, medicine, science, research and development etc.

If they only know that fiat is also not backed by anything. If the people lose faith in fiat, the value of it will be useless. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:03:26
I never trusted that app anyways lol.

Bitcoin is not trying to replace any currency, it’s more like an alternative. And bitcoin is much more decentralized than the current currency we have imposed. Today’s youths does not hate the current currency but rather it is deeply centralized by the government. People want total freedom. 
Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of 
BREAKING DOWN 'Fiat Money'
Fiat is Latin for "let it be done."
Because fiat money is not linked to physical reserves, it risks becoming worthless due to hyperinflation. If people lose faith in a nation's paper currency, like the U.S. dollar bill, the money will no longer hold any value. This differs from gold, which, historically, has been used in jewelry and decoration and has many modern economic uses including its use in the manufacture of electronic devices, computers and aerospace vehicles.
Most modern paper currencies are fiat currencies; they have no intrinsic value and are used solely as a means of payment. Historically, governments would mint coins out of a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, or would print paper money that could be redeemed for a set amount of physical commodity. Fiat money is inconvertible and cannot be redeemed. Fiat money rose to prominence in the 20th century, specifically after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, when the United States ceased to allow the conversion of the dollar into gold.

I believe the politicians and other people who keeps destroying bitcoin’s name will be coming in anytime soon eh? I can smell it! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:43:55

So I live in Japan right! And been using this application for awhile.
But then suddenly I accidentally logged out my account and I forgot my password. 
So I contacted bitflyer. And a beautiful japanese girl answered it. 
So she asked me questions about my account and so. And I got everything right. 
Then she said she will send me an email with an url where I can reset my password, then I asked, is your number included? And she said maybe... but then when I opened it. It wasn’t there :((( 
P.s Bitflyer is so great! I love this company!

Money and any material things that we possess is an extension of our personality, emotions, passion and it shows that how much we tried. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:34:50
It’s there fault anyway. Too much greed and fucked up brains inside that company.

In conclusion, when you hold. Almost everyone wins. When you sell, somebody wins (big amount)

Yea same here but the only difference is I bought it  in “19k” :( 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:50:37
And the old generation is hating on us cause ‘ their generation failed to build something amazing that doesn’t cause harm to mother nature. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:54:46
So I woke up and checked my exchange application on my phone.
And wonder why every single Cryptocurrency is going up. 
And now I know. Sorry for the weak hands, but you guys just lost. HODL’ng gang HODL’ng gang. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:03:29
The thing is, whenever I buy, the price goes down. It’s like the world hates me from buying lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:33:39
Obviously they saw young people getting rich, so why not pull it down and join the rise? “Typical government.” 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:51:28
Japan HODL’ng bitcoin when Korea and China tries to abolish them. 
And became the safe haven for bitcoin in Asia. 
And now...every country have open up their “primitive brains” and saw that Japan had accepted this type of currency and made it’s GDP grew by 0.3% in just 1 year. 
And now. Countries around the world are now talking about bitcoin and accepting the fact that it cannot be stop. 
And this type of technology will change the entire globe and the quality of life. 
And trash the old systems that the old generation/s had established. Indeed people are getting smarter and wiser. Hopefully the next generation/s after us will continue to change our life for the better and prosperous future. 
The end.

I do have a life. I bought half the price of bitcoin and still got tons of money to buy a new car. But this fucking flagged and removed my fucking past post where there are valuable contents and people were positively reacting on it. Yet here come the fuxking bot of the fucking reddit and flags it and trash it. Seriously? What kind of piece of shit who fucking invented this flagging and removing posts. Pieces of shits!
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:48:32
Electric car and Cryptocurrency seems to mix well rather than Cryptocurrency and gas. 
Imagine that people. It’s time to higher up our quality of life. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:20:32
And people where commenting positive things and yet suddenly this fucking reddit flagged it and removed it like they are the fucking “law” fuck you reddit. Never ever do that. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:11:51
As for it being indirectly related, I would say that BTC is considered to many as a hedge against currencies, similar to that of gold. Therefore, if the demand, recognition and acceptance of BTC becomes much larger, there is a chance it would be in a similar position to that of gold and the stock market.
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:40:02
More like....wating for the fucking people who wants to sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:35:16
Tell this to the whales and they will tell you, profit is life change and future is for the weak. Sad reality. Look at this piece of shit warren buffet. Doesn’t help the community. 
He did donated some of his billions but that’s nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:15:21
Are you sure about that? 
Imagine 80% of Cryptocurrency owners just hold and never sell. The only way whales can make tons of money fast is to manipulate those 80% to sell their “owned” Cryptocurrency and obtain it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:17:54
No! You know! Reddit should be removed! This piece of shit application or website whatever the fuxk you call it should be terminated! You know why? Cause they fucking removed my post where I wrote a very valuable information and yet this fucking reddit flagged it and removed it? Seriously people?
