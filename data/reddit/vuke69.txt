So you could put your wallet private key on this device from a suitably secure computer (or generate it on the device itself), and then be able to use that wallet securely from any device?  
Sounds interesting.

The reason for this one is quantitative easing.  It's artificially masking inflation, and making the market soar despite the increase in money supply.

There are a lot of videos out there that have the crackpot vibe to them; you know the type, dramatic music, doomsday prophecies...
Here's a series from Khan academy that presents everything in a very neutral, facts only manner.

I should qualify my "spendy" comment.  They're expensive for a notebook, but not expensive for a "good" notebook.  
They're slightly less expensive than the large size hardcover Moleskine.  They have slightly fewer pages, 192p vs 240p.  A better A/R in my opinion, 5.4"x7.7" vs 5"x8.25".  I'd prefer a light blue quadrule, but a dot grid works (I wish the website stated what the spacing was).  I'd like to have the elastic closure, but I'll live without it.  
Side note for the creators, having the perforated pages as the last (or first) signature will probably cause the spine to get wonky when all the perfed pages are removed.  Having it in the center should prevent that, but is less practical in usage.  (source:  My dad and grandfather both owned binderys, I started working in one when I was 12.  I've seen stuff that works, and stuff that doesn't work, YMMV)

Serious question, what exchange(s) allow you to put in a buy order with a bid price?  I've only used Coinbase (I'm in the US) and they don't.

Thank you for the update, and comments.  
I'm grateful for growing up in the environment I did.  It's hard work, and I learned a lot.  But I was damn good at it, and some days I miss it.  My dad was acutely aware of how the son of the boss could be perceived, so I always had to be the fastest, most accurate, and lowest paid person on the floor; of course I took this as a challenge.  The fact I could be his most productive employee by a good margin, while daydreaming the whole time about mathematics and physics, without losing any body parts (I did get injured a couple times, but never more than some stitches), astounds me to this day.  The odds were not in my favor, so It's probably for the best that I moved on.

Just bought a 3-pack of dotgrid.  Payment (from Bitcoin Wallet on Android) was as close to instantaneous as possible.  
They're a little spendy, but not outrageously so.  I hope they're as nice as I'm expecting.  
It would be nice if the price was shown in BTC before checkout.

You are right, ponzi scheme is inaccurate in this case.
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:25:53
It's nefarious because they are allowed to loan out, and charge interest on, money they don't actually have.  If a person does this, it's called a ponzi scheme, which is fraud; when a bank does it it's called fractional reserve banking, and is completely legal.

I was just wondering... If BTC became a significant portion of a given economy, especially an unstable one; I'm talking 30-50% here.  Could that actually serve to stabilize the local currency, or would it help push the local currency off the cliff?

If that's how it worked, I'd have no problem with it.  Unfortunately that's VERY far from the truth.  There are several very good videos that can explain it way better than I can.  I'll warn you though, once you know how it actually works you'll be as pissed as I am.

Some level of taxation is necessary to support a functioning government.  Taxation at an oppressive level, of every activity, transaction, and interaction you partake in, is not.  
I, and others like me, prefer not to pay for the privilege of being oppressed.

If they're running the minimum mandated reserves and 5% of their depositors (by value) request to withdraw their funds what happens? They have to borrow money themselves just to cover it. Probably not the end for them, but still very bad. What about 10%, 20%, or 30%? They're WAY under water by design. It's a house of cards waiting to fall.
Credit is fine. Very convenient, and makes a high volume economy possible. But personal and systematic debt at outrageous ratios is bad.

I hate to sound all tinfoilhatty, but knowing someone is a member of the CFR is sort of a short cut way of knowing if they're trying to screw you.  Maybe not a perfect indicator, but there is a strong correlation.
