My problem with bitcoin: if bitcoin ever becomes popular, governments will just ban it. People don't understand that modern economies rely on interest rate manipulation. If governments loose this, the worldwide economy will be much more vulnerable to shocks and prolonged depressions. Just look at how things were like prior to 1907 when the Federal reserve was created. 
I recently had to fill in due diligence for my bank that had a question if I ever held any cryptocurrency. I decided not to lie and they froze my account without reason for 3 months. Bitcoin is not illegal where I live.
Just look what happened to the crypto bubble after China partially banned bitcoins.

The fact that the technology is a great advancement does not give it value. It can easily be copied and is is not pegged to a physical item like gold. Noone denies the technology is cool, it is already being applied by banks, but again that does not give it value. Banks don't need to use actual bitcoins to do transfers, they just need the technology behind it. If I could invest in a patented technology behind cryptocurrencies, I would.

Rubbish. Governments including the US and UK have banned alternative currencies in the past and they will continue to do so. By your thinking governments can't ban drugs, igaming, prostetution, or protection rackets either.

What are you basing this on? Bitcoin has no value. I am shorting it till it reaches 200 USD. At that point I will short it to 0

That's where you are wrong. Bitcoin has no physical value. Just because Apple reached 1.1bn market cap, does not mean it is worth 1.1bn. it is worth whatever it has in assets, minus liabilities. The value of bitcoin is 0.
