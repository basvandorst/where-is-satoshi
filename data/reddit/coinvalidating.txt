Soon our server will be able to validate the cleanliness of your Karma earned bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:04:47
Your coins have been placed in "Limbo" status, we can't review the status of you coins until you review your status of us.    
Have a nice day.

Whatever Troll.   
You can't invalidate the coins of the validator.  








(I love you too)

We're just your friendly neighborhood coin validating service, while you're a coin validator.    
Plenty of room four both of us, I'll take the docks and waste management, you can have the upper side and construction.     
Nice and organized, what could possibly go wrong? 
Edit: stupid 8 minute wait.

That's right, the plan is to put in a front door that lets us control which accounts are acceptable.    
"Voluntary" registration will begin soon.

Heh they offered to buy this one too.

No one cares about some low volume non-compliant exchange.    
They will just be replaced by one we sanction.

WOW, it's a joke man; like it's clearly a joke, the account is 10 minutes old.   
I think you need to take a few deep breaths while we add you to the naughty list.

Threatening the integrity of the coin validating or validation system will be a serious (capital) offense.    
Going to keep an eye on you. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:02:22
I think if you calmed yourself a bit, do you have to bag laying around you can breath into? (remember not to put your whole head into the bag), you might see that the joke was on your side

I'm going have to ask you to cease and desist.  Now promptly sign over this username to me.

The alex_waters username on reddit is not us, this is the official reddit presence. Just wanted to clear that up.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:36:42
What are you talking about there is any army of people. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:43:47
Your coins have just been validated,    
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:45:48
I just want everyone to know that MatthewMellon is a troll account and has nothing to do with CoinValidating the people who mock those who want to centralize bitcoin. 
Fuck those guys let them go home.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:42:56
You have to have a capital C, those are the rules.

We are pleased to announce that we have joined the partnership between CoinValid and Blacklisted Coins.      
Now all coins being sent to your Coin Validating approved account will automatically be filtered through our partners at no extra cost. 
Long live Validation.
