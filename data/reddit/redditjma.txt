"Lets look at an argument made heavily on the bitcoin cash sub. They claim that Bitcoin Cash will actually replace BTC and take over its name, effectively becoming the new bitcoin. For this to happen, each exchange would have to unanimously agree on what the 'real bitcoin' is and the first exchange to switch their definition of bitcoin to BCH"
First of all, can you please source where you see this argument being made "heavily"?
And why do you think this instant unanimous agreement on the label of the coin is the only way for BCH to replace BTC? I haven't read anyone saying this is what they think will happen, or hope to happen. The true debate over the "true bitcoin" is what properties the coin has. As Gavin Andresen says: "Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value AND means of exchange."  He's saying the BCH has a means of exchange while BTC does not, something that BTC used to have. 
Think of it this way, the President of the United States is what he or she is by virtue of who is playing that role. If BCH takes the role that BTC used to have, then what does it become?

Agreed. We'll see BTC to 5200 again soon
