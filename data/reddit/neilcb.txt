Hi toosmartforgood, this is Neil from BitDazzle. Just saw your post and wanted to say hi!
BitDazzle is indeed legit. We've been around since last Fall and things have been growing steadily ever since. We have a team of people scouring the web for great stores that would do well on our marketplace. So, you received that email because we found your store on Etsy and think it would be a good addition.
Transactions are flowing through the site regularly (with Bitcoin and Credit Card/PayPal). Hopefully u/sefrojones starts seeing orders come through soon. 
If you have other questions or concerns, please reach out. We have live chat on the site during normal business hours, and if you reply to the email you received from us, Orinna will receive it and email back. We're also around on Reddit if you prefer to ask here.
Good luck with your store. Hopefully we'll be able to get you some quick sales and get some BTC in your pocket (virtual pocket).
-Neil, BitDazzle VP of Product

This is Neil from BitDazzle.
I just wanted to add to what has said here. The Kings have been working directly with BitDazzle for the past few months to implement this custom store page. It is most definitely legit and if anyone has any questions or concerns they can contact BitDazzle directly via the live chat in the corner of the page.
We're excited to see it get so much attention and look forward to seeing it expand.
Stay tuned for more of these BitDazzle store pages going live with other major brands.

You should seriously take a look at BitDazzle -  We've got a great thing going and we're seeing solid growth month over month.

Hey abdada,
Neil from BitDazzle here! 
Thanks for the heads up about that issue. We are still tweaking the seller flow and so you'll see some updates throughout the week.
We increased the height of the window so you are much less likely to see this issue moving forward.
Thanks for the feedback!
