You can buy from Amazon some of them are verified resellers. You sent up the seed, doesn't come with one.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:37:02
Top 5 seriously, sad. Anything that gets positive news 10x in like a week. Crypto isn't even "easy" to buy. If it was like Facebook intergrated with the ease of PayPal it will be the biggest cap coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:30:13
Bitcoin will be on the list. If just soley cause it was the first. Collectors item at worst. Silicon Valley people with big money invest in Bitcoin. They even admit it doesn't work well but it's decentralized and is antibank. Most other coins are very centralized and if they become king ,they will be attacked even easier. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:59:21
The firmware can not be tampered with, I mean they could try alternate website I suppose. I got my from Amazon in October and I am 99.99% it's legitimate. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:16:01
2 weeks is a long time lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:55:38
Stocks are safer then speculating on internet money. I started invest in 09, it was great. 
Edit stocks are also safer because you can buy puts. There is like a dozen reason why it's safer actually lol.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:11:36
They will be burned soon enough
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:21:33
Stocks are much safer
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:31:25
Is this just for Bitcoin electrum? Or some alts
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:10:55
Lol, if you actually think investing in crypto is safer then stocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:17
You should never by a mooning coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:54
Keep btc

@_date: 2017-12-24 01:10:43
Honestly I only mine vertcoin. I enjoy the community and like the devs.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:51:59
It would be cheaper if it was segwit to segwit. Needs mass adoption asap.
Edit: incorrect info
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:58:26
IRS tax reasons
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:47:18
Just did the same thing. For the long term it's good, usually more coins per day. Mining is a great hedge. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:31:21
Won't get back to 20k in for a few years now...ok lol.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:08:27
Lol ok ��
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:06:54
If Bitcoin does really good FOMO for alts. 
If Bitcoin does really bad FUD for alts.
If Bitcoin does nothing Alts Moon.

God I hope so, bagholding SQ from 39, but hodling 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:42:46
You do realize that if the lightning network lives up to the hype alot of alts will crash and never return. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:11
Way to jinx it
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:47:28
Didn't it already air?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:01:37
Crash happened the other day lost almost 50% of its value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:36:47
I'm on the same boat but ledger wallet does a quick test at the end of setup and has you spit back like 5 words or so. I feel confident enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:22:23
Wouldn't the difficulty adjust and eventually be back to being gpu minable?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:03:01
Both techincally are taxable but coin to coin is gray area 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:37:22
I don't even have a single coin and I have a ledger ! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:22:50
Is it 8 dollars on segwit? Serious question I just hodl
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:00:28
The nodes can also agree to lower the difficulty without hardforking. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:39:35
Your 100% wrong. 1070, 1080ti and you can mine shit coins and they moon all the time. Zclassic  just recently. I can easily make 7 to 10 USD a day mining with two cards. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:56:38
Yes people need to stop calling it core at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:28
I'm times like this ,nothing is usually the best option. I am doing nothing
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:25:52
Byteball is not the world's first crypto....
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:04:38
I do hold
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:44:35
This made me less scared. Someone has to take a long position on the short. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:32:40
No it's not. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:53:41
Yeah, I sadly admit that I bought a very small amount of bcash. 4% of portfolio (BTC is 90%)  just in case some crazy shit goes down. But I hope my Bcash investment goes to $0.00 asap. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:35:12
If you look all Bitcoin forks are rising actually. Bitcoin Gold even is. January coinbase is release Bcash coins and people will probably sell those. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:59:18
Bitcoin gold is cool because it's gpu mineable. I don't own any but I do mine with my gpu coins and I can actually see why it has value for that reason.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:11:13
Don't the future hault at like 7% or something
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:44:09
Yeah, but you said selling a Bitcoin is shorting it and you're 100% wrong. Selling an asset is not shorting it. Shorting is believing that the underlying assest is going to drop. You sell BTC and move into LTC because you think it's more lucrative. Selling underlying is not shorting.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:06:39
Right now just Nvidia cards, AMD Miner is coming soon
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:09
I think they will short it then it will rise again. Just hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:12:44
If you still have the hard drive someone could find them. Seriously consider doing that.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:04:01
Why you think it won't go past 1 dollar? Don't follow ripple but thought a lot getting some.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:52:38
It's really not the same thing though. People sell for many reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:57:25
Sorry I was wrong, read that from another comment in another thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:08:35
Yeah true.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:45:15
I invest in litecoin also and vertcoin. Not investing in BCH dominated by 1 miner that "bugged" and allowed him to mine thousands of coins. Haha. Good luck getting the masses to invest in that shit.
Edit: it's a store of value. Barely anyone buys shit with crypto. I can tap my phone and see it taken from my bank account in 2 seconds. Fiat&gt; crypto for currency
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:38:07
What chart you reading? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:16:59
I don't know not by computer right now. Don't want to stress out about it. It's happened before to me and it was fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:22:40
Gonna be honest I'm a little salty has I came I into  BTC post fork. So kinda sucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:47:35
You still get bcash for coins now?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:46:35
Yeah Bitcoin is up 800% for the year and BCH is up 20%. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:09:09
What happens if institutional money comes in and goes segwit 2x? That's my only fear 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:35:07
So I'm wrong? I did market orders twice on gdax was very small. But they were rather small buys
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:46:28
Get a ledger or trezor
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:28:02
Unconfirmed is normal, miners will verify it soon. But your good. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:01:36
Wall Street could try to short it and fail, cause BTC to rise even more. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:27:44
Ok most of it is from Korea which to me is suspect of pumping. They have done it before. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:55:35
Yeah it's better then nothing and do a big buy on a massive dip.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:29:20
Pretty sure gdax marker order is very small compared to coinbase. Could be wrong though
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:24:35
Hi it's me your wife
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:50:09
Yeah it's much stronger this time but miners haven't switched yet and TX spamming as not started. I hate bcash, but this didn't even start yet.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:05:06
Same thing is happening to me also.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:19:48
Just hold I bought at 5900,6300,6900,7200, and will buy at 5400, and all in at 4900
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:47:43
Wow didn't even realize lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:44:44
This is why I dollar cost average. I bought at 7300 and I'm barely down now.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:45:46
You almost did the buy high sell low. My big problem is that I don't buy more. Like I was buying all the small dips the past month but not this monster. I just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:03:22
I have similar amount and have 3k cash to side for small staggered buys or big buy on massive dip. I had hardware wallet before I bought anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:56:58
Yesterday morning was exciting
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:25:41
Ok all good ideas. Thanks alot
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:02:21
Gains are gains mate
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:36
In just glad I've been dollar cost averaging. Only down a little and got in October 27th
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:19:43
Yeah he plans to put in on a ledger nano s, in a safe. So he should be good then. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:00:06
Dollar cost average. I bought 7300, bought at 6400,6900,5900. I'm down but I'm not sweating at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:52:47
Check my comp. It's in ledger now. I'm good
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:23:32
No that is coinbase fee. Move money to Gdax, limit order, then to wallet. No fee
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:59:41
He actually tweeted he only has 5k in Bitcoin. Way more then me but nothing for him.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:40:54
Not sure, sorry
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:43:07
Most of the money is coming from Korea, that is a fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:50:22
I said for the year, put some glasses on please.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:05
She's goes down on everyone?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:16:09
If BCH take significant market cap from BTC. Any coin could take off at that point. No more trust. Think the whole market would tank hard for awhile.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:59:01
Only USD are insured on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:28:46
Not that's much. I put in 1200 total so far. Down like 170.00 sitting on 3k cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:54:00
I don't think there will be a dip then, especially with futures days away. The train could rocket to 12k before dipping. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:38:42
I've be doing staggered buys. Would have made more money with one lump buy at 5800. However if there is a drop, I'm not out of cash and can go in big. Still buying on the way up though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:58:21
McAfee said bch is still Bitcoin and he has 5,000 dollars in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:41
Probably network overload
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:07:24
Oh ok thanks. I'll start doing limit orders for sure then. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:24:19
No replay protection right?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:33:36
Same thing. I bought every 5% dip since I got in with at least 100.00 but didn't buy the big dip.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:31:31
Eventually Bitcoin will be the same. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:15:34
Really good find. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:16:53
I just bought at the ATH 6472! Bought some at 5900. My big buy is still cash for now
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:57:12
It's getting pretty close to strong support 4900 is strong support. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:54:27
Who would sell when futures are two weeks away...
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:11:42
It's too late. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:37:04
It's still less fees with market orders correct?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:50
Supposedly it only lasts like 12 hours and BCH new updates allows for dynamic mining? IDK. I just hold btc
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:59:40
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:57:35
&lt;-----owner of ATH BTC
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:12:35
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:28:08
Just hodl. My mistake is fear of buying more on major dips. I usually just buy small dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:39:59
They are manipulating the market
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:08:11
Oh we see the opinions of them all the time. They literally most of the comments of r/new and are highly upvoted. I'm willing to bet there is actually paid shills for BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:36:42
He could use nice hash, they pay in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:15:39
It's funny cause I got scared during the last crash and  didn't sell. But took some of my fiat that was set aside for Bitcoin and invested into square. I'm so happy it's still going to be riding the Bitcoin train. Wish I bought the dip still have some fiat left for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:38:35
If somebody has 5% or less of their networth in Bitcoin it's not hard to wait. I've held stocks for years before turning a profit. I'll do the same for Bitcoin. I also didn't invest more then I'm willing to lose.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:45:34
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:55:00
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:31:56
Stock market crash will demolish this price.....you from the future?
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:28:48
It's not over priced though. Moving average is not the only metric. Companies across the board are crushing bottom and top lines and raising guidance. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:52:26
Huge green candle at 7540. Support lvls look to be 7500, 4900, 2750...
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:03:26
Where should  buy the hardware from? Is Amazon safe?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:27:24
Great timing
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:14:39
BTC is up 7 % VTC up 30% 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:17:56
Market is up. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:40:51
Plan to hold them for years. If I put them on a trezor can I just forget about it or do I have to be aware of hard forks etc? Sorry last question lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:08:22
Volume is dieing though. Needs more buyers
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:34:46
Ok good to know. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:38:19
How you taking risk moving them to trezor?
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:47:55
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:45:12
Yes be patient
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:22:30
Maybe , best thing to do is dollar cost average. 100 a week or a month or 1k whatever you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:13:21
Ok how about trezor? Safe on Amazon? Don't have any BTC, but plan to invest 1000 to 1500 soon.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:28:24
2006 why are you posting this shit. Headline misleads
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:58:45
Pretty solid volume, could seek 10k again in the next 24hours
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:03:15
4900 imo
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:42:41
What resistance level will hold, how far the drop?
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:49:09
That's insane. Why would they remove it?  You had screenshot too
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:09:14
Maybe, I think tomorrow we hit that. But I'm buying tomorrow under 5400. 4900 would be really nice though. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:50:20
What's your sell mark?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:41:27
When's that's expected to happen?!
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:51:20
What about trezor? Just ordered one ;)
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:36:12
I use gdax right now
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:38:14
Why... newbie 
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:15:00
So I can just buy coins on GDX and transfer right to Trezor? Do I need to use coinbase at all? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:26:06
Yeah I was like that also but fraction of a single coin could be worth a ton in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:52:06
OP so if I'm just buying Bitcoin for the first time. It's better for me to setup up a segwit wallet correct? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:57:39
Fine to buy stuff there just get it off before for fork
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:20:14
Sorry, new. But how did you lose lite coin? 
I'm getting a trezor on Tuesday and plan to buy 1 etherum, .2 BTC and 3-5 litecoins. 
I nervous about getting into this, not because of the investment but just flat losing the coins due to user error or security issue.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:42:24
Even Etherum is bowing down to the king now. Hodl. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:41:18
Coinbase getting scared now. They actually doing something. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:43:50
You deleted the post ? Did you figure it out or what?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:31:45
What will help the adoption of Bitcoin is ease of purchase. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:02:54
Going to be buying sometime next week sold some stocks today. Plan to put into 50 to 100 every month.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:09:44
It still takes time took me two weeks to get verified on coinbase with my bank account. Not paying 4% fees. Took 1 week for bittrex and gdax. Money will finally be cleared Monday. Took hours for E-Trade 6 years ago.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:58:47
Support is at 4900 plan to buy then
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:15:19
It's me your brother
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:09:21
It's coming be patient
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:18:30
No i didnt, would have but waiting on funds to clear. But 10% is not a big dip with crypto imo.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:16:47
This has a good chance of touching 4900 in the next 2 days. If it goes lower then that, look out below.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:34:45
Keep us updated op!
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:56:49
Open an account on GDAX. Fund Coinbase with your bank account. Then instant transfer to GDAX. Place Limit order and sent to wallet. Coinbase is super slow though with bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:34:24
Or 6390-1152. People hodl bit then sell after coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:08:42
Sorry I'm new. I purchased BTC on GDAX.  Am I able to transfer it to my segwit address ledger?
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:10:59
I got a trezor and I don't own any crypto yet. I wouldn't be able to sleep.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:36:28
USD is fine on site. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:43:57
I don't know depends on what happens
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:47:26
Yes, ACH. Higher limits and lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:08:09
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:25:40
Ok nice, what transfer speed is recommended? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:34:27
I found this 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:01:01
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:17:20
My house is handing out full coins!
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:26:23
Yeah if you just got in...lol
