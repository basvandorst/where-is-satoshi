Two concerns. Don’t I also need to close the channel some time? If I only have a channel open to that 1 retailer, the retailer can’t use the money on his side of our channel.

So to participate in the LN I would have to open multiple channels, 3/4/5? Doing multiple on chain transactions?

Why would I care if they can use their money?

The cost is not low. You have to lock up bitcoin in channels. Locking up capital is not free.

Good luck with that.

Could you explain why it isn't according to you?

This is also my worry, together with the fact that we need to monitor the channel constantly. 
Lets assume we will have a constant channel open with a big lightning hub. We want to send and receive money on this channel. It will be mandatory for the hub to store as much money in the channel as I expect to receive without spending. I cant imagine a hub locking up this much money without me paying for it. So sending money and storing money should both cost a fee. 
My second concern is monitoring. They say you can outsource this, but nobody is going to do this for free. I would also need to pay the monitoring company for the monitoring service.
My final concern is the fact that both these issues bring a form of centralization. We have a few central hubs to which I can connect. We also will probably have a few bigger companies doing the monitoring for me. I wish someone could explain how the lightning network is supposed to function in practice instead of in theory.

You are right, its not really locked up since you can close it anytime. The problem is that it costs money to open and close a channel. Favorably you want to keep a channel open for as long as possible.
Yeah, it will probably not be likely a big company will try and scam you. But if you dont monitor it, they could.
I can see how big companies will also function as hubs. But I dont really see a diference between amazon acting like a hub or a specialized company.

If tether is used in the way they are advertising it wouldn't the graph be exactly the same?

If I would run a small node at home to which peoplecan connect I would need to own a large number of bitcoins for the forward channel. Someone opens a channel to me but its unlikely they actually want to send me money so I have to lock up money in a channel to the next route. 
For this reason I dont see how running a node can be done by people with less bitcoin.

This will not work for two reasons.
1 I need to lock up coins for all the coffies I’m going to order. That is not practicle.
2 starbucks cannot withdraw my payment for the cup of coffie untill the channel closes. This is also very unpracticle for them.

Wouldnt this also happen if people really deposited fiat which gets converted to tether and bought bitcoin with it?

It's below $8k. What now?
