Yep I agree! I learned a few things on HTLC's and Republic's mission. BCIO too offers a pretty interesting semi-centralized model

Are you aware of the current the state of the Fine Art Market, then you should be excited that Blockchain could have another use-case. Have you noticed the number of Artists accepting cryptocurrencies and number of use cases that are being discussed. If you are talking about the way a distributed ledger governs itself, than go to the developers for that technical explanation or just read the whitepaper. So many different protocols exists besides Bitcoin, we don't need the incentives BTC has that you seem to point out

There is also a growing Market for Digital Art!

They look pretty good! Considering of getting one for my town, would be the first. The more Bitcoin ATM's the better

That is likely the scenario that's gonna play out. Cryptocurrencies will be there during the next great Economic turmoil

Brunei is quite a challenge, unless you opt for Remitano. We have yet to cover this country. Do try to P2P ones we have listed!
