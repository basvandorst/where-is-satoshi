There are many sellers on localbitcoin, find one in your country and buy in person or use one of the exchanges

That is not of course any problem to receive bitcoins, we run few full nodes and all; 
But we must receive payment in traditional currency, otherwise it seems we might risk being double-taxed first when providing the service and then when exchanging BTC to fiat.
Sadly Poland did not recognized BTC as money yet.

Btw. Is there a prove of stealing here (just asking neutrally - for curiosity)
Because this reminds me on such topic:
on a related and more constructive note, it seems with smart contracts it will be possible in future to have 100% decentralized "courts" or at least proves, e.g.:
Person A promises to deliver electronic goods (e.g. create some work and publish it) - signed
Person B promises to in such case pay X bitcoin or other public ledger currency, or in case of OT afair a private payment in one server.
If now A claims he did not got the money, then B can provide blockchain address - or the receipt (in case of private transaction like on OT server), if he can not then it seems likelly he is the one not truthful. 
If B claims the work was never completed, then A could publish the work (even using blockchain, like encoding sha1 of the data in blockchain as notary prove of timestamp, or even put entire work in some ALT blockchain like datacoin if size permits).

About "pump and dump", as you can read or see in source, OpenTransactions is not a currency, it is a general tool, there is no pump&amp;dump on anything.
People can use this open-source tools to create and trade assets that they define, emit/mint (also for smart contracts, blinded tokens, voting, and of course for basic messages too).

Please post a prove that this is the address, it should be placed on the hospital's page.
