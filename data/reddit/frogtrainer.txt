I love the idea of BTC and what it can/will do.  However I'm not sure I share this level of optimistic outlook.
Sure, we might break from centrally controlled fiat currencies, but people will still need mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc. People will still make good and bad choices and go into debt, for both good reasons and bad.  People will still need to go to shitty jobs everyday to make the world work.
Yes, in theory these things could be made better through lower bank fees, more transparency, and less value lost due to inflation.  However, being in debt for an amount of BTC is no different than being in debt for dollars (actually BTC would be worse).  Asset recovery will still be a thing, your car will get repoed your house will be foreclosed.  Loans that default before paying a ~~penny~~ satoshi of interest will still be a thing.  Interest rates will have to reflect that.

Selling something for dollars is not the same as printing dollars.  (well unless you sell directly to the fed in an asset purchase)  The dollars you get already existed.  Just like buying bitcoin with something does not "print" bitcoin, those coins already existed.

Inflation isnt the increase of supply, it's the outpacing of demand compared to the supply.  The supply of bitcoin will never meet demand, therefore it will likely be in a state of perpetual Deflation.

That's the problem, no one has "insider info" on BTC.  Those who succeed on wall street consistently have insider info.
... That, and the fact that BTC does not represent shares of a company like stocks do.  Unless we are talking FOREX traders, then maybe they can weight in a little better.  I would imagine BTC offers lots of room for arbitrage between currencies and I'm curious if any FOREX traders would try to leverage that.

You're not making any sense here, I think you are grasping at straws.  An obligation can certainly be paid in BTC, as people buy things with BTC.  If your only argument is that TAXES, a.k.a govt obligations are paid in dollars, therefore, it is standardized, umm ok, then you just have a false illusion of govts and societies in general.  And either way, it doesn't support your original assertion that standardization requires centralization.

It's not a binary option.  You can still "consider the future" quite differently at varying levels of inflation.

That is a big question.  In the federal reserve world, the money has traditionally gone to big banks in the form of low interest loans, or the federal govt in the form of bonds.  More recently they have added direct buying of assets on the stock market (and maybe elsewhere? I'm not sure)  The "contraction" part is by NOT renewing some of those bonds, effectively removing that money from the economy.  
In the BTC world new money goes to miners as a reward.  But I don't believe there is anyway for BTC to deflate itself should a contraction in supply become needed.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:32:53

@_date: 2017-09-07 15:25:37
Right, I'm not saying deflation good, inflation bad, I'm saying both are bad, in their own way.  If it weren't for central banks trying to "shadow tax" us through inflation, they'd probably have a target inflation rate a lot lower than they have now.
But also, why should it be a govt's job to "encourage" people one way or another?  It's just more govt meddling, the same as quantitative easing, bank bailouts, auto bailouts, etc etc.

But you need giant pools of loans to spread the risk.  You need teams of people to work collections, approve loans, etc.  Whatever organization that springs up to handle this pooling and overhead, and skim small fees from it all to survive/profit, are essentially banks.  
The existing banks already have giant infrastructure to handle this and have a huge head start.  Removing just the ability to use fractional reserve banking is a tiny piece of the overall loan business that I'm sure most banks will just deal with it if there is a large enough market for BTC loans.

At the end of the day, by putting a price on BTC in dollars, you can at least say that the price should always be going up.  Dollars are fiat and have an ever increasing supply.  BTC does have an increasing supply, but that increase is trending from negligible to near zero. Should the price be going up this fast? Probably not.  But IMHO, it should always be going up against major currencies such as the dollar.
