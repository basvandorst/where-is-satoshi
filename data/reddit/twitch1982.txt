Don't be daft. 
Maybe I've just hit a point in IT where every time i learn something, it makes me realize how much I don't fully understand. It's impossible to learn everything about any technology. I don't understand all the inner workings of my CPU, but that hasn't stopped me from being a systems admin. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:23:04
I didn't really do any research when I bought in at 1000, It was in the news, just hit a record high. I know more now, but don't shit on people for diving in, as long as they aren't spending money they don't have. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:18:42

Yea, I get the idea, it's a permanent ledger that tracks all the transactions on it, via mining. How it achieves that goal, I don't really know, I assume there's some manner of algorithm that validates one block against the previous one, like a really complicated checksum. But honestly, I have no freaking clue how it works, any more than I know how my CPU works. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:26:19
ok, well, everyone else had to, at some point, buy their first BTC, Most likely with little knowledge of how it all works. Hell, I've been in for 4 years, and I work in IT, and I have a really difficult time wrapping my head around how the block chain actually works. I understand what it does, but I'll be fucked if i understand how it does it.

But if he wants the benefits of our infrastructure and educated work force, then he's subject to the laws of our country.

No one is facing prison time because of BitCoin, They are facing prison time because they were seiiling, or facilitating the selling of illegal goods. Think of silk road like a flea market, people can come in and sell what they want right? but if all the people started selling drugs, you can bet your ass the building owner would get arrested right along with them. 
People are going to become addicts one way or another. That's what addiction is, your question of did people become drug and gambling addicts because of silk road and sdice is absurd and shows you know nothing of addiction. 
How many people have lost money in ponzi schemes or con's over the phone? Have phones hurt more lives than they benifitted?

But it's not universally accepted.  If if you find it justifiable to kill enemy soldiers it does not make you an immoral person, it means you draw the line of what is moral and what is not differently than someone else. Because of these differences, morality is not universal. Some monks sweep where they walk to avoid killing any bugs. Their sense of morality is different than yours or mine. Doesn't make us immoral, it just means morality is subjective.

so, it tends to depend on how much money you have in them, small balances tend to get closed out. 
also, they sometimes start charging maintenance fees. best bet is to roll them all into the same account. 
You can see if you've had any money closed out by going to your state comptrollers website. 
I don't know your state, but Credit Karma has a tool to search it for you as well: 
It's really something everyone should just do every couple of years. I had 250$ out there at one point because i over payed my last car loan payment at a small credit union, and they just stuck it in my account. then i moved and forgot i had the account.

The effects of aging can vary though. It depends not on keeping the temperature high, but on temperature variance. Hot days and cool nights push and pull the booze into and out of the wood more than a constant temperature would, no matter how hot.
