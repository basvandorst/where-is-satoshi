Oh ok got your point of view. I can defend Quark by saying that the distribution model was part of the plan to take away the power of market manipulation by industrial miners. This has created an interesting effect as presently the difficulty has dropped so much that regular people are introduced to mining crypto currencies through Quark using only their PC. Of course Quark has implemented auto-checkpoiting in order to protect from 51% attacks so the low difficulty doesn't presents a vulnerability.
Another interesting effect that the relatively fast distribution model has created is that the late adopters of the currency have a similar buying power as the early adopters, unlike Bitcoin which late adopters are having less and less buying power compared to earlier years.
Those early miners which benefited the most out of the relatively fast 6 month period of 98% quarks, have most certainly sold and are gone by now. As for Quark creator, he is still present in the community and has always worked to improve the core wallet.
Quark is an experiment, we will see if this 6 months distribution plus the 0.4% inflation(1 million quarks) per year will survive. Also seeing that you consider the distribution model unfair after 1 year, I wonder how will people in 10-20 years judge Bitcoin distribution model...

if Quark is a scam, so is Bitcoin. Bitcoin has dropped in value from Dec last year, so did Quark, so did other coins. Its people choice which currency they wish to transact in, if they choose Quark are they scammers ? If so then by this stupid logic those who choose Bitcoin are also scammers.
I am mod of r/QuarkCoin and I can confirm this above user _k_digi, has been banned last week. He has nothing to do with Quark more than Karpeles has to do with Bitcoin.
