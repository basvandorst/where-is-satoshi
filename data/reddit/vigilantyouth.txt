Bitcoin is religion (as all ideas are) and as ppl continue to believe and newcomers continue to believe the price will grow exponentially

This fucking post! Exactly.  Coinbase saying their customers werent allowed to buy/sell bcash for weeks prior to  this rollout is fucking bullshit. This shit wasnt integrated in two or 3 weeks... more like 12-16 WEEKS!!! and not to mention they announced on their blog that sends/receives of bcash were planned but not buys/sells; JUST A COUPLE FUCKING DAYS AGO... GTFOH Coinbase.  This is just part of the war that is crypto.  This is everything.  This is why it's important to diversify your portfolio and invest in things YOU believe in - not what reddit/twitter/whoever else believes in.  
This coinbase shit has me fucked up tho... def. insider trading if that's even considered a thing in the crypto world lol! And def conspiracy as far timing goes - not a fucking chance this was random.  
Coinbase and Gdax failing shortly after this feature launches and gdax having bcash at $10k has FUD written all over it.... they are fucking ppl from every angle imo and this is literally just the beginning.

you didnt need to apologize for anything you wrote - those people are going to be the first to die when this shit collapses.  You are very correct in your thinking that in 2017 with everyone as visible as they are - especially with the dollar signs on their heads.... they def gonna piss off the wrong ppl or already have.  Id say its very dangerous for them walking around Earth and it will continue to be more dangerous as the prices of crypto climb and eventually destroy the financial house of cards that has been dominating the sheeps brains for 100+ years.

I don't understand how people don't get that this cannot and won't be stopped.  This is only going to get worse!  Everything is for sale.  You can buy accounts all over the web for cheap and only half of the world's population is online.

This is the genius of bitcoin... this will never end... printing currency to the left of the decimal should have never occurred.  Add value to the right. GENIUS!

ive been saying this same shit forever.... these dummies. IF ANYONE COULD READ A CHART OR PREDICT A PRICE THEY WOULD BE THE TOTALITARIAN OF EARTH!  
ASTROLOGY AND "TECHNICAL ANALYSIS" are both for wishful thinkers without any common sense.

If anyone has any good twitter accounts that NEVER post a chart except to make fun of whoever posted it - please let me know the account name thanks
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:39:44
thanks.  I am just super confused on how/why an exchange like coinbase would benefit from allowing coins to not be supported or devalued... Im cool if the bitcoin ship sinks - but this splitting the ship in half shit is trash
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:46:41
if you look at someones karma history as a sign of how long they have been on here... you pretty dumb too lol.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:01:49
How will you have two sets of coins tho?  Will the BCC just magically appear in a BTC wallet? to my knowledge you will have to transfer these coins at some point to either of the networks - since the coins are all currently on the BTC blockchain - how and where will these coins appear?
Thanks for your help
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:31:48
is the blockchain app or breadwallet an acceptable place to store the coins?  is there an online wallet like myetherwallet for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:02:27
how does that work tho?  if I have a wallet and send them off to one blockchain another will not be created.... where do these coins appear? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:07:30
so I can transfer them out of my wallet twice?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:33:12
this a super retarded response.  looking at your post history... you spend a majority of your life on reddit talking coins - TO YOURSELF lmao! enjoy your miserable existence ya cunt
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:44:52
what does this mean?  All coins that have already been mined will be duplicated on the BCC blockchain and I will have the same number of coins in both chains?  in total BCC and BTC will mine 42 million coins?
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:56:14
CAN SOME PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING!?  It's like no one knows... I have looked everywhere for these answers and I haven't found any help - even posted twice in this sub with no responses.
1.  How is this changing the supply of coins?  Will there now be 42 Million total coins (21M BTC and 21M BCC)?
2.  If I have all of my coins on a ledger or a wallet and I control the private keys of the BTC - how/when/where would these coins ever get to the BCC network?
3.  If I were to transfer coins out of my wallet to lets say coinbase who is only supporting BTC - those coins will be leaving my wallet - once those coins are gone - they will not be there to move on to the BCC network.
THANK YOU TO ANYONE WILLING TO ANSWER THESE!!  I've googled and I have searched this sub in all the ways I can think.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:44:44
thats what everyone should be doing 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:09:00
I know what I am invested in!  THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE TRYING TO CHANGE IT!! no reason to be a dick.  I know decentralization is all chiefs all indians (whenever they decide to be)... what I shouldn't have to do as an investor is worry about a coin  splitting bc miners cant get on the same page.... I invested in a coin... if some miners want to roll out - roll the fuck out! everybody trying to make something much harder than necessary.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:11:01
yeah from everything I am reading it has been in the bag for days now... why so much FUD? and why so many people still seemingly panicking on this sub?  
Seems to me this is not a big deal at all (could have been - but isnt)... just seems like some ppl got all worked up over nothing.  
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:32:22
what a fucking cunt you are
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:03:15
yes I ubnderstand I dont have coins lol.  but this still doesnt make sense to me.  If I have keys on my ledger - those keys are going to be the same on both networks?  My ledger has keys - when I send those "coins"  to anyone they are gone - I don't have two copies of them anywhere.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:00:53
Thank you so much.
So how does one take advantage of having both coins?  I don't understand how the coins can exist on both networks simultaneously.  If I transfer the coins from my ledger to any exchange to sell - those coins are sold... they aren't going to magically double while on my ledger.
Can you explain that please?
Thanks again

the dollar tanked bc saudi arabia and iran began accepting other currencies for oil

this is the funniest comment I have read in weeks.  I laughed so hard I woke my girl up.  Shit is classic.  I will literally never forget this.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:24:54
in 2011 Iran proposed that OPEC only accept gold for petro.  This would've lead to THE war of all wars had it happened.  Mainly bc saudi arabia was taking all of our gold until 1971 when the gold window was closed (exchange program for gold/dollars).  a currency that can be accounted for is the future!! HODL
