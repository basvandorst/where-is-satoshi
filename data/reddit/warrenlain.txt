People seem to be ready for whatever compromise they can make. Probably part of the bargaining process in the four stages of grief. With that said, it's human nature to believe x is okay because in the end I still get to y, and ends justifies the means kind of thing.

So what will happen to everybody's transactions when mining pools no longer find their block rewards cover their electricity costs? I assume many will simply shut down and recycle their equipment, but who will maintain and add more transactions into the blockchain?

Easier to say with hindsight.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:13:55
So miners can pick and choose which transactions will be recorded into a block? They can also determine their own transaction fees? How confident can users be that the transaction they are attempting will be included in the blockchain? Can all the miners choose to decline recording a specific transaction? And what happens if all the miners want to raise all of their transaction fees to some absurd amount? Does the lowest-bidding miner just take all of the block rewards and transaction fees?

There is something called a Jam Link I believe that allows ultra-low latency "jamming." Never tried it, but if it could truly solve the issue, that would be cool for remote practicing for bands, even.

Thanks for the explanation. Unfortunately, that's been a recurring issue in Bitcoin... I chalk it up to human nature being semi-trusting and careless, even when it comes to thousands of dollars. How else could con artists/cryptocurrency thieves exist if it didn't work often enough to justify the risk? And if I understand correctly, these digital thieves have nearly zero risk of getting caught.

Thanks all. I realize holding onto my BTC is potentially still at the I-will-be-part-of-the-new-1%-because-I-was-an-early-adopter stage but there is a part of me that thinks getting out and possibly buying back in if the next dip comes would be a way to mitigate some of the anxiety of holding amidst all the swings.

For Bitcoin to grow, I think we have to stop thinking that every incompetent exchange failing is a good thing and that the notion of trust is bad. Think of what the average Joe's perception of Bitcoin is now.

I think you are onto something. The average person really sees no reason to admit they're wrong about Bitcoin and will continue to see it as a failed experiment or tech for libertarian and anarchist elitists. Meanwhile in this sub we see the cries about statists and shills and it becomes clearer every day that people on both sides suffer from the same problem: they/we won't take the time to learn how to do things better (remittance or Bitcoin PR, it makes no difference).
Quite the hypocrisy.
I was literally on the phone earlier today with a man from TSYS. He was asking me how I wanted set up my website for recurring payments through Recurly (I believe in Bitcoin but I also want to offer other payment options) and I asked him for his personal opinion on Bitcoin. It was brutal but he told it to me straight: he said he has worked in the payment industry for 14 years and he thinks it is impossible to revolutionize payments and currency and there will always be a middle man. Admittedly, he didn't know much about the technology, but he was satisfied in his way of thinking and saw no reason to go out on a limb and take a serious look at Bitcoin.
It may be his loss in the end. The future may prove the old guard has had their day. But until then, **there is no reason to assume people will suddenly change their own minds.** Advertising/marketing/PR/branding is effective, plain and simple. Maybe the people who want Bitcoin to succeed ought to take advantage of that beyond making a few mugs and stickers and putting up a few billboards in San Francisco. Maybe people should stop relying solely on Bitcoin startups to change the opinions of the masses and actually make a concerted effort to put a real marketing campaign together. Remember when we talked about buying time for a Super Bowl ad? Remember Dogecoin sponsoring that race car? I think we know what it takes. Some of us just complain that we aren't already where we think we should be in terms of mainstream adoption and won't lift a finger if it takes learning something new.

People like you are the ones who are making Bitcoin thrive right now. It's awesome to see people so passionate about a new world, a new way forward. I just think that average joes are the ones who will be the ultimate tipping point. And it takes a special kind of person/innovator to bridge the two.

@_date: 2016-03-01 10:22:43
I don't use it because I agree with 100% of its anarchic philosophy. That's a very narrow view of what kind of customer can enjoy and use Bitcoin. I use it to store value and transact micro payments with low fees and to go beyond borders. My use case is not unique. I am like a lot of people who want to start using Bitcoin. And Core is keeping the door almost shut on these types of people. How will the value of Bitcoin go up if people are brought in just to have a bad experience? Are we just supposed to wait? And wait? And wait? Altcoins are waiting at the door. A hard fork is looming. And Core continues to appear to stall and engage in strange meetings with signed statements when a supposedly anarchic crypto system needs no central authority.
Edit: added "narrow view" sentence.

@_date: 2016-03-01 09:21:20
This sounds like the old "Don't do just one thing; do everything!" dismissal. A significant portion of this community doesn't trust Core anymore. Core might be doing a whole lot of things right and have the best interests of Bitcoin (the settlement network) in mind but right now, Bitcoin (the currency) is obviously stifled and they aren't addressing that with much more than vaporware and promises. Some of this seems worse than the ways presidential candidates attack each other. How can Core lead if a significant portion of the community doesn't feel like they're listening?

I was here and remember it well. The cesspool was anything but and it seemed the only way around it was sorting by controversial and many lines of code. But if the community was split then why did the big blockers get cut out of the discussion? It seemed to me at the time that one person had too much power over this sub, and that they simply silenced those who disagreed with them, right or wrong. For that reason I am skeptical that honest discussion can happen here in a reliable manner. I personally am divided over the issue; I think Bitcoin can be both an asset class and peer to peer digital money, but I don't like how dirty the politics have become over its planning on both sides. Someone like me cannot find a sub where compelling, logical arguments are the norm.
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:39:36
Yes I agree there is not much mention of Bitcoin but I found it interesting that instead of merely using Bitcoin as a form of payment, they are using blockchain technology to de-centralize music publishing, which is an on-ramp for Bitcoin/other crypto as micro-payments for music streaming, and a streaming-to-owning concept.

Judging from more vocal folks (who may be in the minority), that trust has been completely eroded. This recent letter sounds like a "desperation" attempt to avoid a hard fork which in the eyes of some, eradicates the stranglehold of Blockstream/Core. I don't vilify Blockstream/Core the way they do, but I do agree that it feels like too little, too late. It's a crawl that is stifling one of the greatest innovations (not just in money)...

The criticism over at the other sub is that Core has had a year to outline the roadmap, and they haven't. I don't follow closely enough to know the truth of this. But I do agree that the because the Lightning Network is not here yet, it might as well be vaporware when we are already dealing with huge backlogs/confirmation times.

This happens again and again with any decentralized movement.

People complain when they care. Coinbase used to be a great onramp for newbies and GDAX used to make daytrading a pleasant experience. Going back to that IMO is what Coinbase needs to fix, or else they are not only going to bring themselves down, but the perceived value of the ecosystem as a whole down as well. It's just not a good look, and until they repair the damage (which might not be fixable anymore), Bitcoin as a fungible asset will look like amateur hour to the outside world.

While this is just anecdotal, but I have heard significantly more people from different walks of life and political persuasions bring it up in daily conversation in the past few months.
