Thanks for informing me! I didn't actually know but the idea just kind of made sense to me since you've had to deal with newbies for years and years. Guess I presumed. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:48:10
Well if you go there and compare them to justing bieber fans they'll probably down-vote you. I mean, we're friendly and frivolous, and maybe a little naive, but that doesn't mean we're idiots. it's still 50 thousands mostly adult people. 
If you just go there and ask what the advantages of Doge are and if you should seel some BTC for Doge I'm sure they'll be nice! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:25:53
Awesome comment! I can kind of forgive the Bitcoin guys for being a bit less frivolous though, considering all the shit they had to endure the past years.

If bitcoiners know they had a chance to fund it faster than Doge, they'd have it funded in a day. Some friendly competition might be great.

I have a greasemonkey script that works for Dogecoin, it's a bit of a hackjob but it kinda works, and tips all the different users in one thread. 
I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to change to a bitcoin version.

@_date: 2014-02-04 13:07:31
I appreciate the though! I'm not really sure how to explain it myself, the whole "Shibe" perspective. I've always found cryptocurrencies a cool concept, and the absolute ridiculousness that was Dogecoin was just the perfect opportunity to try it out for me. The fact that everyone was so nice is probably what kept me interested. 
I wish I had more time to discuss this, I'll be back in a few hours :)

@_date: 2014-02-04 14:08:22
Interest I guess, we saw a thread about Dogecoin, we went to the thread to see what it said, and we felt we had something to add to the discussion. Simple as that. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:31:19
They can be, but as far as I'm aware the devs don't intent to do that.
Though frankly I wouldn't mind a new lead dev. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:51:22
Yes, so? Both are cool in my opinion. I think sponsoring gaming teams is genius, it's pretty much exactly our target audience. Bitcoin sponsoring that showmatch between the two best non-korean startcraft players to, that was awesome.  
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:44:40
As an outsider, I can confirm there definitely is. All this nonsense of overthrowing the worlds financial systems, you guys glorifying the concept of the blockchain to cultish levels, the fact that the only accepted political view here is libertarianism. 
Just look under "Non-Bitcoin communities" in the sidebar to see why most normal people don't feel welcome here. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:36:19
That might have been fedoracoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:56:01
I spend most of my time on but I do come here semi-regularly. 


Yeah, that's because a lot of people here think that bitcoin ís inherently political, and is a tool to overthrow the corrupt banks and financial institutions. That kind of stuff. 
You sounds like exactly the kind of person that we'd want to have here. When I first came here it felt like the fringe people had kind of hijacked this sub. I'm glad to see there seems to be some change in that now, I for one really like bitcoin and what it could do for the world, as long as people here stay grounded in reality it could be an incredible tool for good. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:21:16
Fair enough. It will scare some people off though.
I mean, I just went to your front page, and I saw the title of the second most upvoted post;


And my jaw just kind of dropped. Are we living in the same world? I mean obviously it sucks that this is the way it is, but how can you guys delude yourself into thinking this is unexpected? You might as well have posted "But Moooom!". 
You guys should be the ones changing the world to make it so that stuff like that can't happen anymore, not cry about it! Because guess what, you are competition to the most powerful people in this world, and you will not get sympathy.
That's what I mean when I say you guys don't live in the real world. 
I know it's not fair to direct that rant at you, but damn you guys need to learn. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:31:12
Damn you just got really unnecessarily mad. take a chill pill bro, I can personally guarantee you that that's not what I mean when I say "To the moon". 
I've given out pretty much all of my Dogecoin to New Shibe and Shibe that make cool content, I'm pretty sure I'm not in it for the money.
we might be a little circle-jerk-ish, I'll give you that. but aren't you too? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:55:37
I suppose that's my bad. I should call it support? Or just "speculate with"?

You're not making very much sense. I'll agree that the internet is something really interesting with the potential to change the world. actually, it already has!

I might not be rich myself, but I've "lost" what is now the equivalent of $140 on tipping and having fun. Thanks for that post. We might not survive forever, but damn are there some lessons to be learned from Dogecoin. If BTC doesn't change start changing it's image it's never gonna get any further. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:59:37
Yeah that might not have been the best of my arguments. But I do think it demonstrates that wherever there's a power vacuum it will be filled, and not usually by the nicest of people.

@_date: 2014-02-04 10:21:18
This is really fun to read, because it demonstrates exactly what sets us apart. 
You assume that the fun and euphoria is a result of the price going up. but it was the complete other way around. We had a splendid time back in the beginning when Doge was worth nothing at all, and with the price slowly going down now, we're still having a blast! 
The time when the price went up rapidly was actually one of the more trying times for Doge, since we had to do out very best to stop us from becoming all srs bsns and keep the Shibe spirit alive. That's actually the time when there weren't enough tips!
This is what I mean when I say you guys can learn from us, we do genuinely have something going for us that's different from what you're used to, and we seem to be doing alright for ourselves. I too would like BTC to succeed, and I'd love to see you guys pick up a little bit of the Shibe spirit, especially if Doge ends up not working out.

Hey, some people on here are really bitter. The lesson to be learned here is not the all bitcoiners are hitler, but that you shouldn't invest more than you're willing to lose. 
Many Bitcoiners are really cool and thoughtful.

Everyone read "Doge" for the first time, tried to come up with a way to pronounce it for the first time, and stuck with that from then on. There's probably more than 10 ways to say it and as far as I'm concerned they're all equally valid.
Except for people who say dohjgé, they can go fuck themselves. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:10:38
That's true I suppose. I'm pretty sure they're trustworthy though, that's one of the cool things in Doge, transparency. I think I read that at least one of them had less than 300k Doge.
They're pretty much just enthusiastic naive people like the rest of us. 
I still wonder though, what made you hate us so much? is it the circle-jerking? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 06:20:43
Didn't you guys sponsor a gaming team? I though that was really cool. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:56:57
One of the big things that makes me steer clear of BTC is your guys's economic stances. It's like you all live in your own universe and just disregard how the real world works! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:33:44
Sorry to hear that. That's not the way it was supposed to be. 
Speaking as a completely unbiased person here. I think there a lot in the Dogecoin wtf thread that you should take to heart. it might not be presented in the nicest manner but some of the criticism there was really poignant. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:34:01
I hear that concern a lot, that we have no actual discussion. I think a large part of the reason for that, is that the reason we got so big in the first pace is our frivolous and un-serious nature. 
Another part of the reason is that if we actually tried we'd sound like a bunch of blithering idiots. I cringe every time I see someone post we'll get to X$/Doge "because nobody thought BTC would get there, right?". I'd like us to keep doing what we're doing well, namely having fun. 
Having said that, we do have actual discussion, it's a misconception on your guys's part that we don't ;) It's just not formatted the same way as on this sub. You could check out [Of wolves and weasels]( it's basically a daily column with some noteworthy info on Doge. As you can see it discusses serious point, but in a very light-hearted manner.
Also, thanks for the info about speculation and support :) I'd say many people in Dogecoin would be considered support, but there's your fair share of speculators as well. But I don't really have a clue what I'm talking about, I'm just going by the atmosphere over at And I guess you could say I'm into Doge, but that mostly because I bought some to tip around, adn than accidentally trippled my investment. It might sound weird but I genuinely enjoy it, it's gotten so bad that I'm almost out of Doge!
After today I think we do owe you guys some more respect. Like it or not, compared to BTC us Shibe have no clue what we're doing, we're just kind of making it work because we have so much fun with it and just try stuff. 
Thanks for the interesting discussion btw :) 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:56:06

This is a really great post, as someone who had been part of Dogecoin for the past 7 weeks I second this.
Part of me would kind of like to see a war of words between our two subs though. BTC being all serious with relevant arguments and whatnot, and just being spammed to shit with that "Wow such talking" gif. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:56:04

Most of us respect BTC as something like a "Big brother" and basically want all of us to go to the moon! (just like you guys, remember?) 
We want to keep it fun most of all though! 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:17:03
Oh. Well that's just dumb frankly.
Guess you'll need to exchange it into Doge and use dogetipbot then,  though I'm sure many people on here would realy rather not. &gt;1M dogetips are a semi-regular occurrence. Just the other day there we two to the net-neutrality fund. 
Seems weird for a tipping service to dictate how much money can be transferred using a currency that was specifically designed to let people decide that for themselves. But their hand might be forced, I don't know. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:03:23
Your sidebar is filled with anarcho-this and libertarianism-that stuff. That, and the little that I heard form you guys looked to me like you guys had a pretty clear economic stance.

@_date: 2014-04-28 02:19:13
Both people in the argument are being idiots, it isn't about who's better. We're in this together. 
You're right that we brigade, but i's honestly just out of interest. This thread got linked on and I though "Oh cool!", that's all. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:34:46
I hope so. The reason I'm talking about this is because I've see someone come here, notice all this stuff, and now he basically sees this sub as a fun beehive full of loonies to poke his stick at. I personally think BTC and all it's derivatives can be an amazing force for good, so it's sad to see that stuff happen. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:00:25

@_date: 2014-04-03 12:13:34
My uneducated guess is that it's the actual effect from the gox collapse. 
After gox collapsed the market immediately fell down to about 400$, but many people rightly figured that the price would climb back up after that, so they bought in then. 
Now they saw it's not climbing further and they dumped their coins. This price now is might really be closer to the fair price of bitcoin. 
another thing is media attention, even bad attention is attention, and we got a lot of that with gox. 
This is all speculation though, obviously. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:54:22
You know THIS I could get into, our two communities trying to one-up each other in how much fun we're having? that sounds pretty awesome man! 
Here's something fun I did with Doge, i asked a bunch of people to send me the most beautiful songs they had ever heard and I'd tip them some Doge. I heard some amazing music that night, that I would never have otherwise found. 
I know it's not a Lamborghini, But for that i can bid you [one two-man bobsled](

@_date: 2014-02-04 11:12:22
Well that's cool, sure. as long as you don't lose sight of reality. Bitcoin is a really cool tool, but I really don't think it should be used to overthrown world governments or anything. 
Use it to make the world a better place, make money transfers faster for starters, it's pretty good at that. I think you'd do well to not mix up your political ideologies in this, if you want to market it to the world. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:03:16

It's your choice, and you can always have some of both, I'm sure you'd get a very warm welcome in though.

Just because something is serious doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:46:14
Used to be just an altered form of altcointipbot. That bot got behind literally days though, so the creator has pretty much been working since then to improve it. 
It's a completely independent piece of software at this point, but it's not completely independent from reddit yet, and reddit has limits on how many requests a bot can make. Parallel tipbots are probably illegal for the same reason, you may only make so many requests as a bot. 
oh, want some Doge? 
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:56:44
Alright, I'll tip it though, since the bot has apparently become twice as fast yesterday (thank you based mohland) it's completely through the backlog.

@_date: 2014-02-08 15:29:18
one of the first things they see is your sidebar. Besides, in my own experience, the second you mention any other economical ideology than anarchy-capitalism or you've pretty much set yourself up for a long pointless discussion with the first person who responds to you. 
Not really directed at you, personally, but that's what it feels like. If I make one misstep here and mention anything but the established norm I'll get attacked from 4 sides and downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:42:27
Awesome! :D
I think I'll do my best to do the same. I can't really act the same way in since it's so ridiculously nice it's basically a support group of 50 thousand people. But just remembering every person you meet has that kind of niceness in them is really cool. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:28:13
We might be a bit cultish I suppose. somewhere today I remember a comment from one of the founders saying "I wonder all the time weather I might have started a cult!" in response to someone asking. heh.
I don't really like the circle-jerk myself. I'll give you that.
I'm not sure about the serious discussion part. I think we have them all the time, we just like to keep t light-hearten. Yesterday and today we've had a lot of discussion about the inflation deflation thing, and I learned quite a bit reading either side.  But yeah, if it's not or you it's not for you. we're basically 50 thousand clueless idiots who don't even know what a block is so helping us might take a while xD

I'm pretty sad that most people interpreted "to the moon" as "become worth a shitton". 
For me it's always meant "Let's have fun together and make the most we possibly can out of Doge" and I think many Shibe still carry that spirit. 
And to be fair. YOU GUYS were the ones that came up with the phrase! 
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:59:26
Don't you think the fact that this subreddit and bitcoin supporters in general seem to support some rather fringe economic ideologies will turn many people off? Obviously bitcoin in itself does not have an economic stance, but its supporters look like they do.

hey, you know what. It looks like this thread might be a wake up call. how about you start being vocal about this? For example, the second most upvoted post right now, just go there and tell them that they should stop acting like a bunch of fucking crybabies and start living in the real world. 
It's up to the community to fix things and get this sub back on track. BTC could be awesome as a pioneering technology and a bunch of people that actually work on the future of money. instead of some creepy political fringe circle-jerk. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:55:40

Yeah it's hard, that's true, but if you can shift the overall perspective of the community it would help a lot. the Dogecoin wtf thread might be doing just that, or at least it could.

While I think your economic stances are a little out there, and you should probably try to be a little more open towards newbies, you guys have all Done amazing work, and the reason we can be frivolous idiots is because you guys have put up with all the shit directed towards cryptos all this time. 
So yeah, thanks BTC! 
p.s. Sorry about any shibe blatantly attacking you. the vast majority of us strongly disprove of that. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:56:14
You need to be pretty rude to get downvoted there, If you want to get into Doge, I'm pretty sure that's the last place you'll get downvoted. actually, if you make a post with "Hi, I want to get into Doge but only have BTC right now" you might just get on the frontage xD
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:23:28
OP just made a really stupid sounding title. Pretty much all of the animosity I see at this point is because "well they hate us too right?".
We're really all in this together. I'm a "dogecoiner" I guess, but I respect the hell out of Bitcoin for everything it's done.
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:07:40
that's an interesting point. BUT, the religion vacuum has actually been filled, everything that it had to offer has been done better by something else. 
once the same thing happens to governments, I'll be fine with it, it'll be improvement, not just removing something altogether.

Out of curiosity, would you celebrate being able to sell your BTC for more, or BTC making it as a viable method for transferring wealth. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:59:25
the price tanked, and has since gone up again. nothing very significant. 
I'm interested though. you say people will be more likely to buy something if it's worth a fraction of a bitcoin? how do you figure that? I've been to some BTC stores and I personally found the prices rather confusing. whereas x-thousand Doge was less so, for me at least.  
The biggest reason Doge went with inflation is to discourage people from just buying and holding Doge, yes. and I think we can all agree that that is what BTC is now, an investment. at least for most people it is. 
You can rag on it but you can also look at it as an interesting experiment. you don't suffer right? and you still get to see what happens when you don't have a solid cap. It's not like satoshi was an all knowing god that could predict the future. the anti-inflation sentiment for cryptos doesn't make very much sense to me. it's a currency right? you're not supposed to hold it for years, you're supposed to spend it. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:08:23
well that pretty much depends on the community.

Yeah but quite reasonably most people don't give a fuck what Jackson says or thinks. He's said some good shit and some really dumb shit in the past and there really is no reason to take his opinion over anyone else's.

@_date: 2014-05-08 19:20:53
You sound pretty mad. Besides your reply doesn't even have anything to do with my question, I'm genuinely curious how people here think. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:52:44
I'm pretty sure they have less than 1million Doge. and you can always just check the wallets right? there's only a few with more than a Billion. 4 last time I checked, and those are just investors and a very old gambling site. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:34:25
oh no what a brutal insult, how could I possibly recover from this! you don't even make sense. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:31:31
I'm not so sure about that. Out tipbot creator recently added a feature where you can see how much you've tipped. I've tipped around 840.000 Dogecoins and received around 670.000. 
What I'm trying to say is, we don't just do what we do because we think the coins are worthless anyways, Dogecoins is really something special for me. It's people being nice for the sake of being nice, I haven't seen that in many other places in my life. 
I tip Doge because it shows I appreciate people, and I know from experience that it's a great feeling.
So, if you ever want Some Doge, feel free to hit me up :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:58:35
If you don't wanna talk to me that's fine, I assumed you were Ok with it since you keep replying. I'm learning a lot here actually, thanks! 
And just FYI, we don't pretend to have any innovative technology, we know it's litecoin with some tweaks. the only thing we're proud of is our community. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:04:21
Hey, That's pretty damn awesome! Every generous act should be commended :) 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:37:06


yeah yeah yeah, go fix the sidebar then!

Much fluent, many willing to help. Such dedicated wow.

@_date: 2014-02-04 09:09:56
You know what, while ther may be truth to this, if anyone has a chance of not becoming you guys, it's Dogecoin.
We'll always be a coin based on an internet meme, we'll always be a coin who's value is solely based on the fact that it's community is the way it is, fun and generous. and anyone who invests in Dogecoin, who's not an idiot, will realize that fun is what keeps their investment growing. We've already proven that we can have serious discussion without losing what makes us us. and just FYI, there are many people who have large amount invested in Doge. last time I checked we we're number 6 in market cap. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:35:39
It might be a Ð, but who knows :P
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:27:44
Yeah that's true, and thanks! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:33:17
Have at it! As long as you're not too mean :P
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:28:32
Well I can hardly blame you. I've been here for a few hours and it's pretty tiring. but I'm also learning a lot about the BTC people's perspective.
There may be some truth the BTC being inherently political though. but that doesn't mean BTC supporters need to be completely detached from the real world right? The politics of BTC should be trying to progress the way finance is done now, they have the perfect tool for it, not try to be cool and "overthrow banks", that's pretty retarded. 
How about they start setting up their own fast money transfer service? they could make millions! that's just one idea from some clueless dude on the internet, but BTC to be the tool to do just that. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:48:16


Oh no, I agree, we definitely don't live in a perfect world, and governments need to be kept in check by their people. That's one of the many reason I'm really big on internet independence. 
And there's private businesses that killed people yeah. remember the industrial revolution? or the current situation in countries like china? Wherever governments don't regulate private businesses they exploit the hell out of people, that a fact of of this world. I think if you'd rather have a private business protect you you're being really naive. They'll fuck you over as hard as they possibly can for profit. I know this is the extreme other end of the spectrum, but history is on my side in this one. 


Maybe, but there's another big problem, namely that most people have no fucking clue what they're talking about. and should absolutely not have an opinion on anything that has real world consequences. 
i'm not sure where I stand on this one though. I agree governments should be held accountable to the best of our ability. but I think that should just mean they need to be transparent, not that we should let anyone just decide on everything important. 
Your emergent order idea is nice, but in the real world that's just not how it works. It takes a mindset that humans just don't naturally have, we've got to work with what we've got, and again, I think we're doing an OK job with that as it is. 


Who cares? I don't give a damn about whether people like the system they're in, what matters is that people live decent lives. You wanna know what's a good historical example of what happens what a bunch of people overthrow their government with the ideal of peacefully living together without a leader? Stalin happened.
This discussion has gotten terribly off topic but I must say I'm enjoying it. It's good to see some other perspectives, thanks! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:37:47
Cool! 
^^and ^^ehh, ^^y'know, ^^to ^^the ^^moon!
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:50:20
I would agree if this thread wasn't specifically about Dogecoin. and the comment I'm replying to wasn't specifically about Dogecoin. Damn dude, if you guys get to rag on us, we get to defend ourselves. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:50:57
Yup, all that "cyber-attack" bs was just cringe worthy, how come any decent mining pool can do what a bank can't? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:27:36
Reading you say this makes me want to prove you right so badly. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:23:12
That actually sounds very reasonable. here, you can put these in cold storage for when Doge is 800$/Doge too! (We don't really know what all that silly market cap stuff means)
+50 doge
@_date: 2014-02-05 09:19:45
That's really cool man! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:12:23
Well hey if there's something better then I'm down. It's not gonna be easy to think of something better that might actually work in the real world though. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:10:21
Haha, the only acceptable way to fight out our coin wars! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:02:34
Oh yeah I can see how that might be annoying. I personally think it's endearing most of the time, since it's really just a bunch of people being really enthusiastic about something and wanting to share that enthusiasm. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:13:12




yeah this is the kind of stuff that makes people think you're a bit out there. 
What are you tying to imply? That we should have a world without police, jails, bombs, troops, guns etc? Those things all exist for very good and sensible (mostly) reasons, and they're also in the hands of an organised group held accountable by the general population. the systems we have right now are the result of hundreds of years of pragmatic evolution of human civilization. 
And then here you are saying that's all just.. wrong. It sounds really simplistic and detached fro the real world you live in. 


What, so you think just "removing" the gouvernment would work? You know what would happen then? chaos would happen, and slowly, over time, with a lot of unpleasantness along the road,  some people would gain control, and the whole process would start over. i don't know who, but someone put it pretty well like this. democracy (the system right now) might not be perfect, but it's the best we've been able to come up with. That's pretty much a fact of the world we live in.
Sorry, that may have been a little ranty. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:03:16


I don't think that's true. Yeah, most gamers probably know bitcoin exists, but most of them don't want to have anything to do with it. 
I'm a little involved in the startcraft scene, and when I saw that showmatch I knew that that was golden publicity, and sponsoring a team is a great way to get respect in the gaming world, since you're basically making it possible for hard-working dedicated people do do what they love. 
That would get a lot of the people that just didn't care at first to at least respect you and maybe participate. 
Besides, that sponsorship came down to 3000$ over 6 months. Bitcoin could do an awful lot more than that I think. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:10:56
I'm pretty sure you just got it O.O
I might start actually giving a shit about crypto instead of just trying to get that Doge face on as many things as possible for the lulz. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:30:47
You guys seem to hate (fiat, is it? I really badly just wanna call it real money) an awful lot. Most people will think that's pretty weird. 
Personally, I'm from the Netherlands and I'm pretty leftist. many of you would probably straight up think I'm a communist, so there's that. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:26:10
Well anything with the word "anarcho" or "libertarianism" in it scares the shit out of me, and probably most of the people in the western world. And your sidebar is full of it! 
I don't mind the fixed supply, that's what make you you right? an investment opportunity. I think it's cool that Doge has decided to go for something different though. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:30:15
The ASICs right now are not competitive yet as far as I know, and Doge will be "mined out" within a year from now. ASICs won't have a chance to outperform GPU's significantly before that due to memory requirements, and after that they'll be the only things that can run efficiently with 10k Doge per block, so they'll be really useful for keeping the network going. 
I think Doge may have dodged that bullet, but it's speculation at this point obviously. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:59:23
This one failed. Just thought you'd like to know :)
Unless I don't know what I'm talking about in which case feel free to flame the shit out of me. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:25:18
By fringe economics I just mean economic ideas held a by small percentage of people that the rest generally thinks are very bad ideas. 
I think bitcoin has some great advantages, but if you're just scaring people away the minute they come here it won't matter. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:58:37
Thanks ANALCUNTHOLOCAUST! paragon of maturity and reason! 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:17:19
That is ridiculously insightful. Look at it this way, we're both good pr for crypto, we just have completely different target audiences! 
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:58:17
I kind of doubt there are many real "competitors" of bitcoin, it's just that most people don't have a clue what it does and think it's scary as hell, a lot could be done to improve the image. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:28:21
HOLY SHIT, Shots fired! This is so true if physically hurts! Exactly the reason I steered clear of this sub! 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:56:37
You know I never though of it like that, but you're exactly right.
I just came into crypto because of how much the idea of "Dogecoin" trolled the status quo, but I ended up spending months of my life in it. It's a really neat idea that has so much potential, as long as people work to realize it. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:09:16
God damn that's deep bro. I'm actually a little inspired. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:35:47
I'm pretty sure it's in javascript, can you read that? I didn't make it myself so I don't fully understand it. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:18:25
Hey I got into crypto through Doge, and now I'm reading this thread, progress right? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 06:24:05
I really think they would help you image, which is one of the biggest obstacles you guys face. You know, fix your sidebar and all that. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:47:34
Before. and please don't even try to suggest that had anything to do with it, you have no right to detract from the generosity of the people that Donated thousands of dollars worth to charity. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:00:31
1 bit = 100 satoshi = one millionth of a Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:42:43
Yeah that's right, weren't you the guys that came up with it? You had the original ToTheMoonGuy and everything! 
You know what, **TO THE MOON!** With the both of us! :D
@_date: 2014-05-05 06:37:27
Some people decided there is now a correct way apparently, It looks like the war has only just begun. I'm pretty sure Jackson Palmer killed dogecoin by declaring a "correct" pronunciation. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:42:16
Thanks for writing up things bitcoin has Done! I won't let people on say Bitcoiners aren't generous. Hell, the biggest tip I ever got was a bitcoin tip, RIP bot. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:36:25
I know it wasn't supposed to be that way, they basically turned a bug into a feature. It may have been a naive mistake, but I don;t think so. Dogecoin has always been a little bit different from all the other cryptos wouldn't you agree? I'd say; just look at it as an experiment, it's not like you've got anything to lose right? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:57:01
thanks for the cool response! and for the tip :)
It's kind of like herding cats. I think a great improvement would be removing the links to fringe ideologies from the sidebar. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:15:31
like BTC isnt gambling
