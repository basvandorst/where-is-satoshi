It's not news that Coinbase lacks competence and is not a friend of Bitcoin.  Perhaps the news is the coordination between the BCH price pump, CNBC shilling for BCH, and Coinbase listing it?  
I thought perhaps something else happened while I was asleep!

BofA has not objected to my ACH transfers to and from GDAX.  Perhaps they have a different standard for wire transfers?

I thought lighweight wallets only learn about the receipt of BTC to one of its addresses after the fact.  How can it prevent the receipt of BTC after it has already happened?
I'm not sure about full nodes.  Are they able to blackball specific addresses or is that left to miners?
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:52:17
I believe exchanges operate their own wallets and nodes.  How can they prevent BTC from certain addresses from being sent to their wallet without involving any wallets, nodes, or miners?  
Do you mean that exchanges and merchants can blacklist addresses by stealing any BTC that is sent to them from those addresses?

If corporations can create value by launching bitcoin-clone coins, adding an additional 21 million to the total limit of "bitcoins" with each hardfork, this undermines the scarcity value of bitcoin.

Thanks.  I read at r/BTC that the 20% difficulty adjustments would begin with block 478578.  In the absence of other evidence, I believe you.
In either case, there is no reason for ViaBTC to withhold BCH hash power to reduce mining difficulty at this particular time (before 478575 is found).  Correct?

I did check Amazon before posting and saw they sell "satellite radio" antennas around that price range, and "satellite tv" antennas for much more money.  So a "satellite radio" antenna would work?
Any idea whether an Intel Celeron CPU N2830 @ 2.16 GHz laptop is fast enough?

Ledger posted an updated tutorial,  in which the following appears:
"WARNING : do not send BTC or BCH before you split your accounts, otherwise both balances will be decreased from the single transaction."
This is a big change from what they wrote in their recent blog post  : "Splitting your funds is no longer a requirement now that the Bitcoin Cash chain offers a two-way replay protection, but is still recommended if you plan to hold your Bitcoin Cash for some time to avoid getting lured by scammers...."
I am hoping the new warning is not true, because I already used their wallet to send some BCH to an exchange without splitting my coins. So far, it did not affect the BTC balance of my wallet.
I've been very impressed with Ledger's quick response to the fork, but this is a big issue if it is true!
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:26:50
Based on what I've read, the mining difficulty of BCH is now guaranteed to decline no matter how quickly the next 6 blocks are found, which would mean there is no incentive for miners to withhold their hash power from BCH (other than being able to earn more money mining BTC).  Is this correct?  
How bad a sign is it for BCH that it's hashrate on the ViaBTC pool remains so low (currently 70 P)?  Here is the link:

So will this enable people with slow crappy internet connections to run nodes?  
If so, where do you buy a satellite antenna and how much does it cost?

The high volume of BTC trading in China and the PBOC "crackdown" on exchanges did not concern me.  I knew much of the trading reflected gambling and high speed trading (in pursuit of very short-term gains) rather than a desire to accumulate bitcoin.  
Hardforks are more concerning IMO.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:44:37
In what way would that be better than using bitcoin to pay with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:10:18
I posted this issue on r/ledgerwallet and received a response from a Ledger representative.  He said the warning in their relatively new tutorial was WRONG.  They quickly removed the tutorial from their webpage after responding to my post.  So relax!   [It did scare me too though!]
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:24:17
If what you are saying is true, that would mean the conflict in Ledger's statements is not due to them discovering a bug in their newly updated software/firmware.  Instead, they realized they were completely wrong when they wrote just a couple days ago:  "Splitting your funds is no longer a requirement now that the Bitcoin Cash chain offers a two-way replay protection."  I'm not sure what to believe right now.
If moving my BTC to a new address would accomplish the same thing as "splitting my BCH" (moving the BCH to a new address), then I wonder why Ledger does not mention this option (considering BCH blocks may take 12 hours to mine and folks who want to protect their privacy should move their BCH in small chunks if it is currently in many addresses).  Are you sure moving your BTC is as good as moving your BCH for security?
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:51:15
But if you only have bitcoin, would this new technology provide any incentive to buy and use LTC?
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:18:04
I believe Bitcoin needs to first achieve widespread adoption as a long term investment vehicle (not just short term speculation) before it can become a widespread medium of exchange.  
I do some speculating with altcoins (hoping to sell after they pump), but I use Bitcoin as a long term investment.

I've used bitcoin to pay for stuff when I wanted a degree of anonymity and when I did not trust the retailer enough to use a credit card.  However IMO, using bitcoin for retail purchases is bad for bitcoin when the retailer (or the payment service) will immediately trade it for fiat, putting downward pressure on bitcoin's price.  I think bitcoin's price and market cap needs to be much higher in order to reduce its price volatility and increase its utility as a medium of exchange.

Six was standard practice in early 2015.  Due to the increase in mining hashpower (and power consumption), many (including exchanges) now consider a transaction valid after one or two transactions.
I want to know what the standard practice and recommendation was from 2010 to 2014.
EDIT:  For example, how many transaction confirmations did Mt. Gox require in the earliest days before they let you trade (and withdraw) your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:19:44
Then they don't have to confiscate any equipment to attack the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:04:10
If Chinese miners are allowed to keep mining but are forced to join a government approved pool in order to sell their coins, would that give the government enough control to attempt an attack? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:36:29
Well, I think they could do a 95% attack on Bcash!
...and you seemed to indicate that if they force all Chinese miners to join a mining pool that they control, then they do not need to confiscate the hardware. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:36:00
Bcash is not doomed to fail anytime soon IMO.  If people believe that the unknown mining pool that controls most of the hashpower will continue mining BCH when it is less profitable than Bitcoin, that the unknown mining pool will refrain from 51% attacks (or 91% attacks), and that the unknown mining pool will not be shut down by governmental authorities in whatever country they reside, then people can rationally use it as a store of value.  It makes more sense than the hundreds of obvious ICO scams that people can't wait to pour money into.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:06:31
I listened to the recording of the 911 call; the "swatter" did everything he could to get Jameson Lopp (and/or members of his family) killed.   The  propaganda and personal skapegoating attacks of Roger Ver and his r/btc sockpuppet army may have played a role.
I wonder whether the NYA cabal worries about their own safety.  If they succeed in disrupting the value and utility of Bitcoin, someone on the other side of the debate could seek revenge. I certainly hope nothing like that happens.
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:04:27
It is rational and valid to consider the quality of the community to be a reflection of the value of the crypto.  I recommend selling Dcash (they are being downgraded) before it becomes Ftrash.

So if economic nodes are afraid to run segwit2x software due to their inferior coders, Bitmain can get away with backing out of BIP-91 with little risk?  Could that be why they didn't want to work with core developers?

Hi Wolf.  I'm a true believer who agrees with you about BCC.  Is there a reasonably safe way for Americans to dump their BCC?

It enables you to see/play MANY times the number of hands per hour.  So although your expected profit per hand may be less online, your expected profit per hour can be considerably greater than in live games.  Also no tipping the dealers, possibly no tax on tournament winnings, no travel expenses, etc.

Would this be true for a mining cartel that controls a large percentage of the network hashing power?

I believe both Ledger and Trezor will provide BCC support for the wallets if the hard fork occurs.  The risky part is trying to sell your BCC...especially if you want to sell them in advance of their existence on a shady exchange in China.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:37:52
Are most "economic nodes" enforcing BIP-91?  If not, why couldn't the miners just decide to not run the BIP-91 software?  If Bitmain decides not to activate BIP-91 this time, would they have time to lock it in again before August 1?
 
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:39:44
Will my Ledger Nano wallet be storing the private keys to my BCC coins if/when they hard-fork?  
The BCC website says Electrum will make a BCC wallet; will it be compatible with Ledger hardware wallets?

Do we know whether the BIP91 signalling miners are currently running a BIP91 client?

@_date: 2017-07-21 04:24:00
I'm not sure it is possible for Bitmain to lose more credibility.  
If they decide to sabotage this BIP91 activation, would they still have time to "lock in" and activate BIP91 before August 1?  A lot of money could be made by shorting BTC and crashing the price.
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:06:39
In addition, one's self-control and mathematical understanding of the game are usually more important than spotting physical tells.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:43:32
They wouldn't need to "move" all of their btc.  If they plan to activate BIP91 and segwit after crashing the market, then they would be unlikely to lose money on their btc long position.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:07:49
I just received a response from Ledger support, who say message signing is not supported by the Ledger Nano.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:34:54
Does the "BIP 91 Lock-in" mean it is impossible for miners who signaled for BIP-91 to avoid running the BIP-91 software (and continue mining bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:22:52


Are the parties to the New York Agreement (e.g., Coinbase) supposed to be running BIP-91 enforcing nodes?

From what I saw, most of the folks at r/BTC hate Andreas.  It really reinforced my negative impression of r/BTC!

Bitcoin is revolutionary because it offers an alternative to fiat money which is issued and controlled by corporations in collusion with governments in order to control people and confiscate their savings.  Bitcoin is the people's money.  The efforts of a corporate cartel to gain control of the bitcoin protocol or hijack the Bitcoin name with a corporate-controlled forked altcoin and propaganda campaign are attacks.
