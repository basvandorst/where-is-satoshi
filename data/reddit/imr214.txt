no I just didn't realize that exchanges offered stoploss buy orders with bitcoin. Who offers this service and what is their fee?

I would love to see someone secure funding with that argument. You'd need bitcoins in reserve to issue refunds. The question is how many do you need? 200? 400? 500? well that all depends, and not on how big your business is but how volatile the currency is feeling that hour. Maybe we could accept payment in the form of shitty stocks. After all bitcoin is hardly even a currency. It might be one day, but as of now only a very small amount of  bitcoins are used to purchase legal products and services outside of a currency exchange.

you sound suprised that bill gates doesnt like the volatility in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:56:16
why? Why would any business, that is literally in the business of making money, give incentives to a currency that is highly volatile while discouraging payments in a safer and much easier to use form?

quick question, I had this idea to open a theatre in the southside of Chicago that only ran poetry readings of the epic of Gilgamesh, in its original ancient sumarian. Do you think this is a good idea? I'm stuck between this and opening up a business that only accepts bitcoins. Any advice?

they would never secure funding and lying about or leaving something like this would have your shareholders suing not if but when your business went belly up.

I hope you picked up on the sarcasm

this is from bitpay's website. 
"When do I get paid?
We prefer to send one payment to every merchant each day, which clears out their balance with BitPay. This prevents balances from accumulating and discourages hackers. Payments to bank accounts are made per business day. Payments in bitcoins are sent to the bitcoin address of your choice, at least once per calendar day. "
Bitcoin's price has fluctuated more than 3% in a single day. Does bitpay have enough money on its books to function if a large amount of people want to sell off their coins, how about coinbase? How do I ensure that I am not being a party to money laundering? Could I be found guilty of being willfully ignorant to my role in a money laundering scheme? How do I get investors for my business? How do I ensure that I am not misleading my investors? How do I ensure that these investments are safe and that my business will not be sued by those investors? How do I ensure these investments are safe so I can gain future investments? How do I make my business run when few people use bitcoins legally as a currency rather than an investment? How do I know these exchanges are completely legal? How do I protect my business from hackers? How do I make sure my customers are protected from hackers? How do my customers purchase bitcoins? If they are using one of the online exchanges isn't the credit card fees built into the exchange rate? This means higher prices for my customers and I still have those fees when I cash unless I'm actually receiving cash instead of crediting to my card. How do I handle refunds? Do i give them the amount in bitcoins  back as would make sense? Wouldn't my customers who purchase something, receive their item a week later, return it and receive 5 bitcoins back which significantly decreased? On the other hand if I issue a refund for an item purchased with a retail valued of 5 bitcoins at the time of purchase and suddenly bitcoin's price skyrockets do I still issue those 5 bitcoins? Wouldn't this anger my customers if I don't issue them bitcoins? Wouldn't this anger my customers if I don't issue them the cash equivalent? Only a few out of many many other questions that you'd want answers for before opening a business entirely run off of bitcoins.

I would be scared shitless to short Bitcoin. Shorting a volatile investment like Bitcoin is not a good idea
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:55:26
I can't speak for him but because accepting only bitcoins would A, make your business only accessible by those who have bitcoins. B youre accepting a "currency" that is highly volatile. Additionally no one would invest in your business.

For the love of God don't tell your parents to switch their retirement into Bitcoin
