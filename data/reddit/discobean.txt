I think its his brother, Arthur. Yep.

No, in real multi-sig each party signs a transaction to move the coins to an agreed destination.
SSS means the 2 people can get the private key, and then any one of them can quickly move all the funds wherever they want, without the other knowing what just happened.
@_date: 2014-03-11 08:45:59
Arthur, are you the real Satoshi Nakamoto?
@_date: 2014-07-18 09:19:02
Send me the 10mil now and I will send you 2% back this month, 1% next, 0.5% next ... then nothing in 10 months :)

Hi Jimmy, my only recommendation would be to see whether any staff or suppliers might be interested in being paid in Bitcoin.
This way you wouldn't need to convert to fiat.
I believe BitPay has support for paying employees.

I remember when it was 13.37, and 133.7, and people posted pictures.

If you generate a BIP38 paper wallet, you can just not print out or cut out the public key, and store the encrypted private key at your friends house, or somewhere publicly.
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:33:38
you say that, until the price drops...

He also had double spaces after full stops, both on his emails, publications, and also on his website source code.

:) Don't have any issues making it so we can accept it technically.
The issue I have is selling it to the Cafe's so they use it, and that the process is easy for their staff to manage, and that people don't fumble around for a BTC transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:02:29
Ok, Meetup done: 
@_date: 2013-06-26 02:05:11
The problem is the 49% is not the majority, and so their fork will most likely not be the longest chain, instead Intel's one would be (because they have 51%) of the hashing power.
Again the majority can't go back to the last fork, because they are no longer the majority.  For that to happen they would have to increase their hashing power and gain &gt; 51%.
In reality though the 51% is not that big of a deal, IMO unless the person is malicious - If a mining company (or Intel) have &gt; 51%, then as long as they are not malicious they will have a tidy mining income, which benefits should outweigh them being malicious (but not always the case if somebody wants to shutdown the network at whatever cost).
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-06-09 04:45:12
Can you explain how it wasnt?
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:35:37
"a single sell transaction of 400 shares brings the price down 99,62%"
Not true, the price does not go down 99%. After the 400 shares are sold off, the price remains at where the next seller is, not where the next buyer.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:25:00
Several servers seemed to make all the difference, thumbs up!
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:02:21
They charge 7.9% to buy and 2% to sell.
EDIT: I suspect they calculate it by the moving average or similar.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:53:59
Quite a few people on localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:00:27
I would be very careful of this guy, and this company, and what news they release.
Seems like a bit of a scam, especially since he was manipulating the price between 0.0005 and 0.0008, and then trying to dump at 0.0025, and when everybody caught on he decided to change to this AMC/VMC/ActiveMining stuff.  *hey look over there*
And just now they gave out a div, that's 250BTC total for 1 week (on bitfunder alone, AMC+ActiveMining), from 6 avalon machines, which don't mine that much.
Just seems fishy.
I do have some AMC though, but have a sell at ~0.0025
@_date: 2013-05-19 09:28:58
All the leftovers would have been perfect for  (If in Aus)
@_date: 2013-10-08 10:59:59
I think it was great, I cracked up when I saw all you guys.
Good job!
@_date: 2013-06-26 01:55:18
I will be there, if anybody wants to sell some coins I'll be all over it tonight.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:29
bitcoincharts should start charting the trading lag.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:54:49
I give you my bitcoin address, you provide me your BSB/Acc, I DD into your account, you send me the coins to my address.
You seem legit so am happy to DD first, and you can send me btc after you get it into your account.
I'm with St. George, if you are too should be quite fast.
EDIT: Or instead of DD can do PayPal, but you lose some % for that
@_date: 2013-05-29 04:48:01
I have both asicminer and a tiny bit of amc.
But let me say this, asicminer ship, everybody else talks..  Who knows which camp amc will be in, so far they have been talking a lot.
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:39:07
I remember reading about a startup providing an API for iOS where game developers could earn money for people playing their games by implementing their mining API.
Not sure where they are now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:19:03
I hope the imgur link was good.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:58:13
I won!  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:16:18
Exactly my point.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:21:06
You can always use the testnet, and get bitcoins from the test faucet.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:49:02
I am in Aus/Sydney and can buy them from you, can DD into your account or PayPal.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:43:33
FYI website and bitcointalk username only registered only a few weeks ago
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:58:10
How would the coins you mine with 51% of the network be useless?
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:44:29
A reliable ponzi scheme, that is not a scam
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:11:30
I do get your point, and no, the price is not the last transaction, its the next transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-13 13:27:43
Yes reward halves, and as I said, fee's increase over time, more transactions.  Where will fee's be in 4 years?
Finally you don't realise that if you had bought shares at 84c a few weeks back, they'd be worth 1.5 now.  Which is 78% profit regardless on dividends.
Who knows what they will reach in the future.
My point being, dividends (based on 25BTC) is not the only thing to look at.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:40:18
Or $20

Where do you get the live feed from?  Seems like their websocket feed is down most of the time.

Gradual drop between 50-100, then rise over 12 months.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:02:37
I don't know why people keep calling it DDOS, when in reality its just customers trying to use their system.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:30:31
A lot of that may be automatic, it could just be somebody with a lot of coins making it appear like that so people buy up, increasing the price.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:39
50x times faster!
@_date: 2013-06-13 00:33:59
Last I saw somebody is selling 2k direct shares on bitcointalk @ 2.5, min order 100 each.  Not sure how many are left, this is the wall.
@_date: 2013-06-26 04:39:52
Yep same here, bring it along.  I'll take it, can't do BTC now, but will happily pay cash equivalent, and DD it to you on the spot.
@_date: 2013-08-07 01:43:32
My friends were not into it, until I paid them.
Now its the default way of paying for your share of food or drinks or whatever when we go somewhere.
Its very handy, and everything is settled there and then.
@_date: 2013-07-23 13:36:06
When I owe people money, or go out and have no cash, I pay friends or anybody else with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-01 05:09:36
On holidays, so I won't be around for this one!  Have fun all.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:28:32
Have many small denominations of paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-06-04 23:49:38
Good luck.  If nobody sponsors you, remember to wear a bitcoin shirt anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:36:49
Sure, 300k tps, if there is no persistent storage.  Once there is a DB and/or ACID transactions things change.
@_date: 2013-06-24 10:27:42
I don't plan on selling any BTC, instead waiting for the BTC market to grow enough so I can spend it, anywhere, anytime in any country.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:36:53
Count me in, I am in Sydney CBD at the start of most weeks.
I own 365cups.com, among other ideas have been thinking about a nice way of getting our Cafe's to accept BTC, or purchase credit on our system using BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:02:14
How do you deal with such high transaction fee's, and the fact you don't get any rebates?
@_date: 2013-05-28 12:34:25
Would be nice to view the price in different currencies, instead of just btc..
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:06:30
Regardless the fee, just chargeback.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:13:38
They can mine more but for different pools sharing the hash rate and not getting too much of the network.
Mining also returns transaction fee's, which will increase over time.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:58:49
I've created a meetup group:
Never had a meetup group before, but lets see how it pans out.  Would be nice if you guys joined so we an organise something.

This is not shorting, I believe its just CFDs.  Google it.

I added the sydney bitcoin meetup group the other day.  
Let me know the venue when/where and I can add it in the calendar.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:37:04
Localbitcoins.com, I have bought a good amount of coins at good prices.  For the best price, put an ad up to buy and wait.
@_date: 2013-06-04 08:40:54
My bad. I just googled the other day and found that. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:11:13
Cool, every new thing you do, is better than the last.  Like the idea of integration with 3rd parties.
@_date: 2013-06-28 11:28:35
Converting to another currency is not helping bitcoin at all, I would rather you not bother doing it.
Instead people should keep bitcoin as bitcoin.
So do it properly, and do multi currency.  Let people keep their btc and then _they_ can buy goods and services with btc, and so on, and so on.
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:18:24
That's neat, when I type my reddit password into this window it marks it as ****** too

I suspect sitting out of the market, not in a falling one.

I actually think he is from the future, bringing back his white-paper 'almanac' and giving it to himself in the past.
