If you think about it, all currency is like this unless it's explicitly backed by something of incontrovertible value. You don't have money per se, you only have some form of proof that you have it, which others must agree with in order for it to have value.

I can't tell you why other people like or don't like DRK, but I can tell you why I sold mine: anyone can host a masternode if they just round up $10-15k(ish). Nothing stops the FBI or NSA from running one or ten if they want to, and how many of those people are going to keep their node completely secure? That's what compromises the anonymity.
Happy to have my view changed if I've misunderstood the protocol.

They would have to buy that many to spy on everyone. They only have to buy one to spy on someone. Even though they can't choose what transactions they get to see, there's probably an awful lot of incriminating information flowing through a single master node I would imagine.

How hard would it be for one of these linux experts to create a bootable ISO that would automatically start a wizard that prompts you at each step exactly what to do, and the end result is a paper wallet with or without an encrypted backup wallet on as many USB drives as the user wants to provide?
Then the instructions are:  
1. Download ISO and create CD with it (or bootable USB if you're a pro)  
2. Disconnect internet  
3. Boot ISO and follow wizard

I think "run" has something like 100 different definitions in some dictionaries.

Right. Behind every tip is a deposit and a withdrawal (or part of one) on the blockchain.

Besides, even if it were remotely probable to (randomly or maliciously) generate a key for an existing wallet, connecting the wallet to the network would offer no protection.

Remember you're buying from another person. As with any private purchase, it's helpful to try and understand why they might be selling it before you buy it.

It's like laughing at a car dealership for selling cars that go on to become collector cars. 
"You idiot, don't you know that'll be worth more in the future?"
"Not if I don't sell it today, it won't."
