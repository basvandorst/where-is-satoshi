They do this on purpose. When Bitcoin was shown in Grey's Anatomy a few weeks ago, it was shown to have billions in value.

I can't decide whether or not to jump in on Bitcoin or keep plugging away at my student loans before they come due. 
Your comment is helpful to me, because this site is almost pressuring me to buy with these talks of the moon and potential ceilings. Keeping BTC in focus as a potential investment rather than a one time road to wealth is a godsend for people like me, who want to get in but can't, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain this. 
This comment reminded me that bitcoin is an inevitable g
