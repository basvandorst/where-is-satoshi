Not at the level we have now, in democracy we can change these criminals from government and then try to change the economic.

I don't think is many people, It's depends on you inner circle I think, I'm a developer/tech person so my friends and I are all well aware of cryptos, but every day is increasing, right now are Dash conference in Caracas, I have friends that do the same for Bitcoin too, You can see sometime people asking or talking about it on TV, Twitter, and other media. The majority still use USD for reference almost all propertys are sell on USD (you can't even display Bolivars prices on sites like Mercadolibre (local ebay) cuz there is no room for all digits to fit the screen LOL).
The big problem right now is that the country is in ruins, the telecomunications infrastructure is so bad that is becoming a wall for entry in BTC.

I'm from Venezuela, I'm living here right now, you are so SO wrong, I can't even know where to start argue with you.

You can't really... but we can buy food from amazon and send it to us paying privates courrier services using btc

Maybe because here in the Venezuelan dictatorship is the only way to exchange our local currency to buy things, from food to whatever.
