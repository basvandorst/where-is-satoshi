I used the Excel spreadsheet/BitTorrent analogy over at my site [bitcoinhelp.net](  originally [posted it on this subreddit](
Though I'm sure that analogy is totally lost on the old folks.

The statements I chose are meant to be a basic intro to the major ideas about Bitcoin - particularly ones that wouldn't overwhelm some people's short attention span.  I'm not sure that any 7 statements could solve your grandma's, or any other layman's, doubts about cryptocurrency.  But I'm making a site to help fix that by diving into the details a bit: [

Reliable and secure hardware wallets are probably the best bet.  Hopefully the upcoming release of [Trezor]( will satisfy this need to some extent.
But education about Bitcoin and best practices is a key factor as well.  The challenge is breaking down the complexity of Bitcoin into simple terms that the rest of the non-geek world can get a handle on. Shameless plug of my in-progress attempt at this:
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:34:13
Ah gotcha, thanks for the correction.
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:59:36
Ironically, the "Cryptocurrency" category has only 2 subreddits (of 70 total!) that are specifically Bitcoin related: [and [Nearly everything else is altcoin related.
I'd like to see subreddits dedicated to Bitcoin (like etc) in that list, plus the ability to advertise on specific subreddit(s).  Until then, I won't be advertising.
Still, a step in the right direction.

Can confirm.  What's also interesting is that [blockexplorer.com]( gives a similar cloudflare error (Error 524 "A timeout occurred") when you when you try searching for a txid or address.
Do blockchain.info and blockexplorer.com use the same backend?
EDIT: nevermind, blockexplorer search seems to be working again, while blockchain.info remains down.
EDIT again: well maybe nevermind the nevermind, blockexplorer is continuing to have intermittent issues.

Thanks!  I think I've got the general idea.
I asked ["Do thin clients leak which addresses you own?" on bitcoin.stackexchange.com]( and the current top answer suggested that neither Electrum, Multibit, or Mycelium sufficiently utilize bloom filters to conceal which addresses you own.
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:29:30
Not bad!  I like the simplicity. But I'd add in the limited supply aspect somehow. I think that's a huge part of Bitcoin and a common misunderstanding with the average person.

It may not save you money, but by donating, that money goes to a noble cause instead of going to a government cause... like spying on you, drone bombing weddings, and waterboarding people.

Thanks for sharing, friend!  I wasn't aware of those two videos.  While I don't necessarily agree with your sentiment that they are comparatively better at explaining Bitcoin, I may now have enough additional videos to increase the list from the "Top Five Videos" to the "Top Ten Videos".

Apologies about the colbert report video - it fails to load since Bitcoin Help runs on https and the streaming source domain (media.mtvnservices.com) doesn't have a valid SSL cert. There's a link to the video (that works) in the description.

If I understand correctly, by donating, charities get more money and Uncle Sam doesn't.  Most people pay other taxes than just capital gains on their Bitcoin holdings.
For instance, if you owe $5K in income taxes, and you donate $3K worth of BTC, then you only owe $2K to Uncle Sam... the gov't never gets that $3K.

I agree - the Billcoin demo is a cool interactive that illustrates some of the technicalities of cryptocurrency.  But its target audience is still geeks; once the general population hits that [demo interface]( or the [key pair illustration]( they're going to be pounding on their browser's back button.
I'm working on [Bitcoin Help]( The goal is to be the most simple, high level, comprehensive guide to Bitcoin made specifically for the general population.  I'd love to get some feedback/suggestions/corrections.  There's also lots of unfinished content pages on the site, so I'm hiring knowledgeable members of the community to help write them.

@_date: 2014-04-29 14:23:06


I agree.  But you have to get people's attention first with the basics, and hopefully then they're enticed to learn more.  Otherwise they get overwhelmed with details.
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:04:13


I'd disagree.  I think many "normal users" have heard of Bitcoin and their curiousity has been sparked.  Unfortunately, in most cases, they've been horribly misinformed.  Summing up the most important aspects of Bitcoin into a few digestable sentences is a win for everybody.
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:24:51
This is handy.  But I'm privacy conscious. Why should I entrust this service to associate all my crypto addresses with my IP address?
What would be even cooler is a single piece of software that tracks read-only BTC/LTC/DGE balances and **runs directly on my computer or device without talking to a centralized party**.
Note: I see that they'll soon be releasing an iOS app - I'm guessing this will be communicating with the balances.io service for balance data?
