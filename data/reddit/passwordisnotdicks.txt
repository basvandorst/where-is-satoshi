Yeah and then coinbase put a freeze on and freaked everyone out. Look at the volumes since then, it’s basically step function like behaviour. Hard not to infer causation from that. 
But you’re right, trading is down in general however

That’s because GDAX is Coinbase’s exchange and Coinbase has lost some credibility as well as usage from the fees. That’s why volume is down on GDAX. 
Other places have seen decreases, but still fairly robust volumes.

He asked, unaware of the hubristic nature or his comment. 
We’re on a sub where people are putting their savings into an asset that could be worth pennies tomorrow. And it’s not really an asset, but also could be worth 30k tomorrow. 
The entire game is a coin toss

Asia is waking up, we'll see what happens. But based on volumes im going to assume it going to keep rising. 
I any case I have my alerts set so that I can buy if it dips

I mean yeah, there are some decent models showing some head and shoulders behavior. The most pessimistic ones are pegging around 9-10k as the low point. I wouldn't be shocked if something like that happened around the new year. 
At the same time, there have been some optimstic signs showing stability and that the worst is over.

You catch it by the handle, duh.

I want to see Asia react to this before I declare it being over
