Nope, used a payroll site (see pay stubs and such) once that used that interface.

Keep in mind, talking like that makes you sound like a zealot. Management isn't keen on that. A friend ran into the same issue trying to sell his company on Linux (vs Solaris and Windows at the time). It may be too late with this group, but to sell people on an 'out there' idea it helps to take a conservative approach.
In the case of Linux he kept attacking it from a free software perspective (not cost, free as in freedom). The management didn't care. They wanted the systems to work (and from their perspective the status quo did).
If you want to sell people on bitcoin take a breath, expect resistance (I'm not convinced of it as a currency, but the tech fascinates me). Show that it's gaining mainstream attention (NPR, Forbes, others). Expect them to believe it is a bubble, the value of BTC wrt $ is rising astronomically, it's a reasonable reaction. Setting up a mining operation is probably not in their interest, investing directly would be. And as others said, put up some of your own money to demonstrate confidence in it.

In the future, you may not want to try and generate passphrases like that yourself. Aids like [password card]( can generate much better (more random) phrases than you would. It also creates an mechanism that you can keep with you and restore your phrases from should you forget them.

Having $55k available to invest/spend is still middle class. Having 100s of thousands available is a minimum requirement, and probably not enough on its own depending on what other assets you have. If I can maintain my current rate of savings (this precludes having a family, so is somewhat unlikely) I could be there in 5 years or so. I'm definitely not upper class, just frugal. When I retire I might be considered upper class if I maintain my current path, but then I'll only have 20 years or so to enjoy spending it on all the infirmities of old age.
