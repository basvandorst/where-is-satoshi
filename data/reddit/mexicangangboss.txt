I don't intend to "stick it to the man". I prefer to not have my the value of my assets arbitrarily decided by the actions of a central bank. 
Your suggestion that I should feel ashamed about myself is also incredibly presumptious. Chip on your shoulder?

I was about to come in and say this too. After finding out gyft doesn't work outside US, I tried using egifter.com (with no success, had to write into support to get my btc back) and finally giftoff.com
It worked flawlessly and within an hour. Have used them again since, no issues.

Please enlighten me to the difference between confiscated and stolen. Frankly, there doesn't seem to be a difference but for the costumes the perpetrators were wearing at the time.

It all comes down to if the value their work provides to you is greater than the price you pay.
