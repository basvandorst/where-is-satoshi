Nah, I'm sure Apple will jump on the train soon enough and you'll be able to "Apple Pay" some crypto.

Yeah, if we're going to be honest, transferring Crypto is actually much simpler than transferring fiat.

What about quantum computers?

I sold .10 BTC at 4000 to buy a bumper for my truck and then it jumped. Lost over 1000 bucks of potential gain.

You can move your coins to Binance as well.

A+ advice right here.

We've got a long way before the normies start to catch on. Keep watching the news, save what you can. Take care of your life first. The cryptomarket will be waiting for you. That being said, if you can afford to just toss 100 bucks in I would encourage even a tiny amount that you could afford to lose.

I'm fortunate to have only invested "fun money" into the big three so I'm HODLing til the cows come home. I've got little to lose and everything to gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:40
I spread a small amount of "fun money" across the big three. If you can stand to lose it, I say hold, hold, hold. If the theory of cypto becomes reality this stuff is going to be the future. Eventually, you won't want the US Dollar.

Meh, I'm a pretty speculative holder of cyrpto, but at the same time I have at least a topical understanding of the philosophy of decentralized currency and the end-goal of crypto and I've still never heard of this guy. 
I'm gonna check him out now, though!

Honestly, I've thought about trying to start a crypto brokerage for old people who don't quite get it.

Whats your secret? How did you keep from turning into a stereotypical boomer?

Just curious. I'm not saying AI would want to build a log cabin, but I was just wondering if there was any type of chemical or resource only available in living creatures that they may want/need.

So... they're... not?

Right, gotta have PC fans to cool their glorious Matrix rendering graphics cards.

Right? Film is about imagery. If you tell a guy that computers are using humans as computers in 1999-2000 I think its safe to assume that idea may go over their heads.

It blows my mind that a card I bought in 2015 is 200 more now than what I payed back then.

Good point. This makes the IT guy in me a lot happier with "the One" prophecy. A human program is a lot more believable than a rogue battery.

Irradiating an entire planet could destroy resources that the machines would want in the future though, right? At least organic resources.
