I feel like everybody should read this
Please, read. Read my friends!
NB:long read, 
TL;DR there may be a cartel made of coindesk bitfinex and many other companies/personalities which are drilling the BTC price down

Please. That’s population, not surface area. It’s normal since Berlin has a higher density

First of all you are a rude fake smart guy.
Second, RomA (use all the letters please, uneducate barbarian) is a third bigger than Berlin and probably that’s even an outdated stat.
If you consider Rome to be just the center of the city, well I must tell you that it is a tenth of the actual city. Naples follow the same path while on Milan you may be right.
Third, I wasn’t even considering the half billion cities in the South East Area/South American area, since they are completely off-scale and in the most cases filled with favelas, bidonvilles and poor management.
Not the case to open a digression, but also Rome is facing a decline in management and cleanliness; first due to corruption, now with some incompetence and the leftover of corruption.
Milan is way more well managed, much more similar to any European Capital, while Naples seems to have took a right path in improving itself while it’s still cursed by the Camorra and a general “western-style” mood in the outer rim.

In Italy, it is.
Our biggest cities actually are enormous, only London can compete but because it has London 1-2-3-4 and so on..

I’m in the EU, which is the best exchange for buy BTC with credit card and the best for selling back into fiat?
Excluding Coinbase, preferably an exchange that doesn’t ask you intested bills ( cause i’m young and have no bills intested to me)

It’s still cheap. Looking at volumes and buy support, I think it could reach 15k before a correction

B wave theory is strong.
People here will attack you for crushing their dreams but the guy in the video has some points.

Your doubts are legitimate.

I’m secretly waiting for a dip to get more

How is Bisq for EU users? Can I pay with credit card?

Never sell mate

I don’t really think that is possibile to reach 100k in this year but honestly i didn’t even believed BTC to double in a few months
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:42:52
I knew that post. 
I can’t believe in that for obvious reason but honestly some points MIGHT get real in some years. If the governments can’t collect taxes anymore, it will be chaos

Honestly I enjoy the Liquidated Shorts graphs 
Eheh.
