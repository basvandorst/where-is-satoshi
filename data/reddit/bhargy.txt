This might help for muppets like yourself:
**Dark Pool**
"Dark pools are both legal and common in the traditional financial world. While the term sounds ominous and the type of place your mother might warn you against visiting, they perform a service in trading circles. A dark pool is a private exchange where ﬁnancial assets and instruments are traded and matched by an engine running on a hidden order book. Approximately 14% of all US stock trades occur in dark pools where the trader and their trades are hidden. The purpose is to allow large trades take place without altering the price of the stock traded in the marketplace."

I'm inclined to think they scammed him as well. I'm sure they'll say "satoshi" is the developer of onecoin who until now didn't want to be public...��

Prob USD since onecoin doesn't accept bitcoin and she hasn't got a fucking clue what digital currency actually is.

Praise dear leader Ruja who mined the [Guinessblock]( - she is tired from heavy mining work and must take rest.
