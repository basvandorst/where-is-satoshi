I disagree that everyone is trading. If you buy and immediately consume (for example, if you buy Bitcoin so you can spend it on something online, or so you can pay off a ransomware demand), you aren't "trading" any more than you would be if you used your USD credit card while traveling in Europe. You are simply exchanging currency.

Unless changes are made to the block size, you will never be able to buy a reasonably priced cup of coffee with bitcoin if the blockchain is involved. The transaction fee will be more than the purchase price. Those kinds of purchases are going to require bitcoin payment processors to mutually trust each other and use off-blockchain transactions. For example, Coinbase and say, Bitpay, could agree to trust one another, and only transact with each other on the blockchain once a day, or even once a week, and handle everything else on their own books. Kind of the same way a bank (at least initially) trusts a check drawn on another bank. 
But the same thing could done between merchants and payment processors. Try to find a payment processor who will accomodate what you are trying to do. For example, if I want to send you a dollar from my wallet on my computer, and it costs more than a dollar to send it, I am not going to do that. But if I can send you a dollar from my Coinbase wallet for free (or for a couple of cents), I would have no problem with that. You and coinbase would then just settle up later, when they can send you a large transaction all at once.

Ummm, this is a no-brainer. It is not like coinbase pays interest. If you believe there is a chance that there will be a hard fork, and that coins on the hard fork might be worth something, withdraw your coins on July 31. You can always send them back on August 2. But you will control the private key for the new coins.
