Okay even if a large corporation or industry conscpired to do this... It would definitely have a likely chance of leaking out. You can't really easily set up and maintain that kind of infrastructure in secrecy unless you are a covert government agency. 
Also wouldn't it technically be illegal? The Btcoin network is a lot like the Internet, I would think a group planning this kind of attack would be unlawful under laws like CFAA or the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.

@_date: 2015-01-19 01:24:17
if any of you see this and have a min, what do you think as far as listing the prices? Bits or BTC?

Thank you for your feedback, any changes in particular that would make it more legitimate to you? I'm bummed to hear that, I was going for a more legit look with this update haha. 
It is starting to feel like it is near impossible, unless you're a big company with a lot of resources or investors, to build a successful bitcoin business/site that people will trust. Sucks that the few bad apples who scam people (cryptodouble and the like) have made our community so afraid of doing business with smaller btc sites.

Thanks for your comment, if you have a min could you perhaps give me an example or two of sites that have a more 2015 look?
