Usually it's a bit.ly or tinurl link
EDIT - Hah, the bot just messaged me to tell me shortened links aren't allowed (though I didn't post a link). Someone needs to give it a better regex pattern.

Personally, I always listen to elitists who look down on poor people. /s

The /s at the end of my post means that I'm being sarcastic.

I was hoping to read something useful, but all I found was someone wearing a tinfoil hat.
There are *many* reasons behind why Bitcoin has tanked that don't include pointing a quivering finger of rage at Bitcoin Cash. Sure, they're involved to an extent, but they're not the *reason* that every cryptocurrency just took a dive right now.
The reality is that an enormous amount of new money was pumped into a technology which just isn't ready for adoption by billions of people. Bitcoin is just about the only crypto accepted by (a very limited number of) merchants right now, and yet it takes far too long and costs far too much in fees right now to make it attractive over fiat. Other coins have better solutions but still aren't widely adopted. The LN is months away most likely, and Segwit hasn't picked up steam.
When people are buying into something only to get rich and not because they think that there is an actual value in having it to spend, it becomes overvalued. That's what's happening here. Don't get me wrong, there are still *plenty* of advantages of Bitcoin, just few that can or will be recognized by your average consumer jumping on the get-rich-quick bandwagon after watching the evening news.

True, you'd still need to run it, but that's like throwing mines into your back yard and saying that they're only dangerous if you step on them.
