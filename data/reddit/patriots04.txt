Thanks for looking.  No, not my idea.   Those were big sellers a few years ago :)   Not so much nowadays.   I should replace that picture with the Hoka One One shoes.  Those are the popular ones right now.   The website needs a major overhaul...

Thanks for the quick answers and the tip!
I will check into the Bitpay directory.  
It's a small business in a small town so I'm not expecting much in Bitcoin sales, if any.  New customers will be very much appreciated.  I will also try to figure out a good way to run new promotions for customers paying in Bitcoin.  Any suggestions for that would be welcome.
I also bought some Bitcoin from Coinbase will be looking to support other local small businesses in my area as well.  Can't wait to make my first purchase!

Very interesting system.  I will look into it.  Thanks for the link.

Thanks, I will list on those subs as well.  
A couple of the employees are not tech savvy at all.  I created an instruction sheet for them and just completed some training.  It's so easy to do.  Hopefully they can handle it and not look incompetent.
Yeah, it didn't take very long to set up.  If it brings in only a couple new customers, it will be worth it.

Thanks for checking us out.  We are about an hour from Boston.  18 Highland St, Townsend MA, 01469.
Unfortunately we are sold out of the Echo Street golf shoes.  We do have the Ecco Biom Golf Hybrid in Mahogany/Fire and White Royal.

Yes, it is verified working.  The wifi signal at the front counter is spotty so we are upgrading the router to fix that.  Until then we just have to bring the tablet a little closer to the router to complete the transaction.   
We're listed on Coinmap and Yelp so far, but still waiting for our first Bitcoin customer to walk in.

Great advice on   I just gave $5 worth of Bitcoin to one employee and she's going to use it to make small purchases from the other employees.
