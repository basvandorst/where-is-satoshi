Let me know if you have any questions. We try to carry only high quality boutique cigars. We are planning on bringing more cigars on each month.

We are very excited about adding this as an option to our cigar store. It took a bit of doing, but we got it figured out.
We carry only the best boutique cigars. If you have any questions please let me know.

Exactly. If you go to the [cart]( screen, you will see you have to select this legal disclaimer before someone moves forward with their purchase.

Hey there buddy. I am very glad you got me into the fold on Bitcoin. It has been a great experience thus far, and the community support has been overwhelming.

What do you normally smoke?
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:13:04
Just an online store. We are focusing on cigars now, but humidors and more accessories are coming.

We have several [cigar samplers]( but I would look at our [cigar singles](

Looking forward to your business. Let me know if you have any questions.
We don't sell any small cases. I think your best option is to order a box, and leave them in the box. This way they are properly packed. I would get a humipack and put them in a big ziplock back, so they are properly humidified.
I would suggest maybe getting something on the side before you leave, or maybe getting something when you are there.

I am glad you found us :)
Still a newb, so I will ask. What is litecoin?
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:17:46
Very cool. I will do this for sure. Thanks for the heads up.

Well we don't carry any Rocky. We focus on hard to find, and limited boutique cigars.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:06:40
Never thought about that. Great idea. I would suggest a milder cigar in strength so it doesn't overpower you. Also, it would depend on price point. What have you smoked in past which you have enjoyed.
