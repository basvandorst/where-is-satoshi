He has a point.... Who uses btc on a daily basis. Ln will only work if two people make many transactions between them...but who does this right now?
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:27:58
That is the best analogy I have ever heard!
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:06:46
Because 0,1 k would then be worth roughly 10 k..
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:46:25
Not really. The Network is designed to seperate daily transaction off of the blockchain and write them as one transaction on it  (Basic example: you go to a store and buy something. You ooen a channel to the store and practically say you owe them x ammount of bitcoins. The store has an open channel to their supplieres. Instead of you paying the shop and they paying their supplier the network basicly makes it so that you transact your money to the supplier. Instead of 2 transaction rgere will be one -&gt; so less transactions for miner to confirm the lesser the fees will get.

If anyone falls for any of this scams, they kind of deserve it. You never send money to a stranger...
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:17:35
Someone just bought 11 coins O.o
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:27:18
Free market...why do people choose this bank then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:57
Exactly what i am waiting for
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:56:32
Depends on how long you know each other and how you feel about your relationship.....if longer then 5 years and a healthy relation...tell her
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:24:29
But they offer much more service....
Secure funds - hard to lose youre money with screwing up some digits
Getting transactions back
I do not say they are good....but keep in mind what they offer!
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:27:41
No need for the private key. He send his bitcoins to a address from the scammer instead of his own 
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:45:48
Sure...who would give out mobiles for free? Send him your coins and there wont be a way to get them back
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:56:54
Don't do it...he is probably another scammer
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:29:29
'Cause We're having a good time, having a good time
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:07:43
Turns out the owner is going to br you XD
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:12:59
He does nit fight against it....
@_date: 2019-11-04 06:52:43
Because it could become a world wide currency. That is way bigger than a company should become. So either bitcoin goes to zero or you get a massive return.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:09:06
Want to know too
@_date: 2019-11-04 07:20:55
The chance of this happening in the next 10 years is pretty small.
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:17:31
You can't compare companys to currency
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:44:06
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:39:45
Made me laugh :D
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:41:08
This pump was a bit too much! I call a standard bart reverse with a price drop of around 5-7% in the next 2-3 days ^^
Oh nooo it was a Bart in a Bart
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:10:25
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:07:42
I call inverted Bart

As soon as you make two or more transaction, a lightning channel is worth it (because you need one opening on chain transaction and one closing transaction). What is your point?
@_date: 2019-02-28 10:11:17
After one year of hodling we do not pay taxes at all :D

My future prediction: Bitcoin will Aladeen! 
!RemindMe 6 months
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:56:16
Therefor its price is goinh to be zero
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:53:50
1 + 00000000 = 1
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:04:00
Holy cow, do your own research and prediction.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:04:12
On their freakin heads
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:30:46
All time high
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:28:22
Because bitcoin is in an early adoption phase. Once most people got some the orice will settle and that is the point where it could become a reliable source..
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:55:48
Question is who is willing to use the new coin?
@_date: 2019-06-02 10:21:31
What mobile wallet for Android do you use or do you think is the best
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:36:37
That was irony ^^
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:52:05
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:37:20
Oh i see :/
@_date: 2019-12-16 15:26:13
They give the people what they want to hear!
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:26:28
Imagine building the road to your house by your own hands....that is where a majority of taxes go to.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:44:20
Wrong sub
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:23:00
Exactly my thought!
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:10:46
Market value does not say a thing. With low trading volume few money can move the price by huge amounts. The price however now reflects a small percentage of people but "market value" counts all people in.. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:14:27
Wrong wallet? Coinbase charges way to high fees too. I sebt 10 cebt transactions and the y got validated in less than 1 hour....
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:05:22
It is a small, cheap computer. Just google it.
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:56:00
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:38:38
Hahaha, if you had such an amount, you would pay more than 7 dollars a year for your acount.
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:13:27
No, the person who has that number owns the coins (Which should be you)
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:08:04
Which is the same
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:09:55
Made me nose exhale!
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:14:33
? What is your point?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:38:16
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:12:42
Wrong wallet maybe? I sent multiple 4 sat/byte transactions that cost ca. 10 cents per transaction...and they got through after 1 hour. 1.15 seems way to high.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:46:26
It is a market...anything could happen. That is the lesson to understand. Maybe there won't be any dip ever or it crashes... who knows
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:18:58
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:38:23
The great inflation
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:49:53
Should he build the lambo by himselfe XD? The comoany gets what they deserve. You are speaking of capitalism not bitcoin. 
Bitcoin was never meant to distribute money equally. It could just become another currency.... 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:40:36
So basicly you say that you don't want to lose money.
255% is not enough for you.
Now you invest in more volatile cryptos.
But did you realise that you are way more likely too lose your money there?
That is some logic.
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:19:09
He has a point, you know?

A gt 970 uses 145 W. Rest of the math is up to you
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:14:45
I hate those statements....
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:14:32
Bees may eat our money....
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:02:50
Maybe that would save them...
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:31:47
10% of our kids money could be eaten by bees
@_date: 2018-07-23 13:03:35
It makes the same promise as OP
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:19:55
Half now, half later
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:55:36
Never.... 5 cents should be more than enough
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:14:39
I dont think they send each other enough text to make it vulnerable ^^

How can he lose 17% if he only sells 15%?
