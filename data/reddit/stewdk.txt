Looks like your transaction never got relayed.  Use -rescan and try again. You paid a transaction fee, right?
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:35:47
If by "console" you mean Bitcoin-QT's debug window, no.  If by "console" you mean putting -rescan as a command line option, yes.

Last I checked it was actually about 7% unknown. Accurate stats are here: 
blockchain.info's chart is very misleading.  "Relayed by" is not necessarily the same as who actually mined the block.
 used to be a good chart, but it's due for an update.
Two of the larger lesser-known pools are:
KNCminer: 10.9% of the network
CloudHashing: 5.8% of the network

@_date: 2014-02-13 01:12:32
I'm guessing that's not your only address.  Bitcoin-QT automatically sends change to a different address in your wallet for every transaction.
Sure, it's possible that the transaction was malleated since there are bots on the network doing that sort of thing lately, but even if the transaction happens to have a different txid once it gets confirmed, coinbase should still have received the money.  Try -rescan before you come to any conclusions.

USD cents doesn't make sense in terms of bitcoin fees.  Currently, a fee of 0.0005 BTC will get the job done.  The purpose of the fee is to deter spammers from filling up the blockchain with useless data, which already takes up way too much space on my harddrive.

Though it is still possible (but not guaranteed) for both of these transactions to get included in the same block (aka both get confirmed at the same time).
4 Currently, one way to reduce the possibility of a double-spend attack is for POS merchants to run their bitcoin nodes with only outgoing connections to other well-connected nodes and major mining nodes, and encourage customers to pay a transaction fee.  This will ensure that most of the network has picked up the transaction (even though it has 0 confirmations) and any double spend transactions are more likely to get refused.

@_date: 2013-05-07 04:47:59
I believe that is correct, yes. Another thing that I've noticed is that it is possible to calculate the bitcoin address given only the private key in wallet import format.
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:00:26
Assuming the address has at least one spend and the actual public key is known, yes. A bitcoin address is RIPEMD160(SHA256(ecdsapubkey)). SHA256 and RIPEMD160 are still quantum safe, so if people would stop reusing addresses bitcoin would easily be quantum computer safe.
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:14:59
Well, technically you're right. The bitcoin address is a hash of the public key, but for regular people like you and me it's okay to pretend that they're equivalent.

Use the Bitcoin-QT/Satoshi client, wait for it to sync, go to Help --&gt; Debug window --&gt; Console, then use the following commands:
* listunspent - see how much money you have available to spend
* createrawtransaction - specify which coins to spend, pay to what address(es), and the amount(s)
* signrawtransaction - sign the transaction with your private key(s)
* sendrawtransaction - push the transaction out to the bitcoin network making the transaction official
* walletpassphrase - if your wallet is encrypted, use this command with your password to make the private keys available with an optional timeout
* importprivkey - imports a private key into your wallet
* help &lt;command&gt; - print useful info about the above and other commands. with no argument, prints a list of available commands.

* Try to get your next paycheck paid out in bitcoins
* Go to any restaurant or small business that currently does not take bitcoins and convince them to take bitcoin as payment.  Most merchants that accept bitcoin don't have to worry about fluctuations in the exchange rate since they use a service that immediately converts it to dollars.
* Sign up for a new paypal account and go the full 9 yards with it (transfer money from your bank account, get verified, etc) and compare the process to buying bitcoins.

Not a scam, but understandably frustrating. Bitcoin-QT just has a relatively naive algorithm for calculating fees based on transaction size.

It depends on the amount you're sending.  If a zero-fee transaction has any outputs less than 0.01 BTC, it will likely take weeks for it to confirm.  If no outputs are less than 0.01BTC it may take between an hour and a day or so for confirmation.
Compare that to a transaction with a 0.0005 BTC fee, which typically takes less than an hour.

Not necessarily. Miners (including mining pool operators, solo miners, etc) are the ones who decide which transactions to include in a block - they have different rules and priorities for which transactions to include, and some may even simply reject transactions that don't have a fee.

You are downloading the blockchain - a record of every transaction ever.  Yes, the micro transactions AKA dust transactions AKA spam unfortunately add to the size of the blockchain.
There is much active discussion on bitcointalk.org and other places about:
1. Pruning the blockchain. In other words, removing data that is no longer relevant.
2. Preventing spam transactions being committed to the blockchain in the first place
It is well understood that the ever increasing size of the blockchain is a barrier to entry for new users and it is not sustainable.
EDIT: Yes, for new users it is indeed easier to use a lightweight client like multibit.  However, if starting up a new full node in the far future isn't viable that is a huge problem.
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:06:33
Just to note: if you want to mine bitcoin you should join a pool.  Only the pool operator needs the blockchain/hash of previous block header/whatever.  Nobody mines solo anymore unless they have more than 1TH/sec.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:56:05
No, but you can export the private key(s), import into the Bitcoin-QT/Satoshi client, and concoct a double-spend transaction *with* a fee. This may or may not cause the new transaction (with a fee) to get confirmed sooner instead of the old transaction (without a fee).  There is no way to know which one, but one of them will eventually get confirmed, and it is impossible for both to get confirmed.
In the future, it is always a good idea to make a backup of your wallet before making any transactions.

Whether or not real emails were leaked, you still need to go a couple steps further with SPF and DKIM authentication for email, and put a DMARC policy in place to mitigate fake emails that appear to come from bitcointalk.org.
* I would suggest you change your SPF record from "v=spf1 mx a ~all" to "v=spf1 mx a -all".
* Set up DKIM authentication with your mailer daemon (this is easy if you use google apps) and add a corresponding dkim zone record.
* Create a DMARC record.
For examples of the zone records, use these commands to see how I've set it up with my own domain:
$ nslookup -type=txt stew.dk
$ nslookup -type=txt google._domainkey.stew.dk
$ nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.stew.dk
Please let me know if you need any help with this, as I've set it up with 5 other google apps domains already.  Some great resources are       and

You can actually specify the transaction fee and even zero transaction fee in the Bitcoin-QT client so long as you're willing to learn about [raw transactions](
Also worth noting is that gambling sites like SatoshiDice sends small amounts to notify of a loss, and when you want to go and try to spend lots of these small transaction outputs it adds lots of bytes to the transaction, and that is why the Bitcoin-QT client by default tries to raise the fee on you.  However, most mining nodes currently will accept your transaction regardless of size so long as it has the currently defacto standard 0.0005 fee.
If you really hate fees that much, a zero-fee transaction will usually get confirmed between a few hours to a day or so, as long as none of the outputs are below 0.01 BTC.

testnet is an alternative bitcoin network that the software developers and testers use to test and try out new things before they're ready for the main network. The testnet has everything the main network has, except that the bitcoins associated with testnet are worthless.
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:16:00
I hope nobody falls for this scam. Testnet coins are worthless.
If you need testnet coins, just start the Bitcoin-QT client with "bitcoin-qt.exe -testnet -gen" and wait a while. Or you could even go all out with "bitcoin-qt.exe -testnet -server -rpcuser=stewdk -rpcpassword=pa55w0rd" and connect your favorite mining software. You *will* eventually solve a block since the current testnet difficult is 1.

It is voodoo, not science.  I've had zero-fee transactions work just fine as well.  It depends transaction size, fee amount, as well as other magical things, and it's nearly impossible to predict exactly how long any given transaction will take to confirm.
But hey, people wanted more control over relay fees and transaction filtering and so that's what they're gonna get with 0.8.2, but unfortunately this will only complicate the answer to questions "how long will it take for my transaction to confirm?" and "how big of a fee should I pay?"  I guess that is the beauty of a decentralized system...
