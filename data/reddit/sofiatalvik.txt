Yes, but I only have some demos, radio and live takes on it. Not really the best stuff.

Dang, this is just so great. Spreading my music and getting tips and giving back love. It's almost like a live concert, but I can't see y'all :)

Spamming me with tips? This is not a strip joint :) lol
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:33:02
Thanks for the idea but I don't think it would look to great with a bitcoin logo or a QR code on the cover :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:23:21
It's a BitTorrent bundle. It got lots of peers... look again :)
Thanks for the support!

Yes, I love this stuff. This has a lot of potential and I'm going to sit down and think out a good strategy to how I can implement this in the way I distribute my music and how I can use it to reward and thank the followers of my music. It's all about paying it forward and for me it's really important to connect with my listeners both online and live.
Thanks for the upvote @_date: 2014-11-07 17:28:35
Yeah could work. But most people that use digital money won't buy physical CDs. :)
