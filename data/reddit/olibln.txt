I fully agree, yet don't see this as a bad thing. It is currently too complicated and risky for the vast majority of people to own, use and securely hold crypto on one's own. Not talking about tech savy reddit users, but about the average population.
I use btc since years, use paper wallets, hw wallet and so on. you are essentially your own bank and have to prepare security measures comparable to one. This is not and will not (imho) be something that anyone can and will do. I talk about people who confuse google with the url bar in their browser - I would not recommend holding btc themselves to these people (many friends, even in the 20-30y age range would qualify).
As long as you don't have to use such services, I don't see it as a bad thing. Centralized services with real insurance, liability, help desks and so on can make crypto more accesible.

Wouldn't it make sense for large exchanges, online wallet services and payment processors to have large (funded) channels open all time between themselves?
I believe a huge part of transactions is happening between these business entities anyways currently.

Its pointing the right way up currently, please don't try this!
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:26:04
That's what they WANT you to think.

The newer ATMs (with option to also deposit) often also give 100€ bills (at least here in Berlin)
@_date: 2014-04-14 10:25:12
Sounds more like Facebook-coins. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:52:18
..then they fight you..
@_date: 2014-05-06 11:29:03
Simple answer: They will not be able to do so. They would need to address money laundering issues, prevent direct p2p transfer, have the ability to freeze or block transfers and would likely peg it to the usd.

Yes, it is possible - but very very veeeery unlikely. This website comes to mind:
"Bitcoin addresses are 160 bit hashes of the 256 bit private keys, so there are 2^160 or about 1,460,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible addresses.
Let’s say it’s 2045 and the world population is 9 billion. In an unrealistic scenario, every single person on the earth is using Bitcoin and each person has created and used 10 million addresses; yes let’s go overboard with this: that would mean a total of 90,000,000,000,000,000 addresses spent addresses.
So, the possibility of collision, in this scenario is:
 90,000,000,000,000,000 / 2^160 = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000615%"

Interesting - doesn't sound like the most 1337 hackers out there ;)
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:48:07
Agreed, nothing but positive experiences with Kraken!

Needs more deadlines.. China fud is not good without an ultimate deadline to pass by without anything happening
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:35:02
Yes, worked without a flaw - I see prices in USD, though.
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:45:43
Yes, that is exactly what the paper backup is for. If you don't need access to the coins for some time (long term savings) you don't even need a offline pc.

These people seriously bought malware-toolkits with Paypal? SERIOUSLY?!?!
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:30:28
Very cool.. bought lot's of stuff there, very nice and competent staff!
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:40:56
More like “if you panic, at least panic early“
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:28:25
Actually it takes you to reddit mostly...
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:37:14
Threads like these are super helpful to our situation.. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:21:39
how can it be assured, that the new PoW system will not suffer from the same large miner? -sure, the ASICS won't work anymore, but they could restart from GPU-level, couldn't they?
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:41:57
We now have segwit, because a majority of miners agreed to in the NYA
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:57:09
This.. with references to statements please. Otherwise I can just write down all the bitcoin-related companies I find..
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:45:46
Faster as well (in a drag race..)
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:13:33
So you are saying, that constructive argumentation is a reason for a ban?
E.g. I am a proponent of S2X, as I believe that the NYA was the only way to get SW to activate and the 2X part should be honoured as well.
Is this opinion enough in your eyes to warrant a ban?
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:35:04
Yes, this sounds super helpful in the current situation /s
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:45:10
None, except for a warm feeling
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:44:31
This should be pinned on both subs!
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:48:37
I'm curious about this site, do they list their sources somewhere?
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:05:50
I agree to the second point, people will vote with their feet by actually using one or the other chain more.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:17:38
Oh, in fact i did...

No love for pizza?

considering Bitpay advised users to download btc1, it's unlikely for them to end on this list..
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:42:36
Stay classy
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:52:31
Thank you for these links. So I understand this list is opt-out: unless you specifically agree to S2X, you are "against" it. 
I would prefer an opt-in list to get a clear picture.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:14:06
Maybe the others got banned?
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:01:54
And now you jinxed it..
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:40:01
Its a joke obviously, no self respecting german would drink only half a liter of beer.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:59:58
Do you have any references on this? They would need to auto-generate plenty of adresses in nearly no time
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:11:59
I shouldn't have clicked "show comments".. at least it shows, that we are still far from mainstream...
So, I guess, good news?
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:32:52
Wow, thanks for that info!
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:28:30
I understand that argument. In this case btc would remain to nerdy or wealthy individuals imho.
I guess this is not ours to decide anyways. Also, I'd rather have btc with banks instead of centralized alts.
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:39:26
Soooo if they re-deposited onto Gox, shouldn't we be able to link this to the account information leaked? Also, shouldn't it be even easier for official investigations to get name and adress of the alleged thiefs?
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:59:17
This, before btc can become real mainstream we are going to need bitcoin banks. 
There are enough people having trouble to find the browser on their computer, they will always be vulnerable to phishing attacks etc. BTC banks solves this. Also, customer support. Also,  24/7 Lightning node with enough channels.
The good thing is, that you don't have to use them :)
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:44:20
Awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:03:56
Can you elaborate? How was the process? Did the employees know what to do?
