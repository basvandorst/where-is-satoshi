I appreciate you’re looking out for me (not sarcasm) and you’re trying to help me, but it isn’t a problem like it’s conveyed

Yeah it’s a military email address
As far as I know, I think it’s government run so you have to be in the service to get it. You might be able to do some backwoods hillbilly shit to get that email. 
It’s much more secure than gmail (as far as I know) because I have the option to send classified emails/documents that require the recipient to have clearance and permissions to open that email.

Uhh. That’s literally the question you’re asking. It’s never been hacked so nobody knows.

I take screen shots of everything, email to myself on my .mil email, then print them out and never have to worry about it lol

Kinda fucked up to say, but as long as they have a decent amount; this is not a bad time for them. The cost keeps on increasing every hour. 
When they finally get power, hopefully it’s at an all time high and they can use the money for getting their life back together.

Buy low, hodl. 
It’s an investment because when people a few months/years ago they took a risk to put their hard earned money into a non-tangible form of money, they weren’t sure wether or not it would increase in value.

The government doesn’t care about bitcoin, considering the legality of it right now; so I doubt they care if I sent some random screenshots of numbers and words to my gov email 
I don’t really care about the government looking into my money. They already do since I’m in the Army. 
I’m not barred from participating in investments, so there’s nothing to worry about. It only becomes an issue when I start to flaunt the money, or let it get in the way of my duty

God people like you blow my fucking mind. 
You ask a question, people take their time and brain power to answer your question; and when they don’t have a definitive answer you shit on them. 
Nobody has ever seen a Mycelium hack, because it’s never happened. That doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but it hasn’t happened yet... 
Take the time out of You’re day to respect the people that took the time out of theirs, to answer your narcissistic and egotistical ass. 
Become humble.
