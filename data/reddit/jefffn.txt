I think the problem with bitcoins is they're complicated. That complexity is required for all the features we want from them but it makes it hard to explain them to someone in 60 seconds. Especially if they have a less technical background. You almost have to hand-wave and say "Here are the features of bitcoins and that's all enforced with mathemagic."

Short answer, no.
Long answer, not even close. According to Bitcoin Watch, the current network is doing about 3 TH/s. Assuming a key could be tried in the same time it took to check a hash, that'd be 3 trillion keys per second. The insurance file is encrypted with AES 256, which has 2^256 keys. Assuming the entire network was working to crack it, it'd take (on average) 2^255 /(3 * 10^12) seconds or 6.12 * 10^56 years. That is 4.5 * 10^46 times the estimated age of the universe.

Miners don't set fees, the people sending money do. Miners can choose what transactions they want to include in their block, and if it's solved, they get all the fees associated with all the transactions they chose to include. So if I send you 10 BTC with a 0.1 BTC fee, miners would decide if they wanted to include that transaction in their block. When a miner decides to include it and manages to solve the block, they get 50 BTC + 0.1 BTC from that transaction and the transaction gets 1 confirmation.

That is a fair point and something that bothers me as well. However for now, at least in practice, it seems not to matter. The accepted fees are hardcoded into the main client and can only be changed by modifying the source and recompiling.
Even in that example, once all the 4% fee transactions are confirmed, that miner has the choice of confirming nothing and getting no fees, or going for the 1% transactions. So although it will be slightly slower to send a 1% transaction, they'll still get confirmed in reasonable time. And right now, most transactions are sent without fees anyway, and they get through just fine.
