If we make enough memes we can speed up the process..

Yes, you can do this in the UK, almost. In the UK you cannot get a tax credit as such but what you can do is offset any losses from previous years against your tax bill which can either totally eliminate it or lower it significantly.

Interesting, yes I agree its not a full answer, not nearly, but its certainly a massive step in the right direction. Compare if you will (As much as this is different, and should not be compared too) banks.. They have multiple payment rails they use depending on the criteria of a payment, personal accounts usually use a thing called FPS (Faster Payments Service) but they can also use ones called CHAPS, SWIFT, SEPA and much more.. Each has its own quirks. Maybe lightning is simply the first of a menu of payment options to come? As cheques were the first major one for banks..

Sorted and confirmed, thanks for the assistance sir!

Until lightning manifests itself fully, I doubt the price will move much in a positive way, for newcomers looking in Bitcoin is now an expensive, slow, clunky transaction process. It's being conveyed as a currency when at the moment its more similar to a commodity in that there is no real liquidity, its though to spend. The reason it's like a commodity? It's illiquid, you can't spend it easily in its original form, and the value isn't in the asset itself, it's in the currency the asset is most commonly linked too (in this case USD). So in short, Bitcoin for newcomers is a slow and expensive machine, they struggle to spend it without changing back to USD (or other currency). What will lightning bring? SPEED &amp; SAVINGS, which in turn produce LIQUIDITY and thus VALUE. I guess my point is, lightning, hurry up and help send this currency/commodity/unicorn to the stratosphere.

What’s your wallet code? I’ll see if I can find the transaction. (It should appear) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:47:24
Could slow transaction times be the beginning of the end? If it gets this busy how can the network cope 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:58:15
That's ridiculous, they have got too big for their boots and are unable to cope with the capacity of their own business! I work in a similar company (not crypto but another type of brokerage, one that actually helps its customers might I add) the email point is a good one, we do have a system in place which sounds the same. Each email is assigned to an account and goes in a queue when you send another one it updates the account time for how long you've waited (back to 0). Bit of a flaw? Yes! My would be to not send any more emails for around a week if you can wait it out. Hopefully, you'll get it sorted soon! I only used Coinbase when I started to buy; I immediately transferred out to a non-hosted wallet. I strongly suggest doing the same when you get back in your account, if you have a robust laptop, Exodus.io is great! From another perspective, if you call again and they are still unhelpful ask for details of their legal department, they may have an internal procedure if going legal is mentioned which could speed up the process. (Just bluff them, or actually go legal if you want)

No problem! Yeah its 100% there, just not processed yet. Blockchain.info is more reliable for sure, blockcypher should show it, unsure why it didn't (did the same with me). Although your bitcoin is safe, I can assure you of that. Might just take a while, until the network calms down, essentially a big traffic jam of transactions.

When does everyone think we'll see the next price correction? Its been a mad few days..
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:47:36
Verging on soul destroying, I really can’t complain though.. still have 8!! I’m going to cash out half maybe, just incase it does crash hard... tough call though! Could it reach 100k in a few years? Who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:57:17
I do not know, but it better hurry its bitch ass along! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:26:53
8.29, got in early, had 22 at one point but sold years ago. WHY!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:14:00
okay, thanks! Any idea how I'd actually go about doing this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:14
It's a nightmare, crypto traffic is crazy just now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:06:36
That's some horrid grammar right there. I mean, if you're going to write a letter at least do it correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:35:30
No, the bitcoin network is extremely busy just now and everyone is having slow transactions (here is one of mine  its been almost 24hrs for me, 5 btc on the line.. Hang in there, it is NOT lost and it WILL arrive, might just take a while..
