I noticed it about a month back, but I finally stopped and took a picture and tried to inquire within.

I know I was always used to only seeing the little sticker in a window similar to [this](

Yeah the sign is confusing, I am guessing it is for one of the suites in the building. Here is the [street view]( 
Obviously an older picture though.

I believe it is for the suite for lease. I spoke with the secretary at Edward Jones and she had no idea what I was talking about. She just said that they did not keep any currency on site lol.
edit: pretty sure it is only for one suite because the building also had this [sign](

It is located at 62nd and Keystone in Indianapolis.

Many different ways of attempting to do it, but one of the more common ways it to run it through a tumbler. A tumbler is used to obscure and disguise it, making it difficult to prove where bitcoins came from. First you have to realize that only the amounts, addresses, and transactions are recorded. A tumbler attempts to eliminate the links between your old address and a new address by sending coins from you to other people and coins from them to you. It also randomizes transaction amounts and sometimes adds time delays to the transactions. However there have been [studies]( that show it is extremely difficult to do. Additionally many of these tumblers have been known to steal users money so it is a large risk to place in the tumbler in the first place. A popular one is [Bitcion Fog]( which is accessible on the TOR network.
Edit: This of course is a very brief description and their are many other steps to take in order to protect your anonymity.
