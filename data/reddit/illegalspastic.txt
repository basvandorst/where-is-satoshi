I get how a hard drive works. Nothing stopping you from shutting down your node and taking a drill to it.

Very helpful, I will start preparing for the apocalypse

Yeah I’m very familiar with how the blockchain works. I’m a software engineer that dabbles with this stuff. I just wanted to know if any redundancy was in place.

I should have made the scenario clearer. I mean if they turned off permanently the transaction history would be effectively gone right?

If the network consists of only a few big companies then you lose the benefit of the network being in the hands of the people. One of the primary issues with a centralised internet. 
Thank you for a sane answer. They are hard to come by here.

Like I said I just wanted to sanity check the principle before I missed something. We’re looking to make use of blockchain in our application and most of the devs have been going crazy about the potential data loss if all nodes disappeared. We are going to host our own nodes anyway so I don’t care. Was just curious.

The question was merely a hypothetical. I just wanted to see if any redundancy was in place. Which it clearly isn’t. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:03:50
I thought so but wanted to double check. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:19:50
Alright, fair play I got nothing on that ��

The application is using blockchain for other purposes not currency so no ICO this time. Fully aware of how a hard drive works thanks.
