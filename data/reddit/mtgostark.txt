That really, really sucks. I'm sorry for your loss OP. 
People, remember that Bitcoin's rise is not unique or "once-in-a-lifetime". Major booms like this happen once a decade, if not more often (5 years ago it was weed stocks, 10 years ago it was social media, 20 years ago it was internet companies...). If we go even further into the speculative market, you could technically make bitcoin's gains off options or penny stocks whenever you want. 
The tough part about missing out on bitcoin is that many people were "right" about it as early as 2012, but never bought in or sold too early. Consider that not many people bought at $10 and have held till now; most people, if they're lucky, have only made double digit gains over the past 5 years, which is pretty good, but not life-changing spectacular.

Coinbase reports to the IRS? Lmao, what's the point then? Time to go back to cold storage and brown paper bags if that's the case.

Fed is easy
1. Print infinite money
2. Give to Black Ops
3. Tell people everything is fine
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:40:17


And...this is why the IRS still exists. One of the main merits of crypto is the ability to circumvent the government thugs.

If it helps your sleep...
- There's hindsight bias here. Bitcoin was a risk, and you just happen to live in the, uh, universe where it spiked. It had an equal if not much greater chance of failing, whether through legislation, geopolitics, technology, etc.
- Even if you did buy it then, it's unlikely that you held this long. You might have sold at 330 or 400. Nearly everybody sells too early on stuff like this, if they don't lose the money first. 
- Assets spike like this every day, you didn't really miss any opportunity. For example, Diana Container Ships (DCIX) went up 348% just a couple days ago. If you want to rewind back time for another shot, you could trade small cap stocks like that, or options (although I don't recommend it unless you really know what you're doing). 
- A second CS degree is pretty valuable too.

Famous last words. No shame in taking profits.

Isn't this just gambler's fallacy? Keep doubling your bet when you lose? There's no guarantee of a bounceback ad infinitum. Bitcoin's latest spike was all over the mainstream; it doesn't get larger from here without significant structural shifts in the technology or the economy.

You mean bag hodling?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:46:25
A deflationary asset in itself has no value. The value of BTC is still dependent on the larger economy, geopolitics, human psychology, etc. This should be obvious considering it's still widely priced in American fiat. 
Anything that purports to be 'the next best thing since sliced bread' should be looked at with skepticism, not excitement. I've seen companies sell stem cell therapies, cancer cures, rocket ships to Mars, quantum computers... all end up in the dumps. You can frame anything as world-changing, few things actually are. 
And as I mentioned before, fundamentals don't matter. There are garbage assets that get pumped up 10,000%, and great assets that lose 99% of their value. Price action is universal.

Golden rule of financial analysis - all post-analysis is bullshit.

That's what I was thinking of, thanks.

Not trying to scare anyone, just FYI...
Bitcoin's growth pattern is very similar to how many penny stocks blow up. A period of large, inexplicable spikes followed by a long decline. 
As a libertarian, nobody wants for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general to succeed more than me. But I feel like some people might be slightly careless about what they're getting into. There isn't a security in history that grows like this without a corresponding fall, often permanent. 
Whatever money you put into crypto, just make sure you can afford to lose it. Otherwise, good luck and hopefully bitcoin/crypto takes over in a few years.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:07:56


I suggest you read up more on the topic first, you're just beating up strawmen here. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:19:28
I told you so. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:05:07
I dunno about long term perspective - nobody can predict the future. What I'm talking about is short-medium term price action. 
In finance, you quickly realize that the underlying asset doesn't matter. It could be donuts, guns, computer chips, or an inverse corn volatility index; all valuation is guided by supply and demand, and human emotion. Price action is king. 
The recent price action of Bitcoin is nearly identical to the price action of many penny stock pumps. Note that I'm not calling Bitcoin a pump or fraudulent; I would like nothing more than for it to succeed. But you can't ignore price action, and usually such price action is followed by a sharp or long decline. Financially, there's no reason why Bitcoin's price action would behave differently from existing types of assets. Most people try to point to its fundamentals, but for short-medium term, fundamentals really, really don't matter. Fundamentals are descriptive in the long term, but even then usually only in hindsight. Most modern trading firms completely ignore fundamentals.

Every speculative asset claims its part of a new ecosystem or new market. Twitter did it with social media, cannabis companies did it with marijuana, robotics companies are doing it with automation and machine learning.
I possibly don't know as much about crypto as you, but I've also been following crypto for a long time. Been following BTC since it was $10. I've seen many different securities in general, and BTC doesn't strike me as anything that different. Its underlying technology is relatively different, but the aspects that go into its valuation are not. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:40:15
Lol, that sounds like the sales pitch of every pump and dump. Not saying you're a con, but you probably got your information from one. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:18:25
It just sounds like typical hype. I've heard how cannabis companies will cure cancer, stem cell companies will cure paralysis, and quantitative finance algorithms that solve the market. I've seen robotics companies that had tech that looked like it would replace human labor - 10 years ago. The vast, vast majority of things like this fail, no matter how promising it looks. Saying that Bitcoin has great fundamentals is basically meaningless, especially if we're talking about price action, which isn't even determined by fundamentals in the short-medium term. 
I'm reasonably familiar with the tech behind bitcoin, and I've been following it since it was $10; in the context of every other company, derivative and asset I've ever seen, it doesn't seem particularly special. Which is why I'm cautioning people to treat it as it is - a risky speculation.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:06:59
That growth happened over decades and centuries, with obvious changes to the actual property involved that could justify changes in valuation. Bitcoin's growth is orders of magnitude faster, often inexplicably. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:53:36
I think we're still decades away from the type of automation you're talking about, and that post-scarcity is impossible to achieve on a finite Earth, but even then it wouldn't work with any central authority. 
Who is owning and operating the automation? The government? Then you are open to the same problems you have now.
Yourself? Then that is libertarianism you are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:32:40
So if you consent to allow the government do whatever it wants by voting, give away half your income to fund them, and they then use that money and power to start frivolous wars - you're *not* giving away your freedom and money to feed the military industrial complex? 
Rather than trying and failing to paint me as ridiculous, why don't you give one example of a political ideology that promotes all those values, which doesn't act hypocritically? I'm not sure I can even think of one that doesn't require an absurd amount of taxation to prop up. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:15:14
Considering most people align themselves with political parties that do, and unquestioningly feed the system with their votes and taxes, yes. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:07:43
Haven't there been cases where people have been tracked through their bitcoin transactions? How anonymous is it really?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:29:09
In trading, what you realize is that the characteristics of the underlying security doesn't really matter. It could be a penny stock, blue chip, bond, derivative, currency...they all operate by supply and demand, and human psychology. It's the pattern that matters, and the spike that Bitcoin is experiencing has been seen many, many times before.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:27:11
Valuing freedom, peace and prosperity is so retarded...
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:25:34
There are penny stocks that have gotten 10,000% returns in a matter of days, and lost it even faster.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:37:45
Where did you hear that? I don't know of a single ancap that wants that. Like many people, you are probably conflating anarchy with chaos. The groundwork of economic libertarianism is based on the idea of philosophers and Nobel-prize winning economists.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:49:44
So you can't come up with even one example, and don't see why taxation is wrong...don't know why I even bother. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:39:49
Libertarianism isn't perfect, but how do you expect to achieve the goals of the greater good through the current and historical systems? Give away your freedom and money to a faceless central authority until it eventually results in genocide, democide, or civil war, and the cycle repeats. 
Authoritarianism and central regulation is almost synonymous with human suffering and disaster. The founding fathers of the minarchist state of America knew this. If you have a better suggestion than freedom as a remedy, please let me know. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:42:10
By giving away your freedoms to government, peace to the military industrial complex, and prosperity to taxation? Nearly every system outside of libertarianism is an affront to those values, certainly any one that you could vote for. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:38:37
Yeah and some penny stocks actually grow into legit businesses, but they all behave the same. Fundamentals don't matter, only price action. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:12:01
It's an asset class, by virtue of having value and liquidity, and therefore behaves through supply and demand. I've seen every sort of weird derivative and speculative commodity there is, BTC doesn't strike me as anything different. 
Nobody can predict tops or bottoms; BTC may hit 50K before its current run is over, the point is for people to be careful and not to bet the house on a speculation that is clearly spiking. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:36:09
Sure, but the odds are overwhelmingly against it. 
The difference between a business and a speculation is, business valuations increase based on real factors.
A speculation's value can change dramatically in the short term, often for no real reason, the typical example being a penny stock. Bitcoin's price pattern is much more akin to a speculation than a solid asset. 
Not to say that's bad - plenty of money is made on speculation. But also plenty lost, so people should be careful. From reading, there's seems to be people on this board that legit thinks it's a non-stop trip to a million dollars or something.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:01:17
It still doesn't sound like anything that different to me. You think Satoshi invented proof-of-work? That kind of information algorithm has been around since the 90's, which is ancient in computer terms. I'd argue that what you perceive to be bitcoin's value - the new printing press - is pretty different from what it really is/could be. Not to mention, there's various competing cryptos that do the same or better things than Bitcoin.
