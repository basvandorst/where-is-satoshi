Well every idea has to be preconceived before it can be shared, but it’s not a crook or anything, it’s all public knowledge explained by many other people, just an explanation between many others. It’s not really preconceived, it’s quite the opposite actually, he explains how it’s really working behind the scenes.

Oh, sorry, the FED is a private corporation, the profit goes to the shareholders (often the banks themselves).

Basically: to the FED, a private corporation printing money out of thin air and asking for interests on this « debt ». The income tax was created the same year as the creation of the FED and that’s not a coincidence. All your taxes are used to refund those interests. The biggest fraud of human history, hidden in plain sight. And the fractional reserve system helps to fuel this system by always lending more than there is in real reserves. It’s more or less the same system in every country, enslaving populations under more and more debts.
I stumbled upon a great video on this subject a few days ago if you’re interested in learning more on this: 
The problem is not really the banking system. It’s how it has been hijacked by a few people to profit from the mass. There is no money, there is only debt and it’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s just the reality. The origin of all money is a debt. It’s just how it works. But governments should have the power to issue their own currency or of course their own cryptocurrency.

Those 164 trillion (more like 22 trillion) are caused by fractional reserve banking (lending more than the bank owns or creating money out of thin air by the banks). Governments deficit spending doesn’t help either. Of course most of this debt is owed to the banks, because people like you and me borrow money that don’t exist and that is created for us. But yes, most of the income tax we pay only exist to pay the interests on the debt we have to the FED. It’s all explained in the video. When a big part of your salary is taken to pay the FED, it’s possible you will have to borrow more to the bank to make ends meet, so yes it has something to do with the FED. Just look at how the debt exploded since 1913. Of course the FED is not the only owner of those debts, each time the government needs money, it issues some bonds and there are many buyers (pension funds, banks, other countries, investors or else).

And what is this amount representing compared to the income tax revenue? Let’s try to do a small calculation with 8% interests on this debt (it’s probably a smaller percentage in reality, but it gives us an idea): 22 trillion debt x 8% = 1,7 trillion approximately. What is the income tax revenue? Around 1,6 trillion dollars. Pretty similar don’t you think?
