Undoubtedly Satoshi would also say "dumb things" if he were around to do PR.

Screenshot it with censored info, would be interested to read the phrasing of this.

What necessitated a raid?

Elaborate on this point, I know zero about xrp.

The point is that no PR campaign or individual is perfect, at some point they are going to say and do dumb things publicly.

This sounds cool, shoot me an email on hammy if you get this off the ground. This is what the world needs.

It's too mainstream now. I liked it before it was cool.

Have you seen the majority of the open source and nix community? They're mainly socially awkward neckbeards who can never be wrong and frequently flame others with contrasting perspectives, including donators or support customers.
I'm not saying everybody is this way, but seems that a lot of people who have their project go mainstream end up committing endless PR boo-boos, because whilst being highly talented developers and being very smart, they aren't usually prepared for public facing duties.

Stop wasting our time with complaining about others wasting your time. Thanks.

I'm going to refer to this post every time somebody recommends an iPhone for privacy and security. Well done, my friend. Very well said.

Any particular reason why? Why is bitcoin.com still recommending them?

How could anybody be absolutely certain when the odds were absolutely against it? Ask anybody with a currency background.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:08:01
The odds were against Bitcoin though, it's been a long journey getting to this point, I'm still in shock, and I've been a firm supporter since the start.

Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto. Amateur mistakes and misunderstandings of basics, also fabricating proof.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:27:48
Life's for living. Nobody expected Bitcoin, and nobody expected it to do this well, nothing wrong with a little fun whilst the sun shines. All the more power to op if this makes him happy. ��

I was the technical consultant for a controversial political novel recently, it was by an anonymous author. The author connected his name to the project very quickly. It happens.
