I listed no less than six ways to tamper with SSL. I have no idea what most of the rest of your post is supposed to be in response to.
Yes, there are absolutely people who will accept any given bright red warning. Yes, you can sometimes land a good catch with sslstrip (which, I reiterate, does not directly interact with SSL at all). You hypothetically might even pull off something like BEAST! Sometimes. Maybe. Maybe _once._ 
SSL is terrible. A significant portion of my problems as a professional information security worry wart are rooted in SSL. But _there is no general purpose means of breaking it_ and if you know of one I congratulate you on being a millionaire-to-be mad genius who has outsmarted the entire academic field of cryptography. I guess they all live in Equestria.
You already apologized to someone else for shouting in all caps, I know. I'm just trying to steer you right before you're in my industry (as I have the overwhelming impression you're a young student). If you are ever across the interview table from me, best hope I don't remember you called me "retard" as a slur.

It's not that out of date. The vast majority of PHP deployments are _not_ running the bleeding edge git repo with new features and new deprecations. And the vast majority of PHP code was _written_ at some point in the Distant Past and merely maintained enough to not obviously catastrophically break, and hence falls into all the bad patterns everyone "knows" to avoid.

There is a finite number of Bitcoin. The difficulty goes up permanently.
They were literally decreasing the value of their own, _pre-paid_ product to customers while profiting themselves. And burn-in conveniently continued until there was another device to replace it, not for a set time. 
Add that this is the very sort of thing that the test net was made for, and there's simply no way out of it.

I'm not really in bitcoin, just in infosec, so please forgive me if my comment is based on a misconception:
Wouldn't these sst files contain at the least _addresses_ which are under an attacker's control, and large enough to fit the signature? 
Additionally, this upload to pastebin is dated to April and shows someone clearly articulating the idea.  
Not to say that it's literally impossible to have an accidental collision, but the very specific prank nature of the virus in question, combined with people clearly _trying_ to accomplish this exact effect, does make deliberation seem more likely.

GET over https is of course "better" than not but one should still use POST because GET is much more likely to get logged at all sorts of incidental points in plaintext to permanent storage. It's a forensics dream come true for law enforcement or thieves when someone has unintentionally dumped all the passwords to a plaintext file because they were logging URLs for analytic purposes.

This is true. But with literally hundreds of millions of dollars up in the air, I would be _extremely_ wary of trusting that it doesn't _seem_ to be hacked. Hopefully they have a series of backups stored on media not connected to a computer they can compare.

C is the wrong direction to go for a high-level business logic application. C++ with heavy use of modern features is not a bad choice but it still runs the same fundamental memory corruption risks as bare C, just fewer chances per kloc to introduce it. 
Python probably is the "best". It has rigorous mathematical extensions that are well-documented, well-tested, and well-used. PHP and Javascript are both notorious for the ease of introducing numerical bugs. They can be really freaking _subtle_ too. 
Obviously when the code was initially written, there were not _yet_ hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, but if you're running a money changing business you had darn well plan for that eventuality. I would never, ever, ever recommend writing code that directly works with so much money in PHP.
Here are three completely different examples of stupid numerical bugs in PHP.

This is the most European reaction to learning how we do things here in _America._
Yes, everything really is that terrible. The banks continue to feel that handling everything on a manual, ad-hoc basis and refunding people who complain out of pocket is easier than overhauling the system. The recent Target breach may have finally been what sets off the avalanche of technological reform.
At least it is not 100% useless. I remember my own bank did catch an internal employee going rogue on the same day he made the transfer from the accounts of some elderly, misled customers into his own account.

Are you referring to sslstrip, which attacks _unencrypted_ traffic to keep it from upgrading itself to encrypted traffic;
Are you referring to having control of the victim machine to install local proxies or new roots;
Are you referring to specific nonbrowser applications disabling SSL certificate verification;
Are you referring to possible latent bugs such as Apple Goto Fail;
Are you referring to being a nation state class adversary who may hypothetically be able to subvert certificate authorities; 
Because none of these are sniffing or breaking SSL in the general case. Stop shouting.

_Tremendous._ Many of the world's great datacenters are on the two North American coasts, and serve Europe and Asia respectively as well as the continental interior. 
Now, hypothetically, if every cable between Europe and the Americas got cut, I could still ping Amsterdam from Massachusetts by way of going all the way across North America, the Pacific, through Asia, and all the way across Europe - much slower, clearly, but technically works. However, ALL the traffic doing that both ways would quickly overload the entire system, and it's true that satellites could deal with only a tiny sliver of this. 
Fortunately, the internet is designed such that cutting off North America,  Europe or mainland Asia in bulk would be extremely difficult. However there are many individual countries (especially island ones) which can be cut off and indeed have been cut off in the past.

It's still very vulnerable to click fraud, especially if a hacker can get XSS on a legitimate site to replace through JavaScript the API destination of the money with their own ID. Facebook like buttons on websites are very much subject to click jacking but the maximum impact is low. Not so with a tip button.
My thirty seconds of thinking about it idea would be to have the "tip" button not go through "for real" but push it to a pending ledger. Then, when the user next visits the tipping central site, they can validate their pending ledger. It would show both the domain name the tip-press came from and the registered proper name of the organization you're tipping.

Alternately, if you _have_ to download Adobe Flash directly (and sometimes you do), make sure you are at the real adobe.com, that HTTPS is on with the green or blue lock, and that the .exe you download is signed with a Windows certificate that gives the name as Adobe and not as some other company or individual's name, or worse, no signature at all. Same goes for Java (which might still be signed under Sun's name, I don't remember, but either Sun or Oracle is fine). 
Remove Java completely unless you absolutely have to have it. I recommend only having it installed in an alternate browser. For example, if you do your normal browsing in Chrome, only have Java in Firefox, for that one site you need Java for, or vice versa. 
I know that sounds like a lot to remember but those two things, Flash and Java, are overwhelmingly popular malware targets - both for fake installs, and for exploiting bugs in older versions because you haven't kept up to date. 
Also remember that OSX and Linux are not immune. Just yesterday an acquaintance installed a pirate patch for some expensive OSX software, and it turned out to contain malware.
And always assume anything stored on the same machine as where you check your email and watch funny videos is at extreme risk of being stolen. Enjoy your paranoia!

The phrasing is misleading. It's more that you can stick arbitrary, nonsensical (to bitcoin) data in place of addresses or other data depending on the type of record. There are several examples here.

Oh, silly me, I forgot the most obvious one because it's just too obvious: Are you counting on the end user accepting the "warning: you may be MITM'd if you click okay" bright red error screen in any modern browser? You're going on about ettercap so apparently the answer is yes.
That's like saying Windows can be hacked because the user can say yes to "this unsigned piece of code that triggers antivirus wants admin permissions. Are you REALLY sure?"
If you have some secret version of ettercap which is able to generate certificates signed by mainstream authorities such as Thawte, and thereby MITM people without generating a bright red warning they're about to be MITM'd, every national intelligence agency and criminal underground on earth would like to hear from you

Mild risk for PDF and very very low risk for CSV (as long as that's the real file type and it's not, like, safe.csv.exe). With PDF the problem would be on a per-reader basis, that is, it might be malware in Adobe but it would fail to execute in Foxit, or vice versa, etc. Keeping your PDF reader always up to date eliminates the vast majority of risk.

Most security exploits sold to many parties are actually _known_ and _patched_ by the time said many parties are involved; it works because end-users don't flippin' well install patches. For something where there is only one "end-user" who needs to patch (the service) it would be extremely difficult to have more than a few people involved before it leaked somehow.

This has found its way to infosec Twitter and we're all kinda sitting around gawking at it in sheer disbelief that someone would seed for Bitcoin from random.org (problematic), over plaintext (deal breaker), and then not even trap results other than 200 OK (mind blower). An incredible cascade of bad decisions.
Though this is a good opportunity to praise random.org for doing the right thing and going HTTPS only. I wonder if there are other implementations that hit the same bug of not actually checking for 200 OK from them.

We know a lot about the guy. I took some time to browse his website. Obviously this is subjective personal experience, but every single last thing about him sets off my "scammy dude" detector, and my partner (who has even less to do with Bitcoin than I do, but got curious) thinks the same thing. We've both met probably-sociopathic scammy liars who look and sound and act and make claims just like this. They always pile on their real or imagined (often imagined) credentials for an Appeal To Authority. My very first warning sign was that he puts "dr" right in his domain name (and I don't have the cite handy but one of the news sources was saying they found no proof his doctorates were real... I have this [screencap]( from his website before he wiped it where he mentions every school EXCEPT where the doctorates came from which would support that).
Everything about detecting scammy people and possible sociopaths is "soft", you can't 100% prove it, and so should always reserve some possibility you're wrong... but protect yourself wisely. There is literally no reason to believe this man (the "proof" he offered Gavin in a controlled setting, which Gavin *wasn't allowed to study or keep*? No.) and literally infinite reason to not believe him, culminating in this, which could only be more guilty if he literally said "okay yes it was a scam" instead of nonsensically saying he can't handle being accused of being fake so he'll keep on acting fake.

- they're not attached to a hard drive per se but the private keys (like a password too long to memorize) go in files.
- Satoshi kicked off the blockchain and so has the private keys of a lot of early coins; he never spent them. It's a misconception that Bitcoin is inherently "anonymous". Rather, anyone can participate without providing external identification and can have any number of "accounts". You'd never be able to pay anyone if it were fully anonymous! Failing to appreciate the difference is how petty criminals get caught... 
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:21:31
Consultancies, isn't that answer enough? But there are multiple perfectly plausible hypotheses here on Reddit you've not looked at, such as that he's trying to falsely establish himself as Satoshi to "reclaim" the private keys from the family of the deceased true Satoshi (who he knew). In this hypothesis that would be David Kleiman.
But we all heard him out till he was blue in the face or didn't you notice?

Because it is a simpler matter to get the bleeding-edge users to revert than it is to get the users with older clients to upgrade when dealing with such a short timeframe. In particular, to my understanding, only the major miners on 0.8 had to revert to 0.7 to ensure that the 0.7 chain would become unambiguously the preferred chain
