He didn't secure his keys against local intrusion.


Australia has a Key Disclosure Law, which means that the government can compel you to disclose your encryption keys. However it would be possible to set up a Multi-Signature Transaction arrangement to ensure that in the event of your loss of liberty, ownership of your coins cannot be transferred.

I think that's probably correct, see: 
There are some counter arguments:




I'd be interested to see if Gallippi's hypothesis ("most people are only using bitcoins for goods and services when they see the price spiking.") is correct, but I'm not sure how to go about performing that analysis.

And you're confusing value and utility.


Value literally cannot be known (only estimated) because it's a completely abstract and subjective concept that varies from person to person. (Often when we talk about value we're talking about "dollar value" aka "price")


Whatever you've learned about finance, I suggest you unlearn it. You've managed to comprehensively misunderstand literally every concept you've discussed in this post.

Well you might turn them over, but not all nations have Key Disclosure Laws, so you might be able to simply tell them 'no', or you might have configured your bitcoins in such a way that they require a signature from a third party before they can be transferred.

So when people use USD or GBP or Euros to commit fraud, is that one more reason to not be associated with those currencies?

Well it's possible, but think of the limitations; if you're holding the btc on your own hardware, then if your hardware is taken offline then so is your DMS.
It could work if you're storing your btc with a third party, but if you're doing that then you've already nullified the biggest protection btc gives you.
The best option I think would be a Multi-Signature Transaction arrangement with an offshore third party that would prevent the transfer of bitcoins in the event of your loss of liberty. Even in nations with Key Disclosure Laws and weak Right to Silence protections (such as Australia), I don't think you can be compelled to communicate with a third party (IANAL though).

Yet somehow the rest of the world managed it.

Possibly, but the legal aspects have little impact if the party is offshore, or cannot be identified. In any case I doubt either of us are qualified to comment on the legality of it, as it's untested and legally complex.

Nearly zero is not zero. Their stock is highly valuable to you, therefore you have a demand for that stock. But people who are unaware of the companies prospects do not value the stock. Hence the [aggregate demand]( for that stock stays low, because at that point in time it's not widely *perceived* as having value.


Actually it is... You think I'm being dumb but in reality you've failed to realize that [value]( is distinct from [exchange value]( and [use value.]( Fundamentally you need to understand that the reason a product is valuable is because it has value to someone, and then ask *why* do they value it?
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:35:24


Sure; *"The value, on the other hand, is intrinsic, and independent of supply and demand."* Value is not independent of supply and demand; if there is zero demand, the product has no value to anyone. Value is neither intrinsic, nor independent of supply and demand - you're thinking of utility.


You arrived at the correct answer via a faulty premise. That needed to be addressed.


Because believing that paper money has no value is just as silly as believing bitcoin has no value. People value it, ergo it has value.


Eh, I'm not going to change your mind but I think there's a good chance anyone else that reads this thread will realize you don't have a clue.

Bitcoins (the assets) are held in a public ledger, you're not hiding the asset, you're *securing* the keys to access them.

2004 was 11 years ago, but that doesn't matter anyway because Bitcoin to WoW is an Apples to Baseballs comparison.

What standard or framework was used to perform this audit? Because it seems a little subjective lol.

Eh, I do information security assessments for a bank (not a US bank though), client data confidentiality is taken very seriously. It's not equivalent to cryptocurrency privacy, but it's good.
@_date: 2013-02-14 23:36:25


Um, yes we do - we just call it mining instead of printing and although it's beyond the ability of any one party to inflate the supply of bitcoins, that's both an advantage **and** a disadvantage of the currency.
The ability to inflate the money supply is not, by itself, a bad thing and with inflation of the US dollar currently at 1.7% and the national debt of the US at over 16 trillion, having your federal bank increase the money supply would be far from a stupid idea as it would reduce your national debt and increase consumer spending.
@_date: 2013-02-14 22:51:09


Well that's kind of the point of a speculative market isn't it?
@_date: 2013-02-14 23:56:08


Are you telling me there aren't more bitcoins constantly being mined?
@_date: 2013-02-15 00:40:30


Excluded it as monetary inflation is only relevant in the context of price inflation.

Speculative market is speculative - who'da thunk it?
@_date: 2013-02-15 00:26:25


That's not correct, there are practical limits to how rapidly the monetary supply can be increased before the devaluation of the currency outstrips the value being created by the introduction of new coins.
