Trezor. Ledger. Paper wallet most secure and iPhones not terrible just have everything fingerprint authenticated and anti spy and bugging apps always running and always run vpn on hidden networks on iPhone.  I wouldn’t trust an android to do shit. They come prehacked. Literally. If I must I can link article of batch proving this. They’re so goddamn susceptible.

As a girl here, and after reading some hilarious and insightful comments they pretty much stemmed from mostly men who seemed very naturally suspicious and also distrusting of their wives. Interesting social construct I seem to find. Isn’t that why two people are supposed to be married?? Love and trust. I digress. Let me just piggyback on some of the others and say this:
TRUST is sick and huge and if you guys are living paycheck to paycheck it seems she loves you for you and doesn’t give a shit about your wealth but she might instinctually hate you for not only lying to her but playing a double broke agent for several years groveling about bills and paycheck to paycheck. 
Women HATE liars and there’s no worse feeling than .. well something similar to being your wife in this exact scenario. You either tell her everything cuz you love her, she’s your partner and you want to share this and enjoy it WITH and FOR your family OR you fucking leave now and ship the BTC to Switzerland while dealing with divorce. Because anything in between will be mind numbingly long and drawn out torture. This money will root everything and tear you apart with the WAY YOU handled it. So you already royally fucked up IMO. But this is your wife. Are people still clocking out at 35 to just anyone they lie about things like this to??

The MOST vulnerable ways of hacking are sadly user generated errors. IE phishing attacks are not what they used to be. There’s are networks pumping millions of dollars to track use adware and infiltrate devices... by looking IDENTICAL to websites and apps. Always bookmark websites and or type and recheck the site you land at to make sure you weren’t redirected. AlwAys enter every single password with extreme caution

Because you probably are influenced by other people’s opinions much more than you realize. You probably have certain friends you trust to learn from etc. 
I still have people telling me I’m an idiot but it’s just a fundamental agree to disagree because I’ve always at my core believed in the vision, drive and technology. That’s the difference. I’ve always researched the pros and cons. Price predictions week after week. And I laugh and love the passionate disagreements. But I’ve believed paper money was going to die back in 2009. Probably before when it was an insane thing to be heard saying. Allegedly. 
Quick story I’m sure the other true believers here can relate to...
I remember months ago I had just added more or reloaded BTC at like 4kish...hahaha and in like maybe 2 hours towards end of day started dropping and next day I almost lost about half from what I put in day before. 
Ilaughed to myself, and said “well I sure as FUCK, am not selling now.” And I just put it out of my mind for while. Knowing I was going to probably have to it it took a long ten hit. But I never wavered in faith because I’ve never even been speculative with the coin. I’ve always believed it would be the most important thing I’d see in my lifetime. 
The day I didn’t sell and begged my coworkers not to.. they instantly sold even though I’ve tried and tried to make them see what they’re clearly ‘not’ getting. But as crazy as it sounds. Some people literally will not or cannot wrap their minds around the way bitcoin has its value lol. You either just get it or you don’t and I’m sorry you sold but it’s so not a big deal. There will be other things. You’re caring way too much about the money.  I didn’t ever care if I lost cash in BTC. I don’t know if it was cuz I knew it’d come back but I just wasn’t banking on it to spend. Mentally the money I bought in with anyways was such a hassle for ME to get out cuz I had every type of 2fa etc. so mentally I’d forget about the cash 
In my opinion. Again I could be wrong but my belief never made this too much of a financial thing for me. Granted in other cryptos yes. But I always knew the money I had in there was ride or die. And the true believers in this, the  fundamentalists who were also saying paper money would be abolished within 20 Yrs 8 years ago were also called crazy as I was. 
But why I stress open mindedness in all scenarios in life. As crazy as people thought we were for not seeing how insane they believed it to me I couldn’t understand why my top 5 friends ignored me when 6 mos ago I said “if there’s anything you ever take In from me and can learn. Please please PLEASE do yourself the favor of buying bitcoin now. You know how many did it?? Not 1.. 
So it’s not that I was right they were wrong it’s the simple fact I believed before people were saying things and before I even knew what bitcoin was that all money was moving digital in storage at least cuz debit cards. I for sure believed paper money was dead. 
Drunk rambled maybe? Sorry ask me anything else loll

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:20:32
Well explain the superficial similarities that you’ve noticed. I was too young around dot com bubble but are we calling corrections bubbles cuz Idk if I could compare that to house if crisis. What I see is certain people were just much more open minded to accepting other possibilities and outcomes that could be adopted. 
So.. Herbert Hoover during Great Depression made everyone turn their actual gold into the government. So dollars then were worthless.. Reagan put it back right but didn’t matter cuz people who call crypto a scam and fake.. other than the hilarious fact it’s like the most biased opinions on  rypto being a scam are from all the ‘genius big bankers’. Etc. a. Common sense tells me I’d be more surprised if banks first positions were pro bitcoin. Lol no it stands to explode the very foundation of their system etc. 
 Second and most important. There is not bigger scam than the rate at which we print money which.. have only ever been IOUs. And then they became IOUs’ IOUs once the gold was taken away haha. So people define markets and what our neighbors value something at and what they’re willing to pay is so similar to other financial systems. 
I’ve said this for a while. The one pro for banks to bitcoin RIGHT NOW.. hands down is the chargeback factor and they do have your back if you as much as dislike what you bought. Let alone. Get robbed. 
So other cryptos .. they’re all basically the same type of operating fundamentals the decentralized nodes. Hash rates etc. I mean it can deviate but for the most part long term, they’ll be able to all be exchanged for one another. but mostly the cryptos are founded, funded and started on ideas of taking this open face and secure method of every business you can think of that will also inevitably be digitized as well. Those are the ones I’d suggest to you to look into it read about and buy into one that’s a few cents right now because you see now other way than their brilliant idea becoming adopted. There will never be another bitcoin, but there will be other coins like bitcoin. That get mass adoption and make a lot of people very wealthy people. Bitcoin is the gold standard. But huge tech companies will acquire some that are out and prob try their own. But the technology is DEFINITELY a learning curve.. it took me a while to become fluent to literally understand exactly what the blocks meant what they did. What a miner was. I mean; and  that’s me who has loved the idea of this beautiful disruption since day one. So for you, you inherently just trust and we’re very used to banks. Money is sensitive to people so obviously you and many others are like this. 
But if I can suggest anything that will help you maybe understand what we’re saying or to see more of what we see. Google or YouTube search. Bitcoin explained easy. And then from there what I’d then do is go to coin market cap and research some coins. You’ll see some websites. Idk what the markets loo like.. i won’t touch it. It looks like a stock webpage ad from wix. But you’ll find some solid ones and see what matters to you.  
 
It’s interesting. About 5 years ago I really started worrying about public’s mass adoption to everything digital because that’s where I saw everything going and it was going. Privacy and security in this digital age is HUGE to me and many of my cryptos are the gold standard and focus their blockchain on making sure this type of business or company that aims to do this is using their own blockchain etc. that technology is the only plausible future for secure online ‘anything’... but a lot of cryptos just happen to also accept money because it’s an all inclusive thing. 
I told some people this yesterday. Download iPhone app brave. Amazing browser anti ad anti tracking beautifully interfaced. Came from people behind Mozilla. Code writer of java script. Their entire platform is digital advertising and how it’s fucked. 
1. Its  fucked because end users like us get tracked everywhere.  I could give a shit personally, except hackers who specialize in decryption and cyphers are like the Einstein’s of hackers. Hats off to them. They’re brilliant and I don’t want 3rd party software hacked from that tracking screwing me. 
2. Middling fees, inflated specs, not entirely honest or properly targeting etc.  AND duopoly like 99% of digital ads are google Facebook. 
3. They also cite the amount of end users with ad blockers. Ads are a necessary evil in everyway on the net and with the next level of digitization BRAVE browser realizes this is only going to get worse. (Side note. Brave is so much faster right now because they literally don’t track and block everything most spy apps and software block anyways. I hope it stays that way) but there are tons of issues. 
SO.. we’ve got a beautiful idea and website with creators in the tech world that are not only the best of the best but I trust as will others to see through the project is and remains a success. So how do THEY disrupt the multi directional-exploitative advertising market? They will begin to allow users to watch targeted ads by clicking yea or no on their own brave browser eliminated the middle man (solving a huge Somali dilemma just like bitcoin and merchant processors..) and BEST part!!
GUESS how end users will be paid. BAT crytpo currency. I bought it later than I would have liked At .18 cents. It’s at like 22 cents 5 days later and I’m in love with the browser it’s like be best versions of Microsoft google and Firefox combined and it’s the crypto I am most exited about with the most obvious huge future. Period. 
So I did just ramble again but I wanted to literally write out my love and passion and my thoughts that go into why I’d invest long term in a crypto. I don’t care about money. I’m not driven by it I never have been. I probably would be better off if I did but my point is I think this coins BAT has the most potential of anything I’ve ever seen besides BTC/ now eth by proxy lol .. that I’m just purely ELATED to see where it goes. I believe it has an amazing mission statement and that’s mainly cutting the fact of abusive and greedy ad sales in all directions :) 
If we can discuss more from the first part ask away. I might fall asleep however we can continue tomorrow if needed. 
And download brave. See if you like it. Then I think you’ll thank me later as you’ll see what I’m talking about w bat coin. Man.. I’m so sickly in love with this stuff I have just poured my HEART out trying to make you love everything crypto too!!
Ha but for real. The people just like me get it. Thanks for listening I appreciate any of your questions and I’d love to hear your opinions or input/ insight on any and everything I said etc. ciao!

Well I wasn’t able to find stats on a solid timeline ration for amounts of times app wallets are hacked if bitcoin and by how much... kidding sorta. However it’s how vulnerable you make yourself. If you’re using a wallet that redirects you to transfer your BTC to another site upon entering I’d say you need to shut that down all together. You could have a key logger and tracker on your phone right now and have no idea. I’ve read some articles where some hacks and thieves don’t instantly siphon. They sit and wait and pick good time. I’d say a safe bet is 1:100

You know what bothers me about every victim on here is the fact about my personal experience with bittrex, their customer service has always been stellar. It’s really been me when I’ve had to re enable my accounts so my photos and the tons of documents they need ( which is a GREAT thing, however tedious you guys may complain). Took like two seconds in theory. 
What I’ve tried to explain is there are much smarter people than any of us who are actively trying to figure out how to steal everyone’s crypto currency everyday. It’s still very early in this game. Very early. And bitcoin will hit over 6 figures a coin within 5 years and who the hell even knows how high from there. 
But my point is...slowly as the richest people begin to have their lightbulbs go off and see crypto is the future of money period... many innocent and or lucky investors who either don’t truly understand crypto yet... they don’t protect themselves etc .. and don’t  get who how or why hacks are so prevalent and will be much more before it even starts getting better .. basically the retail/ coinbase investors... these people will probably lose their coins somehow. Or will be hapless victims of some sort. Which is why education and just thorough understanding of everything bitcoin is essential to still having these coins when they do create many many more millionaires in the next decade etc. 
-Others will not be proactive enough and have some warm wallets compromised.. because they don’t understand the people like myself and many others on here who are bitcoin lifers who truly understand we’re still witnessing bitcoins infancy... we’re in early stages and the hacks or accusations people are making now against certain wallets exchanges etc are going to look like the good ole days in a few years. 
Shit will get crazy. The only real real way to do this correctly and stop theorizing and wasting time with these threads because they can and will all be compromised or have at some point in some way.. you need a piece of paper. A pencil. And a written down key.. period. Make 2 pencil copies and bury one in back yard if you have to and buy a damn safe. A real safe. One that’s bolted to ground. Only sure fire way to protect yourself. To protect yourself in a few years from any entity to even know you own these etc. 
Anyone who made it  his far down on this thread and read my comment. Please take this as seriously as you had to protect your moms house because groups of the best burglars in the world were trying to find a way to open a window every single damn day. Period. It is what it is. I think the reward is definitely worth it. But we need to support and help each other like this and really defend our community. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:25:18
lol 100k max. We’re at basically 10k now and prob less than 5% of people even kno what a bitcoin is. 
By 2025 if bitcoin keeps market share and is just 2-5% of global economy market share. That figure is actual and way higher than your guesstimate 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:42:07
You’re absolutely NEVER using bittrex based on this story which other redditors with clear crypto knowledge have poked more holes in than a honeycomb. That’s not logical or bright. And pretty ignorant and naive imo. Do your own research. Lol. It’s only the google of crypto and what I’ve found is more times than not it’s a user error or mistake that is NOT on bittrex and them disabling the account is a phenomenal thing because they are trying to protect their other users. Like myself and etc and if you guys send off ANY flags.. I don’t give a shit if you have 1 million USD in BTC I want them flagging your accounts for however long it takes. Period. 
This is a GOOD thing. I love bittrex because they can be the most tedious to get in and out of but that’s probably the single most important part of their business model. You think hackers are bombarding them hundreds of times everyDAY trying to pose as people like you and everyone else to gain access for forgotten passwords or disabling 2fa briefly etc. 
Do yourself a favor so you’re not so quick to listen believe and follow a strangers grievance from reddit and do your own research to confirm if this person is or isn’t onto something. My guess is if they are real. They’re leaving out the smoking gun of WHY it got disabled and it’s prob for their own protection. 
Can’t you guys critically think or even Just think of WHY bittrex would do this. If they were shutting down accounts arbitrarily .. why? It’s not standard to keep 120k on there but you think they need that money more than the amount in fees they collect and keeping a positive reputation so users like myself can speak their truth like this of saying it’s hard for me to believe these horror customer service bittrex stories because the real website (many clones and fakes..) has never been less than stellar to me. And others I’ve seen. Best of luck.

Hey can you explain to me of this attack? I have a trusted source and from what I’ve theorized I know BTC will tank.. I didn’t know there were evil hands behind it. Could you loosely explain The Who and why etc. centralized powers trying to gain more control over this crypto ‘situation’ as they see it so keep forking off and want to do it until they can get one miner to clog over 51% of CPU to potentially pervert and tank entire system?? Totally on right path or completely off..? Thanks if you wouldn’t mind

Why do people like you and so many others pretend or pose as cypher experts. Like come on. This point is extremely valid and intrinsically I feel bad for the millions on coinbase because the smartest hackers could probably have an easy field day with that site. Paper wallets seem the absolutely only logical way. The big amounts etc.

Bottom right now will be -5000 down to $-3800 .. which is great buy more and ignore the downswing of numbers on your screen cuz it’ll shoot back up and prob break 10k by next summer at least. It’s always remained steady slowly going up up up. You’ll never regret buying those if you just never sell them. GL

Machines etc will keep getting smarter and smarter. Year over year. This is just the way the world and markets are shifting. It’s not gonna take 50 years.
