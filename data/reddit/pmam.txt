The thing that would concern me about all this if I was a customer is (apart from the fact it seems totally illegal) **nothing** has said has been independently verified by a third party.
Law enforcement? Who are they? What are they doing?
Investors? Who are they? 
Balances affected? How did they arrive at the positions they're claiming? Did they engage external auditors?
The investigation into the hack? Do they have any idea who did it? How do they know it won't happen again?
For all the world knows it's just some kid with a stolen laptop bashing out posts, and customers are supposed to be happy with a 36% haircut?

If you control the keys, it's yours. You gave your depositors an IOU to retrieve funds held on account. No different to how bank accounts are IOUs.
The way I see it if you can't make all of your customers whole, you are insolvent. I'd be very careful about resuming trading if that's the case.

For all intents and purposes it looks like an inside job.

I doubt that any such model would apply (though I can see why BFX would try it on) as it would far too easily allow for fraud.
In most common law jurisdictions courts do have the ability to see through schemes to circumvent corporations law (especially solvency provisions).
Banks not holding full reserve isn't relevant; this is about solvency.

Surely you can at least name the law enforcement agency you have contacted. If not, why would anyone assume you have actually engaged law enforcement?
The scant information released so far suggests that the hack was an inside job. You're not doing anything to dispel that illusion, if it is in fact an illusion.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:39:10
here's some questions I'm sure your customers who you plan to give a haircut to would like answered:
* Where is Bitfinex incorporated?
* What law enforcement in that jurisdiction was informed about the security breach, and when?
* Did they give you a reference number for the matter? 
* What other law enforcement has been informed, and when?
* Have your secured creditors been informed about the breach?
* On what basis does Bitfinex believe that its Terms of Service will carry any legal weight, especially given that in most jurisdictions attempts to displace the force of corporations law via such Terms are generally invalid?

I don't think you can infer from those transactions that all 11 bidders won something. That doesn't really sound very likely, does it? It would only be possible if they only bid on one or two blocks each.
If two bidders bid for the lot at $X/coin and $X+Y/coin respectively (which is much more likely with these whales), the $X/coin bidder will not get anything. For that reason I think there will only be a small number of winners.
I'd guess that the 50K is being broken up into smaller pieces for security reasons by the USMS pending transfer to the winner(s).

I'm thinking the same thing. To a behemoth like Microsoft, it's really neither here or there if they cash in their coins or not. They might as well hang on to them, at least for a while.
The most exciting aspect of this development to me isn't just the increase in transaction activity (which I think will be fairly small in the short-term). It's the fact that Microsoft aren't just any retailer; they're a tech giant. I may not love all of their products but I don't doubt their ability to move into a tech space and become a player in it, if they choose. Their track record in that regard is pretty good.
So I hope this move is the first of many from them, leading to them offering new products and services in Bitcoin.
I think the example of the success of cell phone networks in the Third World could inspire a company like Microsoft to develop a cheap hardware wallet that could be used by people who don't have bank accounts to pay for things and receive money from family overseas. The market for such a device could be huge; and Bitcoin's technological advantages would make it the ideal exchange mechanism.

Gox manages thousands of wallets for their customers. Many of those wallets receive new coins from mining pools.
Gox doesn't leave all of those coins sitting in customer wallets. They manage them, which means that some will go into cold storage, etc.
When Gox pays out a withdrawal their wallet software will use some algorithm to pick inputs, and some of those inputs could be from customer wallets with immature coins (which obviously is a mistake that needs fixing). Gox maintains true customer balances internally, off the blockchain.
TL;DR: When you withdraw funds from Gox, they don't necessarily come from 'your' wallet. They come from *a* wallet Gox manages.

I think it's of more benefit to people new to bitcoin, who don't know about exchanges and such. MS's data mining of the search requests they receive must have prompted them to do this.
It might not persuade anyone on this sub to change, it's more of a "good to know".

No, I don't find it ironic. Anonymity isn't one of the goals of bitcoin.

It's designed to be a peer-to-peer trust-less payment protocol. It doesn't promise anonymity, or even consider it important.

Actually, if BIT put in a stack of bids on behalf of several syndicates, that could result in there being multiple winners. But you'd think that if you are only bidding for a single block, you're less inclined to pay a premium when you have OTC and exchange alternatives.

My wife works in a public library. Yesterday in the workroom the conversation unexpectedly turned to Bitcoin (started by the person who is probably the least technically-minded, as well).

Bitcoin could be used for pretty much anything that currently relies on maintaining a public register, such as land - probably the biggest unique asset class there is.
Interestingly the method proposed is more like how title deeds work (which were in turn supplanted by public registries) where you show a trail of ownership back to the originator of the initial grant of land (i.e., the King). The problem with title deeds was that they could be forged, burnt or lost. The blockchain avoids those problems.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:19:58
Yes, it happened a few weeks ago, IIRC.
Nothing was 'lost', as such, but some transactions had to wait 40-50 minutes to get included in a block.

The market is still working out what the premium is worth. If there's no perceived value in what they are doing the price should come down to the spot price.
If you buy a share legally you become one of the beneficiaries of the Trust, so it's not really an IOU. In law there is a distinction between legal owners and beneficial (true) owners. A trust baby is an example of a beneficial (true) owner. Their trustee (the legal owner) is required by law to run the trust in the best interest of the trustee, and stiff penalties (including jail time) may apply for failure to do so.
GBTC are subject to audit like any other trust and are liable to be prosecuted like any other trustee that fails to execute its fiduciary duty.
I'm not an advocate for them, just trying to give a short explanation of how their affairs are arranged.

Under GST law, there is no way you can "push the GST liability" onto someone else. If you are liable to collect the GST, you must collect it and pay it. If you fail to collect it when you should have, you are still liable to pay it. If as a customer you are not charged GST, it is not your responsibility to pay it.
To me this looks like they have asked the ATO for a ruling and it has come back as they describe - no GST chargeable on the purchase of the coins themselves, only on the commission. That would explain why no one else has announced it yet, but other exchanges will be free to take advantage of it as well, as long as they also comply with the conditions of the ruling (which we don't know about yet).
This will be good for transparency as well as they would have to break down the commission on the GST invoice, so you can see how much it is.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:57:48
It's hard to say at the moment. There are such things as private rulings, which don't have to be made public, though the ATO might later decide to make the ruling public.
I imagine Coin Loft's competitors will be scrambling to lobby the ATO to either make the ruling public or get their own private rulings as they will be uncompetitive otherwise.

It does, but in the world of commercial computing it's actually not that long. If a vendor like Microsoft or Oracle tells their customers they *MUST* upgrade their systems to a new version of a product that is incompatible with their current one (incompatible in the sense that the current version will not be able to recognize new blocks) they would usually give a longer lead time (at least 2 years and probably a lot longer).
Given that the hard fork is currently still in test, the time in fact is quite short.
Having said that, given the likelihood that 1MB will soon not be big enough preempts the decision to go with a short lead time, I think.
EDIT: As others have said, it appears to be a band-aid. It's the simplest change possible that will keep the network growing for a couple of years, but I think it's only intended to buy some time to implement something that will scale seamlessly (i.e., the real solution will be something that doesn't require future hard forks).
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:10:30
Yes, that's pretty much it. As a customer you can't be held liable if Coin Loft err in their interpretation of the ruling.

I think the potential in the third world is big as well, but I think the greatest opportunity will be offering a service to people who don't have bank accounts. 
Brick and mortar banks and ATMs are pieces of infrastructure that require a stable government, economy and law and order. In the third world banking services are often [inconvenient or don't exist](
In the third world the main piece of infrastructure that has been built in the last 20 years and survives fairly well even during civil wars and natural disasters is the mobile phone network, which is why a lot of people in third world countries have cell/mobile phones.
A technology stack of a mobile phone network and phones that are capable of holding a wallet app might meet many people's requirements. The bank would not be needed.

One share is backed by 0.1 BTC. However you aren't buying BTC directly, you are buying a share of a publicly traded unit trust that holds BTC. Therefore it is expected to trade at a premium to the BTC spot price as the trust is expected to handle reporting, compliance, security, et cetera. It also offers convenience to investors who want to hold BTC as a registered security but were previously not able to.
In theory those extra features represent the difference between the spot price and the GBTC price.

One of the (until now) less discussed aspects of the btc:fiat ratio going Moonwards is the likelihood that when it happens, it will be because there is a sudden realization in the wider community that their fiat is nearly worthless, followed by a panicked rush into 'good' money like bitcoin.
Many early adopters will suddenly become very wealthy as a reward for our foresight and patience. However, *many more* people will suddenly realize that their retirement fund or whatever they were counting on has fallen in value so much that they can't afford to retire. They will be looking for someone to blame, and they might blame us. They will ask us why we didn't warn them. They will assume we were somehow involved. In short, we need to be careful.

Have you considered what would it cost to run 20 7950s? You'd need several PCs with chunky power supplies and some serious cooling. The AM blade draws 120 Watts. OK, I concede you'd probably be able to resell the GPUs after 12 months for maybe half of what you paid for them whereas the ASIC wouldn't be worth much, but running costs and extra peripherals are much higher with GPUs.

Thank you for blowing my mind. I can imagine Google or some start-up you've not yet heard of offering a service that is Bitcoin + something else. The beauty of the system could be that only 1 satoshi is needed to signify payment, so an entire app or ecosystem might happily exist with thousands of users only 'consuming' 1 bitcoin. Kind of like a universe-within-a-universe. The true 'value' of the transactions might be a lot higher than the nominal value of a satoshi, but the value exists because of whatever the utility of the ecosystem is. In the same way that a google search is worth a lot more than the computing effort that was required to create it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:05:31
Yes, that was one of Satoshi's great insights. Transactions already add about 1% to the value of a block, and if in a few years Bitcoin has many orders of magnitude more transaction volume that is where the return in mining will be, regardless of the decreasing coin reward. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:27:10
Harder yes. I think with their low cost of production and operation they will be OK for a quite a while. They have plenty of blades on hand plus a huge order booked. They probably won't need more hardware after that until the network goes over 1 Phash. Bitfury might be a worthy competitor; apparently they expect to have a low cost/hash chip ready by August.
Yes, it is a fixed reward game; so at some point the share price will stabilize.

I know it's still only early after the diff change but we've already seen 77 blocks hashed in 10.5 hours, which is 22.6% over expectation (of course this could be just luck).
However with hundreds or possibly thousands of KnC devices hitting the network this week the next increase might be north of 35%.
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:03:17
It will balance out because going to smaller process sizes (110nm -&gt; 55nm -&gt; 28nm) has an exponential increase in cost, both in design and fabrication. Intel apparently have only just stopped using 22nm and are going to 14nm (I'm not an EE so don't quote me on this, I just read about it). The closer you get to current tech, the costs go up as you are relying on R&amp;D which hasn't been fully amortized yet. Also, you have to compete with the big boys (Intel, Samsung, AMD, etc) for time in the fab, and they've got very deep pockets.
It will depend on the price of btc vs USD on how soon ASIC manufacturers invest in smaller process sizes. I haven't heard about any 22nm ASICS yet.
Also, there is a point at where it is not worth it to keep making more of a current-gen chip. Usually the fabrication costs of a chip are very low (once you've paid your NRE, or Non-Recurring Expenses). However as the global hashrate goes up the return on a chip keeps falling; eventually to the point where it's not worth making more.

Used them as well for both buys and sells. No issues for me.
@_date: 2013-09-02 12:06:46
Used them a couple of times. Their sell rates were higher than coinjar at the time. They quote 3-5 business days to fill an order. Count on 5 days.
I asked them a couple of questions about their service and they were very prompt to respond. Maximum sell per order is $2k.
When the price rose recently they suspended their sell service but it looks like it is now back, but the rates are now worse than coinjar.
If I was you I'd compare them with coinjar for rates and order fulfillment times but they've been OK for me so far.

I think they were doing it initially for the transparency. People could look at the pool stats and confirm that what they were seeing matched the revenues reported. On the back of that they have now sold several hundred blades to customers.
Their next step will be to grow the solo mine for higher returns plus the ability to develop and deploy their next generation hardware with less public scrutiny (hash rate of the solo pool won't be visible to the public, only estimable from the number of blocks mined).

Perhaps a journalist could actually do some real journalism instead of doing product reviews and find out why BFL publish misleading information on their website about how long it will take to ship new orders.

Did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. If a 7950 draws 188W while mining, 20 of them running non-stop for a year would use about $5,000 worth of electricity at 15c/kWh. The blade would use $157.68. If you are paying more for your power the difference in cost obviously goes up.

I think its more likely that they have shipped *some* Jalapenos ordered in the first 3 days. While  is not comprehensive, you would expect to see more than 2 acknowledged deliveries out of the 89 Jalapeno orders listed there from 23 June to 25 June if all Jalas from the first 3 days had shipped.

Proof? No. Circumstantial evidence? Yes. They have order numbers stretching up into the 50,000s (source: bfl.ptz.ro). Ok, not every order gets checked out or stays non-cancelled. Estimate how many orders are still pending. Maybe 50%? Estimate 2 pieces per order. 50,000 pieces to ship. They have stated on their website that their production line can produce 400 pieces per day, 5 days a week. 2000 pieces a week. That's 25 weeks.
Then you also have to factor in that they have continually failed to meet their past promises. They're always a couple of weeks away from shipping, but it never actually seems to happen. Read bitcointalk and here. People have been talking about this for months.
Currently they are testing new boards for the singles, and they have received a new batch of chips around today for more testing. You can find all this out on their forums. They are trying to get the power consumption for the chips down to 3.7-4W/GHs, otherwise the chips will not be stable without underclocking, which would mean they can't get the required hash rate in the form factor they are using. As far as anyone knows they have only shipped a handful of evaluation units to developers and journalists, maybe around 20-30 pieces. Ordinary customers who ordered in June last year are still to receive their orders (browse bitcointalk and here and bfl forums, there are plenty of long-term miners there who have waited since then).
There is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that they are not shipping to anywhere near the volumes they'd need to to ship current orders in July. Can I prove they can't? No. 
The question should be, what are BFL doing to prove that they *can* ship by July?

Yes. Though on long-enough timescales, the current rate of increase is not sustainable.
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:57:13
Well done. While it was still a massive gamble you obviously did a lot of research.
I did my research on AM a few weeks ago before I invested in it (for some reason I missed out on hearing about Bitcoin until recently even though I am a geek). I read everything friedcat ever wrote on bitcointalk front to back, and realized he figured out everything that's happening now, **9 months ago**. It's all turning out exactly the way he predicted it would. When I realized that, I couldn't get my money in fast enough. Yes, he's a legend.

Yes, and like TCP Bitcoin is silent about what you do with it. I expect that just as TCP's designers only had a general idea what it would be used for, Satoshi, even though he is likely a genius, can only guess what Bitcoin will be used for, beyond the obvious uses (i.e., store of value, currency).

I speculate that it's not currently profitable for them to ship Singles.
Their design has had to change because they now need to put (say) 20 2.5GH/s chips into a big single. Depending on how high their chip yields are they will need to go through a lot of chips to find 20 good enough to use. That will eat through their supply of chips very quickly.
In order to give the appearance of progress in the meantime they've decided to ship 5GH/s miners, which only require 2 good chips per device. They might not be making any money on them but it is proof of shipping and discourages people from cancelling/suing. It buys them some time.
When they get their chip yields up and performance per chip up they'll ship Singles.

No hang on, you said:


So you accept that AM are excellent, but you expect their shares will be worth nothing in a few months? Yes, competition will be coming, my point (and a few others agree with me) is that they will be *as well placed as anyone* to deal with that competition. As long as they can match the technical advances in the field (and it's brave to say that they won't) they can maintain a share of the network and remain profitable. Note that I don't disagree that the shares are very highly priced right now, but that doesn't mean that they'll soon be worth nothing.
If you hadn't worked it out already I bought when the shares were cheaper than they are now. My investment horizon is 2+ years out and I don't see the point of dumping the shares because the price has gone up, especially when the company has excellent management and bright prospects.
Oh, and today's dividend was a tidy 0.038 per share, even at the current valuation that's a tasty 1.5% return this week.

mathematician != cryptographer
I think the biggest insight in bitcoin is the system of incentives for miners. I suspect Satoshi is a mathematician with interests in economics and sociology who knew enough programming and crypto to get by.
@_date: 2013-04-30 01:23:47
This is just a bit of blue-sky thinking; I'm happy for someone to point out where I've gone wrong.
I've now read a couple of the articles on that site, and while the author's enthusiasm for the potential uses of Bitcoin is apparent and enlightening, he also takes a slightly mocking tone against people who intend to hold Bitcoins as an 'investment' (even though he cites 'Silicon Valley' people he knows who hold millions of dollars in Bitcoins).
In other words, he sees Bitcoins as ultimately a payment mechanism, so the parties on either end are really using the mechanism to move money about without a third party (and there's a conversion between money and btc at both ends). So they're not investing in Bitcoins, just utilizing the mechanism, the same way that people who use a smartphone to send an email utilize a different mechanism.
But isn't there a bit more to it than that? When those parties are done using the Bitcoin, it has to go back to *someone*. It's explicit in the system that coins are always owned by an address controlled by some entity. So surely as the container becomes widespread (and I agree with him that it will) the value of Bitcoins will settle at *some* value to compensate 'investors' for holding them, and making them available for commerce (i.e., effectively 'renting' them)?
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:17:00
Yes, it would. We already have a word for the smallest fraction of a bitcoin (the satoshi, or 0.00000001 btc). Maybe other words for useful small fractions of a bitcoin will catch on (e.g. millibits for 0.001 btc).
Some people think that we may not end up paying for things in bitcoins directly but using them as a medium of transfer - you want to pay someone $2, so you tell your wallet to give them $2. Your wallet buys $2 worth of bitcoins and sends the bitcoins to the recipient's wallet. Their wallet sells the bitcoins for $2. You can both see the $2 was transferred, but neither of you would know without checking exactly how many btc were involved in the transfer.
Actually it's probably more accurate to say people will keep a small amount of btc in their wallets for small transactions (maybe $50-500 worth), but will 'rent' btc for bigger transactions. So to pay a tip you might pay out of your wallet directly. But if you want to buy a round-the-world plane ticket that costs $4,000 your wallet will do the conversion I described above.

The Bitfountain shares are held by friedcat and his investors. They're using them for their own purposes (staff bonuses for example). The ASICMINER 'real' shares are traded 'off-market', by private contract. You can buy those if you want to.
If a pass-through owner decides to add more shares to the pass-through (they want to do this as off-market shares are usually a little bit cheaper) they buy off-market and just add them to the pass-through at a rate that won't drop the price noticeably (otherwise they'd lose their profit). The pass-through owner also has a good chance of ending up with a board seat (4,000 shares).

If we go with your logic about invoice numbers and order numbers we get a 'hold on' to the order rate of about 43%, not much less than my 50. But not every order is for 1 piece, in fact many are not. You haven't challenged my assertion that there are probably about 2 pieces per order, so that makes 23.6 weeks. Scarcely any different to 25, and nowhere near July.
Owning a little bit of AM isn't a bar on me or others stating our reasonable opinion based on observation of their performance so far.
@_date: 2013-09-01 13:39:07
I sort of wondered about point 5 (the deflationary argument). Then a couple of weeks ago I had a temporary fiat cash flow problem. I saw the exchange rate was about $125 and realized I could sell a few Bitcoins to solve it. Yeah, deflationary currency - big deal.

I've got a few AM shares. I believe that they'll be able to compete with new players as the tech evolves over the next couple of years. They may lose market share for a while but their low cost of design, manufacture and operational excellence will mean they will stay viable in the medium term (I expect this will happen with gen 2, they may be displaced for a little while but will soon catch up).
I expect that open source will probably mature to always be around a third of the network, so that will be viable too.
ASIC hardware for mining will become a commodity in a few years when the tech catches up with IC state of the art. New generations of tech will give an incremental benefit (only for a few months), rather than an order of magnitude benefit.
When that point has been reached, I think AM will have pivoted off in a new direction, though it's hard to say what that will be at the moment.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:34:20
Yes, and hardware sales are the future. You know AM's long term goal is to be a hardware seller? The mine is just a way of bootstrapping the company.
Saturation is still some way off. When it happens the keys will be fast development cycles and low cost of manufacture in volume to bring new generation tech. AM's marginal cost of production at the moment is very low and yes, they will need to drop it lower to stay competitive. The value will be in what margins they can achieve between what they can make hardware for and what they can sell it for. I honestly don't see any of the current crop of rivals being able to match them there, but that's just my opinion.
At some point around when ASICs become a commodity (maybe 3-4 years) I expect AM will pivot into other lines of business.
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:31:26
True, and it doesn't yet account for solo mining, unless it's been updated really recently.
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:21:56
Yes, good point. I guess economics and game theory are interrelated here.
@_date: 2013-06-26 06:40:33
Yes, I think 2013-14 will be a period of consolidation where the issues you raise are looked at.
At some point after, when those things are in place, the use of and demand for Bitcoin will skyrocket.

They're still selling blades.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:02:36
[Have a look at this](
People with orders have volunteered their order number, date, and product ordered.
You should take the information with a grain of salt. Apparently if you create an order on BFL's website but don't check it out, that order number is still spent. Other orders have been cancelled as people gave up waiting.
Wild-Arse Guessing of the hold rate for orders is somewhere around 40%-50% (outside of BFL no-one really knows). So even if you say 40%, that's still ~55,000 * 0.4 = 22,000 orders, at a conservative average of 2 pieces per order - over 40,000 pieces. Just a guess, but no one really denies there are a lot of people waiting for their ASICs.
I won't comment on when people will get their hardware or if it will be profitable or not, but it's fair to say in this game the sooner you get your ASIC the better. There are plenty of people who've seen the same data and have decided to wait. Others decided to get a refund.
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:48:28
I bought in a few weeks ago just before the dividends started to climb. I only invested as much as I could afford to lose. It's already had a nice pop in price but in my horizon (2 years) I think buy/hold/reinvest dividends could produce an outstanding return.
To put it another way, this is friedcat's game to lose. He has put AM in the perfect position to be the first commercial success story of Bitcoin. Nothing is guaranteed of course but if he pulls it off long-term holders of AM are going to be smiling for a long time.
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:42:16


Well, not quite. In the long run, the value in mining will be in the transaction fees. The new coin reward is an early stage incentive to encourage mining. There is no limit on fees beyond the physical capacity of the Bitcoin container to accommodate more transactions. Imagine if all of the bitcoins in the world were traded once a day. Work out what the fees are for that. What if they are all traded once an hour? Or once a second?
Whilst it's impossible for someone to own more than 21 million btc, that doesn't mean there can't be something btc based which is worth *more* than that. It's how fast the coins move, not who holds them.
Not discounting your strategy, just pointing out that growth in mining might be less limited than you think.

Try not being too pedantic and have a look at the wider picture. If OP is running a business, his or her operational costs are in fiat. He or she needs fiat to survive. What you say is true in principle but not very helpful to OP's predicament.

The pass-through shares (like G.ASICMINER-PT) are backed 1:1 by 'real' shares in ASICMINER. The micro-passthroughs are backed 100:1. There can never be more than the 163,962 public shares in ASICMINER (no dilution is allowed). If the pass-through owner wants to increase the number of shares in the pass-through they can by buying more real shares and selling the pass-throughs that are created as a result. You'll often see them bidding on auctions on bitcointalk.
I hold some passthroughs on btco.co. I think AM is a good investment, though I've only invested money that I can afford to lose. Helps when things like the Mtgox panic happened the other day (AM dropped from 1.7 to 1.5 as people rushed to get out of btc, then went back to 1.7 when everyone realized it was a storm in a teacup).
@_date: 2013-05-01 01:21:05
The thing is, there's nothing you can do about it, so why worry? It's like saying you're not happy that AT&amp;T are switching from X.25 to TCP/IP. Anyone, anywhere, can set up a payment service that sits on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-05 09:04:09
I hold some AM shares. I happen to disagree with you but I upvoted you because it looks like people who don't see you are trying to expound a logical argument also disagree with you but they think the way to express that is by voting you down.
Most of the things you've said are true, but AM have some advantages that most of those other companies lack:
- proven IC design competence
- low cost of manufacture
- low cost of operation
- operational excellence
- strong cashflow and balance sheet
- reputation as a company that meets or exceeds customer expectations
Most of the other contenders in the ASIC space have maybe 1 or 2 of those capabilities or qualities, but none of them have all 6.
I think the share price is maybe a tad high at the moment as yes the competition will get harder, but then again I'd feel foolish betting again friedcat. AM are taking in over $1million a week in profits at the moment. They very well know that there's hundreds of TH coming; they are also beautifully positioned to deal with it.
To turn your argument around, what could any of the companies you mentioned do that AM could not replicate, and do it cheaper and better?

With respect, the focus of 02a's question was on the ongoing rewards for mining (transaction fees v coins) not on whether Bitcoins are better or worse than banks and credit cards. My argument was that if Bitcoins are successful (which was implied in 02a's post) there will be enough people with an incentive to keep mining to keep it afloat.

So, perhaps someone who is a securities trader can explain this for me. 
Hypothetically, if the price of one of these shares goes higher or lower than the value of btc, it represents an arbitrage opportunity. So, would you expect the price of btc to stay in sync with these? Or is there some reason that arbitrage wouldn't apply here?

No offence taken.
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:06:14
I guessed you were (others who downvoted you probably didn't).
On a more serious note, the stability is a reflection of the fact that at any one time in bitcoin's history no-one expects the price to stay where it is for very long. I guess it would be an interesting bet to have on what will be the first year that bitcoin's high for the year is less than 200% of the low for the year. I really have no idea but I'd be surprised if it's before 2020.

Without giving away too much of your secret sauce, do you have some way of estimating how much of the market is working to a self-fulfilling prophecy? i.e., if enough people have the same information and invest based on the idea that the market 'should' correct at $138.2, that increases the chances of you being right?

I'm in a similar boat to you (Big single that cost me ~18btc). My back of the envelope calculation was that it would only be a bad investment if:
- I didn't receive it until after January 2014 (OK, I know that this isn't guaranteed NOT to happen :) ); AND
- the network hash rate reaches  1.8 PH/s or higher by January 2014 and grows at about 15% a month after that). It's difficult to credit that the hash rate will get so high if BFL continue to stumble on shipping, though.
OK, it's not a sure thing, but I'm comfortable with the risk/reward ratio. And the up-front cost isn't so over-the-top to be ruinous if it actually does fail.
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:19:34
True, but it's still done pretty well in BTC alone. The IPO was at 0.1BTC, it's hovering around 2.0BTC at the moment. 20-bagger in four months. IPO investors have already been paid more in dividends than their shares cost.

When you want to send some coins to someone, you will usually attach a fee to the transaction, so that it will be processed promptly. If you chose not to add a fee to the transaction, the miner might ignore it and it stays unconfirmed until another miner chooses to include it.
When the miner solves a block they add the new transactions they want to include to the blockchain and receive the fees for processing those transactions. Usually most of the reward they get is the fixed reward for finding the block (25 btc at the moment). The total transaction fees are usually well under 1 btc per block. However it is in the interest of the miner to include as many fees as they can in the block (after all it's free money) but at the moment it's not the primary motivation to mine. The large block reward early on in Bitcoin's life is part of the system that Satoshi thought up as a way of encouraging mining even when the transaction fees are low.
If bitcoin 'takes off', it is expected that the transaction fees will be much higher and will tend to dominate the reward. Therefore over time the block reward will drop, halving approximately every 3.5-4 years.
And yes, in mining the bigger the rig (or rigs), the better.

Their top-quality chips are producing around ~3.7.GH/s but the proportion of those is low. They have more chips at around the ~2.7GH/s level. If you get a 'regular' 5GH/s miner you get 2 chips ay ~2.7GH/s each, if you upgrade to 7GH/s for $100 extra you get 2 ~3.7GH/s chips.
I speculate *all* of their delays, at the root, are caused by chip issues. If the chips worked, board redesigns, firmware tweaks, etc would not be necessary.
The Jalapeno was supposed to be a 1 chip product, so they expected to have a plentiful supply of &gt;4.5GH/s chips. It appears that only their very best chips are ~3.7GH/s, they have more around ~2.7GH/s, and presumably they have a lot more that barely work or don't work at all.
Singles boards having 16 chip slots means that they need 16 chips working at ~3.125GH/s each to populate a 50GH/s miner. I don't think they're getting enough of those to make shipping Singles profitable yet.

The people who are underwater with mining are mostly those who paid several months in advance. The difficulty has risen quicker than most predicted.
People will keep mining, for the following reasons:
* if you've already got hardware and it's profitable to run (i.e., btc earned is more than cost of operation) there's no reason not to run it
* if you're an ASIC manufacturer you've got every reason to keep selling your chips while they're still worth something, so you will keep cutting prices to what the market will pay
If one ASIC maker could execute a 51% attack the value of bitcoin would drop, thereby making the attack self-harming. The only recent time it could have been done was earlier this year (ASICMiner) but they kept themselves to 30%. It seems that soon we will have three manufacturers with 28nm technology, so the chances of one of them doing a 51% attack are slim. Also, a 51% attack now would require about 3.6PH, which using the most power-efficient chips (0.6 W/GH) would require 2.16 MW of power. Getting that much power into a data centre and keeping everything cool is not a small undertaking. Plus, you'd have to be adding 30-40% to your data centre every 10-11 days.
