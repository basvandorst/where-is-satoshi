When your rates are low, yea you definitely want to join a pool. deepbit (deepbit.net) and slush are the big ones. I like deepbit right now. Your return rate is still just as trivial but you get to see small pieces come in much more frequently. Deepbit even has a mini tutorial to get you rolling in a few minutes of time.

Where did you read that? I didn't see it listed on the comparison page:   but I would love to double my output!

You don't need to compile the java clients. I am running the diablo miner just fine. Seriously, it took me about 20min to go from "what is a bitcoin?" to "I am making bitcoins from my macbook pro."
I have the latest high end 15" MBP (6750M) and it is pushing out ~38MH/s. not bad!  However, when you do the math, those numbers are still horrible. That gives me like 1 BTC every 5days about. That really isn't much.  A single ATI 5970 can push out 800MH/s which is 4-5 BTC per day. WAY better.

I logged in and submitted my info into the withdraw page within 10min of bitfloor posting the news on twitter. I am one of the sub $3k people. In theory, it's going to be faster and easier for me. At the time I submitted the info, I had a balance of $0 USD but a "pending" withdraw that had been that way since the bitfloor meltdown. 
At this very moment, my  page says "Your refund information is under review. Once reviewed, your refund will be sent to you electronically." and I suddenly have the balance of my longstanding "pending" transaction sitting as available USD balance. Bitfloor canceled all the longstanding pending transactions AFTER I submitted my info. Does that mean I will need to submit another withdraw request once my info has been reviewed? Who knows...

What kind of things can we do to help steer clear of being marked as high-risk? Obviously you can't give too much detail, else people may game the system... but there must be a few things legit users can do that would be extremely hard for a fraudulent person to do. 
For instance, I'm avoiding adding a credit card to my account because I don't plan on using one. Would that help my account though?

This was excellent! More people really need to see this. Since a 40min youtube is difficult for many to digest, here is the text from all of his slides in this presentation. This took me way too long but hopefully more will absorb this data as a result.
**Value Proposition**
■ Financial markets in the United States are the largest in the world. In 2011, finance and insurance represented 8.3% (or nearly $1.3 trillion) of U.S. gross domestic product. 
■ The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010.
■ Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. 
■ The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. 
■ Credit and debit card processing take half the profits of smaller stores. 
■ Fraud costs for credit card companies run up to 40%. 
■ Bank Bailout Total: $29.616 Trillion Dollars. 
**The Bitcoin Revolution**
■ Bitcoin is a revolutionary protocol for information synchronization. It can precisely and chronologically order all database entries and check their validity without any central authority. 
■ The database that this protocol keeps synchronized among peers all over the world is referred to as "the blockchain." 
■ The blockchain acts like a giant accounting ledger, allowing the storage and transmission of financial information. 
■ It is by no means limited to this sole function. 
■ It can serve as a worldwide public record, for many potential purposes, without the need of a central controlling authority. 
**The Present: Bitcoin as Money**
■ Bitcoin's blockchain is combined with simple encryption functions and database rules to provide people with ownership rights to a certain balance of numbers dubbed "coins." 
■ With the right private encryption key from a user of the database, one owner's balance, or partial balance of coins, can be sent to another user on the database. 
■ These database rules allow for a condition where multiple private encryption keys must be used to send a balance to another owner. 
■ This can provide escrow functions where two out of three parties have to agree to a transaction in order for it to take place. For example, the transaction of Bitcoins only takes place when either the buyer and merchant agree, the buyer and mediator agree, or the merchant and mediator agree. 
**The Present: Bitcoin as Money pt2**
■ The Bitcoin protocol does not care where these private encryption keys used to authorize transactions come from, so long as they are the correct keys for whatever particular transaction is being performed. 
■ This means that a program in the blockchain, called a script, which contains the correct private encryption keys, could be used to authorize a specific transaction. 
■ This feature would allow for things like sending a transaction of Bitcoins that will not be executed for a certain period of time, or will be executed on a certain date. 
■ By way of a script, pledges made in Bitcoin could automatically be delivered upon reaching a specific goal, facilitating the crowd funding of public goods, big or small. 
**The Present: Bitcoin as Money pt3**
■ More complex examples could involve scripts that check the Internet for a certain condition before authorizing a transaction. 
■ An inheritance could be fulfilled when a person's name appears in an online obituary. 
■ A promise of website availability by a website hosting company could be guaranteed by an automatic transaction of Bitcoins into customer wallet if there is a website failure. 
■ A reward could be automatically delivered upon the completion of some sort of online project. 
**The Present: Bitcoin as Secure Record Keeping**
■ The blockchain is a secure record keeping system that happens to be used for monetary transactions, but it can verify any kind of data whatsoever. 
■ One of the ways this could be useful is for time-stamping and verifying information, with or without revealing what that information is. 
■ For example, it could be used by journalists, for free, to ensure that there is an incontrovertible public record that they were the first to break a particular story, and it would also protect them from plagiarism. 
■ Here's a more complicated example: An inventor could use the blockchain to verify and time-stamp a digital fingerprint called a "hash" of a document describing their invention, for free. Using the digital fingerprint means that, even without revealing the invention publically at the time of its conception, the record in the blockchain could be used as proof of existence, if at some later point in time the origin of the invention was in question. 
**The Near Future: Bitcoin as Proof of Ownership**
■ Remember: The blockchain is a giant public record of ownership that's independently audited and verified by computers all over the world, with ownership rights secured by cryptography. 
■ One of the major projects underway in the Bitcoin community is called the "colored coins" project. 
■ The colored coins project would allow anyone to ''mark" a Bitcoin, or fraction of a Bitcoin, with ownership rights of ... well, anything! 
■ For example, if I sold you my house at 123 Lincoln Road, I could complete the transaction by sending you a Bitcoin that I uniquely marked with an ownership deed for that property, as in "This Bitcoin entitles its owner to the property of 123 Lincoln Road." 
■ This ownership transfer of 123 Lincoln Road will now be publically visible and auditable on Bitcoin's giant public record of ownership information, and will be like transferring a property deed without the need of lawyers or central authorities. 
**The Future: Bitcoin as a Decentralized Stock Exchange**
■ The colored coins project takes the application of the blockchain as a public record of ownership one step further. 
■ Imagine a company that marks or "colors" Bitcoins (or fractions of them) with proof of ownership in shares of that company. 
■ This would allow people to take full ownership of shares in companies they invest in, as opposed to having them physically or digitally stored with a third party. 
■ This would facilitate the purchasing, selling, or trading of shares without the need of intermediaries such as brokers or stock exchanges. The simple consequence of this is that it grants everyone in the world equal and free access to the stock market. 
■ An even more significant consequence would be that it could give individual entrepreneurs and small businesses equal access to public funding. A business of absolutely any size could have an IPO. 
**The Future: Bitcoin as a Decentralized Stock Exchange pt2**
■ Right now companies that wish to offer shares to the general public through a stock exchange incur an average cost of $3.7 million plus an underwriters fee of at least 5% of whatever their IP0 raises. 
■ This makes the ability to raise public funds extremely prohibitive for small and medium businesses, and a luxury only available to companies of a certain size and clout. 
■ For an artist, band, or a mom-and-pop shop, having equal access to the ability to offer shares to the public in order to raise money for new projects would 'pc invaluaole. 
■ Colored coins would make this possible, and support for it is already built into the Bitcoin protocol. 
■ It's just one programming project away to create online Bitcoin wallets that support colored coins (the "front-end," in programming lingo), and remove the need for stock exchanges, brokers, underwriters, and other barriers to entry involved in public finance.

People always tell you to never place a market order. Well, this is an example of why a market order would have been smart. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:21:27
I was almost certain that a large drop was going to come in the next couple days after we saw the 200 to 240 jump in half a day. I decided to sell all the BTC near the peak and put a buy order in for $200. $200 seemed like the correct price for where things should be today. In retrospect, I should have anticipated that things would drop way below the correct price and quickly rebound.  My 15% gain could have easily been 30% or more. 
That said, if you have money sitting around and waiting for the next bear trap... it probably isn't the best. Hasn't it been proven that you should just go in and simply hold for best returns?

same boat!
I'm happy to just be participating in it. I can say I was there in early 2011.

Definitely one of my favorite songs from ytcracker. Also the best song about bitcoin.  Fun fact: ytcracker gave a talk about bitcoin at DEF CON 21.

I have almost nothing so I haven't been heavily active for all the drops. Have the rest of you noticed the same pattern anytime there is a rapid drop? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:35:31
Then why did you call it a "market cooldown"?? 
Why are you being dishonest with your customers?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:35:59
I am definitely learning! I've been trying to play smaller dips over the last month. I've managed to lose about 20% of my starting BTC over the last 30 days. Only after today did I manage to FINALLY net a gain on my starting BTC amount. I'm not sure if I should keep playing or just hold though... it's so addicting to try and play!

Thank you! I just realized I was replying to the person who actually made the video. My post seems kind of silly now. 
Keep up the great work. I absolutely love the videos I've seen of yours over the years.

It's not even lag. They have been frozen at 82.0 Buy and 83.0 sell for the last 15min. What The Fuck?!  What I don't get is how the transactions below these numbers are actually occuring (
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:35:20
All I have to say is good luck trying to quickly dump $100m in BTC. mtgox would be able to keep up. The crappy mtgox infrastructure might actually be acting as a sort of safety net for rapid bitcoin drops/panic sells. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:35:19
I am seeing tons of transactions hitting in the upper 70's right now but mtgox seems frozen at an 83.00 sell price for the last several minutes. WTF??

And this is why I put a buy order in a hair above 200 YESTERDAY.
