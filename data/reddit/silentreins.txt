You can request a higher limit. Mine is 100k and I've never even put close to that amount into Coinbase

Don't forget to pay your taxes.. the government still controls the military and the guns. The government needs those tax dollars to hire policemen to protect the people..

I think the government is allowing cryptocurrencies to exist because they're monitoring the blockchain's growth and development and getting, essentially, free labor from the developers... Once it gets to a point where government can take over, they will step in.. With that being said, I'm still hodling.

I own some bitcoin but my brother is really against it. He believes it will crash and burn. The main reason is that it's not backed by anything or anyone and once the government creates their own coin (i.e. US Coin) then bitcoin will become obsolete. How would you respond to this?

1. Unlock phone
2. Click on camera
3. Take pic
4. Make sure it's a good pic
5. Open reddit
6. Upload pic
7. Bitcoin price drops
8. Take out a line of credit and buy more bitcoins

Isn't Alaska one of the more expensive places to mine bitcoin..?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:36:46
I don't know about that.. Maybe there are some things they don't want to announce? Maybe there are some things that only get announced by a leak from a CB employee? Maybe there are insider information we do not know about?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:39
Honestly, this is more of a test to the long time hodlers.. and here's my reasoning.
The new guys actually have an incentive to continue holding. They got into the crypto game to make money, not lose it. They're going to continue holding until they make their money back or profit.
The holders from 2016 and earlier could cash out now if they cant handle the pressure. They're already making a lot of money, just less than they would've made a week ago. This is not the same pressure as from 2 years ago. A LOT more money is involved..

From OP's presumption, Bitcoin will not reach $1m per coin by 2020. That means we will be watching a mukbang starring John McAfee.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:57:47
You went back in time to buy BTC at very low cost. You're hoarding all of it and because of this some of the rich guys like the Winklevoss twins, Chamath Palihapitiya and Tom lee don't have any Bitcoin they decide not to promote/advertise the coin. BTC hits 2 bucks in 2018. Reeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:42:42
Yeah I don't think so. Android pay, Apple pay and Samsung pay were supposed to eliminate credit cards. That didn't happen.

In the current market, \~$208B cap with 17,213,337 BTC (according to CMC), Bitcoin would go to 12k.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:38:35
Or they can accept it as a form of payment for goods or services.

You literally can't. There is a minimum amount you can buy on exchanges. Also nobody would sell you 1 cent worth because it costs way more than that in transfer fees. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:40:50
You are so wrong. Here's an example: 20 years ago you can go to a gas station or a corner store and buy a bag of chips for a dollar. Today it'll cost about $1.50 because of inflation. You are actually losing money if you're not investing it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:50:45
I HAVE INVESTED MORE THAN 10K IN BITCOIN AND I WILL CARE DEEPLY IF IT GOES TO ZERO
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:26:35
Funny if you lose the bet. You'll embarrass yourself, owe your dad a steak dinner and, adding insult to injury, lose money on your BTC investment. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:39:05
To be honest Bitcoin should be digital gold and seen as a scarce asset. It doesn't make sense to have a finite supply of a currency because the rich will just hoard it.
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:36:23
Actually Coinbase IS hiring.. or at least they're looking for accountants. I've seen some of their listings on indeed.

The one thing that Bitcoin hasn't been tested against, and I think this is huge, is a recession. The last recession ended in 2009, right before Bitcoin's inception..

Will they be refunding customer then?.. It's not an "accident" if they don't attempt to make it right
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:08:41
Honestly, no, I didn't. I haven't kept up with coinbase and didn't realize they were double, triple, 50x charging customers. I thought it was the coinbase exchange fee that was being overcharged. Sorry I made you upset.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:03:20
The chance is one in 10.
