Bank of America and Deutsche Bank are sister banks so you can use your VISA debit card at Deutsche bank ATMs almost fee free, great for getting euros for usd.
or maybe open a coin base account in Belgium, send btc to it and cash out in Euro?

Isn't it blatantly clear that Mark Kabelas took of with the digital booty????? No brainier that he is the culprit here and knows where the coinage is. It's under his control.

Government qualifies BTC as commodity. Sooooo yes you may write off losses just like you would with stock or
Gold or whatever. One question I'd have, does the wash sale rule apply meaning, let's say you traded bitcoin, made a grand profit after selling, then buy back in almost immediately (within 30 days) and it dropped hard and you lost thousands, do you first have to pay taxes on the grand profit you made and only then can deduct the loss? The answer is likely yes. Fuggged
Up huh? ;P

Kabelas used mtGOX deposits for operating silkroad?

This whole crash got kicked off right after the bitstamp hack. Those hackers DUMPED and started this huge sell off last few weeks.
Just my opinion.
