In case you were not aware the [United States government issued legal demands for ALL of Coinbase's user information](


Coinbase spent a lot of time and money in this legal battle, as well they should have, and ultimately the final results were [Coinbase handing over the account information for 14,000 higher volume customers]( Coinbase will let you know if they handed financial information to the US government or the IRS for a 1099-K.
Moreover, there many ways the US government could determine whether to send you letters or not, like your national or regional bank, or your ISP who can as of 2018 [now legally log (and sell) all your web traffic]( 
As far as I have seen there has not been any evidence these letters originated because of Coinbase. But most important of all is the fact that you should never keep your coins on Coinbase in the first place. That is literally rule

Good to know, thank you. I just started reading the Trezor documentation now.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:13:16
I guess I was confused from previous attempts to create my own wallets when I tried using Bitcoin Core or BitcoinQT. There are so many different avenues and so much information out there about wallets then figuring out which method is the best for your needs while also remaining secure can be a lot to take in. Granted if you are protecting thousands of dollars then people, myself included, really should do their research and the fact there is so much information is great; however, sometimes too many options and too much information can make it somewhat difficult to determine which steps you should actually take for first-timers.

Yes that's what my post is all about download Electrum and use that to store your BTC so you never have to worry about your account being backed or the exchange getting hacked or going under.

I was using Coinbase and I have never had any trouble with them but I had my account hacked once on MtGox then of course later when MtGox went under. For Coinbase I had also been using SMS 2FA which is now [not a secure method for 2FA]( so I have been using Google's Authenticator for 2FA but there is no way to back that up without rooting my phone which also leads to a bigger attack vector in regards to Android malware.
And besides all of that there's the thousands of other reasons to not keep my BTC on an exchange which really did have me worrying especially after everything I had been through already with BTC. I really like the idea of laminating the cards with my seed on it, I was also trying to figure out a method to keep my USBs secure for the long term but I guess that is why I have the CDs as well which are waterproof.

Tales has Electrum built in? That's pretty legit, and I feel you on wanting a completely sterile environment which is what I was aiming for initially and I think was part of what had held me back for so long from moving my BTC off an exchange.
But I feel you with some of the difficulty of Unix, I'm going through some of that right now trying to get a VirtualBox RHEL 7 distro to keep a static IP. Not bitcoin related though.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:36:52
I think some straight forward instructions like your post for noobs could be very beneficial on the "Security guide for bitcoins" or "FAQ" section on the side bar for r/bitcoin. I think I took a wrong turn when I was looking at the sidebar "Getting Started" which takes you to bitcoin.org then clicking to "Choose your wallet" which you then have to start doing research all the different wallets and options and all that good stuff. 
Thanks for your post!

A high paying job with little expenses. I just bought a house but before for 5 years I was living in a nice 2,800 sq foot home with three other friends, I had the master bedroom and my rent was only $700. Gf paid for my portion of the bills since I was paying for rent. It gave me the ability to invest at least $1k per month in BTC and save an extra $1k per month so I could hit a 20% down payment on a house and avoid PMI. I'm a software developer in Texas. Having little expenses is key though, I have friends that make a lot more but spend like $2k on rent alone which means a lot less cash available to invest. An SO who is down for a more low-key lifestyle who can also carry her own weight financially is beneficial as well.

Everybody likes to hate on Coinbase for some reason and I have never understood it. They are easily the largest and most legit US based exchange. You are going to hear about more users involving Coinbase simply because of the number of users they have. They are hardly perfect but I think the disdain for them is a way overblown circle jerk. Gemini is fairly new on the scene yet have such a high approval rating here, they simply don't have the volume of users or history for me to personally vouch for them over Coinbase.
People here used to praise Circle despite their CEO having a retarded understanding of bitcoin's future and vision. Next thing you know Circle's CEO completely turned his back on the community. The Coinbase CEO has done a fantastic job with representing bitcoin but just because he was on the wrong side of the fork for some time some users go out of their way to trash Coinbase. 
I do like Gemini being on the scene more competition and options is always a good thing and it will continue to raise the bar and push development and further innovation for all of us. But Coinbase is not some shit exchange like many in this community believe it is.

Pretty much not really saying it's a secret that was more of a tongue in cheek comment. But wait for an alt coin to be pumped then immediately buy and sell as soon as it starts dropping.
My bot is pretty basic but I'm making about 4 BTC every 10 days starting with just one BTC for each trade. I'm working on better signals since I could be doing a lot better, only 1/3 of my trades result in a profit right now but when I hit it I hit it big.

I'm so fucking happy that my home loan company wasn't competent enough to figure out Bitcoin I was going to sell them last October as part of my down payment. My loan officer told me they could do but it was going to be a lot of work on their end since nobody had ever as used BTC when providing proof of account statements.  I ended up selling my non dividend paying stocks instead.

Renting for $715 you are probably able to continue investing heavily into BTC. Once you buy a home your ability to invest in alternate investments without making a large risk in future becomes more difficult. That is not to say with BTC it would not have been worth it, but is the same true of cryptocurrencies over the next 5, 10, or 20 years?

I am in a similar boat. My BMW was totalled by a recent hail storm. I have a Tesla Model 3 pre-ordered and I need a car to get me through the next year. I am going to invest the entire check I receive into bitcoin and take out a loan on a cheap $10k car.
I could sell my BTC and buy a nice car but material items, especially highly depreciating assets, would have too much of an opportunity cost compared with allowing an albiet risky investment to grow.

Offline signed transactions is the opposite of a hot wallet
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:10:14
\&gt;  Therefore the private key has to be exposed on a machine connected to the internet. 
1000% not true at all, there's offline transaction signing which I have no proof of but is probably what every large exchange uses. That transaction is then probably sent over another local network device that acts as an intermediary to broadcast the transaction.
