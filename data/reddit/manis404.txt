I agree 100% with what you are saying w.r.t the currency aspect. But I still expect returns from investing in BTC -  you should check out youtube where people bought lambos and paid out their mortgages by using their BTC profits. How would you explain that?

no it will rise to 100-500k definitely this year. It's not a good time right now

I bought bitcoin to make profits, the USD is working fine for me.

Bitcoin will not fail, McAfee (a leading crypto-currency specialist) says so.

Why is the price tanking then? I don't understand the contradictory conclusions of the article. I bought bitcoin at 19K USD now it's at 8K.

But don't you realise that investors need a return on their investment as well? This makes no sense

This is the result of purely organic user behaviors. The exchanges definitely did NOT hire a memetics company to post these.

bitcoin will be one million by 2020, mcafee said so. He founded an antivirus company and therefore knows quite a lot about crypography(and by extension, crypto). (McAfee the person, not the product, you should look him up)

mcafee (who is a leading cryptocurrency specialist) predicted it could be even higher. I think 500k by end of 2019 is very likely

Bitcoin will kill the big banks and evil corporations and corrupt central governments. We all need to BUY MORE and  Whats important is the fact that 1 BTC will always be equal to 1 BTC

Anytime you need to convert BTC to local currency, the shovel sellers(exchanges) will charge a fee. In the model you describe, you are just shifting the fees from the banks to the exchanges.
