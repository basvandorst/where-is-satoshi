Any hardware wallet is more secure than Electrum because the private keys to your bitcoin are stored offline in the hardware wallet where malware cannot get to them. Once you use and are comfortable with a hardware wallet you will never go back to desktop wallets. Trezor has always been a good choice, I have used them for years. Ledger is the main competition to Trezor, and they started shipping the [Ledger Nano S]( last week. Less expensive than Trezor and also stores Ether and Ether Classic. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 22:47:40
Given how slow progress on SegWit has been I would not expect Core to allow signing by hardware wallets any time soon but progress is always good to see. I have been using Trezors since introduction but I do like the Nano S very much. I use Nano S every day and all that I miss is the ability to use passphrases. Android support would also be nice to have not critical though. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:43:29
Just say [no to paper wallets](
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:49:12
Please read the section on [security threats]( from the Trezor user manual. KeepKey was built using Trezor firmware so same applies. Nano S uses a secure element rather than a microprocessor. Hacking a company is not the same as hacking a device directly. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:28:07
Not really competition to Trezor or even Nano S

You were given a seed to write down, that is what you use to restore your wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:51:09
Yes, and Armory used for cold storage with two computers, one offline, is no more secure than Ledger or Trezor. It is perhaps more private since you have to run a full node to use Armory. Since Trezor switched to BitPay Bitcore it is almost as private as Armory as you can choose to use the localbitcoins bitcore server with Trezor.

Trezorwallet.co is hosted at NameCheap in US. I have seen at least half a dozen cloned phishing sites on NameCheap this year, because NameCheap ignores takedown requests.

Mycelium works really well with Trezor passphrase protected accounts. Also recommend you install the Trezor Manager app from the Play Store. That way you can completely manage your Trezor from your phone. The only hiccup you may have to deal with is finding a short cable with a USB C male connector for the newer phones. [Here is a link]( to one on Amazon. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:44:54
KeepKey is a Trezor clone, so I would go with the original rather than the imitator. If you have Ether as well as Bitcoin the Ledger Nano S is what you need. Nano S is also 2/3 cost of Trezor. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:45:47
Electrum is the most versatile desktop SPV wallet. It comes in a portable version you can carry on a usb drive and supports all the common hardware wallets. Hard to go wrong with Electrum. Multibit HD is limited compared to Electrum (it was bought by KeepKey.)
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:41:11
I have been using Trezors for years and recently also started using Nano S. Entering the PIN is not the hassle you make it out to be. I find Nano S very easy to use. Main drawback is that the Nano S does not support passphrases yet. But if you need a hardware wallet for Ether it is the cat's ass. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:35:42
Armory is a good choice if you want to run a full node and use two computers to set up Armory for cold storage. This is how we all stored bitcoin securely until Trezor came out. Still popular with some die hard fans but most have moved to Trezor and Ledger. Much simpler to use and just as secure.

At $1395 for the miner plus $240 for the power supply at current bitcoin price you would need more than two to three years to return your investment. 
If price were to come down the numbers look better but you would still need bitcoin price to rise significantly to earn your money back. I think the miner and power supply should be sold together for $1000 to $1100. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:12:04
Trezor will work with Mycelium on your phone using type c connector. You are using Nexus right? You just have to buy the right cable. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:16:36
This review is already out of date because the author reviewed the Nano instead of the new Ledger Nano S. Nano S does not need a security card and is immune to keyloggers. It also asks you to confirm the address sent to on a screen on the Nano S. The Nano S is a big step forward from the older Nano. Trezor is still the most versatile wallet at the moment if you need passphrase protection and do not need to store Ether. 
However if you need bitcoin, ether and ether classic cold storage you need the new Ledger Nano S. The only features Nano S lacks compared to Trezor are 1) ability to protect your seed with a passphrase and 2) Nano S does not work with Android yet. Both features are planned to be implemented soon. Nano S uses different derivation paths for ETH and ETC so no danger of replay attacks. 
KeepKey is a Trezor clone. I think if you like the way Trezor works buy the original. Nano S is the least expensive of the three at about $65. You can also read a [recent review]( of the Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:20:13
The new Ledger Nano S addresses and fixes all of the problems you mentioned the original Nano had. Other than the fact that passphrases are not enabled yet (will be with a firmware update) the Nano S is the first product from Ledger that really is a serious competitor to Trezor. It is what the company should have come out with to begin with. Good things take time maybe? 
@_date: 2016-08-10 22:07:04

Ledger Nano S does not currently work with any phone app and does not support the use of passphrases yet sorry.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:52:24
Use a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S. For $65 no one can steal your bitcoin, just store your seed phrase securely. It also comes with a nice leash so you can carry it around your neck. Hard to lose that.

AFAIK you can only write off $3000 per year against normal income and unused rolls over. If you have a $10000 capital loss it would take you four years to write it off unless you have long term capital gains greater than your loss. If you have a large loss you may have to carry it until you have capital gains to offset it, say if you sold your house. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:00:57
That changed with the introduction of the [Ledger Nano S]( Works for bitcoin, ether and ether classic and your seed is never leaked to the host computer when restoring. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:09:55
Trezor can be used with Mycelium on your phone and supports passphrase protected accounts. It also works with more wallets than Nano S at the moment. Nano S is a good alternative though if you hold Ether. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 21:13:44
are there any security concerns using Trezor Manager with Mycelium on a rooted phone? I do not root my Nexus but am curious if rooting could cause a potential problem. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:56:35
Yeah, keep bitcoin you are not using in a good hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor. If you have Android Marshmallow probably the most secure wallet for your phone is Breadwallet, already there on iPhone.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:04:11
No local bitcoin wallet is 100% secure. Bitcoin malware can steal passwords through keylogging. You can buy a bitcoin and ether hardware wallet from Ledger for $65 and never worry about bitcoin (or ether) theft again. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 18:55:38
KeepKey is not plug and play with Electrum like Trezor. See [this article]( at the support desk.

Not if you are using a Trezor. You did good. Just store your seed safely and get a spare Trezor, if you lose or break your present Trezor you can recover to the spare. If you are not using a passphrase to encrypt your seed consider doing so. 
A Trezor with PIN and passphrase enabled is very secure. If your seed was stolen it would be worthless without the passphrase you have memorized.

Bitcoin can not just disappear from your Trezor no one has ever had bitcoin stolen while using a Trezor. If a thief got access to your seed he could setup the seed on a new Trezor and move your bitcoin so keep that 24 word seed safe.
Bitcoins are not stored in your Trezor but on the bitcoin blockchain (actually transaction information.) The Trezor is a device to securely manage the private keys for your bitcoin addresses, to easily send and receive bitcoin securely and prevent theft.
The 24 word seed you wrote down when you initialized your Trezor is all you need to recover access to your bitcoin if you lose the Trezor or it breaks. 
If you lose that recovery seed you need to buy a new Trezor, set it up and send bitcoin from the old Trezor to the new one you have the seed for. Store the 24 words in order in a safe place. If you have not already, read through the Trezor [user manual]( so you really understand how your Trezor works.

GPU bitcoin mining is dead since specialized ASICs for mining bitcoin were developed and mining difficulty has skyrocketed. To mine one bitcoin in a month you would need four Antminer S9 bitcoin miners. Cost with power supplies would be about $6800. Then you have to consider power cost and noise. There are some colocation centers in China which would charge you about $180 a month to host those four miners and cover power cost.

If you place a limit order on GDAX you may get a better price than at Coinbase. Paper wallets are best left to veterans who know how to avoid making a [mistake]( with the change. I really think hardware wallets are the better choice for new users. If you are going to use a Trezor or Ledger Nano S buy two of them in case you lose it or it breaks. You can immediately restore your hardware wallet as long as you have the seed. Suggest you read the Trezor [user manual]( it will answer all your questions.

Electrum is easier to use when starting out if you do not enable 2FA and just protect your wallet with a password. You can read the Electrum user manual [here]( I think 2FA multisig wallets are not for beginners.

Paper wallets are safe if you use them the right way. Make one offline, load with bitcoin and store in a save place. They should be considered single use. When you need to spend the bitcoin sweep the private key into a good wallet like Electrum. Hardware wallets are designed to not only store bitcoin but make it easy to use those bitcoin while maintaining a high degree of security. For someone with more than one bitcoin who actually spends bitcoin frequently a hardware wallet is extremely secure and convenient.

I also own a KeepKey but use my Trezor instead. Why? KeepKey is a fork of Trezor and both have the same security weakness: anyone who gets your seed can steal your bitcoin. It is a function of the way both wallets work. So obviously you need to securely store your seed. Trezor offers the option to protect wallets with a passphrase. If you create a passphrase protected wallet on a Trezor to gain access you enter your PIN then your passphrase. Any thief who steals your Trezor seed gains nothing because he does not have the passphrase.
KeepKey refuses to offer passphrase protection for wallets using the Chrome KeepKey proxy. If you want to use passphrase protected wallets with your KeepKey you are limited to Electrum and the [process to install]( the dependencies required is a complete pain. Customers should demand KeepKey enable the passphrase option on Chrome or vote with their bitcoin by buying a Trezor. KeepKey is handsome but at this time Trezor is the better hardware wallet.

Use a better wallet that calculates dynamic fees correctly. Electrum has a slider that lets you set fee to High. Has never failed to send a transaction for me with a fee that gets the transaction confirmed in one block. You have been around bitcoin for a while graduate from blockchain to a better wallet like Electrum. Trezor also lets you use a high fee and automatically calculates the best fee for you. Post your transaction ID and someone will push your tx for you.

Buying and leaving your first bitcoin at Coinbase is safe enough. Long term though you would want to take possession of the private keys yourself. 
There is a good series on how to [understand bitcoin]( at CoinDesk you should go through until you understand what private and public keys are, how wallets work and how to manage fees.
Electrum is a very good wallet that is even more secure when you use a hardware wallet like Trezor to store your private keys. One step at a time though. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:43:41
The key to mining bitcoin and returning your investment in the shortest period of time is to keep fees as low as possible. Pennies count! Genesis Mining charges $0.35 per TH per day which means an investment there will never ROI. Your best bet is to buy a miner and have it hosted in a colocation center with cheap power in China like SinoHash. If you do not want to go to that trouble ViaBTC has the lowest fees for cloud mining about $0.16 per TH per day. You would make about 10% less bitcoin per day there compared to having an S9 at SinoHash. But you would not have to manage a miner.

Electrum versions below 2.0 should not be used any more as they sign transactions High S; also the wallet file format has changed. You can do CPFP with latest Electrum but that would be a separate transaction from sweeping the private key.

I own or have evaluated all the bitcoin hardware wallets on the market you can buy right now. For a first time user I recommend Trezor for a couple of reasons. It is the only hardware wallet you will ever have to buy. It works with Mycelium on your Android phone. It is very easy to use and affordable at $99. If you get started right using cold storage on a Trezor you will never lose bitcoin to malware. Read the Trezor [instruction manual]( to help decide if Trezor is right for you. There are competitors but none under $100 have all the features Trezor does. KeepKey in particular is missing a security option that Trezor has had since it was introduced two years ago. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 23:57:28
To answer your question KeepKey originally advertised on their website that passphrase protection of the seed was a feature in the Chrome extension. See [WayBack Machine]( for confirmation. When I ordered my KeepKey for $239 I expected to be able to set a passphrase using Chrome and was not. I have an email from KeepKey support stating that the FAQ was wrong, they just had not bothered to change it. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:44:43

You are aware that KeepKey only supports passphrase (hidden) wallets on Electrum 2.6.3 and not the Chrome proxy? Trezor allows you to create passphrase protected wallets on the Chrome Trezor extension using myTrezor.com, and you can access those same protected wallets easily on Electrum or Mycelium on your Android phone. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:31:28
Proper cold storage using Electrum or Armory requires two computers, one always kept offline. Your wallet is on the offline computer and the watch only component is on your other online computer. It is as secure as a hardware wallet but more expensive and certainly less convenient. Usually only used by die hard Armory supporters who keep hoping Armory will eventually support Trezor:)

Price is the same now, but KeepKey used to be $239. Trezor offers you more options than KeepKey. It works with more wallets, also with Mycelium on Android, and allows you to create passphrase protected wallets. The only other hardware wallet that allows passphrase (hidden) wallets is BitLox which is more expensive at $199. Trezor has also been on the market for two years now so is a well proven product. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:51:40
I wish someone would sticky this. If you are using Electrum 2.7.18 enable dynamic fees and replace by fee. When you send set the fee slider to high and also put a check in the box marked replaceable. If for some reason your transaction does not confirm in a reasonable amount of time just click on it and bump the fee up. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:41:38
You can do better. The lack of a screen on Ledger HW.1 and Nano compromises security. Ledger Blue is promising but not shipping yet. 
Trezor is more secure than Ledger. What many do not know is that KeepKey is actually slightly more secure than Trezor due to the improved recovery process KeepKey uses. See the reddit post at  for a more detailed comparison of hardware wallets.
I expect Trezor will update their firmware to make their recovery process equal in security to KeepKey though.

Most complaints here come from blockchain.info users. There is nothing wrong with the latest version of Electrum.

Combine Electrum with Ledger Nano S or Trezor and you have a state of the art bitcoin wallet.

You have obviously never used a Trezor or any hardware wallet. I use one every day and can affirm that it is fast to use both with a wallet on my laptop and Mycelium on Android phone. Very convenient. You can step on your Trezor and smash it to bits, then recover from seed on a spare Trezor. Trezor owners love them and many buy a spare in case of loss. Of course the seed has to be saved securely as with any hardware wallet. I have yet to find anyone posting 'I hate my Trezor and wasted my money'.

Stay away from Genesis Mining. Their fees are $0.35 per day per TH/s which are the highest in the industry. They rely on slick advertising and affiliates to lure in new customers. You will never break even.
The hosted (cloud mining) provider with the lowest fee is ViaBTC at $0.16 per TH/s per day. Second place is HaoBTC at $0.17. The advantage of HaoBTC is they have an exchange so you can sell your hashpower any time you want. If you buy at ViaBTC you can not sell. 
From personal experience ViaBTC will give you the highest return per day, more than HaoBTC. So if you have 0.16 bitcoin to buy one TH give ViaBTC a try. Or not, your call. Just please stay away from Genesis Mining.

Go to the [Alloscomp]( calculator and you will find that right now that $1950 investment will earn you $252 the first month before fees. Genesis Mining [charges]( $0.30 per TH/s per day in fees so deduct $135 monthly. That leaves you with $117 per month in earnings. 
So at least 17 months to earn back your investment at current bitcoin price. Problem is the mining difficulty goes up and as time goes by you will be earning less per day while fees stay the same. If bitcoin price stays at current level expect about two years to earn your investment back. And once you buy at Genesis Mining you can not sell your hash power. 
When you buy mining power at Genesis Mining they keep more than half the mining income. You are actually helping them offset their capital cost for miners. It is a win win for them, not so much for you. If you believe bitcoin price will rise you are better off just taking that two grand and buying and holding bitcoin. When you sell that bitcoin for a profit down the road you get to keep it all.

Well Trezor switched from 12 words to 24 just to increase security if you had to recover the seed to a new Trezor. Up to you if you want to buy a new Trezor, set it up with 24 words (the only option now) and send your bitcoin from the old to the new Trezor. Everyone needs a spare Trezor by the way, I had one that was less than a year old fail on me.

In order to use a 12 word seed securely I think Trezor would have to use the rotating cipher KeepKey does, and that may be hard to implement on the small screen. Most Trezor users prefer the compact size of Trezor and a 24 word seed is not a drawback.

There was a big jump in security between Lollipop and Marshmallow on Android with the new phones providing encrypted hardware storage which iPhone has always had. Breadwallet uses that hardware storage on your Android phone while Mycelium does not. I would feel safe keeping 5 bitcoin on an encrypted Pixel using Breadwallet, not at all with vanilla Mycelium. Do realize that you can use Mycelium very securely by using a Nano S or Trezor to sign transactions since the private keys are kept off the phone.

Breadwallet uses hardware encrypted storage on iPhone and the private keys are stored on your phone so it is probably the most secure way to hold bitcoin short of a Trezor. Something to remember is the seed phrase you write down when you create a Breadwallet is not compatible with any other wallet. Very easy to use. Most folks who use Trezors have Mycelium on their Android phones as there is no iPhone wallet that works with Trezor yet.

Genesis Mining is a legitimate company but they are in business to make money for the owners while the customers get the scraps. Their fee for bitcoin hosted mining is $0.35 per day per TH/s which is the highest on the market and twice what some of the competition like HaoBTC charge for 150 W HashEx hosted mining. Also once you own hashing power at Genesis Mining you are stuck and can not sell it. At HaoBTC there is an internal exchange where you can sell your hash. Sorry for your mistake but you picked just about the worst place to buy bitcoin hosted mining. Some research would reveal alternates like HaoBTC, Hashnest, ViaBTC and POW88.

Putting a wallet.dat on dropbox, even with a password, is not secure. Using a Veracrypt container for the wallet.dat is better but you are still taking a rather large chance of being hacked and losing your bitcoin. The safest method for most users combining security with convenience is a hardware wallet like Trezor. Just don't do something insecure like storing your seed online. Write it on paper and store securely, a lockbox for example. You can gain an extra layer of security with Trezor using a password protected account with a password you keep in memory. The downside is if you forget that password your bitcoin are gone, really gone.
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:45:17
Yes with Breadwallet if your phone was lost you must recover the seed to a new Breadwallet. Since you already are using a Trezor you should keep your bitcoin there and transfer bitcoin to your phone wallet as needed. If you had an Android phone you could use the Trezor to sign transactions created in Mycelium wallet. That is the best mobile security you can have. You would have to carry a short OTG cable with you. Maybe time to switch from iPhone to Android? New Google Pixel is a great phone. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 03:38:15
No. Breadwallet gets downvoted because you have to have an Android phone running Marshmallow or Nougat to use it. It stores your private keys in hardware protected storage. Mycelium does not. Breadwallet is arguably the most secure way to store your bitcoin on a phone. The only setup more secure would be to use a Ledger Nano S or Trezor with Mycelium, but that would require you to carry the hardware wallet and an OTG cable.

One thing bitcoin holders could do is to buy hosted mining only at companies that support SegWit. Most cloud mining providers charge outrageous fees (Genesis Mining.) I realize the better option is to run a miner yourself and point to a pool using Bitcoin Core 13.1.
The problem is there are only a few companies that have low maintenance fees for hosted mining and none of them are signaling for Segwit yet: HaoBTC, Hashnest, POW88, ViaBTC and BW.com.
You could write those companies and let them know you will not buy hosted mining until they support SegWit.

If you want maximum security for your bitcoin while still being able to make transactions just buy bitcoin and send to a receiving address on a Trezor or Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. When you first set up your hardware wallet you are given a 24 word seed in order to write down. Not save online. Keep a copy of your seed in your safe deposit box. You can add an additional layer of security to your seed by using a passphrase. Read the Trezor [user manual]( to see if this works for you. 
Because the seed is all you need to recover all your bitcoin if your hardware wallet is lost or malfunctions safe storage is a must. Most users buy a spare hardware wallet in case of loss.

There is no bitcoin miner under $500 that would ever return your investment. The Antminer S9 is the most efficient miner you can buy but would cost you $1500 with power supply and is too noisy to be used at home. Also to return your investment in a reasonable period of time you would need power cost under $0.05 per kWh.
Really you already have the right idea buying bitcoin every month. 
If you have to scratch that mining itch sign up for an account at Bitmain Hashnest and buy $50 worth of S7 (not S9) hosted mining. You can sell at any time on the internal exchange Hashnest runs. Believe it or not, the S7 hash is more profitable than S9 at the moment.

Using a hardware wallet is one of the safest ways to secure your bitcoin. No one who uses a Trezor has even had their bitcoin stolen. 
Trezor can solve your problem but like any other technology you need to understand it before jumping in. Read the Trezor [user manual]( to see if Trezor is the right fit for you. All your questions are answered in the manual. 
Yes your 24 word seed is in essence your bitcoin and you have to protect it. If you lost your Trezor you just take your spare and recover your seed to it. 
There are advanced options explained in the user manual where you learn how to protect your seed with a passphrase. 
Read the manual, get a Trezor and set it up following the instructions. Then just transfer a small amount of bitcoin from Coinbase to your new Trezor a few times until you are comfortable with it. Then you can transfer the balance.
No one has ever had bitcoin stolen from Coinbase due to a hack but there is always a first time. They do offer a more secure Vault but why not do it yourself with a Trezor.

Interesting concept updated from the way we used to do cold storage with two computers using Armory or Electrum, one computer always offline for signing transactions. I would be concerned that users will not use a strong random password for the persistent volume. Also cumbersome to use compared to a hardware wallet like Nano S where one only needs to keep the seed safely stored away and memorize a simple PIN. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:58:07
Paper wallets are promoted to newcomers as cheap and secure when really use should be limited to bitcoin veterans who understand sweeping, change addresses, etc. There is much less chance of making an expensive mistake just starting out right with a Nano S or Trezor. You do need to save the seed phrase on paper so in effect you do have a "paper wallet".

If you are going to use Coinbase remember you are also automatically registered at their GDAX.com exchange. Advantage of using GDAX is ability to place limit and market orders and you can receive your bitcoin right away. Downside is you have to transfer fiat to GDAX before you can trade, takes a few days. If you do not want to use Coinbase or GDAX Gemini is a good option.

From a privacy standpoint reusing addresses is really bad. Someone who has your address can see your past and future transactions making yourself identifiable. Bringing Coinbase into the mix creates a problem where your bitcoin addresses are linked to your identity.  Actually using more than one address in the same account on your Trezor gives Coinbase more information. If you like sending direct from Coinbase to your Trezor just create a [new account]( you use only for receiving bitcoin sent from Coinbase. You can just use one address in that separate account. Remember if you ever spend bitcoin from that account that Coinbase has a record of the coins. Kudos on using a hardware wallet btw.

I have experience with both. KeepKey is simple to use with the Chrome extension and much less so with Electrum. Directions for using KeepKey with Electrum are provided at the KeepKey support desk. Not plug and play like Trezor is with Electrum but manageable.
If you browse the support desk you might wonder why go to the trouble of installing the python client just to use Electrum? Well the reason is password protection of the seed is disabled in the Chrome extension or when using KeepKey with Multibit. Like Trezor the private keys in KeepKey could potentially be extracted by an adversary unless protected with a passphrase. 
If you are going to use a Trezor or KeepKey it makes sense personally to use a passphrase to encrypt your seed. A PIN alone is not sufficient protection in my opinion. Your mileage may vary.
If you feel safe using a hardware wallet without the added protection of a passphrase you can use either Trezor or KeepKey. The Trezor user manual explains in depth the pros and cons of using a passphrase protected seed. Trezor has the better user documentation and has been around longer which is a plus. Customer service from both companies is very good.
Trezor is compatible with more wallets than KeepKey and also works with Mycelium on Android if that is important to you. They have a new password manager also. 
KeepKey has a slight edge over Trezor on security when recovering from seed but not enough to convince me to abandon using my Trezors. My personal preference is for Trezor.

Breadwallet is a good secure smartphone wallet. It has two problems you should be aware of. One, it can be slow to sync, sometimes taking a few minutes. Two, you can not restore the Breadwallet seed to a different wallet. The derivation path is unique to Breadwallet. That might concern you, might not.
Getting your bitcoin off of Coinbase is smart. Not that I am aware of any thefts from Coinbase, but because you only own the bitcoin if you have possession of the private keys. If you keep bitcoin at Coinbase or an exchange you have an IOU.
Really though if you are going to own more than one bitcoin consider a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor, both of which work with Mycelium on Android.

Blockchain.info has a taint analysis tool on their website that allows you to check if mixed coins can be traced back to an address you control. If mixed coins have zero percent taint compared to coins you sent to the mixing service the transaction trail is broken.

Also use a new address whenever you receive a payment.

IMO paper wallets are really best left to bitcoin veterans who understand the limitations. Otherwise you might reveal your private key when spending or make an error with the change.

HaoBTC hosted bitcoin mining is legit but you might want to also take a look at ViaBTC. Both are respected in China and neither are scams or ponzis. ViaBTC is a mining pool first who added hosted mining while HaoBTC started mining before adding services. 
I own both and ViaBTC consistently pays out .00005 to .000054 more bitcoin daily per TH/s than HaoBTC. That could cut a month off ROI, not insignificant. 
The advantage to HaoBTC [HashEx]( is the exchange which [ViaBTC]( does not have yet. I don't consider either a great investment but can be fun if you only buy a few TH. Better to buy and hold bitcoin I think.

Bitcoin cloud mining at Genesis Mining will take years to ROI due to the very high fees charged at $0.35/TH/day. That means over half the daily mining proceeds go to Genesis Mining in fees. Not a good deal. 
If you have to buy hosted bitcoin mining look for low fees at $0.16/TH/day at Chinese providers like HaoBTC or ViaBTC. Even Hashnest S9 is a better deal than Genesis Mining. 
Another thing to consider is that once you buy hashing power at Genesis Mining you are stuck with it, cannot sell like you can with HaoBTC or Hashnest.

Even though miners make the decision on SegWit every 0.13.1 node counted at bitnodes makes a difference in public perception.

There are always scams in bitcoin and cloud (hosted) bitcoin mining has seen its share. However calling all hosted mining a scam is just wrong. 
There are legitimate companies like HaoBTC and Hashnest that are well established that sell hosted bitcoin mining. More important, they have exchanges on their sites that allow you to sell hashing power at any time. 
Taking HaoBTC as an example you can buy 1 TH/s of [Hash-Ex]( bitcoin mining for 0.1811 bitcoin on their exchange. It might take a year for your investment to be returned depending on price of bitcoin. 
You don't have to keep your mining power that long. You can sell any time you want. For new investors to bitcoin who want to experience mining without the headaches of running a miner at home this is a legit solution. 
Unless you have power cost under 5 cents per kWh you cannot compete with the Chinese miners, who have very cheap power available to them. 
For the mining power backed by 150 W/TH miners HaoBTC charges daily fees of $0.17 per TH/s. Compare to Genesis Mining which charges $0.35 and has no exchange to sell your mining power. 
OP if you want to try bitcoin cloud mining put in a small investment at HaoBTC or Hashnest and see how you like it. Personally I prefer HaoBTC at this time for better daily payouts.

Armory is a wallet that works on top of Bitcoin Core and used to be very popular as they were the first to enable convenient cold storage. If you call having to use two computers convenient. 
Once Trezor came out Armory started falling from favour but some die hard fans still use it even though only a couple of developers maintain it. 
There are some privacy advantages to running your own full node over an SPV wallet like Electrum.

Breadwallet on Android is not handling fees as well as Electrum or Samourai. I find consistently that fees are significantly higher with Breadwallet. And Breadwallet does not do RBF like Electrum. But for iOS you are stuck with Breadwallet. However you are not stuck with using bits: at the top of the 'local currency' screen you can swipe left or right to change to bitcoin.

Too complicated and not bullet proof sorry. At some point your unencrypted private keys will be exposed to malware when you make a transaction. If you like to use Electrum portable you would be better off using a hardware wallet like Trezor with Electrum to store your private keys.

Breadwallet IMO does not do a good job with fees. Electrum is very good. The Android version has all the features of the desktop except hardware wallet support. It does a very good job with fees and you can send transactions replaceable just in case. Samourai is also very good but still in development so a little buggy (hangs once in a while.)

Bitcoin has had safe offline wallets for years. Both Armory and Electrum provide for cold storage using an offline computer to store your private keys and sign transactions. If you have two computers you can set it up yourself. However if you have ever used Armory for cold storage you know how tedious it can be to send bitcoin routinely. That is why bitcoin hardware wallets like Trezor have become popular. Trezor is just as secure as Armory or Electrum cold storage. Less private though but most users are willing to accept that tradeoff. There is a new bitcoin hardware wallet now available called BitLox that looks to be as secure as Trezor but more private.

If you don't trust Trezor or Ledger just go back to cold storage using two computers with Armory or Electrum. 
That is how everyone did it before Trezor came on the scene in 2014. Well, everyone except the paper wallet fanboys.
You have to dedicate one computer always kept offline for signing transactions shuffled between that offline computer and the online watching only wallet via USB drive.

The reason you use a hardware wallet in the first place is security, which you ruined by entering your seed into a phone.  
Probably browser support as mentioned. Instead of going to and asking for help you entered your seed on a phone which means every bitcoin address generated from that seed is possibly compromised. 
Once you get your bitcoin you should send to a temporary wallet like Electrum along with any balance on that Nano, then wipe the Nano. Initialize again to get a new seed and keep that seed offline. Then send your bitcoin to an address in the Nano from the new seed.

The passphrase (password) can be considered the 25th word of your 24 word recovery seed. If you have bitcoin in a password protected account you can restore your Trezor from the 24 word seed just fine. Your bitcoin will still be in the account protected by the password after recovery. Just read the manual and try for yourself. The folks at Trezor spent a lot of time writing a very complete user manual that should answer any questions.

When using a Trezor after entering the PIN if you have passphrase protection turned on your wallet presents a screen asking you to enter a passphrase. If you do not enter a passphrase and hit enter you go to your default account. If you use a passphrase you enter a hidden account. You can have more than one passphrase protected account if you want. 
If you are using a passphrase you can safely remember (it should never be written down) you could leave a copy of your seed with a friend, because your bitcoin are in an account no one can enter without the passphrase. The downside is if you forget the passphrase your bitcoins are gone.
Trezor has been around the longest so it is to be expected it has the most features in terms of wallets supported, hidden accounts, Android integration with Mycelium for example. Ledger is catching up though and Trezor does not support Ether yet. Running a full Ethereum node takes storage space so some Trezor fans buy a Nano S just to use with Ether.
@_date: 2016-09-24 20:57:08
Also consider using a strong passphrase to protect your seed. This adds a valuable extra layer of security. If you can memorize a strong random passphrase the seed is worthless to a thief, as your account can not be accessed without the passphrase. Ledger Nano S does not yet offer passphrase protection for the seed.

The only problem I am aware of with hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger Nano S is a possible lack of privacy. You can avoid this by doing cold storage using Armory on top of Bitcoin Core, with an offline computer for the main Armory install and a watching only wallet on the computer facing the internet. This is how cold storage was done until Trezor came on the scene and some still use it. It is a shame that Bitcoin Core still does not support hardware wallets after all this time. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:16:47
Good video thanks for the effort. The Nano S is the best hardware wallet Ledger has offered to date but I think could be improved. Trezor still has one major advantage over the Nano S: the ability to create accounts hidden behind a password. But Nano S can store Ether and ETC which Trezor cannot yet.

Electrum 2.5.x was released because the new Bitcoin Core 0.11.1 mandates transactions be signed LowS, necessary to close the malleability attack vector.

GPUs cannot compete with ASICs for bitcoin mining and have not for years.
You will not be able to find a location in the US that has power as cheap as China. If your boss is serious about spending $150K that would buy 120 Antminer T9 miners and APW3+ power supplies netting you 1500 TH/s. Those 120 miners would earn you about $30k a month at current difficulty and bitcoin price before deducting power costs. As time goes by and difficulty increases the money you earn per month goes down assuming bitcoin price is stable. 
Eric Mu in China has a company called [SinoHash]( that specializes in hosting more than 10 miners for clients.

If you want to safely store 10 bitcoin you absolutely have to use cold storage, no way around it. Your private keys must be protected. To be blunt, anyone telling you otherwise does not know what they are talking about.
The easiest way to do this is to buy a Trezor and use it with the myTrezor.com web wallet. Believe it or not (I test all this stuff) myTrezor.com is a faster and better wallet than Electrum or Multibit HD.
The latest Electrum 2.5 (mandatory upgrade) no longer supports Trezor. Armory is an option but you would have to use two computers, one air gapped, to use cold storage. Armory keeps promising Trezor support but has not delivered yet.

If you do not control the private keys of your bitcoin addresses offline you will get hacked sooner or later. There was a guy posting yesterday who lost 16 bitcoin from a password protected Bitcoin-Qt wallet.
You can buy a hardware wallet for less than $100 or use cold storage with two computers, one always kept offline, with Armory or Electrum. Most people go for hardware wallets. 
Anyone who owns more than one bitcoin should be using one of those options. Leaving your bitcoin at exchanges is just asking for trouble.

Why don't you give it a try? Generate an Electrum bitcoin wallet, copy down the seed. Then restore an Electrum-LTC wallet from the same seed.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:49:20
Probably not the best option. You want possession of your private keys before Aug 1 so stay with your KeepKey or buy a Trezor. You can [recover]( a KeepKey seed to Trezor if your KeepKey breaks. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:44:36
There will always be FUD:) Most of the miners signaling BIP91 are doing so with a patch on Core and not running the btc1 client. There will not be a SegWit2X hard fork unless they change from Core to btc1. Then there is the question of Bitmain possibly going ahead with a fork to Bitcoin ABC August 2 even if UASF does not activate.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:29:46
If you can not afford a Trezor (best option) your next best option would be to download Electrum to your laptop and move your bitcoin there. Electrum will probably provide a guide on how to split BTC to BCC after August 1. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:02:22
If you withdraw your bitcoin to a Trezor or Ledger Nano S hardware wallet **before** Bitcoin ABC forks off on August 2, yes, you should have access to an equal number of coins on both chains.

All you need is a Trezor. All your private keys are offline in your possession. You should have zero on a phone or exchange.

No, I know that honour belongs to ViaBTC cloud mining, because their daily fees are only $0.16 per TH/s. About half what pool.bitcoin.com charges. Because of your higher fees the daily payout is running 0.00033 bitcoin per TH/s while ViaBTC returned 0.00041 over the past week. That is a considerable difference in favour of ViaBTC.

S7 is still overpriced and price crashed today as predicted. Still would not buy until it drops to .0016. Making good money on S5 long. Bitmain had over 600 S7 still left for sale when they closed the shop and opened trading a week ago, looks like they gradually sold those off over the past week to prop S7 price up.

I own both. The Ledger Nano must be initialised on an uncompromised computer, why you started selling the Starter. Also, using the security card is a hassle Trezor does not have. If a user wants to bypass the security card routine an app must be used on a late model Android phone. For the convenience I think Trezor is worth the extra $60.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:03:01
Bitcoin can be volatile. If you believe that long term bitcoin price will appreciate and can handle the swings of the market look for those times when bitcoin price drops and use the drop to buy more bitcoin at a discount. If you have more than a couple of bitcoin consider moving them off Coinbase to a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S. When you leave your bitcoin on an exchange you have an IOU because you do not own the private keys. Using a hardware wallet protects you against any loss, it is just good practice.

This means that regardless of SegWit2X being locked in or not there will be a hard fork August 1 so expect bitcoin price to take a nose dive as the new token is priced in. I think Bitmain will use any excuse to fork off at this point.

Buy a Trezor and move your bitcoin there before August 1. Bitstamp has not said if they will support BCC or not.

Could be a bug in Electrum wallet. You could try a small transaction sending to yourself to another receiving address.

Trezor has always offered their users the option to use multiple passphrases and took pains in the user manual to explain the consequences of forgetting. Anyways nice to hear that KeepKey will enable passphrase in the near future.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:28:11
You will be fine. Trezor is actively working on providing access to the BCC you will own after the fork. They had to wait until Bitcoin ABC merged replay protection. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:55:20
Trezor or Ledger Nano S. Trezor is still in stock but you would have to pay for express shipping to receive from EU within a few days

Your 93.457 sat/B fee was way too low. Reference to  states your transaction might never confirm without help; I pushed your transaction and you should see a confirmation within a few hours but you really need to change to a wallet that estimates fees properly. Electrum is good.

It appears even if Bitmain supports SegWit2x (and they are signaling BIP91) there will be a hard fork to Bitcoin ABC on August 1 by ViaBTC regardless. ViaBTC has not been signaling for BIP91.

There is still plenty of time left. Expect both Ledger and Trezor to support BCC if it happens.

Everyone has the same idea as you. Most hardware wallets are out of stock until September. You can still get a Trezor shipped from the [factory]( right away but you will pay a premium for shipping now cost is 133 euros total.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:20:30
You really should have possession of your private keys before August 1. Coinbase will probably make the right choice in case of a fork but you might lose access to your bitcoin for a few days. Get a Trezor [shipped express]( from the factory for 107 euro and learn to use it from the [manual]( You do have to pay extra to have one shipped immediately. Move a few tenths of a bitcoin a few times so you are comfortable with it then move the balance of your bitcoin to your new Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:08:33

It will take some time for Coinbase to send and bitcoin received in your Trezor wallet. It has to get past pending on Coinbase to show in your Trezor and about an hour to fully confirm. You are doing the right thing with a couple of test transactions. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:26:35
The Breadwallet now in beta on Android is very good. The only more secure way to transact with bitcoin on a phone would be to use Mycelium with a Trezor. Your private keys are stored safely in the Trezor, the downside is carrying the Trezor with you and a short cable to connect. Ledger is also good to use with Mycelium.

Agree, ignore the kids who spread FUD. Over the years I have bought half a dozen Trezors, keep some as backups, given a couple to friends. Any device can fail that is why you keep your 24 word seed safe and have a spare Trezor on hand for just that. The only problem I have ever had was one Trezor that quit working after three months and was replaced under warranty. KeepKey is a Trezor clone, but Ledger is coming out with the new Nano S next month that uses a screen and buttons just like Trezor and has Ether support. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:16:20
Magnitude should not matter as long as Coinbase is using a sufficient miner fee. I think your delay is just due to Coinbase being busy. Give it some more time. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:46:44
Most hosted bitoin mining services charge fees that are too high and eat into your profit. They are after all, not a charity and in business to make money for themselves and shareholders. Frankly you are better off buying and holding bitcoin. 
That being said, if you want to put a few hundred dollars into hosted bitcoin mining the provider with the lowest fees is ViaBTC. They are often out of stock so just create an account and get on their mailing list so you are notified when more TH/s are available. 
Roger Ver's pool.bitcoin.com are heavily advertising mining contracts but the fees they charge are significantly higher than ViaBTC. Not recommended as once you buy TH/s you are stuck, cannot sell. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:20:00

There was some mention on the KeepKey sub of company changes, there might be a buy out or reorganization going on. I also read that Trezor has made their open source software licensing more restrictive. Since KeepKey is a fork of Trezor source code that might raise some legal issues that need to be addressed. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:06:15
Be careful migrating to Breadwallet, think twice. Transaction fees are very high. If you are on Android you have more control over fees with Electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:44:58
The one thing you should not do is type your seed words into an online computer ... ever. 
You could make an encrypted Truecrypt container on an offline computer using a strong password, then store that encrypted container in the cloud, but every hardware wallet manufacturer counsels against that. You should really only store a paper backup of your seed.
If you store at a relative's house you have to trust someone else not to steal your bitcoin. If LEO searches your house they will also search your safe deposit box that is SOP.
Store your seed at home and also a copy in your safety deposit box. 
You should also consider using a passphrase to protect your seed. That way anyone who has your seed cannot steal your bitcoin without your passphrase which you keep in your head, if you trust your memory.
Whatever hardware wallet you are getting read the online documentation before it arrives. You can find the Trezor docs [here]( and Nano S [here]( 
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:37:22
Occasionally a minute but Breadwallet usually only takes a few seconds to sync on my Pixel though, could be phone related. Plenty of other good Android wallets if you are not happy, try Electrum, Mycelium or Samourai.

@_date: 2017-06-01 20:10:57
Follow the [instructions]( Ledger gives in the online knowledge base. Any questions you have should be in the [online support]( topics so maybe read them now before your Nano S arrives. Smart decision to go with a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:17:03
Android is best no doubt. The best phone wallets are Android only. The only exceptions are CoPay and Breadwallet. If you want to use your phone with a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S you have to have Android to run the Mycelium wallet. If you want to use a cutting edge wallet like Samourai, again it is Android only. Because of IOS licensing you are more likely to find interesting new bitcoin apps on Android.

Really don't ask Trezor to do something you should take care of yourself, either by leaving instructions with your family or a probate attorney.

Why do you not just buy local and pay cash? You should be able to find a seller using localbitcoins.com
If you use a service like OKPay or Bitstamp you need to follow directions or expect delays.

Anything electronic can go bad. I have had two Trezors quit working on me, one after two years, one after 3 months. The one was still in warrranty and replaced no charge. I tell friends who are buying hardware wallets to buy two so they have a spare. If you are used to using a hardware wallet and it breaks you will thank God you have a spare.

When you have bitcoin at Coinbase you do not own the bitcoin, you have an IOU from Coinbase to deliver on demand. You are always more secure taking possession of your bitcoin private keys yourself. Spending $70 to $100 for a Ledger Nano S or Trezor is a no brainer for most.

I don't know of an alternative to ANACS. Most grading services are not interested in bitcoin physical tokens. You will definitely get a better price with your token in an ANACS slab. Your choice. You take a risk of getting scammed (chargeback) on eBay. Bitcoin has no chargebacks, and most auction sales on the Bitcoin Forum use a third party escrow. It is easier and safer to sell for bitcoin than USD IMO but if you go the eBay route good luck. Your coin ungraded is realistically worth $3000 - $3200 based on recent auctions, but you can ask whatever you like. There are many Casascius coins and price varies greatly with rarity, condition and demand.

You can use a trustless bitcoin mixer like the Shared Coin implementation of coinjoin from blockchain.info right now

Get Electrum so you own your private keys. Do not enable 2FA or you will not be able to sign.

The portable version of Electrum only uses 65 MB

It looks like you do have a brass one bitcoin 2011 Casascius coin with the spelling error. The [last auction]( at the Bitcoin Forum brought a price of 1.42 bitcoin. The collectors who frequent the Collectibles forum are very sharp. Recommend you join the forum, post a thread asking for advice. Selling on Ebay is risky due to chargebacks. If you want to get the coin graded send to [ANACS]( My recommendation is not try to sell for USD, get the coin graded then open an auction at the bitcoin forum and sell for bitcoin, use escrow.

KeepKey made a business off of forked Trezor code. Might have been legal, but ethical? You can not blame Trezor for wanting to prevent that from happening again.

Armory is only being maintained by two developers right now you should post your problem in the [Armory board]( at BitcoinTalk.

For the consumer who values security over all but still wants to be able to make bitcoin transactions conveniently you should be buying a hardware wallet. Trezor and Ledger Nano S are the leaders but I think only Trezor has stock they can ship right away. Both of those work with altcoins also. If you just need a simple secure user friendly hardware wallet for bitcoin only take a look at Digital Bitbox. With the bitcoin price going up a lot of users have been moving to hardware wallets causing problems with low stock and delays in shipping. Which ever brand you buy remember to buy two so you have a spare.

You will likely get a better return on your money by taking it and just buying bitcoin and holding long term.
Mining is mostly no longer profitable for anyone but the companies selling mining rigs to people hoping to get rich quick.

Shared Coin is a coinjoin server while Send Shared is a traditional mixer. Both explained in more detail here: [Shared Coin: Free Bitcoin Mixing Service Fights CoinValidation](

You don't mention the wallet software but you need something like the portable version of Electrum that only saves data to the Electrum folder, does not write to your main drive or /appdata/. You really should look into hardware wallets though.

That article recommends using a Coinbase Shift bitcoin debit card at a cannabis dispensary. Unfortunately that would be against Coinbase [TOS]( and would probably get account closed. They are pretty clear that cannabis dispensaries are on the prohibited business list.

Yeah I call it hit and run marketing. Melanie Shapiro is trying it again with a wearable NFC ring she is trying to pre-sell for $250 called Token. I doubt anyone who bought a Case wallet will touch her new venture.

Nice to see half the audience using hardware wallets. Only error I saw was Pamela recommending importing your seed into CoPay in case you lose your Trezor. You lose all the security of your Trezor by typing your seed into a computer. Instead you should keep a spare hardware wallet on hand so you can always recover on device. Good presentation worth a watch.

A miner renting out hashing at Nicehash is only doing so if they can make more money renting than mining themselves. Take some time to research Nicehash and you will stay away.

Visit the subreddit and search. This comes up every time there is concern about a fork. Do you really think the company that started the first mining pool and developed the first successful hardware wallet does not have contingency plans:)

Blockchain.info has been very transparent and provides the only online bitcoin wallet with two different mixing services built in: Shared Coin and Send Shared. 
If you do not trust blockchain.info security you can open your My Wallet account while connected by Tor and use an anonymous email.  
If and until DarkWallet becomes real Shared Coin is the only commercial conjoin service. It is free and fast to use, and if everyone with a My Wallet account used Shared Coin CoinValidation would be rendered impotent and should fade away.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:11:23
During periods of high trading volume Send Shared can take 24-48 hours.
If waiting a day or so for the transaction to complete is a problem for you do not use Send Shared, instead use the other mixing service provided by blockchain.info called Shared Coin. 
When using Shared Coin the bitcoins are always in your control and transactions only take a few minutes. 
Blockchain.info plans to phase out Send Shared eventually and only offer Shared Coin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:43:27
If everyone using blockchain.info routinely used Shared Coin that would be a big help and a good start.
If all wallets offered a free coinjoin mixer CoinValidation would no longer be practical, because the mixers would serve to corrupt the metadata used by CoinValidation to determine if coins have passed through tainted addresses. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:37:37
Send shared mixer can take 24 hours or more when there is a lot of transaction volume. The other coinjoin mixer Shared Coin only takes minutes but anonymity is not as high. 
When using Shared Coin your coins never leave your control so you might feel more comfortable using it instead of Send Shared. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:07:23
Send Shared is a traditional mixing service that removes any link from coins you send from coins you receive back, but can be slow on days when bitcoin trading volume is high. 
If you cannot wait 24 hours to get your mixed coins back consider using the other mixing service provided by blockchain.info called Shared Coin. 
Shared Coin is a coinjoin mixing service where you never lose control of your coins, they cannot be lost or stolen. Using Shared Coin only takes minutes. The level of anonymity using Shared Coin is not the ultimate provided by Send Shared but still very high. 
If you ever have a problem with a Shared Coin transaction look in your wallet, below the Shared Coin send form is a button labelled "Recover Intermediate Addresses". Press that button and the coins should be restored back to your wallet.

At this time there is no such thing as a secure Android wallet, so best to only keep walking around bitcoin needed for shopping in any Android wallet. Convenience and security usually do not mix well.
Coinbase or blockchain.info wallets are a step up in security but there will always be risk involved, don't keep more bitcoin than you can afford to lose in any online wallet.
Use instead a highly secure local wallet like Electrum or Armory for most of your bitcoin. Better yet, use the cold storage option that both of these wallets support.
If you are new to cold storage just Google it or take the time to read an article like the [Guide to Bitcoin Cold Storage](
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:13:51
Bitaddress.org paper wallets are not the ultimate protection for your bitcoin. Online wallets and exchanges can still be hacked and spyware can steal your passwords. You should instead learn how to use bitcoin cold storage the right way. 
Consider using a good desktop wallet like Electrum or Armory instead. Use the cold storage option either wallet offers to keep your private keys on an offline computer that never connects to the internet. Then regularly transfer all bitcoin in your exchange account, online wallet or smartphone wallet to Armory or Electrum cold storage. If you still want a paper backup both Armory and Electrum provide one you can keep stored safely. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:24:51
Shared Coin (coinjoin mixer) is free, Send Shared (traditional mixer) is 0.5% fee. You have to have a blockchain.info wallet to use Shared Coin. Anyone can use Send Shared.
