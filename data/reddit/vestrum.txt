I sent the bitcoins to my bitfinex wallet when the bitcoin was more than $609. I had no clue there were some security problems. Only after I noticed there have been 6 confirmations and the boins warent showing up in my wallet I sent a message to support asking for help. I was only able to sell the bitcoins very recently when the price already dropped to 565$ (more than $44 less than the initial price). The total loss is around $4000, and this doesnt includes the losses I have because the money were blocked (around another $5000) which its senseless to even think of. This happened only because Bitfinex didnt let me move my bitcoins to another exchange when they shut down the website. I cant even wonder how many others are in the same situation as me :(

Yeah thanks for that man, I hope you are better than me.

Not looking for sympathy, I was hoping there might be a way to get those money back. For some 4000$ might mean very few bucks, for others like me its a lot of money. Anyway, I am really glad I didnt lost all of them.

Of course I am really not happy because others lost their money, but I do make a point also. There are thousands of users in the same situation as myself. Probably their loss combined is also very big!

Today I deposited again 34 coins and after 18 confirmations they still dont show up in my wallet. Bitfinex is not answering to any message for the last 3 hours. I put again my faith in them (this should point out that I am not actually condemning them), and again I am not sure whats happening.
