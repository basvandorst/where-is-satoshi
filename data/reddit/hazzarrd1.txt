Source I am Venezuelan. But i'll give you the complete information, our economy is under hyper inflation and all the prices are being set to the black market $ price. Wich right now according to dolartoday is 102,227 VEF = 1 $. And our minimum wage is 177,505 VEF + alimentary bonus (279,000 VEF), it totals 456,505 VEF divided by the black market $ rate is = 4.46$

Well hello, i have to say it's strange that i found your post today since i am preparing a project to start a fundraising the next week as decembers arrives. So here is my history.
Hello I am a Venezuelan, who is trying to start a Non profit project (wich placeholder name is project juno/chamopaz iniciative) with the help of my mother a social worker with 20 years of experience (She currently works at SOS Children Villages Venezuela) but as the crisis in our country intesifies, we only want to devote both of us into helping those in need but not only with food, but also with proper education/social preparation for the future (education and extracurricular activities are in a very bad shape with families not even being able to afford food so childrens from all age are exposed to a violent culture without the means to see nothing else). We have come with a 4 year project where we plan to use all resources we can gather into teaching parents/childres how not only endure the crisis but actually live through family values, didactic plays and talks/seminars about productions, new technology, family values, etc. Expecting to prepare people to do better in the future even if the crisis can get us in a very bad spot of our lives.
Currently the project is expected to cost 120k $ over 4 years and serve at least 300 Children's monthly directly and over 2000 persons monthly semi directly(parent's, neighbors) and one of my plans is try to fund it through crypto curriencies to avoid fund freezing in US$ or getting the funds destroyed by the hiperinflation we are experiencing (our VEF lose it's value at excesive rate) and also because the store of value qualitie that have been gained by the Bitcoin, as it can be a good place to hold into our funds for the long term. Why we want to go independent? Well due to the political crisis ngo's international funding need goverment aproval which takes infinite time to be aproved, they also keep part of the funds (the international currency have to go through their channels on a undermarket price, and also can be seized at any times)
At the moment we already have some interested donors who are going to give like 3000 us$ but we need a lot of more. If you are interested on helping us and you want proof's of the work that's have been done already by my mother, our indentitie, our project and it's impact pm'me and i will give it to you, i would put it publiclly here but we are still translating it, and tunning up a few things in order to start during december or early january.
Also if you want first hand information of what is going on in Venezuela you can ask me anything
Due to the some private message suggesting it would be good to put some adresses for those who want to help even before the project is already made public here they are:
BTC segwit address: 3F8nnC51dyDtGGdhCf5k6sA6nS4PzMAKZu

Maybe is a hell of a bed for us tho, Here in Venezuela most people have to live a war crisis without being in one daily, so not much will change.
Just to name few things, aproximately there are:
80 homicides daily (last year over 20k alone, not in war).
On a daily basis in hospital 5 childs and 2 new borns babies die from hunger.
There is no medicine to treat a simple flu.
Venezuelan worker gets on avg 0.60 $(14.4$ monthly) for a day of work (min wage) in a economy that just to survive you need at least 100$ monthly.
on avg the citizens have lost 10 kg (weight) of hunger.
there are people starting to eat the street dogs.
Most Venezuelans (70%+) can't eat more than 1 time a day.
The street is ruled out by criminal bands in one side and the public force on the other (civilians are mostly un armed) both in support of the current "Goverment".
The goverment is well know suporter of all the shitty things in the world (like massive drug traffic, hezbolla and some other extremist from the middle east, supports a lot of countries that are against the US, human traffict.).
All of this after recieving more or less 1.5 trillion dollars over the past 15 years (Expert says that at least 55% of that money went to corruption, financing criminal organizations, shady deals with china and rusia, and more important for the help  subject, enough weapons to keep citizens in strict control so the can not be overthrown without help, every time thousands of people go to the street to protest, many get killed, injure or dissapears into the corrupt justice system (here in Venezuela there is no power independency at all, everything is rulled by the party, oposition won the Assambley in a democratic way and got dismanteled, due to not having real ways of enforcing their laws).
My family lives on a +/- 60$(making less every time due to the crazy inflation) a month that my mom and i make by having 3 jobs each, and we have our hard times (inflation is eating our budget, the hipertension and blood related medicines, for my mother and grand mother are extremely hard to find) .

@_date: 2017-09-21 14:30:15
There is a lot of factors but basically, the wealth redistribution was a lie, out of 1.5 trillion $ is calculated that 55 % was lost on corruption, then a lot of it was used to setup a poor way of economy (living out importing) wich eventually destroyed the internal production, because wasn't as profitable.
Then when shit started to go downhill the goverment just creates more regulations and attacks the private sector, trying to setup   price limits and killing the few companies that survived the importation period. Also the country has an inmense external debt(over 150 billon $) even so they have to give away free actives to countrys like china and rusia, so right now there is no money for importations because those countries we owe money are constantly collecting their payments.
They still refuse to change the economic policies, and no one can do shit about it because with all the money they got military in their pockets

don't know about the realeasing part because to my knowledge those who got caught have gotten out by paying bribes, most of them never returned to mine but still are btc users.
What is real is the state keeps the mining equipment for their use. I live like 15 mins away from a big factory called Hermo (sausage making type of factory) and it's a known secret that there is a big mining rig running operated by some tech guys contracted to the SEBIN (STATE SECRET POLICE)

mostly they don't have $ to print vast amount's of money, since most of the printing it's done offshore. Our country has a debt that is aproxemately well above 150 billion $
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:42:19
it's hard to understand from the outside. The problem for the volume is that most of the people here don't make enough money to buy btc, bcuz the exchange ratio is like 1btc= 3600 $ avg, but in our currency is 1btc = 75.000.000 bs +/-. The average Venezuelan makes 350.000 Bs monthly or somewhere around 14$ a month. Those like me who are making money out of internet earn from 200$ to 3000$ and obviously part of it can't be used to buy btc
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:03:38
It talks like ten second's about crypto currencies, and a team looking (exploring options) into it, is not making it a legal payment in anymoment, also our goverment is prone to talk a lot and do the opposite kind of goverment. So this is mostly clickbait
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:28:22
i know that you alone can get away with it, i was talking about the promoting part. Getting some $ worth of bitcoins monthly is how myself endure by a little bit the economic crisis.
The only problem is that you need local currency to survive and if you start changing to much btc to our local currecy it triggers flags (because the goverment is in control of all the baking data private and public) and they could ask you, where is that money coming from (and probably be blackmailed over your answer).

Idk as Venezuelan, my point of view is this. 
Moving silver and gold in this country is extremly risky (crime rate is to the roof). Going to the street with much money is almost asking to get killed.

I wanted to get it as soon as i knew about it but did not have money to pump in 20 year old me was sick as fuck and using all the money i had to get better. Then Venezuelan Crisis.
But the idea as soon as i read about it was mind blowing. Shit was a time jump in the economic world from my perspective, i am puting a few bucks a month slowly but there not because the money i can make out of it, But because i believe in what Bitcoin represents and i think that even with all the brawling that is yet to come, it will achieve it's objectives.

Not responding to you anymore, I can name docens over docens of countries who do well in capitalism but you can't name 5 countries who do well in socialism end of debate.

Because they have done, personal Sanctions to PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS AND PERSONAL ASSETS until the last month, so tell me how a personal sanction on someone who wasn't suppose to have million of $ in US bank accounts can affect a country, even new sanctions doesn't have that much of a effect because they exclude medicine and food, also don't affect any deal or trade before such sanction, and even if it could have some effect it would start now not 4 years ago when the crisis started.

Hello i am Venezuelan and bitcoin is not saving the country but is saving people who lives in Venezuela.
My personal history, i use beermoney sites/freelance websites that offer bitcoin payments, also trade with a part of capital that i had ( stored 100$ btc when it was in 800$ let it there as my savings and then bitcoin skyrocketed, i lost some of it while learning how to be average at it ofc). It let me earn from 150 to 270$ monthly, half of it goes to my personal and family use. 35% goes to help childrens and families who are almost starving to death (poor people here is eating once a day in best cases) since my mom works for few NGO's giving help to childrens in poor live conditions. The other 15% goes to my savings or capital. Why bitcoin is helpful for that? The trusted transactions (no risk of refunds, no shitty blocks from paypal/payza, not frozen funds due to suspecious activity from the account that send's you money, better value since bitcoin sells 15-25% more than other processors)
The big problem here in Venezuela is the hard adaptability to the technology, the majority of the persons don't believe in being able to work and get paid using the internet (spending too much time in your room with a pc is even seen as something bad and believe that everything that comes from it is fake/scam). So imagine how hard is to get people in to adopt a currency that only exist online.
Sorry for my bad englando. Early adopter of the bitcoin idea, but late adopter of it use due to the lack of money to put in.

because there is a lot of money to be made, even with the inflationary crisis, buy low sell high still works for example. You buy 1000$ for 26000000 BSF and then you sell those dollars for 30000000 BSF. there you made 150$ +/- profit, all you have to do is buy dollars fast again wich is not that hard. You keep doing that on a daily basis you can make 60% profit weekly

You are a fucking clown, i normally don't insult people on internet but you are the exception, go fuck yourself with your fucking propaganda, people is dying due to bad pollitics, THE VENEZUELAN CRISIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SANCTIONS. Even the last sanction wich is the biggest one against central bank and pdvsa, has a loophole that permits food and medicine. The Venezuelan Crisis is due to corruption and bad spending, what 2 years sanctions have to do with 18 years of destructing the internal production and giving away billions of dollars in arms and propaganda.

there is no fucking sanctions against the fucking country, the first that were against pdvsa are like 1 month old so it does not even have a real effect on the economy yet, fucking moron with yoru fucking propaganda. Freezen assets of corrupt people means nothing to the country, in fact it just enforce more the reason that everything is going south because of those corrupt people. MOST OF THEM WERE BROKE BEFORE ENTERING THE GOVERMENT HOW IN HELL THEY HAVE NOW PROPERTIES IN THE FUCKING U.S IF THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED OUTSIDE THE GOVERMENT HAVING A 10 minimum wage salary limit (like 400 $ a month in the best years) YOU CAN BUY PROPERTIES OR HAVE BIG WEALTHY ACCOUNTS WITH 400$ monthly
