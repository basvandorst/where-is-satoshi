Worth it imo. There's always going to be people that said you paid too much.

Not for too long though it's gonna shoot the fuck up after Christmas
I'm saying this based on 40k projection
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:16:34
Doubt it's going back under man. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:16:16
Some one got me on this. Wouldn't advise

I think a donation to a user here who isn't fully in do to financial reasons or other, but since there isnt a way to be sure of that I suggest one go to a user here. 
10,000$ can do a lot for someone
Thanks for this, really cool
You can put some money into a Bitcoin PSA

Had that moment at least six times since 2012, doesn't get better til you get in.
 Just back in August I was doing some faucets and received like .01 total, I sold because why not cash out this free $5, a few months later it was at 20k and no one saw it coming. No one ever sees it coming and it's usually too late once you notice. 
It sucks to see old transactions for weed and stupid shit add up to triple the price at the time. On the other hand paying for weed at 20k isn't so bad when it drops back to 8k.

Gotta strike when US is sleep. They knew 6k would be the real bottom, so the expedited the process. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:58:40
Haven't had this problem but I'm gonna keep an eye out, I'm sure if you call and complain loud enough they'll refund your $5
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:14:55
Well..its good advice

Hate to break it to you but Btcoin got it's start as drug tokens
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:54:15
? It's just a competitor of Bitcoin. I believe in Bitcoin, I believe other crypto gaining credibility will help strengthen it. Obviously scammers and hackers are going to come with any crypto, they follow the money anywhere it goes, especially online. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:13:39
Gonna be looking forward for a while. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:01:06
Always got to have a backup plan, or insurance, but you put all your money into Bitcoin so I don't think insurance would've helped. 
And I don't know why you would assume that. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:46:22
My alerts never work then I'm fucked for not buying/selling in time. Oh well though it always goes back up, and I don't have too much in to be worried. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:07:40
It's going past 15k again, but sounds like your initial investment was too large
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:57:51
That's a little harsh dude. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:07:42
That's what I'm trying to say.
go ETH and BTC, even LTC. I don't see them as competition as much as a penny nickle and I guess a dollar for btc.

What's the point of doing anything if the end result is still nothing though. I feel like it's best to just leave it at that; it's best to look at economics in terms of parties rather than personal identities anyway, there'd just be too much clouding the real information. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:00:53
Was it? I was trying to buy at $52 for weed on silk road, had some buddies that did it, it wasn't until a year or so after that that I'd heard anything serious about it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:12:23
I'll check it out. Thanks
