Accepting **donations** is as easy as posting your wallet id online. That's not something anyone should be proud of.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:45:21
Yeah, I also fail to see why ["Company X now accepting Bitcoin donations"]( is worthy of posting/upvoting on this subreddit. People asking for free money is not the way forward for Bitcoin.

I see you've read "How to lie with statistics."

There's probably more people looking to buy drugs and porn online then there are looking for investment vehicles, so I don't see this as a negative

Indeed. The power usage issue is a problem and should not be reduced to propaganda.

It's true that his party was a workers' party, which are traditionally left wing-oriented, the DAP (*Deutsche Arbeiterpartei*) was more "fuck everyone that's not us"-oriented from the start. They added *Nationalsozialistische* to it later (and got more extreme in their thinking) but really never had any link to traditional socialism. Today, their doctrine would translate more towards national conservatism.

The Dutch one has a former playmate as the party leader. The weird part is that they're not even trying to leverage her... uhm... *physical appearance* (to get the lonely male vote?), but that she's super serious about PP stuff. Seems like an easy target for the other parties...

Didn't know about the Breivik thing.
Was Breivik mentioned by him somewhere or could that have been a coincidence?
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:00:21
Yup. And even if Bitcoin was using that % of renewables, if crypto's didn't exist that part would have gone into useful things. Effectively canceling out the part that's now generated by fossil fuel.
Instead of, you know, useless math (financial revolution pending).
