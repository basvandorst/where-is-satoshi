well, cryptex stated that their target for shipping out the cards is approx. may... so, they're still in time. my concern is more about what happens when robocoin's bitcoin atm gets transformed to a 'bank', do i still need the cryptex card then?

Glad to hear that! my iPhone 4S wasn't able to read Gen I QR codes because they were too small for the camera.
Carsten, to you plan to do a Litecoin Bit-Card? Would love to see (and buy) one! You guys rock!

"Does Bitalo take any commission?"
"Yes, Bitalo will charge certain fees to keep the service running, but our rates are lower than most competitors."
Erhhh.... so how much exactly are your trading fees?

Finally! Good job! Speed is absolutely okay on my iPhone 4S! :)

i think mtgox didn't move and will not move at all. the "new" address (apparently they just reactivated their old PO box) is just for letting the protestors think they can catch mark over there. *it's a traaaap*

Is DW's Gateway down? I'm getting two errors when trying to connect to the Testserver: "Error connecting" &amp; "disconnected" - anyway, dark wallet looks really promising and the interface simply rocks! I backed this project and it's quite cool to see the idea now coming true :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:26:19
under settings &gt; add server, try to use: gateway.unsystem.net - should work.

does anyone know which reference bitcoin exchange rate they are using to transfer your fiat to btc? if they offer you a worse rate than i.e. bitstamp, they don't need to charge any fees, because those are already implied... that's how safello.com does it :/

When is Litecoin support coming?
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:39:42
done. I emailed you the whole story. thank you for getting in contact this quick.

Thanks for your kind and helpful replies.
I guess my problem lies somewhere else and this transaction I suspected falsely is just normal change address.
My Hive Account is over a year old. Initially I created it for Litecoin and like everyone else I got a 12 words random seed+PIN to initialize my wallet. Today, after running Hive for over a year without any problem, I clicked on "load different wallet" (out of curiosity! just wanted to see what happens) and well, of course I entered my credentials which I backed up offline on registration.
But while my Litecoin Wallet is still the same, I got a new Bitcoin address that now holds 0 BTC and has no history. I don't know how this is possible at all, but well, let's hope that Hive Support is willed to help me. It's super-awful to see this "0" in front of me.. :(
(And this is the reason why I looked up my real Blockchain address, found out about the not-double-spend and so on and so on...)
At least I now know that my old/real BTC address still holds my Bitcoin. Thanks again.

transparency is the key. starting from a legit website with company details, with real names and a real address, etc. to sharing pics, videos and tech specs of your product. but if you want the community to trust you, you maybe want to give away one working prototype to a trusted community member (btc dev or some hero member of bitcointalk i.e.) of and let him/her test the card.. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:26:54
so how can you ensure us to not simply run away with the transfered btc?
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:08:36
come over to  - there's no need for a verification. a helpful and newbie friendly community awaits you ;)

9flats, the european equivalent to airbnb already accepts bitcoin, so it's time for them to catch up. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:31:53
do we have to pass some kind of identity check / verification before beeing able to use your card?
