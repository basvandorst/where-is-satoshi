Get wasted on the gains, get wasted on losses. It's a win win!

I'm sure she is saying it wrong, isn't it perhaps "Backed"?

Not too sure about other counties but,  here in South Africa you can purchase airtime with bitcoin,at set values and that functions as talk time, data (at a ZAR per a Mb rate) or giving you the ability to send a text/sms. If you wish to have some data instead, all the major networks have the ability to convert some of the Airtime value into data. Also at set amounts/increments.

You did not do your research and now paid the price by losing a lot of money. You won't get any sympathy here let alone, donations.

There is *ice3x* which deals with BTC/LTC/ETH but they trade a much smaller volume of BTC compared to Luno. LTC seems to be their most sold coin there. They also have more tools to use on their charts but I found Luno to be the best on PC and Mobile.

If he wants to prove it, he could do it in less than a minute. Now that he wants to take it to court he will be forced to do so, and when he can't the resulting shit storm will be worth the wait.

Just accept that your BTC is gone, move on and learn a valuable lesson from this. 
If you get it back eventually great. If you can't afford to take the loss, then you shouldn't be dealing with large sums of valuables in the first place.

Its a long shot but, not perhaps a problem with your ISP and p2p traffic being shaped? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:21:36
Yes, do it as soon as you can.

I moved my coin out this week to a local site and closed my account. It was *ALWAYS* off line when I needed it.

Depending on how *fast* he is going down, the g-force could be pushing him back.
