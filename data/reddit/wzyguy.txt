Don’t take offense to this.  Most people in life are poor for a reason.

Tell them to get educated.. shouldn't take more than 1 hour to validate coinbase and bitcoin...

Most ppl aren't gonna start buying till we see $10,000.... we are in the 2nd inning

You would have made a lot of money fading his calls. The day he decides to buy bitcoin is the day to probably sell....

Dumb money isn't here yet till it hits $10k. Thats when Joe Q Public enters the game...

All investments eventually will burn some ppl.  That's just life.. deal with it 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:47:26

Just so u know.. u can withdraw all principle from Roth IRA after 5 years.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:55:58
It’s called “ paying tuition.” 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:06:40
Scarcity is a good thing. Keep stacking, in a few years most people will only be able own 1/10th of a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:12:15
You r young .., put a couple K in it. 2k even if you lose it won’t even matter in the long run.   The time to take more risk in life is when u can afford to lose it. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:25:40
From 7,000 to 10,000 is about 40% increase. So your $300 x 40% = $420

No it’s not terrible advice..if you hold long term, it generally makes more sense to dump everything in ASAP.  What u are trying to do time the market which is all a game of luck.

Anyone can claim something is a bubble. U have to tell me when it will pop. Otherwise it’s just gibberish

I’ll be happy with 10k year end ...  
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:44:00
There are currently 16 million plus btc. It’s impossible for majority of ppl to own one.  We have to remember that it’s a global market.  Most new comers will only own 1/10 of a btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:50:31
Isn’t that really the case with most investments in life. Is that you get in early enough so that someone will pay a higher price to take it off your hands.  Anything that can be invested in will always end with a bubble anyhow. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:30:23
Won’t dip much. Everyone knows the institutional money will be coming.  I don’t see it going below $9,000, it will all be eaten up by the bulls.

He is a one hit wonder. His biggest claim to victory had been the subprime collapse, but has been wrong ever since.  He has become your typical goldbug dooms day spokesman. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:28:36
Convincing friends and family to invest is usually a bad idea. If it works out, just great. If it doesn’t, u might have ruined the relationship. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:29:40
No offense kid, you better not invest. If you’re gonna buy bitcoin, you have to do it with “ I don’t give a shit money “  Can’t let every FUD get to you ..

Use a pc and upload ID onto their site.  That should work. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:01:49
It would upset me even more if people were not buying it period.

Although he advocates bitcoin. He doesn’t own any. All his money is in old fashion gold... 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:27:50
We been lagging Eth &amp; Ltc for a few days now. It’s about time for us to take the lead back.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:06:35
Most people aren’t going to get on board till it reaches at least $10,000.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:04:01
Nothing wrong with everyone making a prediction. Point is everyone can decide for themselves. No one has a superior or more accurate method of nailing a number correctly. Everything is just a guess or hunch.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:52:50
That’s easy, just double down if it drops by half.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:23:29
Trust me, most people can afford to lose more than they think.   Most Americans are in debt, what’s the difference really.   
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:08:29
That 50K annual limit is BS.  Besides using for tuition with proof. U can’t wire money out for any investments period. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:28:26
No offense to you.  $100 is a waste of time even thinking about it. Just buy it now. Buy more later. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:46:00
Most Joe Q Public ain’t buying bitcoin till it hits 10k.  That’s when the run up starts ... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:56:55
If he bought some btc, he wouldn’t need to steal. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:35:59
He hates money... he thought stepping in front of a freight train was good idea. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:35:32
They are shutting the exchanges unless they say otherwise . Stop spreading fake news about getting license. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:19:29
Even if they don't ban it now.. Doesn't mean they won't make threats about banning it in near future. I personally just wish they ban it for good.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:38:16
It's just better in the long run for everyone else if China bans it for good.  The commie govt is paranoid about Bitcoin.. The markets will be more stable without them being in it. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:59:26
Coinbase and Gdax is very slow with money transfers .. it takes upwards of 5 days .. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:46:45
Much respect.. as a gambler myself.. I like seeing ppl bet big.  No guts, no glory ...
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:56:28
Good for you. No guts, no glory ... 
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:24:34
Taxing it add value to the currency.  We can export all the U.S. dollar we want.  All this talk about the deficit and rising the debt ceiling is nonsense.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:26:35
No offense it’s only one btc ... u are wasting your time and energy trying to time the market.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:21:11
Buy it all at once.. go get a part time job.. buy more if it dips. Time is money... u are wasting time trying to average in with so little money.   
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:32:15
Use Gdax which is owned by coinbase .. no fees on limit orders ..
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:21:10
I'm glad China is out. The market is better off without them. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:10:20
Fastest isn’t safest right.. maybe he might get lucky with bitcoin.  If he pissed the 10k away, that’s just paying tuition.  Might not be a bad lesson to learn while young. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:21:56
$25k like he said is on the conservative end.  If btc hits $10k next year.. The media will bring the herd stampeding in at 10k.  We should hit 15k by 2018 year end.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:10:27
I can’t believe that you only purchased 1 btc at $250. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:41:10
Ya... I still haven’t found a taxi driver who loves Uber...
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:39:31
U can’t be serious right? I find this hard to believe ...
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:43:09
I don’t see how bitcoin is a bubble when something like 4% holders own 96% of the coins. I don’t even have one friend who owns a bitcoin yet.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:18:23
I’m sure he thought about that. I’m glad he took the risk.  I like seeing ppl bet big in life and win in the end.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:54:53
Coinbase has $250,000 coverage. I see more ppl losing coins moving them around than just leaving them in the exchanges.  It’s  not even worth the effort or the risk to move such a small quantity out. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:37:09
I doubt they will let their citizens buy bitcoin again. They are paranoid of losing any sense of control. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:38:47
U can look it up yourself ..long live inequality... 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:58:41
This is fake news until it happens.. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:30:40
Govts don’t need to seize your coins. They can just do what China did. Just stop you from converting your coins to fiat.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:49:43
Gandma, bitcoin, paper wallets ... my brain can’t register 
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:38:59
We just need everyone who wants to own bitcoin to buy at least one,  
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:39:11
Just keep adding ..  we are still early ... btc market cap will hit $1 trillion plus ..
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:32:18
What about college? Ppl spend tens of thousands on something that has 0 guarantee.  $1 trillion plus school debt for so call higher education .... 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:45:58
Ppl make a big deal out of this but it’s no different than someone putting all his money or getting into debt to fund a business.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:47:06
If you don’t have that long to live..why not? Shit it’s not like u have to pay back the loan anyway.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:06:30
I’m skeptical but hope it’s true. Easy spike to $7,000. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:44:04
You are splitting hair. I don't see the difference.  They will all close regardless.  
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:54:12
Use gdax which is owned by coinbase.  Limit orders no fees 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:01:00
I’m not proving anything. I’m just stating that data available.  The concentration of bitcoin wealth is in very few hands.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:54:51
I think u can gamble up to 15k.  You r still young and opportunity like this don’t come by often. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:33:56
If u can handle paying back the $10k if u do lose it all. Then fuck it, it’s not a problem 
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:33:33
In all fairness, he also doesn’t believe in gold. It isn’t that he is only picking on bitcoin.    
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:03:27
$5,100 if it gets there is good entry point .. u won’t catch the bottom .. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:13:42
Really depends how much is 60%.  Even if it was 100% but only a few thousand. It wouldn’t affect your life much if u lose it all. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:12:02
I believe in order to qualify as being rich. U would probably need to have min $1 million excluding place of residence.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:59:47
On a Roth IRA, u are allow to take out all your initial investment after 5 years. So if u owe taxes or penalties, it will only be on the gains.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:18:43
If you earn so much .. $30k is nothing.  Go for it.. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:12:13
I think it’s the rumor news about China allowing bitcoin to trade again next month. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:36:25
     
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:21:57
Fomo ain’t gonna start till we hit $10,000.  Nothing like 10k per coin to get Joe Q. Public interested ... 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:30:33
GBTC is horrible.... stay away 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:48:44
Btc can easily spike $1,000 if China opens up again.  Yes, again .. I believe they have stopped trading 4 times these past 3 years.  Maybe we are better off without them involved. It’s still going up regardless with or without them 
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:45:12
I actually like seeing more ppl negative about bitcoin price. Too much euphoria is not a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:34:48
$4 Trillion dollars were wiped out from the internet bubble of 2000.   Was the internet a scam? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:36:09
If you are planning to buy it, just do it ASAP. Generally it doesn’t pay to wait.  
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:59:32
They won’t open up. Don’t count on it.  The govt is paranoid about giving up any control.  
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:42:47
