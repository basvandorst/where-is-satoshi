And here we have exhibit A, as to why lottery winners go broke. 
Most of mine would be somewhere making more money for me. I would hold some back to bring my family’s debt to zero though. After that, live as we always have. In time the money that the investments are making will start coming in. That’s what I want to live on. The money my money makes.

Great advice. I’ll never use it, unless my wife decides to buy a ticket and we get lucky. 
I to throw it out there just in case some future lottery winner sees it, and happens to remember it. I don’t know if it’s ever helped, but that isn’t gonna stop me. I do hope it’s useful for someone.

Stop, drop, get on floor, everybody do the dinosaur? Something like that.

That’s absolutely true. My uncle actually won a few million from the Ohio lottery. I gave him the same advice as I posted before, as well as advising him if anyone wants his money to tell them to fuck off. He didn’t listen and he’s flat broke. His money pit was his son. Hard to turn that away. 
If it were me, I’d tell him that all that money is tied up in investments. Come back after 10 years and we’ll see how they’ve matured. My wife would absolutely spend every fucking cent ASAP, which is why I would be reticent to have any laying around. Can’t spend, what’s spent already, right? I think mostly what I’d do is keep doing the same shit I am now. I’d be very careful about lifestyle creep and stuff. It’s not like the shitty coffee I get now is that much worse than whatever premium coffee is out there. 
I don’t think it would be that bad though. I get to find out who’s my friend. Sure it’s the hard way to find out, but I’d know. 
You’re right, and it sucks.

Fuck no, I’m not. I’m not gonna just throw away money into the ether. I have played before, and for a good year or two afterwards every time i didn’t have money for something I’d think of me wasting it by buying a lottery ticket. I kicked myself thousands of times.

The trick is to not advertise that you won. If you ever happen to win a large amount, get a safety deposit box, and leave the ticket there. Most lotteries have a fair bit of time to claim the prize. Call a financial advisor (personal finance can help figure out how to get a decent one). Once you and your financial advisor have your ducks in row, claim the prize and follow your plan.

That’s why you should get your own.

Right? Why do I remember this advice? I don’t even play the lottery. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:18:42
You can work around that in some cases. Which is why you need a financial advisor. They can help set you up with the kind of lawyer that deals with financial stuff. That’s one of those ducks you need to get in a row before you claim the prize.

If I had money to waste, firstly I won’t ever have that much, and secondly then I’d play the lottery. Right now throwing a dollar or two in the trash (how I think of the lottery) is just too goddamn wasteful. The minute I’d run out of money, and need something I’d think of that moment of me throwing that cash away.  It’d eat at me. 
Hell I don’t even buy loot boxes, or skins, or anything else for video games but the game. I appreciate the people who do (thanks everyone else on fortnite), but I can’t justify it. I’ll be standing in a grocery store trying to decide between the cheap stuff and the stuff my daughter likes, and kick myself for wasting the money.

I like to put the wrong info.

Now you know why money launderers use western union.
