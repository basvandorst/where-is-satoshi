Localbitcoins.com can arrange face to face deals in cash.

We are at least halfway through the third big bitcoin bubble, it could continue to rise or suddenly burst, nobody knows.

Are the rats leaving the ship ?

Your worse enemy are social engineering scams.

Upvoted , for the effort.

What if you use the Google authentificator app ? Is it safer than sms ?
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:59:26
It won't get further 4-5 k within this bubble cycle. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:35:18
10 years for me, until you can easily buy you daily life items directly in Bitcoins.

Ah thanks. But now I have a question : once connected the ledger to the greenbits wallet it shows a balance of 0, while it displays the right amount on mycelium and desktop chromium app... I thought the addresses were bound to the nano and not from the different app ? Am I doing/understanding wrong ?

Count me on this decision. There is also mBTC for milli bitcoins.

Shit is going to hit the fan and people are fearing it.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:23:44
The incoming fork and block size debate ? The rise of alt coins ? Nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:35:14
Yes if you like the risk to buy on the top of the bubble. Yes if you are holding for a long time.
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:41:06
This is the third big bitcoin bubble. Maybe we are only halfway through, or it's already on the verge of collapse, nobody knows...
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:58:29
In the next cycle, probably. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:24:20
What about the UAHF ? is Bitmain powerfull enough to do a 51% attack ?
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:04:32
I recieved my Ledger Nano S.  Sleeck design and works perfectly.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:22:00
Wait few months for the start of the next cycle.(To mars ?)
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:44:41
We can't really deny this is the third big bitcoin bubble,  it might rise further tho.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:54:10
Just a pro tip : don't invest on the top of a bubble.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:26:00
Yes, look at what happened to MT.Gox.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:47:27
Tldr, use a ledger nano S.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:48:00
Remember you don't have them until you draw them.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:58:37
That's the trick, nobody knows :D
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:54:07
I'm not bubble expert but I would argue we are reaching the top of the 3rd big bitcoin bubble. If you are a holder , no problem, just be patient until the next big wave ( To mars ?) But if you bought just before the burst, prepare your jimmies to be rustled.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:57:42
Store your Bitcoins on a hardware wallet, like the ledger nano S. But they are all out of stock at the moment.
