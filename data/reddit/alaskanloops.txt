This will be a good filter on which blogs to unfollow.  Just read several headlines around the lines of "Satoshi unmasked at last" by what I thought were reputable sources of information.  
If they're wrong on this, I wonder what else they're wrong on?

To make it look like they're putting more money on the table then they actually are?
Not saying that's what I think happened, just stating one reason.
