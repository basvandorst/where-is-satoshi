You say that like Kim Schmitz is totally cool to do business with? The same Kim Schmitz that was convicted of insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement multiple times in multiple countries? The one that tried to fake his suicide to avoid punishment?

The biggest shift to the culture was caused by the various surges in price. Interest in bitcoin was first dominated by people attracted because of the philosophical/political/economic attributes. When other folks noticed that something that used to be worth pennies was now worth hundreds of dollars, the greedy get-rich-quick people piled on, followed by the scammers preying on them. Also quite a few criminals became interested, the type who sell illegal stuff online and the criminal gangs behind ransom malware.
Anyway, I think you'll find that 90% of people involved in and interested in bitcoin now are just looking to profit from it and have no interest in the original political ideas behind it or care about centralization at all.

Building payments into the browser is such a horrible idea. Browsers are known to be ridiculously insecure and full of holes while still being the  target for internet hacks through phishing, malware exploit kits, etc. Nobody involved in Brave has any professional experience dealing with malware, fraud, or other types of abuse.
If you feel like using this, only give the browser access to a tiny amount of bitcoin that you don't mind losing.
