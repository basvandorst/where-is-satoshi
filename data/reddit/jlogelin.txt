Not to mention an economic tether to real world resources through proof of work.

Bitcoin is backed by Proof of Work which is an economic tether to the price of electricity.

Another way to centralize portions of the ecosystem. WBTC in its current form is bullshit. If you look at the Smart Contract code, you’ll see all sorts of centralized “administrative” functionality that essentially allows the custodian wallets the capability to hold your bitcoin, reverse transactions and completely shutdown the contract altogether.
There is actually a lot of value in Bitcoin tokenization within other ecosystems like Rootstock and Ethereum. Being able interact with, lets be honest, richer smart contract platforms and services will only underscore Bitcoin’s viability and utility. ( not to mention 10 second transaction times when using tokenized Bitcoin )
However, there are ZERO reasons to use centralized custodians to provide BTC value transfer. We have had cross chain swaps for years - there is no reason not to use them when moving value to and from the Bitcoin blockchain in a decentralized manner.

Curveball: the Bitcoin development community builds a decentralized, privacy-first social network that uses the one true “global coin”.

When you are ready, you won’t need to sell it back for inflationary fiat.
It’s still early so people see Bitcoin in terms of its fiat USD value. Try to instead to view this measurement as a means to determine its current buying power. For example, how many bitcoins would I have to pay for an apple. In 2009 the answer to that question might have been 1 or 2 bitcoin. Today, you can buy a tanker container of them for 1 Bitcoin.

Oh I understand. So the wallet software itself is/was vulnerable because it uses a third party library with a built in backdoor - deployed by the hacker. Yikes.

This feels like lipstick for “Komodo’s blockchain is centralized and not not trustless”. I’m glad the users got their money back, but what does it say about the security of the chain if devs can backdoor it and do what they want with funds?

Why do the fees have to be sooooo ridiculously high? These things are magnitudes more expensive than regular ATMs and they have literally zero backend infrastructure to maintain. Someone really needs to disrupt this.

Can confirm. Our Canadian money even looks like Monopoly money. Long live Bitcoin!

Thank you for educating me on the topic. I was a little off the mark when I said no Backend infrastructure. What I meant was the blockchain infrastructure is decentralized and requires no maintenance or adjudication from the vendors perspective.  Of course you need to maintain the machines themselves.
The fees are still waaaaaay too high. Normie adoption will never happen at current rates.
I don’t get why I would need to pay 8-15% above market rate to buy Bitcoin at an ATM. I’m asking seriously, why so high? Machine maintenance? Vendor fees? Traders fees? How are taking all of these large middleman cuts different from traditional shitty banking infrastructure? It’s disappointing, to say the least, when I try to sell my friends on Bitcoin and hit these kind of barriers.
Educate me further, please. I’m a huge fan of Satoshi’s vision, I would love to see a network with reasonable rates. Why can’t his happen?
