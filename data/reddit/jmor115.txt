While my whole speech wouldn't be investment based (as it shouldnt), I think it would be wrong to not at least mention the possibilities of investing in bitcoin. I do greatly appreciate all the video links though and will most definitely make use of those.

Hey man, fellow LSU Business student here who would love to get involved in crypto/blockchain at school. Care to PM me more info??

I will definitely do that, the only thing that makes me pretty confident I sent it to the wrong address is I dont see any pending balances when I check my breadwallet address on blockchain.info. I already sent coinbase an email and I will call them tomorrow. Thanks for the help!

I sent them an email and Im going to call them tomorrow, thanks.

You wont get more than 8 connections until you have 100% of the blockchain downloaded

@_date: 2017-09-05 17:24:03
