If there is an orphan there is also a valid block. There will always be 1 block approx every ten minutes. no matter how many orphans are produced.

the fees you'd have to pay to wire some Chinese miner money to buy them.  
if there only was a way to send money worldwide, almost instantly, with low to no fees.... shit

@_date: 2016-03-05 15:07:12
It's like saying that we have to lower difficulty because there are just too many invalid hashes
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:12:23
It's always a lotto
@_date: 2016-01-24 08:06:51
And they will have to. Just because there is extra space, doesn't mean that it's free.
@_date: 2016-01-14 05:47:32
There is a fee market.  
Miners are free to choose which transactions they process, for whatever requirements they pick.
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:07:54
That's not correct. The amount of coins given out over a certain period of time is the same no matter how many orphans are produced.

Do people typically carry around their entire bitcoins on their phone.
@_date: 2016-03-20 07:38:27
When someone for example leaves/looses their wallet full of cash in a bar, do people claim, that we are not fit to have our own wallets to hold cash?
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:49:14
just create a mean to exchange Bitcoin to and from ISK

When he uninstalled mycelium did he lose access to any other bitcoin wallet? Smartass

Someone told me, that every lie ends with a but.
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:42:32
cost saving of 30 to 90% for something that happens once or twice every week?
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:02:06
Rly?, so there is no need to create an "eve but with bitcoin"   especially since the current one works so well
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:00:22
You can save your bitcoin in fiat money, like USD, that way they'll have always the same value
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:17:57
... and promoting scams?

I'd rather take my financial advice from the movement of the planets
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:03:46
So it's safer, easier and cheaper to just hire an lawyer.

You can check if electrum is creating the correct addresses from seed with  on the same offline machine
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:30:11
I bet it isn't true

Don't forget 1.5 million to secure the code

How would that work?  
Edit: created an account, pretty straight forward, thx

Do you feel that cc payments are instant?  
EDIT: cc = credit card
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:00:45
Sure, for slock.it
@_date: 2016-05-09 05:42:18
Why?   
That's almost too careless to believe. A simple sync with IMAP would have been sufficient.
@_date: 2016-05-15 18:36:31
I bet most, if not all google results for blockchain, are scams
@_date: 2016-05-12 20:29:06
Crypto locker victims etc

It takes one to know one

That's the smartest way in the long run

i can't trade in person.  
i want to pay a friend in china. and since i have btc, i hoped there is an easy way to transfer money
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:19:59
What benefits would I have in buying it with bitcoin vs fiat?
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:17:36
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:18:49
you can't read two sentences but are a financial genius.  
feel free doing whatever.

@_date: 2016-07-30 20:03:42
a chain forks.  
you make a transaction.  
a node relays the transaction to both chains.  
your transaction happened on both chains (even when you didn't intend to..)
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:18:39
That's different to what he says, and the principle still holds.
@_date: 2016-07-31 07:11:46
Why? What you are saying is that you can't afford the bitcoin you are holding.  
That's dangerous for any investment since you are to dependent on price and should be avoided.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:04:20
I bet they will exit scam in 2016.
@_date: 2016-07-10 08:31:58
Hi there. You should supply following information.  








@_date: 2016-07-19 09:05:27
Since he has invested so much money into it and brought in other people, he is dependent on it not being a scam. The alternative would be he lost a good chunk of his retirement to a scam and in return scammed other people to further his investments into it.
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:48:32
You're an idiot
@_date: 2016-07-16 21:30:47
The difficulty is set so that there will be a valid block every ten minutes on average.  
If more people mine / the mining hash rate rises without adjusting the difficulty we would have a increasingly faster rate in which blocks are found until there would be thousands and millions of blocks every second and every miner would mine their own fork since there wouldn't be enough time to transfer and establish a leading fork/chain
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:30:27
You should think more in terms of fiat and in percentages of your overall retirement/wealth.  
For example:  
You plan to save 10-20% of your income for retirement.  
Your risk assessment tells you that you can do out of  that 80% traditional stuff 5% single stocks and 15% bitcoin.
