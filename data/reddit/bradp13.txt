You clearly have no clue what inflation even means.

Does VoS allow you to cash out bitcoins to CAD and withdraw? I've been looking for a way to cash in some bitcoins for awhile now.

This has to be the most retarded thread I have ever seen.

Does this work for Canadians? I'm looking for a fast way to sell some bitcoin.

~~ChangeTip says "TIP DELIVERY BUG" for some reason.~~
Edit: Scratch that, everything seems fine now. Thank you.

As soon as i saw that OP was QuickBT I was sold. I've used QuickBT many times and they've always been great. I'll be giving this a try very soon. 
I have to ask though, what about MasterCard?

*Fully topped-up. Time for tipping!*
I'll add that I transferred bitcoin from another wallet, if that makes a difference.

Perfect! Thanks.

Yeah I didn't even know there was a limit tbh. I just setup my changetip account and sent over some BTC from another wallet.

QuickBT. No ID verification, interac e-transfers. My transactions usually go through in 15mins. Absolutely love it. I was put on the VIP list awhile ago so I'm able to get 0.5 at a time.

I just ordered regularly and they saw that my transactions were going through. Also I messaged the owner on reddit asking for a higher limit.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:55:59
If I did want to sell, what would be the best way for a Canadian?

Alright I just setup the Google Authenticator. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:40:43
That's what I figured.

Should I hold my bitcoins in my cavirtex account? The wallet thing is kind of confusing.
