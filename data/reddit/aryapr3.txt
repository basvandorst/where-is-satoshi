And a late merry Christmas to you too! (I swear i'm not just here for the free BTC c: )
My id on your site is Account Id: 92893, thanks so much for the generosity!
My favourite moment for Bitcoin for 2015 wasn't a particular moment, but rather starting to see local retailers in my area start to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. As someone who's had an eye on BTC i'm really glad that its growing and becoming adopted as a legitimate currency, and i'm even starting to use it regularly when shopping at certain places in my area!
In terms of 2016, i'd like to continue to see Bitcoin become accepted internationally, and to be honest i'm curious as to the possibility of other altcoins gaining traction like BTC has!
Thanks again, and merry Christmas.

Which, coincidentally, is exactly what happened in this post lmao.

Just keep in mind that we are still in the infancy of Bitcoin, and eventually, just like fiat, there will be more implementations put in place to mask the complications for the average user. Most people don't understand how their money works, they just know how to use it, because over many many years refining the use of fiat to make it easier, it is now essentially, for lack of better terms, idiot proof.
I do believe that one day, perhaps even soon, Bitcoin will be the same way, and only the people who care to understand some of the obscurities of Bitcoin will be required to do so.

No way to say this without it sounding corny but it really does feel like yesterday that .1 Bitcoin was like 25 bucks, I still think "why is this significant enough to post" when I see threads like this and it takes a second for the fact that 
.1 btc is 1k USD now. Insane.

This is actually a pretty clever way of spreading the word with added incentive, probably doubles as great conversation if there's any interest. Good stuff.

Welcome to any cryptocurrency community / forum ever, where very few people know what they're talking about and the ones that don't become easily misguided by comments like the one above that throw around financial jargon and buzzwords to sound convincing but actually make little to no sense. 
This is one of the biggest hurdles preventing people from getting involved with cryptocurrencies right now and learning to use them, we've basically made a culture out of perpetuating ignorance in favor of embracing delusion since every other person thinks this is just a vehicle for them to invest whatever funds they have and get rich quick.

I'm not really interested in your credentials or past statements, I'm saying that the one I'm referring to makes no sense and that should be brought into question.

If you are asking if you literally have to do anything or if you can just do the bare minimum and hold your bitcoin on your ledger, the answer is no you do not have to be running a node and you can just hang on to your bitcoins.

After we see PoS it's often speculated that the amount of Ether in circulation will cap around the 100,000,000 mark, from my understanding.

You have a gambling problem because you have an addiction. If you were good at it, you wouldn't be turning to reddit constantly to borrow money to such an extent that you've been shadowbanned in the past from a subreddit that is meant for asking to borrow money.
To add to that, if you were credible you wouldn't cite your post karma as some sort of testament to your credibility knowing full well that over 80% of your post karma comes from a post you made not even 24 hours ago of some girls tits, and ironically that post itself was removed from the subreddit because her tits were fake. 
I'd strongly advise that you get some help and stop panhandling and at this point the only reason i'm still replying is because your delusion is genuinely disturbing to me. 
"I have a gambling problem because i'm good at it." and a quick skim through your post history would raise anyone's eyebrows.

In case anybody here is stupid enough to pursue this, consider that all of this guys karma is post karma that comes from posting on softcore porn subreddits, which is a surprisingly common way of quickly inflating your accounts karma. OP also has a history of asking for loans on reddit, and is now asking you for a considerable amount of a currency that by nature is easier for him to run off with than any other form of payment, to gamble with.
OP you obviously have a pretty serious gambling problem on your hands if you're having to grasp for straws to the point where you're asking for people to send you Bitcoin to gamble with and promising returns reinforced solely by your Reddit karma lmao

Was just introduced to QuadrigaCX recently by a friend after having issues making transactions with other exchanges during the recent surge of popularity we've been seeing. My experience was pretty seamless with them and I'd definitely recommend them as an option.

Bitcoin itself is more comparable to a "high risk high return" investment, taking you up on something like this regardless of your intention would just be naive and i'm still fairly convinced you've got a gambling problem on your hands.
I'm not looking to connect or invest in your escapade, just trying to educate others on the very explicit risk involved considering how impulsive and disturbingly naive and trusting some people on this subreddit are.
