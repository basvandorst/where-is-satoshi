Just under 17k on GDAX actually.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:06:19
But if the value of the coins is going up as well....
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:07:47
There are a limited number of slots in the block, so if there are more transactions trying to get into a block than you have slots, you get reduced to a supply/demand problem where those who are willing to pay the most will (probably) get the slots.

Do you know if anyone is looking into creating some type of hierarchical structure to address the scalability issue? I'm thinking of something like, the main blockchain handles transactions between sub-blockchains, so that any transactions in a sub-blockchain can be isolated there, but if a transaction needs to interact with a different sub-blockchain it can be 'multiplexed' through a main blockchain transaction.
The point would be to allow the TPS to stay low on any given blockchain so that we can actually run the nodes on consumer hardware, otherwise, it's looking like an arms race to massive data centers.

Looks like nom flashbacks.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:18:00
It's a pun, so both.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:36:14
Sub-trees/chains most likely. Probably similar to existing "central banks".
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:54:21
This is exactly wrong though.
CC companies (at least the ones that are now allowed to be banks, and possibly the non-bank companies (do any of them still exist?)) *can* create currency on-demand, and in a very obfuscated manner. That is the power granted-to/usurped-by banks.
On the other hand Bitcoin production is set to a fixed timetable that is widely known.
So, you just need to flip your understanding of Bitcoin and traditional fiat currency.

Every transaction does not need to be kept track of forever. [Please see section 7 of the Bitcoin paper, "Reclaiming Disk Space"](


it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.


generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = **4.2MB per year**. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:21:27
Miners are commodities. They won't really be able to restore anything. Everyone else can just add more power to the network to reduce their control.
It is believed that the transaction fees will be very close to the cost of the electricity to power the network.
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:20:12
I think you only need to keep track of the "active coins", why do you need to know all the "spent coins"? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:45:16
Core coin/chain is just an historic anomaly.
BU is real Bitcoin; it's just that the miners have been colluding on a block size. Once miners realize the situation, you'll see the block size float.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:52:55
Don't need to? BU seems to be going live soon.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:19:30
By my reading, there is no real need for a max block size.
Why do we need one?
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:15:06
What is a BU coin? One that was included in a block larger than 1MB? That sounds like a Bitcoin per the paper.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:06:00
I think pre-paying could be a serious solution here. You already largely know what you are going to be buying the in the next 10 minutes - few days, why not pay ahead of time and not deal with payment at the time of pickup?
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:17:01
If you can mine 6 blocks faster than the network, then you should be able to beat the network all the time (ie. you are the network).
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:02:10
My understanding is that there can be any number of chains that people may transact upon.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:08:46
Where is max block size in the [Bitcoin paper](
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:54:35
So they only have to download a 1MB unit, but 2MB is too much? Who would have to download a 1PB blockchain?
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:59:57
17 hours later and hashrate is less than HALF of peak. 49.72% by my calculations.

Checked the FAQ in the sidebar and the word 'tax' doesn't even appear.
Can you link me to one of the thousand+ posts addressing the issues about income taxes I asked about?
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:12:56
What rule am I not following?
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:00:13
I'm mostly interested in the answer for the US as that is where I'm likely to be doing business, but I'm also interested in hearing about how it works in other places.
My reading of the tax code says that what is due to the government is a portion of the income received. If the income received is Bitcoin, then the tax should be paid in Bitcoin, I believe. Automatically slicing transactions up into 'tax' and 'after-tax' accounts seems like the ideal situation. Then the 'tax' account can be sent directly to the taxing agency (or, the transaction could send directly to the agency).
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:24:09
My understanding is that it is. A SegWit transaction can be taken to the main chain (not the SegWit chain) for claim by anyone, can it not?
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:04:56
fallacious spam response. must be on an Internet forum
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:03:59
I think if you can download a 1MB chain, you could probably download a 2MB chain. Are mining rigs really that limited in memory?
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:47:21


Yes, that is what I meant.


The pre-segwit chain will have tons of free coins at some point though. Why do you think  pre-segwit nodes will be outmined?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:30:01
Should be "of", not "off".
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:09:29
Well, I searched and didn't find answers to my question.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:10:06
What is the difference between a SegWit transaction and an anyone-can-spend transaction?

It's the pop-psych word of the decade. Therefore it will be brought up in most Internet discussions about humans.
@_date: 2017-04-21 22:11:35
Price rises? Bitcoin needs no price denomination, you can already transact with it directly. No imtermidiary currency is necessary. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:18:54


Right, so that means you can spend the coins from an original client when original clients control the majority of the hash power.


It depends on how the rules changed the protocol. SegWit changed anyone-can-spend coins for some reason
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:08:32
I'm not talking about sybil nodes, but nodes with real-hashpower.
If original clients were the majority hashpower then it would actually be segwit that would fork off the main chain (ie. greatest work): 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:22:43
It would be invalid on the minority network, but the majority network would work as it was originally designed.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:58:56
I don't think a hardfork is required. The current chain is still valid with the original clients, right? All that's required for the SegWit coins to get spent is basically for original clients to be the majority hash power.
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:55:38
Why can't everybody do it?
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:36:08
Well SegWit seems to be mostly unused. Is there a way to know what clients are in use? Maybe original clients are the majority?
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:20:54


To get a coin with witness data attached.


So, you're saying it's not possible? Couldn't the witness trackers recover a/the witness and put it back in? Or are the coins forever vulnerable to a chain fork to a prior protocol version?
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:20:22


Maybe currently. Could change in the future though.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:43:15


If segwit was a softfork, then it shouldn't be a hardfork to remove it. It merely requires reversion to the prior protocol. segwit-come-segwit-go


Even if I'm running an original client?


So, you're saying that an original client wouldn't validate a segwit coin being sent to any address?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:45:40
More likely that bitcoin cash will become the dominant chain, I think. Though, that would probably make it easier to unsegwit the current mainchain.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:56:24
I'd look for a credit union first.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:40:08


Yes, per the whitepaper diagram, Segwit 'witnesses' are no longer part of the mainline merkle tree of transactions, but an alt-tree off the first transaction (according to the first diagram).
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:23:15


That may be the current situation, but it is not guaranteed to be the situation going forward.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:45:56
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:14:22
Do you have a protocol diagram? My understanding is that Segwit is not chained per the whitepaper (ie. is altchain).
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:19:40
The whitepaper shows no such thing:
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:02:40
The signatures are in the transactions, so they are directly part of the hash tree. The 'witnesses' are only indirectly part of the first transaction hash, apparently.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:23:40
It's a good question. Why would anyone use segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:14:25
Sorry, I should have linked you to the full document. Check here: 
A transaction includes a signature: 
The diagram explaining the 'Longest Proof-of-Work Chain' simplifies its representation of transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:45:13
Most people aren't running a full node right now, are they? I'm talking about a situation where the original clients become the majority of the hashpower.
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:59:54


No, the signatures are not in the transaction hash merkle tree, but are in some other new tree.
Why do you think old clients don't see any signatures attached to Segwitcoins? Because they are on an altchain.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:49:25
If prior clients become the majority hashpower (which don't recognize the altchain), all Segwitcoins may be claimed by anyone.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:16:41
Yes, the diagram shows Segwit is an alt-merkle tree (aka altchain).
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:37:14
Couldn't things be pushed onto the BCH chain?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:58:57
Like, what?
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:39:11
Governments can't shut down Bitcoin (unless they go to war with the network, at least, in theory) so they are mostly irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:49:40
You don't need a higher cap. You just double the block production rate (ie. drop the difficulty) while halving the coins generated per block and you get twice the transaction throughput (ie. 2MB of transactions every 10 minutes). 
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:19:04


This is false. Just look at a bank's outstanding loans vs. outstanding deposits. If what you said is true, loans should be equal to or less than deposits. In fact, you will find a 9:1 ratio of outstanding loans : outstanding deposits.
Banks are privileged in that their "loans" actually create money that didn't exist before.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:17:05
How does this contradict what I said?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:46:59


Over where?
It is very simple to determine that banks do not loan their depositors' money. They loan out multiples (9x is standard) of their total deposits. That is an impossible situation if loans are made from depositors' money.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:53:58
Bitcoins are finite and irrecoverable. They cannot be fully guaranteed.
