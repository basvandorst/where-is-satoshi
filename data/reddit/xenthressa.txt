I don't believe this is the case as I did not have a Coinbase account at the time I received this mail but have an upvote for bringing this to attention.

Same, although not weekly.

Oooh fancy. 
Do imagine there will be some sort of verification built in, can only imagine the number of scams waiting to happen if it's really just a nod.

Err, that should be BGP *Hijacking*.

Ask yourself:
Has something broken the fundamentals of the blockchain?
If the answer is no, then hold. If the answer is yes, then panic sell.

The rampant sexism on this subreddit is appalling.

So which psychedelic drug were you on when you made this video?

Thank you, curious to experiment with colored coins.

I got one too. Surveymonkey seems like a legit service and the mail headers do prove it was sent from avonandsomerset.police.uk  
Seems legit, just weird that they would use a hashtag as the subject and put links in it.
Haven't clicked anything yet though, came here looking for other people who received this mail.

Muy bueno! If you can still deliver it for 12$ to Europe I'll hit you up once I get verification from others in the thread that the QR codes are indeed working without a hitch.
Nice idea!

I thought we were gonna stop with the stupid gifs and meaningless posts?

Storing data in the blockchain you say?

Hope I'm not too late: 
Convinced me to finally make a reddit account haha

Could you possibly put another pub address (altcoin of choice) on the other side?
