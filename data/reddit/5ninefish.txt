Looks like I'm in the same boat. I tried withdrawing right when they opened yesterday, and as of now over 24 hours later still unable due to my BitGo wallet being frozen. 
I also got that same standard email from BitGo support. The funny thing is, I only have a tiny amount of BTC in a BitGo wallet. So because of a BitGo wallet containing a small portion of my funds being frozen, everything else gets frozen as well. 
I've seen multiple replies from regarding 2FA authorization and login difficulties, but nothing regarding this problem - just silence. I also posted this issue on the Bitfinex blog, and it got removed. 
At this point it feels like there is a game of hot potato going on, and some of us are going to be stuck with it in the end.

"Notice: Your account is currently restricted from withdrawing because your BitGo wallet is frozen and accurate accounting can not be determined for your balances." How did my Bitgo account get frozen?

All the above happened to me as well - wrong upload, reupload, etc etc. I also got the "apologies, your original was valid" from Finex as well. Also just had my funds moved out of Bitgo. Hoping for some good news from Finex soon.

I got one email saying that they are doing everything possible to resolve this. In retrospect, I guess this was a smart play on their part. Release some of their members to withdraw their funds, but retain others to avoid complete shutdown.

Yup. I got the exact same message from Ninel of Bitfinex.

I wish they could at least let me do some margin lending so I could recover some of my losses while I'm forced to wait around with a 'frozen wallet.'

Ah, missed your post. I deleted my duplicate.

Any word on why Bitgo wallets are frozen and not allowing us to withdraw any funds?
