Well this plot is very misleading. Take a look at the original [plot]( and you will see that there are definitely many "hubs" as you call it, e.g. the nodes *SLEEPYARK* and * Why would you distort the picture such that it fit's your narrative? No matter if people are for or against LN, this is just plain manipulative and unscientific.

Thank you for clarifying this. 


do you mean 1 sat or 1sat/byte?
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:30:56
You mean because the [fee of one transaction with just 4 hops]( **after** opening the channel is still 20x the [mean fee of bitcoin cash]( According to [this article]( the mean number of hops could even be 3 times higher than this example, thus probably making the fee even higher. Sure, go right ahead summon them all, they probably would love to see this. I am not against bitcoin but your example really does not hold up. Also instead of downvoting or banning this I would really like to have an explanation for this. **This is not FUD, I am just trying to understand this**.

We already started roughly half a year ago... You don't need to agree with it's supposed leaders (I don't) but it just works as it's supposed to work. 
Edit: To clarify that, I am not against second layer solutions. But for any second layer solutions, base layer transactions have to work reliably. A second layer should not be used to fix the broken base layer. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:59:14
So you paid 13 cents for a lightning transaction after the channel was opened? 
Am I misunderstanding something, could you clarify maybe? I thought lightning transactions were with lower fees?
Also please don't ban or downvote this, it is a legit question I am trying to understand.

Firstly, did you comment on the wrong comment? I didn't say anything about soft forks or anything... But for the sake of the arguments and since this is more entertaining than my actual work I will answer :-)
Your posts claims that the motivation of the miners to reject Segwit was for profit. Well if some of them even switched to a chain where the fees are even lower, that can't be entirely true. In my opinion they simply wanted bigger blocks and segwit is a simple accounting trick that does not really solve the problem (and is actually quite dangerous, e.g. Luke Jr. agrees with this). 


Like who? I think a large portion of this awful discussion is because people assume bad intentions in every other player. Why can't people accept that other people have other opinions? I for example believe that on-chain scaling is the way to go and switched over to the other chain (there, I said it) because I think it is the more reasonable approach. Does that make me one of the "bad guys"?

There is none. Bitcoin ABC is simply the most lightweight and used one.

Thank you for this, I was not aware of that. I will read about it in depth.


Wouldn't you agree that BTC currently could handle much more than 1MB blocks? The 1GB was with some minor changes to the client and on mediocre hardware. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:12:45


No but the other big ones are also controlled by Theymos afaik. I was just pointing out that it is slightly hypocritical to post about the censorship resistance of something, on a heavily censored medium. 


Beside the Craig Wright thing I personally believe that Gavin is the only guy who always remained unbiased and civil (Edit: I got to add Andreas to that list). His (in my opinion very good) proposals among many others: Bitcoin XT, BIP 101 (somehow related), Graphene, Storing the UTXO as a bit-vector etc. I guess we can disagree if Bitcoin XT is a good idea but all of the slander they had to take (especially by guys like Adam Back), basically nothing turned out to be true. 
About the Craig thing: I am really undecided on that. I do believe that Craig Wright has interesting opinions, especially about the economics of bitcoin in a way I never thought about it: but after all I don't believe he is Satoshi. But I don't see any reason why Gavin would lie about that. I think he simply tricked him somehow. 


Short answer: on-chain. Long Answer: Of course we will need to scale off chain at some point. Especially for applications where security hardly matters for small values (e.g. IOT as a buzzword). But I do believe that a second layer can not fix a broken base layer. For any second layer approach base layer transactions need to work flawlessly (which they don't in my opinion on BTC, paying &gt;10$ fee is breaking the idea of it). 
About the rest: I never said that Blockstream is the devil or trying to control BTC: I just meant, that I personally don't trust them and I think they are the only reason why we have so many alts and BTC forks and they damaged BTC (beyond recovery imho). The fact is: Bitcoin is not what it once was and lost a lot of momentum. I personally do not think that BTC can regain that in any way. With the current trenchwar they can't increase the blocksize without being totally hypocritical (at some point they have to). Check out the number of transactions, they have decreased to a level of 2 years ago... that is a lot of lost users (at least to me the data looks like that). 


It has 0 competition. There are virtually no other clients. As a comparison BCH has 6(!!!) independently developed clients. I personally think that competition always improves the entire system. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:11:48
I invite you to repost your post on the other sub to discuss it freely. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:11:59
And I, as vivid supporter of the coin that shall not be named, agree with you. They should not sell it as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:59:48


No. But it serves as a platform for the discussion which drives part of the "user consensus" (in lack of a better word), leading to people getting bashed who propose new (in my opinion very good) ideas like Gavin Andresen or Mike Hearn. So basically: **who controls the narrative of BTC has some loose control over the protocol by socially engineering its users opinion.** 


Two things, firstly: was there ever any evidence that the ASIC-boost actually works and produces any advantage (I honestly don't know and would be interested in any proof). Secondly (assuming it works), what is wrong with decreasing the energy consumption? I do agree that patenting this technique (should it really give any benefit) is not very moral. 


If there are people of opposing opinion and the maintainers simply refuse to merge their ideas it does matter. In the end these people simply hard forked, so now everyone got what they wanted (except a hard fork, no one wanted that).
I must admit that my point that mostly Blockstream has commit rights does not hold true anymore. In my defense it was the case at some point, but I hadn't checked for quite some time.


Have you tried it or just read on Reddit that it sucks? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:16:48


Only if the increase in blocksize dramatically outpaces the growth in bandwidth, storage and computational power. I made an estimation that in a worst case my current computer (from which I am writing this response) could handle ~50MB blocks without any changes to ISP or computer. Probably even more but it is a worst case. That is half of the TPS of PayPal.  Until 50MB Blocks are reached, there will be better computers, better bandwidth etc. As an example the world record in 2013 in bandwidth was 86mbps. Now 100 mbps is pretty much standard all over Europe. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:22:17


That is definitely correct. But that is a problem of any blockchain, and there are not infinitely many transactions. 
Well my &lt;1000$ computer could run up to 50 MB blocks **today** without any changes to hardware or my ISP. That is nearly half of PayPal Transactions. Until any chain reaches that, the technology might be extraordinarily better. 
Edit: To make my point 100% clear, **yes infinite scaling on chain is not viable, but if the growth of the number of transactions does not outpace Moores Law significantly, on chain scaling works.**
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:39:35
Firstly, (sad that I have to say this) thank you for not banning me. It is important to have an open discussion.


Whatever I said, you wouldn't believe me anyway.


I made a worst case test for every 5 minutes, so it even goes beyond that. 


Hm, I tried that roughly a week ago and it does in fact work (at least for me). 


Yes people with a Raspberry Pi would get kicked off the network. But hardly anyone runs a full node anyway. Even if, I estimated that for 100 MB Blocks running a full node would cost as much as my car insurance (only that it "insures" my money which is far more important). But I can't see the point why I should pay a huge fee simply because people want to run a full node on their Raspberry. 
 &gt; I make a block and send it to you, you successfully download and validate it in 1 minute, you send it out to other peers now they have to do the same, until it reaches everyone.
The new block is broadcasted to every node, not sent node by node. 
 &gt; Do you mine? Do you have a miner running at home?
No, it's simply to loud, my cats get scared :-) And on top of that I am not sufficiently rich to make it economically reasonable. I do run a full node however, just for the coin that shall not be named in this sub. 




That assumes that it takes 3 minutes to propagate the block to all miners. If we had 50 MB Blocks today, that might be true (A wild guess from my side, it depends on the miners), but until then there is a lot of time. As an example, in 2013 some small village in Romania reached the top internet speed of 85 mbps (see [here]( above that speed is pretty much standard in Europe today.

I do by the way. I did not say anything about competition, we should let them compete for all I care for (which is currently happening). I think you slightly misinterpreted the context of my comment. The Post said that "Big Corporate Miners refusing to activate segwit because it would reduce transaction fees". But this can not really be true for all of them, since some witched to the other chain where they earn even fewer in fees. 


I was not aware that Gregory Maxwell revoked his commit rights. I already apologized for my mistake in another comment. Sorry again.


I think no one knows what their goal is. But I don't think that having a fixed reference client with at least questionable governance (can we at least agree on that point?) is damaging the "ecosystem". The number of transactions for example is as low as January 2016... That is not good IMHO. 


Why do you believe that? 


Well they are a for profit firm?! What do you think these kind of firms do (nothing wrong with making money btw.)?


I was not saying that. In my opinion they hinder the development of other clients, which is bad. Competition is generally what makes stuff better.

@_date: 2018-02-07 15:20:41


They successfully tested &gt; 1TB (that would be roughly above 1000000 transactions per second) So even if there is a theoretical limit, that is so long the road that you and me probably wont see it in the next 10 years. 


How do you get to this assessment if the title the inventor chose is literally "Cash system". 


Thus weakening the security. Also the smaller the time between the blocks the less scalable the chain actually gets on chain, since a large block takes longer to propagate, thus giving the miner who found the block a huge advantage. So, in my opinion 10 minutes is just fine. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:48:09

Why is it not sustainable?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:54:43
Well I believe it is the right one. Because even if you got any kind of second layer, the base layer has to work for that, which is (in my opinion) currently not the case in BTC. A good second layer approach can not fix a broken base layer. 
To my knowledge the Bitcoin chain can scale above TB blocks, which would be 1 Million transactions per second. So even though the solution is trivial, it will be sufficient. 
People will need dedicated hardware for running full nodes, as outlines by Satoshi himself: 
*Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes (miners). At first, most users would run network nodes (miners), but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.*
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:58:14
And I perfectly respect your opinion for it and I am looking forward to you writing about it. My current opinion is that the current approach of throttling the blocksize artificially to 1MB is toxic and killed BTC for good, which is why I sold all my BTC roughly half a year ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:48:58


Could you elaborate on that?

I use this account mostly as a scripting bot that measures shilling in crypto related sub to catch small projects with potential without having to read through endless articles and posts. Also it helps me understand when there are large campaigns against certain coins which might decrease the price in the future (such as Tron). What better name for such a project as a known trickster? 


Deleted my old account since I was very involved in a certain (non crypto related) sub but I simply did not have the time to proceed and it got to much work (was running and maintaining several bots that helped organise the community). So I deleted my old account such that people would not bother me further. 


I did not "piss" on anything. I just said that I don't think that parts of your argument are rational since the actions speak for different motivations (I think most miners wanted bigger blocks, not higher fees). You are the one that freaked out and became impolite as soon I mentioned the other chain. 


I did and I have. 
**The only thing you did by now, is waste my time by not acknowledging my arguments but instead being impolite and ramping about me being a "bad guy"**

Didn't some of these miners go over to the-coin-that-shall-not-be-named where the miners earn significantly less fees? 


Well isn't that ironic. Who (in your opinion) manages the reference client (check who really has commit rights (not just pull requests) and who they work for)?

No the node finished the sync a week ago. I don't really know how long it took in full since I had to stop it sometimes, but I would say roughly 4 weeks. 


Your are correct, my mistake, I checked in Andreas Book. But at least it is broadcasted to a very large portion of the network. 


Me neither and I agree that every transaction should be known.


Well I don't have the resources the make a test that anybody would care for, so rather take it as anecdotal evidence. I would have to make a testnet with multiple nodes around the world. But there are such kinds of papers, e.g. the paper by Peter Rizun. [Here is the short version of the paper as a talk](
I still think that the current 1 MB limit is not sustainable (and the market reflects that) and even though on chain scaling is no silver bullet, it is necessary up to a certain degree, which is why I switched to the other chain (as you probably already read from my comments). 
Still thank you a lot for the civil discussion, really enjoyed it.
