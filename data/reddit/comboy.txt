They are comparing it to sum of banknotes in circulation. Cash is very small percentage of money in circulation. Most fiat lives as 1s and 0s nowadays. GBP's cash is ~80bn while M4 is ~2.3T.

Bitcoinity guy here. Bitcoinity indeed fucked up.
At one point bitfinex changed what they push through their websocket without changing url or anything.  Anyway, I'm working on fix for that, and since it will also need fixing some historical trades I will surely do an announcement on bitcoinity for everybody to see with some more details (but it may take some time to recalculate old data first)
I'm really sorry about this. Incorrect data is the worst thing that can happen in my book. Even downtime is better.
edit: it's fixed now and I put up a flash with info on bitcoinity [details here](
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:18
He's right. These are faded out previous order books, e.g. from 2/4/6min ago - time delay may differ though.

Thanks for the post, I still wouldn't know..
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:12:05
Oh, that is clever. 
And it's really very doable. With this hash proof that your is balance was included, public cold storage would be enough, because I guess people would be satisfied knowing that given exchange still has 90% of users holdings. So there's no need to worry about incoming deposits being too transparent (and complications of proving hot wallet holdings)
I think I should give a shout out on bitcoinity to the first exchange that implements it.

I should probably create some annotation on the chart regarding this. It's just about my data source for which blocks belong to ghash.io. So it's not like it appeared all of a sudden, I just lack data on it's blocks before this date. Sorry about that.

@_date: 2014-01-02 11:31:24
Huh, that is a lot. Well, I'm pushing *every* market depth change on bitstamp and mtgox so that's quite a bit of data, and also every few minutes I push full market depth on mtgox which is ~50kb afair (it's in a bit lower resolution anyway than original that was over 1mb afair).
In total ~20Tb of data was sent in December. Your figure still seems high because that 1/400 of it all and there were ~4M visits. 
I don't know if people care about this kind of thing nowadays, but I can make option to disable realtime and depth, make it lower resolution and so on, and that would save you probably at least 90% of the bandwidth.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:44:30
That is a good way to make users feel more safe. Implementation doesn't seem to be very complicated, and I'll be very happy to promote you on bitcoinity if you are the first one to implement it. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:02:12
While it still requires putting some trust in your exchange, it's a [choice between crypto and 3rd party trust](
Of course for the USD (or other fiat) part, that is still a good idea.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:12:29


This would be awesome. But any idea how to implement it? I mean they can provide cold storage address and prove they own it, but how do we know how much obligations do they have? 
Also knowing sum of these obligations (if possible) also leaks some additional info. I would imagine somebody putting 20k BTC on the exchange may move the market.
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:04:31
I'm glad to see you here. I agree you still need to trust your exchange, and that there are plenty ways of screwing up when running an exchange, so one should choose wisely.
But if an exchange implements it, I'll trust it more, because there is one way less of screwing up. And I would know that something has happened when they do. There are still many ways things can go wrong, but there are less of them with this implementation in place.


I think it improves security. What security or privacy drawbacks do you see from the user perspective? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 08:59:27
I'm far from an entry website (just look at the main page) from which beginners learn about given exchange. I don't even link to mtgox. I don't have per exchange messages implemented, and I don't want to be an authorative news source, just graphs. I don't want to track every exchange and put apropriate descriptions next to them (unless there's like a list of exchanges with their descriptions on bitcoinity).
edit: Also, when you log in to mtgox there's a big red banner on top warning about that

I try to only advertise good services. They seem to be legit and caring about bitcoin future (they wanted this ad much earlier while they were lunching some new stuff and were waiting very long and patiently because I wanted to give shout out to the proof of solvency - and still they really like the idea).
I browsed some post too, I think with every bigger company at least one person will shout it's a scam, but there seem to be people who are happy with their services. If you think they are scam and you have some kind of proof or at least want to share some findings, feel free to PM me.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:39:59
Are you talking about exchanges? Because with them it's pretty obvious they store at least as many bitcoins as sum of asks in the orderbook. 
And users don't have to disclose their balance in any way. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:11:04
You can read more in the [original thread]( linked in the article, but basically:
* exchange proves it has control over at least X bitcoins (for example by providing they cold storage address and signing msg with their private key)
* with linked hash tree crypto magic it provides proof for every user (preferably automated with some user side javascript), that user balance is included in the total sum
If every user balance is included in the sum of coins they are in the control of, that means they are solvent (in BTC at least).
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:44:29
5 seconds is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:49:01
If there is a javascript in your logged in page that verifies inclusion of your balance, then it doesn't matter if only 1% will check if this javascript does what it is supposed to, because they don't know who will check it.

I don't advocate keeping your bitcoins on the exchange. It still can run away with them or lose them. 
But with this implemented, it cannot lose them and try to convince you that nothing happened hoping to earn them back through the fees. You still trust them with your bitcoins, the only thing that changes is that you know they still have them. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:01:39
I didn't really remove it. Exchanges are sorted by volume. So it disappears automagically when there's no volume. 
Regarding that some people still see it while you don't - probably cache expired already on one server but not on the other.
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:33:22


Not every. Giving away information about cold storage that would account for 80-90% funds should probably be enough. 
I understand that as an exchange you store more funds that there is sum of asks in the orderbook, but if somebody is willing to, I think he has a good chance of tracing these addresses.  So it's basically security by obscurity. Now I don't say that obscurity on top of solid security is that bad, but these are Bitcoin addresses, not physical addresses where something valuable is stored. I think [just dice cold storage]( is a nice example that it can work.
Of course I would imagine messages proving ownership to be signed offline, there's no need for private keys to touch online world.
Regarding some pool dropping transaction, transparency works both ways. It would be visible and I don't think people would want to cooperate with such pool. 


This is similar to somebody saying right now that the exchange scammed him. Unless this somebody have some trust in the community or is able to provide some reasonable proof he won't be taken seriously.
As an exchange it's really hard to select people at random not to be included and hope it works.
But most of all, doing such thing would be clear fraud by an exchange, and doing something really fishy and wrong. Close to running away with funds. Something requiring really bad intentions. On the other hand, currently if exchange funds get stolen/seized or it does not have enough coins for some other reason, then it's not really doing anything *that* evil. It kind of OK (and possible) for an exchange to stay quiet about it, which is bad for the users. 
Especially being first to do it surely is not easy. But the only real concern I see is telling people about cold storage, which I think should not be a security concern for a well designed exchange.
English is not my first language, I hope my arguments make sense and I hope being bored without freenode can also contribute some thoughts on this.

That's not enough. Imagine this:

* it gets robbed and loses 30k btc

Well, it's no more the default exchange even though it has the highest volume in the last 7 days (as I'm writing this).  That is already some "manipulation of data" on my side, which I would prefer to avoid. 
I'm just drawing charts and people vote with their money. I'd like bitcoinity to stay as objective data source as possible, even though I stated many times openly that I'm not a huge fan of mtgox.
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:42:06
It does not prove they are honest about everything. It proves  that they are in control of enough coins to cover users holdings. If that's partially because some guy is lending them his bitcoins, so be it (if he's not lending just signing the messages with his address, then he is putting his bitcoins on the line anyway, because after s**t hits the fan his bitcoins are considered to be stolen customers funds)
Same in the case of a theft. If they have enough coins to cover the stolen amount, you still may not know it happened. It's not an unconditional trust, but it clearly does improve security of your funds by making exchanges more transparent.
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:50:22

So it works more like localbitcoins, but in a more secure way. I like that very much. 
I don't know what the technical term is, but it's different from "normal" exchanges (assuming localbitcoins for example would not be a normal exchange). Too bad I didn't hear about you earlier, nice to see such well thought implementation (although obviously there are also some drawbacks). 
I didn't find any API on your page, if you provide one then I could list you on bitcoinity.

I only include votes that are actually written in blockchain blocks. So if somebody at some point said that they are supporting X, this is not included in those charts. 
Otherwise there seems to be too much heresay and uncertainty. E.g. I don't know where did KnC say to be supporting BIP 101, but they clearly put '/BV8000000/' string in their coinbase scriptSig, and only slush have produced blocks with different version in block header so far.
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:59:39


They started including that before first version of BIP100 draft? According to it, it would only allow 2MB in first step, but it's still a vote for 8M. This is clearly a format that's described in BIP100 so it seems fair to tag it as such. 
If these strings was included before draft was created and without any contact with then I think it would be a bit weird to create a BIP that interprets these past blocks as votes for it.


Yes it is, I didn't know about that and I'm about to update the chart with this info (I'll try to think about separation of these with BV in the next step). Thanks a lot for the info.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:32:11
Scroll down for the details. Basically nobody voted for anything else than 8000000 using BIP100.
There was an error after I fixed it to also include 'BIP100' string in coinbase and it was displaying these blocks as voting for some other version, sorry about that.
If any blocks appear with different size votes, I'll add a breakdown table.
@_date: 2015-08-27 10:12:22
I updated it and includes now blocks with BIP100 string in their coinbase. It changes picture quite a bit, especially when you look at [last 3 days](
Thanks again.
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:55:35
Yeah, I will sure do. 
So far I received an e-mail that, wait for it...
he will only pay, if after the payment I will display "Thank you WallofCoins" for a week on the bitcoinity
website along with the bitcoin address. This tells you something about the whole situation. In case you wonder, I don't plan to do that.
If I ever receive the payment I'll update this thread. If I would deny it, he has many e-mails signed by me with the address to prove me wrong. That's about it of my time wasted for this issue, I'm getting back to coding.
**update:** **WE DID IT REDDIT** - they just paid. Too bad it was done only to save their public image and not earlier..

I could put many types of ads on bitcoinity. But I don't want to.
So far I've been lucky enough to find sponsors that are willing to pay for the servers cost and more. Since they keep bitcoinity running, most of people who like bitcoinity also like them. So 90% of them are very happy with the results too.
Currently I paused sponsoring to make space for some features I plan to announce in the following weeks. I hope you'll like it

Because I wanted to keep my bitcoin address private. But no worries, it was posted by Robert.
@_date: 2016-02-18 21:43:16
Yes, this is how it was always done, but since they have been a long time sponsor, and since Robert personally assured me that they will pay the invoice on time, I let them do the payment later (november invoice was already with a later due date than it should have been).
Didn't want it to end up as a discussion on reddit, but after trying for months, tons of e-mails and being treated like a joke, annoucement was the last thing I could do (after warning them about it few times in January). If not for their approach to the thing (to put it that way), I would still wait patiently.

Surely there's much more to liquidity than that, and some values from the mentioned exchanges list (spread, volatility) can be used to estimate it better. 
But comparing the two, I think order book can tell you more about liquidity than volume. 
Let's say I create my new epsilon exchange. My two friends can be trading micro trades with each other at 100 trades per second and I can generate really big volume with this, even if no one else is trading. It's really hard to tell much about the situation from the outside.
But if I try to fake order book, then somebody can try to execute an order against it. If I remove it before executing his trade, then he just learned that there is something funky going on. If I don't, then there really is some liquidity.
That's some nasty behavior no my side with my epsilon exchange, but situation with legit exchange with zero fees, seems to be somewhat similar. 
I'm happy to calculate and add more indicators that can help estimate liquidity, suggestions are welcome.

How would you segment it? You can add g=number param (max 20) like that:
Then it covers all exchanges and there's no others group. I'll add some field to select it without modifying url, but in general I'm trying to keep chart as readable as possible, I thought that especially for smaller resolutions/mobile there would be too much data.
But given the comments maybe I should increase the default.
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:32:50
I didn't know the term, but yes, that's what the weights are for. It can still work to some degree, but at least somebody can test it making a single big order. In case of volume there is no way of testing it any way. It could be just 2 bots playing with each other.
You can see all exchanges on the [list]( if you want them on the chart, [here's one]( with 20 instead of 12. Below the chart you can select currency if you are interested in some specific one.
@_date: 2015-09-30 12:14:17

It's about how big amount of data is coming from exchanges, especially when you have multiple tabs. I'm working on this currently, I'll try to compact some and filter some to make it work better.

I'd say that without public mining the price should be high. Artificially limited supply. 
But yes, surely it's possible to come up with something better than the current way of calculating the market cap. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:34:43
I forgot to ping but I did do some improvements. Hope it's better now.
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:33:09
There's tons of factors that make up for a good exchange that are really hard to quantify (e.g. security).
When calculating rank currently if order book would fail to fetch for some reason, average is just made of those fetched successfully. 
I might switch that to rank being 0 for that order book, but I'm note even sure about that (e.g. site may be working fine, and maybe there were some API changes that I ignored). And to even consider it, I would need to be fetching from more locations to be sure it's not just some local issue.
I plan to add API uptime somewhere on data.bitcoinity.org though.
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:18:10
You can paginate yourself by doing next request where timestamp = max(timestamp) from the previous result (that's assuming you're going forward that is started with timestamp being 0)
@_date: 2015-10-16 17:56:34
I added possibility to link to specific sort order on the prettier list:

Hey, thanks :)
I want to keep the GUI clean so I don't think I'll add them on /markets. 5y  is available on the [data.bitcoinity.org]( 
Regarding YTD, maybe I'll just let users choose tiemespans more freely on data.bitcoinity.org, currently focusing on some other features though.
Such a long todo, so little time.
@_date: 2015-10-08 23:32:33
Not sure what do you mean, but yes, volume data is provided through their API, just like on other exchanges. Then it's stored in bitcoinity database so it doesn't matter if it's still available through API (although they provide a param to fetch all historical trades)
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:15:48
Haha, it's hard to stop when the price starts to act again ;)
Very weird that the first link wouldn't load under chrome. Maybe some http proxy at work indeed. But at bitcoinity it should fall back to polling and work anyway. 
Please drop me an e-mail at admin - bitcoinity.org if you still having issues from home, I don't have any more ideas for now, I'll debug it some more today to find out why polling feedback doesn't work. Thanks for all the testing.
If I find anything I'll also post an update in this thread.
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:12:54
Thanks, I didn't actually notice it since it's ok when loading the page. Will try to fix it with the next deploy.
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:03:14
Hmm, if last change counters goes up until red that's definitely bad. Although I cannot reproduce anywhere and based on connected users the issue doesn't seem to be affecting many users. 
I still would like to know what may be causing the problem. I guess I'll add some option for enforcing used connection data type for debugging things like these. 
Are you using https version? If yes could you try a http one? And any chance you could try under different browser? Maybe some firewall?
Under chrome this should be displaying you some live data: 
Or is this table live for you:  ?
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:05:34
Yeah I did [some rank]( and have one more completely different unpublished yet, but it's a way of comparing exchanges which are trading the same pair. 
Even when trying to use it for altcoin/btc pairs I don't think it would work very well for comparing alts. When the whole market of given coin is controlled by a few people they can draw whatever they want in order books and trade history.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:23:56
so much social pressure ;)
I'm ignoring bitfinex until they sort things out. So gifs are currently based on Bitstamp and GDAX. 
Just in case we're not stopping here, I accept gif donations (I mean donate me some good gifs, not btc) - email or reddit PM. Unfortunately not much time lately, I wish I  could already push some updates I've been working on.
@_date: 2016-05-30 09:27:12
This is not happening on Bitstamp and it's just bitcoinity bug. Really sorry about that, it's fixed now.
@_date: 2015-10-01 01:26:54
Oh I definitely agree with that. No amount of indicators can say you which exchange is objectively better. There are always many dimensions to that, and some of them, like security, are really hard to measure. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:19:46
Right, thanks a lot these are very good. For this I plan to put some price averaged from different exchanges in different color (some gray dotted line or something) where given exchange haven't yet existed. I'm working currently on making some reasonable index.

Give it to professionals. After researching them.

You still wouldn't know who's really mining them. Premine seems a bit arbitrary depending on when the coin gets promoted. Creators really have a lot of control over the price. Plus [Goodhart's law](
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:35:43
The bitcoinity guy here. I didn't make any changes. Can you describe what issue are you having exactly?
It could be that to improve performance for some, I actually should try to cut down data being sent out. I'm not limiting it in any way, and gigabit connections are far from saturated currently, but when there's a lot of happening in the market then by default bitcoinity pushes everything to the user - every depth change, every single trade.
One thing that was deployed hmm, maybe 2 weeks ago or something was addition of websocket to bitfinex. Thanks to websocket order book is now fully realtime but that of course also means more data being transferred.
Could you guys provide what exchange currency pairs are you watching, what browser/OS, and what are the exact symptoms? 
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:45:42
Thanks, I don't know how I received it since I don't have gold.
Was it about bid/ask on bitfinex? Or something else?
@_date: 2013-03-24 15:59:50
I'm sorry I read it's only about receiving.
Still though, personally I would put bitcoind on separate machine proxying it with some API that detects trying to move to many coins at once and disabling it then sending me an alert. This way if application server is compromised it doesn't mean somebody have direct access to your wallet.
Damn I thought I was reading it twice to make sure there was nothing about sending, sorry.

It may work for calories, but do you really want to wonder if you're sending all your savings as a donation or maybe just a few cents?
With calories confusion is still present. I'd say it's a nice example of a mistake that should not be repeated. 
Call it satoshis, bits, whatever you want, but 1 BTC should not be confusing.

Bitcoinity users count is also ALL TIME HIGH :]

@_date: 2013-03-20 21:20:28
It will not work well until mtgox implements it (they said they are going to, but not anytime soon). Why? Because when somebody sells shitloads of bitcoins you cannot execute any trade until their trade is finished executing. And after that happens, it's already too late (price is below threshold at which you wanted to sell).
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:59:38

Well it's the data that came from their API, I cannot remove random data points that came from exchanges since then bitcoinity couldn't be trusted.

I know nothing about HoustonBits, but please be aware that if you buy bitcoins in a form of a paper wallet, that is you get a private key, seller may still have a copy of it. So if you don't move them to your private wallet, theoretically at some point of time in the future they could move all these bitcoins elsewhere (stealing them from you). It would be extremely hard to prove that it was indeed them and not somebody else.

I did not say system of goverment is based on slevery, or admit that it is immoral. I cannot even understand to get your point. But you can try going into woods and live there doing all yourself and not depending on other people.
Personally, I like to cooperate with other people. I write them software, they build me houses. I configure their servers, they bulid me roads or protect me from somebody just taking all i have including my house by force (army, police). 
I never imagined to be on this side, I think there should be as little taxes as possible, most of them are complete b***t. But it's hard to organize society without some basic things. I cannot even think what else should be taxes used for other than army police and roads.

Yeah I do believe on the long term bitcoin network itself is for big transactions. And most of payments are going to happen on abstractions level on top of it (with instant confirmations and possibly chargebacks if that's what people need).

Wouldn't be first. 
AFAIK transactions have priority calculated, so probably you would have to be moving some big money or you would just make service worse for those that are also sending very small amounts. Probably a lot would also depend on actual size these transactions (I guess the cost would be higher if you would want to make them big).
Nevertheless interesting idea, if it would work as "advertised" you could probably slow down network for ~ 15hours at cost of $11k, I'd love to hear somebody more technical take on that.

Bar up means amount of bitcoins offered at given price increased. Bar down means it decreased. By how much? Scale on the right. 
Scale on the left is for market depth (you can see it matches with amounts you are getting when moving mouse over the chart).
Colors are to help you to know what's happening with just a glance. Green - up, Red - down.

You must trust computer on which you are running your bitcoin client (until hardware wallets are here).
So if you are unsure, just use some ubuntu or any other distribution liveusb and operate your bitcoin client from there.

I had the same thing some time ago and I was very mad about it. I registered back in 2011 and I never agreed to share my personal data. After exchanging some support messages about how they cannot blackmail me, I finally gave up and sent needed documents. After that I was able to withdraw my bitcoins.
Actually, I still am mad about it. They had completely no right to deny my money, especially that I never ever agreed to share any personal data with them (ToS was short and different back when I signed up)

Fair enough, but "Take your money out" does not sound like gathering more information. 
In general I agree with your post, however mtgox proved to be quite reliable and secure compared to other exchanges. Most people view is biased because given how big they are, you hear about each of these failures.

With real DDOS attack it's usually about saturating your internet connection, so any iptables directly on the server wouldn't really make a difference. Anyway, I do something similar like you to avoid abusers, but here traffic was cut off from me on some datacenter firewall.

Private key is 256 bits, it would be enough for you to find a collision of public key so 160 bits I guess. So all you have to do is to check ~ 2^160 combinations (simplification). Maybe somebody else can give you some fun stories about just how big this number is.

I can't do it for 1,000 because the change would already have to be present on the server, and if these 16,000 people would try to refresh the page at once no one would probably succeed. I'm trying to find a good moment to deploy another machine but it's so hard to find a nice spot for maintenance downtime ;)

I'm OK with suspicions, but please don't assume I'm *that* stupid. I'm not a smart man, but if I would want to do that, I would use some few years old throwaway (after making few random comments with it in and not an 8 hours old account. 
I would also switch address on the site to something with first transaction long time ago, but with very low balance. 4.92BTC since it was created is actually a lot! Perhaps I would add some drama with hosting costs, and how site should stay working. Oh and I would also do common typo in my nick, changing comboy to cowboy, that would be a nice final touch lowering suspicions. Damn, I'm pretty evil.

So at $200/BTC you can no longer send $0.01 to somebody using bitcoin. This will give us terrible publicity. 
First I explain to people that it's cool because you can divide it up to 8 decimal places, and now I should tell them "yeah, but there's this tiny detail, since yesterday you can only spend up to 4 decimal places"? If this has to be done it should be announced long before it's going to happen.

Yeah, everything can be zero-downtime with enough people and money. But since I'm doing it alone moving master database to another machine may require 30s downtime. It hopefully shouldn't be longer but practically may be up to 10mins.

It usually doesn't since I don't have reddit gold, but here I am.
So does anybody else experience this? Seems weird, I did not even deploy any changes in the last few days, and it displays correctly under firefoxes that I tested.
Does refresh help? Does it happen on all exchanges? Same with the light theme?

Given how much mtgox API is lagging, when you receive information about the price change it will probably be already too late to sell.

Because it's suboptimal to try to make instant transactions in a distributed way. It would be hard to go below this 30s, and with 30s you still wait 3 minutes for 6 confirmations which is way too long by today/future standards.
That's why, for quick payments, centralized abstractions built on top of bitcoin seems to be a better idea.

It's not exactly true, it could theoretically hit $90 in a very long time from now, and by then there will be more bitcoins in circulation, making this number lower.

It's rather obvious, and it's a great news that governments are starting to say that because this way they approve bitcoin as something of a daily use.
What's interesting to me is that they want to tax it as barter exchange, which would make it more cost-effective than cash for doing transactions (tax-wise).
