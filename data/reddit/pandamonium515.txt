I bought .05 just to get my feet wet last week from coinbase but I have to wait a full week before I get the funds, will I get it at the price I bought or the price its at when they promised i'd get it? also will all transactions take a week to process?

Here I am trying to get my .05 bitcoin I recently bought to go through so I can sell it to pay some bills and this guy got that much instantly I am so jealous

Heard about it a few years ago and thought it was just for illegal use so I didn't buy. Biggest regret ever. Good on you man!

I have chase and ive been doing a couple purchases a week with no problem not sure why your having that trouble

I feel you, seeing all my friends going out and buying xboxes and ps4's for black friday and me hoping someone at work will want to give me one of their shifts so I can make enough to make my house payment next month is kinda disheartening.

I'm relatively new to bitcoin but I trust the currency and can see its gonna be great in the future. If you can't say you trust it l, the fact that you asked this basically proves the point I say sell now and dont look back. 
Buying high and selling low won't get you money. This hugE price drop isn't even 2 days old and your wanting to sell give it a week before you sell. Yeah it might go lower but the price seems to be steady at what its at now.

Good time to buy?

I completely agree the thing is there's going to be a bunch of people doing it now at a bunch of sporting events or anything live.

Yeah it did with me. It seems coinbase doesn't pull the money from your account until about 2 days before you get your purchase probably to make sure they have the coin you bought

perhaps something like this could be just as/ more effective

What's a good site for quickly buying and selling? I read some sites dont let people from the us get the funds

Happened to me my account got over drafted for the difference and got a 35 overdraft fee

From my experience its usually 2 days before the transactions go through that it gets pulled. But I make sure I have the money when I buy and also make sure its there till I get my coin to avoid ovr draft fees
