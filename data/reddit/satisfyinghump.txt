Do they mean that they are going to need to register their own bitcoin wallets so that the lobbyists can bribe them using btc?
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:05:13
this is a huge compliment :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:53:24
good point, i agree with you. since this is a lawless and new system, we should come up with our new system. 
we should be the judge and jury, and determine their faith

people love misery and hate being envious. they hate they may not have gotten in on it when it was a few cents or dollars, and had to read stories of the price climbing above 1000$+
 
people I know do the same thing, they dont make it as obvious but they do ask about BTC and it's clear they know the answers to their questions, but want to see people get angry/sad about it.
 
this is just an example of the human behavior unfortunately. though i do use this as a good litmus test on who's a good person and who isn't

whats fucked up is the time the miners were seized, may have broken the guys operation, and made it no longer profitable for him to mine

heres a thought... if someone buys these stolen coins on an exchange, since coins can be traced, will the buyer need to return these coins to the rightful owner?

Does anyone have the bitcoin address(es) linked to this scam?

why do you say that?
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:10:59
it means it'll be a lot harder to have the government/police take out their frustration on miners and cryptocurrency sellers, when trying to go after people who are buying/selling illegal services/goods

imagine someone applied, got the job and then from the inside turned capital one into a giant bitcoin run company, and all of a sudden the execs realized they had become what they had hated?

What about a henna tattoo / temporary tattoo applied somewhere before you enter the resort, of a QR code, of your wallet ;)

That is such an awesome reply, and, I am now relieved :)

So this is weird... but, you wouldn't by any chance be this person in this post, would you?
 
Are you sending the money to some woman you met, that is apparently catfishing / scamming you?

Not to be a Debbie downer but your wife should learn a little street smarts and operational security and NOT tell everyone about your btc

What's the update on this? Are people being enlightened and turned away?

You may want to think about getting a QR code of your Bitcoin wallet address thats for receiving payments, tattooed on a hidden area, like an ass cheek.
 
Services are rendered, QR code is scanned, payment is sent and verified.
 
Just an idea.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:05:30
this just gave me a pretty insane idea....
  
what if you introduced all your friends and even "not that close friends" to bitcoin.
  
you can then keep an excel sheet, with their btc address and amounts of bitcoin going in and out of these wallets, and then make note of the wallets they interact with, and you could learn some nasty secrets about them

Thanks for sharing, but I at no point thought this guys, or any of these guys ethics were good.
  
I read earlier about him being responsible for the fiasco with Avalon's

glad to know i wasn't the only one that felt this way.
  
sometimes i feel like im the only one who feels a certain way, and think itd be best if i was on a station on the moon mining till i died
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:38:15
regardless of how small these stories may feel to some, considering many miss the point and to them using btc to pay for chips is nothing more then using an alternative currency, but THESE are the small steps that will lead to BTC and other cryptocurrencies being widely adopted by the world

i feel like he did that, because un like you, he treats BTC as not real money, like monopoly money.
  
i feel alot of people feel that way about btc, before learning about it, and seeing it can be used on websites like overstock.com
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:14:41
this is why there are a few top pools, because the other ones are ddosed, it sucks, because btc mining needs to become much more decntrlized
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:40:01
as opposed to how it is now?
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:45:10

a dead man switch should be installed on all websites that use bitcoins as a payment method.
  
in the event that something like this happens, the wallet which would be kept in multiple locations, would have its funds moved to another wallet, or dispersed amongst several wallets, that are well hidden and held by trusted entities.

why is it so hard to write the correct LOSE vs LOOSE...
