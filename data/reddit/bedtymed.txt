Additionally the new system operates on a queuing method as we know, and I'm sure that initially withdraws will be manually reviewed before they are processed. You can imagine that the percentage of BTC allocated to cold storage will be very high and there will be real-time reconciliations of transfers before additional transfers are permitted in order to ensure that BTC balances are perfectly confirmed with the new system in place. I think it's reasonable to see why MtGox wouldn't throw open the doors immediately.

It's clear there are buy walls in place (easy to see the chart on Mt.Gox and note how the price for long periods will not be allowed to fall below a certain level). 
It's also clear that there are large sales happening on the major exchanges (again, just check the volumes on the other exchanges, the aggregate amounts sold in large blocks roughly equal the aggregate large block buys on Mt.Gox). This may or may not be Mt.Gox, but surley these transactions are coordinated across exchanges. It looks like someone is pretty sure that Mt.Gox will be fine and is buying BTC there and selling BTC on other exchanges.

If someone has a link, you can see the transaction failure count spike a few days before Mt.Gox shut off withdrawals 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:03:39
Insider or not, I definitely agree there are coordinated buys/sells. Correlation of volumes is pretty high

Not sure, but ll the sell orders got goxxed... had to repopulate bitwisdom trade screen. First time we have seen a buy signal on the MA and MACD in 24 hours plus.

this can also be reflective of an offline agreement from Party B with Party A who has $ at Gox. Party B makes the deal with party A to buy up to xgoxBTC. Party A then accumulates up to that amount of goxBTC. The trading pattern was happening for  awhile yesterday before the temporary breakout. After which, the pattern returned to this slightly higher floor.

The key questions are "how long is 'the beginning'", "what are the limits going to be set at", and "what characteristics of current market conditions are being considered justifiable drivers of the temporary systemic limits." If Gox were in truly deep trouble, no amount of withdraw limiting would be able to address the underlying issue.

If this is true, who's buying?
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:37:06
They won't panic sell, they will panic buy. BTC will be the fastest way to move funds out. Gox price will rise higher than market on the news.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:24:08
In my view no, people were probably not holding a lot of fiat at Gox. It's slow to get money in at Gox so right now on Gox there are more sellers than buyers simply because of the friction associated with trading. The market has bifurcated into two sets and baring new information, non-traders are going to sit on the sidelines.

This may require Mt.Gox to re-index the blockchain in order to implement the fix, retest, and then launch the fix. Last time Mt. Gox mentioned the bitcoin protocol change and they were hit on the head hard. They would not have been able to say in the latest press release "hey the fix from blockchain.info wasn't quite done" as it would have seemed as though they were blaming the people they had previously praised.

Actually the BTC represents as much liability to the company as the fiat currency does in a true bankruptcy. Whether they owe a depositor a dollar, a euro, a bitcoin, or a yellow submarine it's all the same - it's a liability. Presuming the company did not have enough bitcoin on hand but has cash, the cost of replacing a bitcoin is higher than the cost of replacing dollar or euros at the moment because of the trading differences on MtGox. Therefore you'd actually be better off holding BTC than dollars or euro. In a bankruptcy the court normalizes creditors by doing their best to mark-to-market. BTC holders would be valued based on replacement value.
Let's assume for a moment that MtGox really didn't have all the BTC they should right now, if you were in Mt.Gox' position and needed to get some BTC very cheaply, what would you do?

Maybe you should spend time reading those posts. You might learn something.

Actually during the live broadcast of the Mt.Gox protest yesterday someone claiming to be Andreas Antonopoulos said that the NTxID indexing had to be re-run because there were coding errors in the new module that had been found. This is corroborative to the above, but I only now recalled. If anyone was on that live stream and remembers this, please post.

I absolutely would.

I believe they are being honest in the statements they are making. I don't believe that they have provided a fully transparent and materially complete situation report.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:54:12
In that scenario, the price will stabilize at the projected liquidation value.

I don't believe MtGox currently is 100% certain of the extent of the problem. However, I do think they likely have a worst case shortfall they are aware of before any of the above actions are taken into account. In my estiamtion there's no way this could be more than 30% BTC losses (no fiat losses). After the above actions this worst case would likely drop by half or more. Thus if 50% of funds are held in fiat and 50% in BTC the worst case exposure is 7.5% (30% worst case exposure * 50% remediation actions * 50% of assets denominated in BTC) of total assets. This would likely be covered by a 2-4 of months of trading revenue. A problem, absolutely, but even in this worst case scenario it's hardly a cause for calls of insolvency. I believe Karpeles wants to be sure he truly understands the scope after remediation before he states things as fact. That's going to be his natural tendency as an open source developer. Right now, I believe he's being as honest as he knows how.

Thought: Bank x approaches Gox and says, "Listen, I hear you may have a shortfall. Tell us the story, we'll float you the fiat, and we will arb the at a floor. We'll take x% of the BTC or a (guaranteed $ amount per BTC) we buy knowing and the difference will balance your gap."

Hang in there. I traded stock  in college and lost everything. I was loaded to the top with debt. When I graduated, I got a job on Wall Street in part because of the knowledge I gained trading stock. $7,000 sounds like a lot of money right now. In the grand scheme it's nothing compared to what is ahead if you learn from your experience. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:22:16
Precisely why they likely didn't lose more than their hot wallet. They would have continued spending from that hot wallet until every transaction from that wallet failed. This would have been a massive flag essentially saying to the Gox team that all transactions are failing.

I don't think the know the answer to the first two. I think they know the answer to the third, but clearly don't want to get any more specific at the moment. However one possibility is that openning the gates on withdraws would create a run for BTC and spike the price unreasonably high - far beyond market.

Note how the orders always come in at 261 even if they are not reflected on the book. Someone did more than put a large order in. This is a HFT with an API connection and deep pockets who is able to intercept sell orders before they fall through to lower levels. You see this in FX trading all the time.

Simple reason why even if mtgox lost money they will not fold: they are the only ones who can play the arbitrage game with MtGox given the withdraw holds. If they actually did lose anything they will play this game until balances are restored. You think that's air you're breathing?
Here's how it would go: sell a stack from the house account. Press release price drop. Buy back on house account. Fix issues. Test. Open the doors. Problem solved. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:09:34
1. Gox is trading. It doesn't need to open back up.
2. Don't assume everyone or even a majority of account holders who want to get BTC out of Gox wants to get out of BTC. 
3. Gox will not allow all BTC to leave at once per their press release. Those who want to pull out will leave at a controlled rate.
There are so many ways out of this for Gox, assuming they lost significant amounts of BTC:
1. They buy BTC cheap on their exchange right now and arbitrage with other exchanges.
2. They buy GoxBTC through 3rd party contracts like bitcoinbuilder.com or other offers.
3. They deal with a 3rd party financier who floats a debt instrument to allow them to buy BTC as a backstop.
4. They sell the company or a portion of it with the new owners bankrolling any shortfall. 
I'm sure there are others I am missing.

1. You don't send out memos to people with this information. 
2. You don't send out memos in companies with 20 employees.

This is a separate bug from the transaction malleability issue. End result is the same and contributes to invalid transactions, but is not the root cause they've been talking about. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:55:32
Not making excuses, just trying to determine the most likely explanation for what we are seeing. MtGox has not provided the strongest PR in the past, but at least this time they are doing something very important: they are stating a series of facts, committing to a communications timeline, and most importantly following through. This is foundational. I would also like to see more complete information from the company earlier, but I can wait if it means that they are holding back for important reasons.
