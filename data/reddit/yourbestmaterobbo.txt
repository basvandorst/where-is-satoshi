ive had rescue dogs my whole life, and they always come with problems that you have to fix.

i dont have debts. at this points im just playing around with $1000.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:01:21
14.8 and dropping.
Will be back up in 20mins.
i swear this is just hedgefunds practicing for the real game on the 18th
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:13:01
hodl it
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:46:15
ive not yet used it but i hear it is quite hard to cash out in australia
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:34:06
why does no one answer a whole question?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:43:27
that is of course, assuming that bitcoin is a bubble, and not establish its worth
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:42:03
I did the same thing - mainly i didnt have the money to waste. But I just sold my motorbike as it started to spike so i put $2000 in at 13k. 
ill probably sell if it hits 25K for some xmas money, and if it keeps going up - oh well, it was an easy way to make $500.
but you only buy what you are willing to lose. if you wernt willing to lose $400 then you made the right choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:51:07
i know its the same market, but i cant work out why it isnt adding up.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:06:09
yeah but Facon is half the price and almost tastes like bacon. +more money to spend on crypto
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:46:41
I heard from a guy in the toilet stall next to me that for bitcoin to become a global currency the price would need to be at least 50k, and at best over 100k. 
so that is the best i have got for you
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:38:21
18th december from memory. cant remember the time
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:44:25
my guess is it is now on the radar of mums and dads and waiters and taxi drivers. and they are all jumping in with a few thousand to see what happens. 
millions of first time buyers arent about to sell in 40mins. so it keeps climbing.
I only bought for the first time today myself....although ive been following it for years - its just the first time ive had some kind of disposable income
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:55:08
when you marry and have a family and can buy a house for the sake of an investment you made 3 years ago that has paid off well. and can now go on to live a mortgage free life. 
sounds ok to me to cash out. 
money is great to get the things you want...and it got him the thing he wanted. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:14:27
Yeah, 3 comments deep in a bitcoin thread as an anonymous user is always the best place to start pumping....
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:47:49
if we knew then there would be no risk. it is trending upwards faster it has before. but if people start offloading then it will dip just as fast
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:35:44
I personally am a minimalist. 
i ride a very comfortable and reliable (ugly) suzuki gs500 (australia, winter is not an issue)
I have one computer, one phone, one TV, 3 suits, 3 pairs of shoes etc. i earn 100k a year and no debts. 
My advice is upgrade the things that annoy you, or buy things that are  missing. but if i had the choice of a very nice car, or 6 months travelling the world, i would travel. and i have travelled, and i plan to again soon.
what i actually spend my money on is old books and wine, god i love me some old books, and they dont come cheap. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:10:22
the crazy number of transactions atm are slowing things down. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:31:06
well as i went ahead and used this wallet. do i need to wait for it to catch up before i am able to transfer it to another wallet? im using Bitcoin Core as it came recommended. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:12:44
the highest transaction ive seen for the past few hours was 12btc. im sure i missed a few, but they arent hundreds at a time.
unless they are simply buying every tiny amound on offer around the interwebs 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:09:16
i have already used the address of this wallet and purchased. can i transfer them before i can even see them?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:42:50
7GB/s [citation needed]
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:16:14
all this i know. ive been following and researching it for a while. however the wallet didn't come with a disclaimer "requires 120gb download" 
My question is what happens when i run out of harddrive space. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:41:20
bitcoin.com.au is literally the easiest thing ever. 
but you are paying a premium for it being so easy. usually 10-20% higher than market value
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:28
buy stocks is really quite easy, and probably easier still to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:57:09
earlier in the year it broke an important threshold where people thought "if it can break X then i guess it is here to stay" 
it has also been getting a lot of good press, regular articles on millionaire bitcoin kids, and baby boomer financial advisers continually being proven wrong.  
basically it is showing itself as a serious contender now. something that is 'worth' investing in
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:00:59
Well that didnt go so well
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:08:55
i bought of bitcoin.com.au which was 18k/btc while the market had it at 16500. (AUD) ~13k usd
it is how business make their money. buy slightly lower than market and sell slightly higher. I paid for the ease of use and no account required. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:18:49
I admitted about 6 months ago that im no good at it. And suddenly i stopped losing coins
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:39:46
250 years 25 days 3 hours 47 minutes 20 seconds
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:26:39
would you like a ladder to get off your high horse or are you happy up there? 
I KNOW i dont need to run a node. i dont want to. i want it to stop but to also be able to use a wallet. 
I have since exported my private key to another wallet and am waiting for that one to sync. and Hopefully i will be able to see my coins in the new one. 
what you have managed to tell me is exactly nothing relating to solving the problem i listed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:47:04
bit unlucky if it crashes 20% on your 40min uber ride. 
I dont think it will be implemented untill it becomes more stable
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:23:02
I solved my problem. Bitcoin Core can be run in pruning mode, which means it only takes up about 2gb. 
thank you for answering my question. it only took 2 hours of my own research.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:44:12
however, if the price is destined to settle at 100k USD or even 50kUSD then now IS the time to buy.
no one knows
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:18:08
only invest what you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:59:56
You sound like a Catholic yelling at a sinner

I used to regret not buying at every spike. but then i look back and remember i had the choice of BTC or food. and i chose food. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:37:11
i know this. that wasn't the question. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 01:13:19

They were alterations of btc. They wernt nearly as interesting or developed as some alts like ada, icx, neo and so on

my plan is to sell the day before futures. If there is a dip i will buy again. if no dip then ive cashed out and im going to south america for a very nice holiday
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:47:00
thats how they make their money. you pay for ease of use
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:13:03
I dont own them. Im currently out of the market
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:10:36
i just want my coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:19
-2k. you will be in debt just for owning some
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:39
I think it is exactly this. everyone on earth who has been 'thinking about it' is now doing it

if you can answer the question it would be greatly appreaciated
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:19:26
China says 'all stores must accept Maocoin' and that coin instantly pumps, becomes the regional coin. 
Even if they also accept other coins, you as a chinaman will always have a stake in Maocoin so you can buy things from any store. 
Dominance by government decree would be easy

Hitting large walls is an indicator that there is momentum in that direction. The price will drop below that wall for sure
@_date: 2018-08-19 10:32:48

the problem is, what if you arent good at school? what if you are ADHD, ODD, BPD, ASD and a variety of other disorders which make sitting in a classroom and learning almost impossible.  no matter how hard you work at $8 an hour, you will never be rich. there is no longer an opportunity to work in a factory and support a family. There is no substantially paying work for those who cannot learn in a formal setting.

there is very little wealth mobility - that being people moving from lower class to middle, or middle to upper - in america.

 i know the jobs exist. but they are harder and harder to find, and as automation of production increases those jobs will decrease. and even $20/h will not buy you a upper class life style, you would be struggling to be middle class.

Cardano and tezos are working on it. Cardano's Proof of proof work and proof of proof of stake algoriths are key to coin interoperability and long term addoption while like 5 coins ada, tezos, icon and others are all making good headway on PoS. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:54:24
dropping below 100% is not a thing
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:04:40

Like 10 people have 51% of bitcoins hash power...that isnt power to the people. PoS done correctly is easily more decentralized.
@_date: 2018-10-06 10:50:29
well i mean if you have 1 empty block. then you have 6 empty blocks that a 600% increase.
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:58:39
If you have a stock worth $20 and it decreases by 110%. You now owe the company $2 for owning a share.
It gets to 0 then it stops.
@_date: 2018-10-01 07:52:37
why this one restaurant? 
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:52:08
Better than sticking with a project that has thr same inheret issues of btc 
@_date: 2018-10-31 13:10:16
the people who control &gt;51% could comfortably fit into a large apartment for a gathering of pizza and beer. That is not decentralised  
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:20:46
So.... That is different to addoption and a pointless comment...
Is that what you were going to say?

I have 4 accounts. It means nothing
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:28:03

so many altcoins that are better than LTC in literally every way. i agree
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:23:57
you only know when the ath is after the fall.
It should be 'if you were on an emotional high and didnt sell because you wanted more than 600% return, you are stupid"
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:53:05
And you are probably right. However, understand iit is designed to be used, unlike a stock.

The only rwason btc is worth anything today is because people bought stuff with it for rhe last 10 years

Bitcoin has no function other than a store of value. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:30:01
You sent me 10 sats (thank you) they are still nothing more than a store of value.
Its like saying NFC paywave on visa changed the concept of money...it didnt. Just made buying things slightly faster.
In this case it made sending sats easier. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:56:13
I donno 700% profit doesnt sound like a dumb move to me.
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:36:30
0 fee systems are unsustainable, and should not be encouraged.
I have done my research, and ive found that there are other projects that are far better than bitcoin, which is only still a serious contender thanks to a first movers advantage.
If something as slow and cumbersome as btc was released next week, no one would fucking touch it.
But because btc is basically a religion. Whatever project i mention, you will call vaporware or a shitcoin because it isnt btc. 
Also i didnt fucking call bitcoin the same as NFC. I called the reddit tipbot the same as NFC.
@_date: 2018-11-02 20:42:52
...so you are telling me you dont really need miners for btc to succeed?
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:03:25

 Investing, getting returns and then spending those returns to increase your standard of living is the while fucking point of investing.
Whi are you to dictate when someone else can spend their money?
Also if bitcoin is your pension then you are a fool
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:02:56
I think me means is the text written sarcastically? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:35:44
point out to me where i told people how to spend their investments
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:35:22
if its not making you poor then why not buy it?
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:57:08
Well unlikely is not the same as impossible. Lots of people said it wouldnt drop below 5k
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:04:01
By that logic is a 5x gain 100x20? 
You accuse me og pulling numbers out of my arse but you dont actually know how to use percentage s
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:45:33
Then you doubting it will drop is also not an argument...which was my point
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:44:34
Are you ok with that 100 being worth $20 next year?
If you are then go for it
My ~$6000 investment is now worth $1400
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:44:52
Well i said 1k. Why are you arguing with me?
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:47:42
You know those are opposites right
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:31:23
If you only take advice from people who have succeeded then you will fail to see the associated risks
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:46:14
What the fuck is a 5x drop? How do you have negative 500%...$5000 to $1000 is an 80% drop not fucking 500%
Im done man, your either dumb or just here for an argument. Either way im no longer replying
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:22:52
So you are saying you should only take advice from people who made money or got lucky?
Ive been putting in $100 a week for the past year, because i dont need it... But it is a bear market. I didnt "buy in the mania"
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:48:30
No. That is not what times fucking means.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:22:53
Well sure. But ir is equally as likely that bitcoin goes down to 1k compared to going up to 15k
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:44:12
Ah yes, all of those well known 14yo innovators and inventors....
But anyway
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:13:46
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:36:14
Ok you win. 
There is no way at all btc will drop to 1k. Its a fucking guarantee.
Buy now, there is no risk at all. Only lambos and cocaine for us now. 
Sell your house and buy btc because this is the bottom and the only way is up.
Im done.
