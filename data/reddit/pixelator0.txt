Remember, if you never sell, you never have to pay gains tax ;)

Jesus dude that's a terrible idea. If you've made anything more than, like, a couple hundred bucks, the IRS is gonna fuck you and they don't play gentle.

That's really not how that works. I'm not sure where you heard what you're talking about, but as it stands, bitcoin is, for tax purposes, treated like a commodity. So if you buy it at a certain price and sell it later at a greater value, the moment you sell you have accrued capital gains of the amount of profit you made. Capital gains are taxed by their own set of rules, which you need to read to determine how they apply to you, based on the timeline of the trades, the amount of profit, and how much you are getting in income from other sources. Or, you could hire an accountant to figure that out for you.
The real lesson to be learned here is always just hire a CPA to do your taxes for you. Because our tax code is a hellish labyrinth which can only be navigated by those who spent years studying it in institutions of higher education, paying a CPA to do your taxes is 100% always the best financial choice.

Nope, because those weren't gains, those were losses.

If you think you can get away with tax fraud because nobody's going to be auditing you and because the IRS might not know about your crypto transactions, then you get to make that decision for yourself. Just keep in mind that the IRS knows what crypto exchanges are and collects information from you. Your identity is tied to your account. I don't know how hard the IRS looks, but it wouldn't have to be too hard.
In short, don't fool yourself into thinking that it's no big deal because "its just bitcoin/its just an internet thing." It's tax fraud. If you ask me, just pay your damn taxes like an adult.
