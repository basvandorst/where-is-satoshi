Every year after Consensus, Bitcoin price goes up by 120,000%

Those shoes are hideous.  But what the btc box?
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:35:24
Imo, it's safe to buy anywhere under 10k.. being at 50% of it's all time high.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:32:48
I haven't been hit that hard, but when btc was about $4k someone got into my Bittrex account remotely and stole 7 BTC from me.. Bittrex basically just said sorry..
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:06:46
Fuh why?
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:43:28
I use Exodus.  Super easy

It's either coming to and end or it's going to zero
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:20:15
It has turned me into an insane person
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:21:46
Imo, anything under 10k is a steal.. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:10:03
One hundred dollar millimeters?
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:50:54

The Technology, the Decentralization, the Future, the Finite supply of cryptocurrency that isn't just printed at will to name a few things.  The same shit that originally brought optimism.. it's still here.  Fuck Boi

I like Binance for an exchange, their phone app is easy to use.. to get btc with $ you will probably have to use coinbase or another like it
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:16:12
It could go down more, this seems like We may see about $6k again.  If it goes down that much I would get as much as possible.. would prob get into a couple of o the coins as well.. I'm really keen on EOS and OMG this year.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:03:38
I'm talking about all cryptos, not just BTC..  holler at me in 6 months we will see where cryptos are then.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:05:04
Ok.. elaborate?
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:03:51
You don't know until it has already happened
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:44:03

@_date: 2018-04-12 13:22:48
No it didnt
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:49:37
Just drove thru on my way back from 420 Fest.  Wore my Hodl shirt Saturday and had like 10 people holler at me about Cryptos, wasn't expecting that much!  
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:53:17
Maybe just a lil bit.. 20%
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:13:13
You should be fine as long as you're not looking to sell soon
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:44:01
