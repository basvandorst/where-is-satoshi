[ you can literally fulfill all needs in life in this city with only Bitcoin. Yes, even Burger King :)
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:36:06
ur retarded :)
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:21:46
It was a retorical question I think. Since based on what you say you seem to lack a lot of knowledge.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:46:47
Which is completely different than the shit you are spewing out. You should get a grasp on economics and get a technical background, then start to use your brain and hopefully you can see then why you are wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:39:57
Ur wrong on so many points.. Many people in crypto space just don’t seem to get it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:50:20
Because its primary use is not as a general currency? Its a store of value... And as to why Bitcoin is so valuable in this requires the needed background you apparently don’t have.

I feel bad for your IQ :(
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:42:16
No I would rather see 100.000 individual miners having control over their own operations. Instead of 10s of pools controlling all operations. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 19:03:41
Technologically LN is on entire different level than BCH will ever be able to go. Maybe in another universe where the average IQ is 50&amp; lower than here BCH would have a chance.

Of course he has no clue :)
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:37:21
Won't u agree that if this is achievable in a safe manner, it would be way better. And my entire question is just that I wanna know what things are in the way of achieving that situation where everyone can mine on their own and still benefit. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:51:00
Yeah these are indeed one of the most blocking issues. I wonder if there was ever some detailed discussion about this. Feels so weird to give out control to your power just like that. I wonder if this will ever change.
@_date: 2018-07-26 04:10:54
U mean 1/32 the blocksize.
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:51:48
I know it is doomed to fail, will be funny to see how BCash supports are gonna react haha
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:40:12
Yeah, but you give your power in the hands of 1 organisation (the pool). The best scenario would be if everyone would mine on their own control. I am just wondering why this isn't possible yet, like what implications does this bring with it.
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:56:48
Damn, a negative IQ, I feel bad for you pal.
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:39:05
Ever bothered to measure your IQ?
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:46:24
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:37:06
It is going down more and more and more indeed. Its the obvious direction I guess after seeing all the success surrounding btc.
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:35:14
no, reward u get is based on hashpower u put in. So the faster hardware u can make, the more you get??
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:18:27
Yes because you then earn more BTC :)
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:16:20
your math is so wrong.. also you talk nonsense. Eur going from 0.88usd to 1.2usd isnt weakening of the euro, its actually stronger then? Your logic is flawed.
Also a 10 year 2.5% inflation isnt a net 22.5% over 10 years. It is compounding at 1.025 ^ 10, which is around 28%. 
I hate seeing these completely wrong “look i am (trying to be) smart” posts. Next time use your brain before posting please. Thank you.
