I made a grand or two after paying off hardware, which was pretty good as I sold most btc between $4-30.  I got some stuff used, all motherboards were cheap and they were running single core AMD processors.

I was an early gpu miner. Mined and sold over 155 btc from 2010-2012. Looking back at past transactions, selling 15btc for $4.xx each was a weekly occurance.  Makes me cry a little on the inside.  Ohh to be young and dumb!

You have to be in it for the long haul. Hodl!

I buy from my phone with the Coinbase android app all the time

Yeah, I did it for the fun and I had a lot of fun!  I had two 4x 5830 rigs, one 2x 5870 rig and my main 2x 6950 rig all mining at once at one point in time.  I looked at getting back into it with Asics, but it just wasn't the same with the now high difficulty.  I made out alright though, It paid for my mining gear which was my main goal!  Here's to a trip down memory lane! Some 2011 era mining rigs:

That really sums up how I felt while mining and selling lol
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:29:54
Same. Sold over 150 for under 24 in the golden era of mining

Yeah, I still have some btc, but it all from small weekly auto purchases and hodl. I enjoyed my time with mining early, gambling some away, selling most and in the end I came out ahead, so no worries from me!

Always check the first couple digits and the last couple of digits after pasting a wallet address to make sure it is the correct address.

This is the standard size for most all key tags. It doesn't flap around the wind. If you ride an older Harley where they ignition is on the side of the bike, then maybe.

I got a big batch made from an embroiderer.  I have them for sale on Amazon  Prime if you are interested, just search for "bitcoin embroidered keychain".

Bike would not start unless the key was programmed. Bikes are easy to steal anywau, just click it in neutral and roll it away, worry about the ignition later.

It looks like they shipped out on the 15th, you should be able to login to Amazon and view the tracking.  Amazon is fulfilling my orders for me, so I do not have access to after sales information.  If you did not receive a tracking number or you dont receive your order in the next day or two, let me know and I can contact Amazon.  Thanks!

I tried checking old pools, but I mined mainly on ArsBitcoin pool but it's no longer here.  I mined and spent over 190btc from 2010-2011 lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:37:14
I started to tally up how much I mined(and sold) in 2011 from pool email receipts and I quit at 189btc.  Oh how much I wish I knew the ways of HODL back then!
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:57:59
I was a miner back in 2011. Thought I cashed out back then, but loaded up some old wallets and found 1.2btc that I left.  It was only worth $20 or less at the time.  Score! 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:30:11
Worth a shot, I found small amounts in 3 out of the 7 old wallets I had kept. Just takes some time to rescan for each wallet
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:11:15
Same. I mined and sold over 150 coins before 2011.  All coins were sold for under $30 :( :( :(
