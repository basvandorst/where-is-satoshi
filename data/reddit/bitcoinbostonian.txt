Even if you hold your Circle account in dollars, you can still send funds to bitcoin addresses. You don't need to change your account currency to bitcoin, you don't even need to denominate your payment in BTC. Just drop a bitcoin address in the recipient field and you can send $100 to it. Circle will just convert your $100 payment to BTC and send it on to the BTC address.

Yeah, seems like a great idea to "like" a seller of illegal goods on Facebook...
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:24:54
Yes, but its not automated. If you send bitcoin through Circle to someone's email that doesn't have a Circle account, then they get an email saying that you sent them BTC. When they click the link they have the option of logging into a Circle account, signing up for a Circle account, or putting in an address for the BTC to be delivered to.
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:49:34
Right, that's the point. It takes &lt;5 seconds to make a new account which makes it a favorite of scammers, scripters, etc.

You better make sure that you don't have any virus or malware that is changing the address for sending when you think you're copy and pasting an address.

Yeah, you never hear from people that get a buy at $375 canceled when the price has gone down to $355, only talk of scam when the price has gone up since the canceled transaction.  There are some great automated fraud detection systems that companies like Coinbase can use, but a certain number of transactions are still going to blocked or require a human to review.

The average person isn't going to want to deal with a currency denoted in "satoshis" and "lunas" or whatever. That just makes it sound like some world of warcraft currency or something.

Except for the part where even a company with a billion dollars in the bank couldn't comply with some of this stuff. If it was limited to the requirements that are navigating red tape, you'd have a point, but the reporting of counterparty information simply isn't possible unless you have a closed loop system. Nobody wants that, especially the companies with millions of investor dollars already spent.
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:45:22
Is that the base rate before or after all of Coinbase's fees? Looks like you're giving the Coinbase exchange rate not including fees and Circle doesn't have any fees.
Coinbase is showing me &gt;$625 right now, does that mean that Circle is &gt;$6 cheaper per bitcoin??

New York State (USA) is saying that any bitcoin company that is located in, or has customers in New York have to apply for and receive a bitlicense or they will be violating the law.  Companies would have to get a license or somehow exclude NY customers.  As you can see from the numerous posts on the subject, the license is extremely broad and far-reaching.

Wow, this is how not to do customer service (mostly Alexis A., but this follow up as well). Someone needs to give these BTCJam guys a lesson in tone. He very clearly isn't blaming you and just wants to know to get control of his account back. Either you have a series of steps he can complete to make that happen or you don't. Just give the man an answer without the condescending tone.
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:13:03
It's a scam. You can't just arbitrarily set the price of something.
What do you think is going to happen to that $20 price when they "go public" and everyone who bought in at $4 or $10 immediately moves to sell?
If you want, I'll sell you some BostonCoins for $1 and then I'll offer them to others at $100 tomorrow. Might as well get in on a huge discount, right!?!
It's obvious scams like this masquerading as "public offerings" that are going to cause the SEC to continue to bring the hammer down on digital currency companies.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:50:01
The expensive hoop jumping will stifle innovation and make the barrier to entry impossibly high for all but the most well-funded companies. Companies will avoid NY entirely. Its nonsense that should be fought hard but at least its possible.
Requiring companies to track things like the physical address of both sender and receiver simply isn't possible with bitcoin. 
I guess all we can hope for at this point is that the comment period isn't a farce and they are actually willing to make changes, but this initial proposal doesn't give me much hope. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 03:31:48
You said Circle hasn't verified your bank account for a month? Did you log back in and confirm the two test deposits?
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:14:36
Does this Coinbase price include all of their fees or just the exchange rate?
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:25:27
Wow, so Circle is $6+ cheaper per bitcoin? Not bad.
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:27:11
How is that fishy? Didn't Circle explicitly state that they were having people with no bitcoin experience test out the site?  You don't learn what the mainstream consumer wants by granting earlier access to a lot of people that have already mastered generating offline private keys and cold storage.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:50:14
I think it really adds to his credibility and the validity of that distinction that he's acknowledging that companies like Circle WOULD be subject to the regulations while continuing to hammer (here and in their BitLicense comments) that software providers shouldn't be subject to regulation.

Yes, according to the demo and User Agreement. But wouldn't be insured against you personally being hacked or keylogged, just if Circle's storage is compromised. So still need to maintain proper security measures on your end (w/ strong password, 2FA, etc.)

Companies like Circle and Coinbase use their own BTC price (though both closely track BitStamp and other exchange prices).
For example, Circle's Buy price is $330.57 and their Sell price is $330.57. Coinbase's Buy price is $327.78 (but $331.21 after fees) and their Sell price is $326.77 (but $323.35 after fees).
@_date: 2014-08-29 04:15:56
This is so embarrassing for Xapo. All that VC money and they can't find a banking partner for ACH deposits?
They have some messaging that talks about what to do if you want to deposit over a million dollars and elsewhere they try to buy access to your social media feed for a penny. Exactly who is their target customer?
Maybe they have a shot to corner the  South American market but otherwise they look like a joke compared to Coinbase or Circle.

No fractional reserves.
See: 
"Full Reserve Bitcoin. As a regulated Money Transmitter in the United States, we are required by law to maintain full reserves – e.g. we must maintain 100% of customer deposit value and are not permitted to invest those assets for our own profit. Moreover, we are required by law to provide audited financials that prove our full reserves and associated accounting to government agencies."

I have not.  Circle has live chat support as well.  They also respond to support inquiries/emails/tweets outside of those phone support hours. So its not really fair to point to Circle's phone support hours as evidence of limited customer service availability when there are numerous other ways to contact them.
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:06:03
The key word in your post is "compliance." I'm sure Allaire would like nothing more than for every federal, state and international regulator to come out and say that they won't be formally regulating bitcoin, but he also is smart enough to realize that is an anarchist pipe dream.  Companies like Circle and Coinbase want to reach millions of users and bring bitcoin to the mainstream, but that won't happen if they're constantly being served with subpoenas and cease and desist letters.  Regulators left to their own devices would no doubt eventually put bitcoin-specific rules and regulations in place. So the options are to let the regulators do that in a vacuum and come up with god knows what, or to engage them directly and try to at least steer the regulations to something that will be consistent and manageable across jurisdictions.

This is not really true at all. Every single one of the companies that OP mentions has numerous people in roles that require no computer science background. Business development, accounting, treasury functions, legal department, compliance, marketing.
I think you should focus on which of these areas you are best suited to and just try to maximize your GPA.  The best thing you can do to target these companies are to attend events they host, talk to people, go to local bitcoin meetups, and submit your resume to them with a nice cover letter even if there isn't a specific open position posted.  Companies are looking for smart people with transferable skills and a demonstrated interest in cryptocurrency, but not any specific coursework.

Are you in the U.S.? What state?  Most states have regulations in place that prevent things like gift cards from expiring for several years (if ever).  That is the reason that companies like Groupon had to move to a system where the promotional value can expire, but the paid value doesn't.  
Edit - For example: "Under Massachusetts law, a gift certificate or a merchant credit slip (given for returned merchandise) must be redeemable for a minimum of seven years from its date of issuance ( M.G.L. c. 93, s. 14S). The seller must clearly indicate the date of issuance and expiration date on either the face of the certificate, or, if it is an electronic card with a banked dollar value, on the sales receipt, or by means of an Internet site or a toll-free number ( M.G.L. c. 200A, s. 5D ). If the expiration date is not made available by these means, the gift certificate/card is to be redeemable in perpetuity." 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:37:02
It's likely that Apple Pay and Google Wallet also pay for promotions like this.
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:14:49
Right, which is why when this happens the two likely scenarios are: (1) Already had a bitcoin address in clipboard and didn't correctly copy the Circle address when pasting, so it went to previously copied address or (2) malware/virus that replaces the bitcoin address you copied with one that was generated by the hacker.
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:34:04
I think its time for you guys to give some serious thought to who is going to be the next villain after Allaire once Circle releases their product and proves to be a normal company and not some diabolical government sponsored ponzi scheme vaporware.

@_date: 2015-01-18 21:42:46
Companies like Circle will 100% be following up on this in the coming weeks and months. Your correct path is/was to dispute the bank/CC charge as fraudulent WITH YOUR BANK, not just close your account. If you report it ASAP, you should be mostly covered for your losses. So I'm not sure why you simply closed your account (which makes it look pretty shady for you).  Circle can follow up with law enforcement, your bank, collection agencies, the courts, etc. in order to get their money back.  I don't get why you think this is at all Circle's fault. You could have 1) Not lost your phone, 2) PIN/Password protected your phone, 3) PIN Protected your app, 4) PIN protected 2FA, etc. You apparently did NONE of these things as doing ANY of them likely would have prevented someone from sending BTC with your account.
I'm also highly suspicious that even if you had zero security on your phone, a thief would know enough to find the Circle app, know it was bitcoin, know it had $500 instant access, and know how to deposit/send.
You need to take responsibility for this with Circle and fix this overdraft and then work through the proper channel (your bank) to see if your losses are covered.
PS - Just because the terms of serve don't specifically talk about it, doesn't mean they can't rely on simple contract law that they fronted you money and then you took steps to prevent the payment that was promised on your behalf.

This is an option. When you go to link a bank account in your Circle settings and get to the screen where you select your bank, just click "Don't see your bank listed?" (or something similar) and then you can put in your routing and account number. However, this triggers two small test deposits you'll then need to verify, which delays the process by a few business days.

It's just dumb accounting. They book the cost they incur to source BTC as an expense and the full value they sell it at as revenue. So if they buy 1 BTC for $6450 and sell it for $6455, they'd record $6455 in "revenue" and $6450 in expenses - with $5 profit.
