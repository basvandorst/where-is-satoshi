Ok. Look at the countdown. There are 21 hours. The counter could does not correctly display the counter when passing through the last day of the countdown (between 24 and 23 hours before the draw). The problem is fixed. The counter will be replaced in the next drawing.

The difference is that your tickets are playing again with each new ticket, and the game can be completed ahead of schedule, if the jackpot is won.
The difference a real lottery - it's much larger winnings and availability jackpot.
