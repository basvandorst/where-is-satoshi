From your article:


I'm no bitcoin expert, but this is bullshit.

Sorry, I should have posted something more constructive rather than just calling it bullshit.
Check out this post, I think it provides some good info:  The part that discusses potential problems with "anyone can spend" transactions is under "Risks related to soft-fork deployment".
I'll try and summarize based on my understanding. Yes, non-segwit miners will see transactions that output to segwit addresses as "anyone can spend", but there is very little risk of this allowing them to steal the coins. A malicious miner can mine a block that directs these funds into a wallet they own, but that block will be seen as invalid by any segwit-enabled miner and will be rejected. If segwit miners comprise a significant enough portion of the network's hash power, the theft block will quickly be left behind.
The weirdness around segwit outputs appearing to non-segwit miners as "anyone can spend" has to do with the fact that segwit is being deployed as a "soft fork". This means that any segwit blocks need to appear valid to non-segwit miners so that they can both continue to work together on the same chain during the transition period. Non-malicious miners that don't run segwit can still contribute non-segwit blocks on top of segwit ones without issue. However if they attempt a transaction that isn't valid under segwit, it will be ignored by all segwit nodes and not make it very far.
Edit: I'm not actually sure if non-segwit miners can mine blocks on top of segwit blocks - I need to do more research.
