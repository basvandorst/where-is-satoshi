Once you start accepting other nationals' money, that's when other countries' agencies may step in.

Paper wallet all the way.

Hey, but even Trump/dead clock are sometimes right! ;)
Buying more on dips anyways.

How do you imagine them making money to pay back? Who will trust them again? Wouldn't you pull the money out of the exchange the moment you can? So would everybody else. They'd need a massive, massive subsidy. It's just not worth it.

I welcome wider bitcoin adoption. But. How would this work, really? Micro transactions that are eaten by the transaction fees?
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:37:30
Sheesh. I'm glad I didn't have any funds in there.
Sorry for everyone else's loss.

He had tax problems before, and he was being investigated already. The raid was coming anyways. It just happens to be that when you go public, it becomes increasingly difficult to collect the evidence. Going public simple pushed the government's hand.

Here are some of DOGE advantages over BTC:
-you're getting in early, so psychologically you have not missed the run yet,
-getting in is cheap, DOGEs will never cost $700,
-all coins will be mined in a year and a half, 
-100B coins means a ton of liquidity,
-amazing and fun community.
p.s.: I personally hold both, but DOGEs are by far more fun.

BTC/LTC/DOGE markets are being manipulated by the big players. Once they acquire enough, they'll let it run again. In the meantime they drive it a little down forcing weak hands out. IMHO, won't last very long, should start going up any day now.
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:27:31
They are not really flawed. They are much easier to understand. And that counts a lot, for majority of people. BTC paved the way for DOGE, but DOGE will pave the way to BTC. It's a win-win, IMHO. 
I know the arguments that you are talking about, btw. However, it's much easier to explain a person that you can buy a beer with 100 DOGEs vs 0.003 BTC. 21M coins and 7000M people is just a bit too complicated for an average Joe. For now.
@_date: 2014-01-25 04:12:27
"blind imitation and empty hope" is, of course, not an insult =D
It really doesn't matter to me what you think of DOGE. I'm not promoting it, it's barely in my crypto portoflio (majority BTC). Unfortunately, stereotypical bitcoiner is still an ignorant smug... Not for long, just wait till DOGEcoiners finally start to understand bitcoin ;)
Have a nice evening!
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:57:25
See, you are one of the reasons why people are moving to DOGE... Same as you claim that they don't get BTC, I can proclaim that you don't get DOGE.
You can be a bitter "smug asshole" all you want, but it's now up to the masses. Just because you only own BTC, it does not make it the best and only. I'm not saying that DOGE is either. Different strokes for different folks. Majority of people DO NOT think like you. You wanted "mass adoption"? Thank DOGE, cause it is helping a lot, it will help attract more users to BTC in the long run.

It will easily reach $20k, provided no catastrophic events/restrictions happen.
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:56:14
Why would you down-rank me? =)
It's true. Look up the largest wallets of bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin. If you think that the market moves completely "naturally," when most of the coins are held by large entities, then I have a bridge to sell you =)
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:32:48
Ok then, care to elaborate?
BTC has been in this range for a while. So naturally those that made huge gains are getting a bit antsy and cashing out somewhat. The later they do it, the more days destroyed we have. Also, more than half of BTC is held by 1000 accounts. I have not checked the transactions, but moving those coins from one wallet to another can cause a ton of days destroyed without much impact to the market.

You do realize that it is mtgoxes and cryptsys that are stopping bitcoin from mass adoption? No one is saying that bitcoin should be ruled by the government. But it does have an obligation to prevent theft and fraud with the same rules and penalties for everyone. And the rest of us have an obligation to pay taxes. Or do you propose a decentralized fairness system, where everyone is out for themselves?.. One will think that a jail is appropriate, another-a fine, and third-that a hitman is due. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:58:44
I know. This will probably be deleted in a second :) Bitcoin will be just fine.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:44:20
Have a nice day! Woof :)
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:50:03
Wow. You just destroyed your own argument. How can one be so oblivious, and post so many untruths in one paragraph... 
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:01:53
IMHO, in the long run more exposure cannot hurt.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:21:31
15 minutes and counting :)
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:26:45
Ok. How does that relate to doge? Hardforking Dogecoin is not nearly as big of a deal. Plus, it will be ported to Ethereum eventually.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:58:57
You mean past couple days? Then yes. But it's a marathon...
I like Ether. Dash? Meh.
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:03:09
Sure, sure.
I'll take all of your bitcoin for your imaginable fraction that you think it should be worth.
Bitcoin is just a vehicle to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Same as all money, whatever is drawn on them. It's only that different moneys have different rules. In itself USD creates no economy. Internet itself doesn't create economy. What creates economy, is what you build with them and on top of them. Amazon, Facebook, and many many other tech giants started with seemingly obscene market caps compared to what you could actually extract from them at the moment. So keep on preaching your nonsense, it makes an entertaining argument =)
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:17:54
I don't know what you are trying to prove, but you have some kind of distorted logic. How much value does USD, or Euro have? A lot of USD will never be used again, and it is impossible to tell exactly how much USD is out there. Sell it all, it will go all the way down to zero. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:53:26
Boy oh boy :))))
Ok, found one number. There were approximately 11 Trillion USD in 2013. Probably 15+ today. Do you think it would make a difference to USD's value if we find out there is 30 Trillion instead? So a market cap does have a lot of significance. You don't think there is a science for devaluing a currency? Euro, British pound, Swiss Frank, Chinese rmb, and so on... All have done it, even though not one of them knows exactly how much real not lost money is out there. Other indicators are also important, but don't try to pretend market cap doesn't matter. You also keep saying that you could not sell all available bitcoins for $9 billion, but somehow conveniently forget that you also could not buy them all for $9 billion. I bet even $90 billion would not buy all of them. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 06:35:23


LOL You just keep telling yourself that Bitcoin valuation is somehow unique to Bitcoin. You find USD to be some sort of exception. If people sold all of their USD(which will never happen, same as people will never sell all bitcoins) for some other currency, say bitcoin, euro, or mexican peso, it would drive the price of USD towards zero against that other currency by driving up its price. You don't even have to use currency. Sell everything of any asset (bonds, stocks, gold) and you will bankrupt the system, they will become worthless. End of story. You're not going to convince anyone. This is like pissing against the wind-keep doing, and people will keep ridiculing you for being retarded. It is what it is.
@_date: 2016-06-08 03:48:09
Ok, other indicators give a more thorough view of what is happening with bitcoin *right now*. Market cap should probably be called *money supply*, because this is what it mostly resembles when comparing to government issued currencies. Evaluating Bitcoin on its *current* economy and its depths is absurd. It has no country, nor does it represent its potential. In 2015 Facebook had a PE ratio of 80. Were you to liquidate its all assets, economy, and the stock, you would be getting only 1.5% of its market cap. I know, cryptocurrencies and stocks are not quite the same, but it still gives you a rough picture what is expected in the near future. Legally, cryptocurrencies are treated as an asset, so there is some legitimate comparison to stocks. That's probably one of the reasons why market cap is (mis)used so often. Cryptocurrencies is a new animal that has both, features of an asset, as well as features of a currency. So I don't think your personal quest to abandon the use of the 'market cap', however flawed it is, is going to get any ground. 
P.S.: I don't hold any bitcoins, but, IMHO, $9 billion market cap(or the price of $600 if you so prefer) is a joke. The tech, if it were patented, would be worth way way way more.
