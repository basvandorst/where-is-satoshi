What do you suggest? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:15:45
Queue the bad press! 
@_date: 2013-07-12 07:59:40
I am. and that's weird. If you get through the verification quiz everything should be in order. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:13:37
While you're post is entertaining, I meant what chain of events would have to happen for bitcoins to plummet to pennies? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:06
WE KNOOOWWWWWWW
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:23:08
Link to what you're talking about? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:12:40
$147 mow
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:10:00
Sorry to tell ya but you're probably gonna have to cut your losses. Sad day. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:13:33
Didn't see it. Haha
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:04
So buy moar!!! Now! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:06
What is that? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:02:56
Troll? Cause if not I'd like to know why. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:24:51
And also, since there are a limited number of BTC, how can the value change at all? This is probably an obvious answer I'm just a rookie in this whole game. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:58:14
Scared me bro. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:09:05
Thank you thank you. I'm sorry. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:51:13
Ahh the old reddit switcharoo. 
I'm lazy. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 07:34:13
The option is definitely still there for me. Do you have a verified account? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:19:18
Well here I am. Educate me. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:14:59
Bitcoin Ticker. Downloaded it today for this exact purpose. Haha

If you put in all completely correct info, it usually does fine. But some services are just flawed. Nothing you can do about it. Sorry, I know how you feel. I just had almost $300 floating in cyberspace for over a week, trying to get an order placed. Most anxious week of my life. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 09:10:17
I'm afraid I do not 
@_date: 2013-07-12 08:51:12
Any time. I hope everything is well
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:09:16
So what you're saying is that he can sell everything, crash the market, and buy what he just had for half of what he made? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:23:22
Oh okay. So that's why everyone on this site is telling people to "hold" and convincing them that they should buy instead of sell? 
@_date: 2013-07-12 08:39:54
I suggest using a sibling, or maybe still one of your parents! There's bound to be more info available to make a more accurate quiz. But that has to be current residency, telephone number, everything.
I would really love to help by doing it on my account and telling you what to put on the form but, as I said, you have to use all of your real info. And that's not a risk I'm willing to take, you've got to understand. 
But remember. Some people have MUCH bigger problems than this. I know it doesn't make it go away, but should make you feel a little more at ease. No need to be angry, just wait it out and consider it a tolerance break :) 
And have a good evening. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:29:56
Heh. Idiots
@_date: 2013-07-12 08:17:59
Yeah that's not true. To do a cash deposit you have to create an account, with all of your real information (this is the only way you'll be able to pass the quiz. And if you're near or under 18, you'll have to use your parent's info to get questions you can actually answer), pass the quiz, and you'll be able to do it from a new transaction in your account.

Hey, question. I've obviously been interested in mining but can't buy equipment. I have a desktop iMac, so do you think that I would get the same results as you? I'm only 16 so even a small amount of money would be worth the trouble, but is there even a small amount of money to be made? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:10:03
It is. They did the same thing a couple weeks or so ago. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:58
Buy at $150. Rinse. Repeat. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:50:08
Commenting just so I can come back to it in 6-8 weeks
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:48:19
Or people just trying to convince others to buy/not sell. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:15:46
It just takes time. The more people that adopt the currency, the less drastic one person can change it.
