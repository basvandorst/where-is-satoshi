It’s possible
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:26:44
In the sense that it is a choice it is. So why not reduce the blocksize?
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:26:07
But I thought the transaction malleability issue could have been solved without increasing the blocksize (weight)

Do you think Bitcoin would be better if it had 8 MB or 16 MB blocksizes?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:05:12
Are 8 MB blocks mutually exclusive with that layer 2 solution?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:20:07
When you say drop off do you mean that it would not be possible for you to ever sync again, or just that it would take more time for that initial sync?

If the block could grow but for human choice then it is a artificially created need
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:07:47
Would you not be able to do any of these things you describe if the maximum block size for bitcoin was 8 MB or 16 MB?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:33:48
Perhaps you simply misunderstood

Isn’t this like breaking your legs and then inventing crutches?
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:01:56
Wow, is there any solution to this? Can older txS be pruned?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:02:04
So to you blocksize smaller than 1MB would be better?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:33:12
So are you then of the opinion that segwit should not have increased “block weight” to i believe 4MB because of people like you who could be too slow / have to slow a connection if all 4MB were used?

If the rules say no altcoin discussion why are comments like these allowed?
