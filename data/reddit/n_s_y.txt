@_date: 2017-11-02 22:28:53
Listening to the way you talk about it...as a speculative investment...I urge you to use caution.  The words you're using are exactly what we heard before the real estate pop.
Bubbles don't require a certain market cap before popping.  That's not how it works.
"The market is invincible!"
"Look at the growth!"
"We will continue to have record growth for years!"
"The spikes are of no concern!"
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:23:49
Not really.  Fork.lol shows you are incorrect.  It's actually riskier for BTC, since there's a chance of lockup similar to what we saw a couple days ago.  Then you don't get paid at all for the previous blocks mined.  BTC is definitely the riskier coin to mine.

BCH is better than ETH and LTC because it has a supply cap.  Also, it's a simple fork, and had the beauty of giving "free money" off of BTC, meaning people were incentivized to get in.  That along with the 2x fail makes BCH very appealing.  I think it's going to last.  I truly honestly believe that we're going to see prices swap in value.

The idea is to get miners to choose what coin makes the most sense to them.  No need to make one more profitable than the other.  Simple math balances things out.  Miners can choose what technology they think is superior and is the future, and mine it.

There is value, though.  Remittance, worldwide currency, proven ledgers, and keeping your money away from banks.  That's value add as far as currency is concerned.

What's lame is the banning.  It happens quite a bit.  Why do you think mod logs aren't open?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:08:05
Interesting.  What I've heard from them is that:
*  BTC is decentralized (BCH has multiple dev teams working independent of each other unlike BTC Core, and mining is no more or less centralized)
* BTC has massive censorship while BCH doesn't (dev logs and reddit mod logs are free to see on BCH, while r_BTC has excessive banning and censored logs)
* Ungovernable is a good thing, isn't it?  Isn't that more true to the white paper - a true peer-to-peer decentralized ungoverned currency?
Now, I'm just learning and asking questions here.  I see good info from both sides, and both sides are very passionate.  Just want to make sure I'm not being misled.
Thank you for your responses.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:28:10
Is that a question?  I'm trying to learn here; care to explain what you're getting at?
Lightning Network seems like a long way away.
BTC seems to be way more centralized from a dev point of view.
BCH is better for miners, at least right now...so they're more incentivized to mine it - making it more healthy with more hashrate, no?  
Again, just trying to learn here.  No need for hostility.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:53:16
Why do you get that impression?  I've been involved in bitcoin since 2013 from both tech and investment perspectives. Keep your assumptions to a minimum, or you'll find you'll embarrass yourself quickly.

You only said "it won't go to zero because there are people who will never sell."
You only shifted your statement once I called out how that makes no sense economically.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:47:17


It's not that I think you did.  You did.  I quoted you.  All you said is "people will never sell" and that's why there would always be value.  Which is asinine.
Anyway, now that you've shifted the goalposts, why do you think that there will always be demand?  What is your logic and argument for such a statement?
There are plenty of things that have no demand, yet people own and hold onto.  What makes you think Bitcoin is different?

@_date: 2018-11-28 00:22:40
...and that's what I'm trying to explain here.  Whether or not people are willing to sell doesn't increase value or increase demand.  I could be unwilling to sell my beanie babies, but that doesn't mean that it means the value goes up.  I could be unwilling to sell my toenail clippings, but that doesn't mean that demand increases or they're worth more.
What you're claiming is that there will always be demand.  I'm asking why you think that demand will always exist.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:09:56


Yes, you said that, but that's not how it works.  We're going in circles here.
Not selling something doesn't make the prices stay non-zero.  That's my whole point.  That's not how economics works.  At all.


It won't have any **just because** I refuse to sell.  It won't just magically have any value out of thin air because I created it and won't sell it.
I don't see how you don't understand how having something doesn't mean it has any value.

@_date: 2019-01-25 22:08:56
No it isn't.  Past market performance does NOT predict future performance.  That's economics and investing 101.
By your logic, markets would never experience change.  By your logic, no company would ever go bankrupt.  By your logic, no company would ever see massive changes in the market, never to recover.
You aren't being realistic.  You're letting what you WANT affect your closeness to reality.

Hahaha oh my god that's rich.  You think that detecting early signs of STOCK movement by Google trends in relevant topics is the same as gauging relative interest by looking at TWO phrases, "buy dollar" and "buy bitcoin?"
Holy shit that's hilarious.  You really think that the content of that publishing concludes that comparing one phrase to another would be sufficient research to conclude relative interest?  They'd laugh at you.
It's amazing what you guys will do to convince yourself of what you want to believe.

He's talking specifically about market performance. Don't be a dunce.
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:25:44
Predicting that a market will change is not the same as predicting the performance effects of that change.  Surely you can comprehend the difference.
"Current events" is a colloquial phrase, and you know exactly what's meant by it.  Your semantics do not add anything to the discussion of value.
Best of luck predicting how bitcoin will perform based on past performance.  Glad I bought at 5k and sold at 18.5k, and didn't just assume it would rise forever because it rose in the past.
Pretending you know what the market will do PERFORMANCE wise (not just that it will change) because it did something in the past is foolish.

@_date: 2018-11-28 13:00:31
You're using circular logic here.  You are saying that there will be demand for bitcoin because people won't sell, but then saying that toenails have no value because there is no demand.
So which is it?  Is demand driven by the fact that people won't sell, or not?
The only thing that creates value is supply, demand, and what people are willing to pay for it. That's it.  Somebody's willingness to sell doesn't CREATE value or demand.  That is not how economics works.  Period.
You don't like the toenail or beanie baby example, so I'll use a more familiar one.
Let's say I create an altcoin right now.  I name it Economics101Coin.  It is mathematically limited.  It's deflationary.  I'm unwilling to sell it.  Does that magically give it value?
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:11:35
You said I think markets experience change because of past performance. I'm explaining to you that they are not synonymous nor linked.
Current exists.  So does past.  So does future.
You are being purposefully obtuse at this point.
Past market performance does not predict future market performance.  Deny it if you want, it's your investment strategy, but you are wrong.
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:20:08
This is one of the most idiotic charts I've ever seen.  Using Google search as an indication of relative interest is asinine and not even remotely scientific.
I love how you said people can use this in the public domain and signed it and cited sources as if it has any real relevancy or even validity.
This post is a great example of how BTC holders are deluding themselves.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:47:55
It's not a bullshit saying, and if you can't understand it, you're just asking to go broke.
If you are ok losing 5% of your net worth tomorrow because it won't hurt your ability to maintain the standard of living you need, then, invest that 5%. 
Don't invest what you aren't willing to lose.  You're right, it's not your choice.  That's whole whole point!  You don't get to decide what you lose after you put it in the market.  So don't put it in the market unless you're ready to lose it.
You **do** get to decide what to invest.
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:31:34
You really think the article is about relative interest?  Did you just Google some random journal and copy paste it thinking it supports your argument?  
That article is about market impacts based on search trends.  It's not about relative interest of currency purchases based on a single phase comparison.  Market trend predictions and relative interest are not the same thing.
If you can't see the difference between relative interest in currency purchase and predicting stock market trends, there's not much I can do for you.
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:04:47

@_date: 2019-01-27 19:10:42
I legitimately pity that you are this ignorant when it comes to economics, and I hope you don't have too much money in the market.
Change is not performance.  Performance and change are not synonymous.  The fact you don't understand that is a little sad.
The way the market performed in the past does not predict how it will perform in the future.  What predicts future performance is current and future events.
For your sake, I hope you don't have much money in crypto or other markets.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:40:57
That's not what you said though.  You said there will always be demand BECAUSE people won't sell.  That's not how supply and demand works.
Also, what makes you think there will always be demand?  If it has no value, why would there be any demand?
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:56:10
Sorry, correct.  What I'm saying is that you being unwilling to sell doesn't mean the price can't hit zero.
I can be unwilling to sell my toenail clippings, but if nobody cares to buy them, the value is still zero.
Deflationary means nothing.  Beanie babies were deflationary, does that mean they are worth something?
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:01:19
Exactly.  The fact that people don't understand that people holding bitcoin doesn't mean it can't hit zero value is alarming.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:01:51
Not selling doesn't mean the value can't hit zero.  What about this don't you get?
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:20:36
Never selling doesn't make the value not hit zero.
The lack of knowledge of basic market economics here is alarming.

Hey, you're almost there.  Nice!
Past performance does not predict future performance.  However, I can predict what I think the market will do and act accordingly **while understanding and recognizing that past performance doesn't predict future performance.**
Past performance is one tool that one can use to make a guess on what the market will do, along with many other tools, but it **is not a predictor.**
If you have any further issues, you can take it up with the SEC.  I'm sure you know better than them, ;)

No.  You are the one that brought up comics and art, not me.  I'm trying to explain to you, logically, that the market doesn't work the way you think it does.  Owning something doesn't mean that it has value in the market.  Owning something doesn't mean that somebody is willing to buy it.

Hurr durr how creative.  Give me a break.  Show me a single person who was hacked through Reddit.  Just one.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:22:44
I won't have to
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:44:00
You really need an explanation on why past performance doesn't guarantee future results?  That's basic market 101.  If you don't understand that you shouldn't be trading
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:52:40
Not going to happen
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:49:47
Exactly.  This is just a "please buy, I've lost so much" post.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:50:18
Hahaha the fact that you said "simpleton" says everything I need to know about you.  This is pathetic.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:52:58
There's that insane paranoia we talked about
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:22:15
Prove it
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:28:23
I repeat what i said.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:22:53
And nothing happens.  Stop with the paranoia
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:29:13
I've made a ton of money on crypto.  Still hold some.  I don't operate on hysteria like people here
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:49:54
You lose nothing.
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:41:24
Nobody is coming for you. Relax.
