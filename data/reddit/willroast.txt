No I'm just saying that for the money you've spent on the equipment you would have been better off just spending it on actual bitcoin.  You would probrobly have more bitcoin then your rigs will ever get you.  Think about it.

If you go through coinbase expect to pay 7-8% just to purchase the bitcoin with your debit card.  I'm not sure there is a lower rate anywhere if your from the USA.   You can complete a transfer to binance within 30 minutes usually.  
If you use an ach transfer on coinbase pro and and set a maker's limit order its completely free.  No transaction fee.

The difference between a $30 steak and a $300 steak is they age the $300 steak for months until it rots and then they scrape any mold off and cook it.  So my take away from this article is that Venezuelans need to stop bitching and enjoy that $300 steak.

Having a few years to build up would be perfect.  I wouldn't mind seeing it dip even further, it's an opportunity to invest cheaply.  I'm excited about what's happening with ethereum prices rn.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:52:54
It would depend on the sentiment at the moment.  Are world governments outlawing bitcoin because it's a threat to their power structure, because its gaining traction and devaluing existing currency?  You have to consider the fact that as bitcoin gains value, fiat currency begins to lose value.  If that's the case the valuation would skyrocket as everyone would want to buy bitcoin asap.  The demand would be greater than the supply.  The price would rise dramatically.  The value of bitcoin could still rise after the cessation of transfer from fiat if it were considered the stronger of the two.  It would just cost less bitcoin for a specific good or service.
Keep in mind that the paper fiat we currently deal in is just as volatile and "imaginary" in value as digital currency is.  Just look at Venezuela.  
If you take the United States debt into account than the paper notes we use here are backed by a government that is severely in debt.  We just print more and more money and the value doesnt change.  It should be going down if there isnt new wealth to increase its value proportionaly.  At least there is a cap on bitcoin production.  
If it happened today though, the price of bitcoin would drop sharply as it hasn't gained enough traction.  If you cant use it for all or most transactions and it's not tradable for fiat then it has no value at all.
I guess it would depend on the foundation of digital currency usage, the infrastructure of the digital currency economy.  Then like any investable it would also depend on the current market sentiment towards both digital currency AND fiat currency.

@_date: 2019-06-01 02:30:06
I like the viewpoint of your second paragraph.
Think about this though.  The cost of conducting a mining operation 110 (closest) million miles away carrying a lot of equipment and returning to earth with a load of heavy materials would be "astronomical" even if it is possible.  220 (closest and perfectly timed) million miles of travel, half of which would be carried out under an extremely heavy load is likely uneconomical and impractical.   Furthermore the profits generated from these mining operations would likely be ruduced with each successive load due to a larger circulating supply of said materials.  Now if these astroids carried useful materials that are foreign to our planet that would make it a worth while venture.
As far as materials we currently have access to it would be much more practical to develope methods of converting abundant earthly materials into the materials we desire.  If we currently have access to it, it can be reverse engineered and recreated right here on earth.  I have suspicions that this is already possible given our known technological capabilities and is just another one of the many suppressed technologies being held back by the wealthy elite as a method of wealth retention.  Trust in the fact that the people who hold the majority of these materials do not want a new supply introduced which would effectively reduce the value of the their holdings.  Food for thought.

I think I would invest 250k across various sectors and caps of stock.  The market as a whole has never failed to yield returns.  This would be a long term account.
50k in short term stock investments.  Options in particular.
100k in gold/silver.  A hedge against the stocks.  Can always sell it with minimal deviation in price as it's more or less bottomed out.  I would probably sell it in a down market and wait for a stock market rebound to buy back more.
300k in a well researched business venture to provide residual income.  
100k in crypto.  From a risk/reward standpoint I have to invest the smallest amount here.  If it were to increase exponentially I would profit greatly.  If it were to fail I would minimize losses.
I would keep 200k as cash so I could quickly sieze upon opportunities as they present themselves.

@_date: 2019-06-01 03:12:45
Risk/Reward ratios right.  S&amp;P 500 long term average return is a little over 8%.  So if you invested your million and waited 10 years you would likely have approximately $2,159,000.  15 years $3,172,000. At the 15 year mark you could sell and invest in FDIC insured investments and draw over $100,000 annually without touching the origional $3,172,000.  Of course there would come a point when inflation would reduce the effective value of your $100,000/year withdrawl to the point where it doesn't produce the desired quality of life any longer.  That's where owning the business for residuals comes into play.  
I personally like instruments that can can be intrinsically valued.  That's my main quarrel with crypto currency.  There is a rediculous amount of speculation already priced into an investment that could be intrinsically valued at 0.  
I do understand that the intrinsic value for many cryptos is "supposed" to be the amount of energy used to mine said crypto, so I would at least calculate the mining costs of different cryptos and use that as a baseline for evaluating if a particular crypto is overpriced or underpriced.  
Unfortunately pricing based on utility of a particular crypto is extremely difficult to speculate IMO.  Then when you factor in the security factors or regulatory factors which can almost completely wipe out the value of a particular crypto...Its just an extremely risky proposition IMO.

Its 12 days on an ach transfer to coinbase.  If you buy with a credit/debit card it's around double the fee but it takes around 30 minutes.  Theres really no better deal on a quick transaction than coinbase.
Now if you go through coinbase pro and deposit cash you can do an ach transfer in about a week.  After the week you can buy without paying a transaction fee by making a limit order.

Right but if only a single copy existed couldn't that be altered?  Especially if it was a paper copy.  Would hard drives be erased in this situation?  Would all data storage devices get fried?
I would agree that some of the problems exists with fiat as well but the paper would still exist.  All account info would be wiped and I don't even know if banks still use pass books for savings acts.

There are smaller denomination's than a Bitcoin.  One Bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis.
Furthermore Bitcoin it self can be transferred fractionally.  
It could influence the price if Bitcoin becomes more mainstream.  When an actuall wide spread valuation method exists, any lost coins would adjust the formula for higher valuation.  This would come to fruition due to analysts upgrading price targets, just like stocks.
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:27:24
Ever consider it may be possible someone did try to log into your account numerous times and that's why they are being extremely careful.  I've closed out accounts on binance and they pay up no problem.
Either way I mean it's on the blockchain so I wouldn't be that worried about this.  It can be forensically traced if neccessary.  You could definitely gather enough for a lawsuit in this situation.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:08:51
You can burn it for fire when its cold.  There is some utility.
If the shit were to really hit the fan how would you even access your bitcoin?  Without power its pretty difficult.  Without exchanges and wallet services it all falls apart.  What if the servers supporting your wallet fell.  I understand you can look at the chain but what if you can't access it.
I love the idea of bitcoin but it comes with pitfalls as well.  Probably more pitfalls than actual fiat unfortunately.

Not sure it exists.  Buy a small amount on coinbase or coinbase pro and transfer to binance.  Obviously to trade you'll have to learn a lot about different cryptos.  Check charts to establish where coins stand, check the news about the coin you choose, set a limit sell order for 1-2% over the purchase cost.  Wait until the order is executed.  I assume that's what you mean by trading.

Bitcoin value has also been falling for over a year.  Rn it bumped slightly from 25% of it's all time high to around 40% of it's all time high.  Maybe your looking at the wrong time horizon.  Your calling me out on an asset that has lost over half of its value in the past year or 2.  What's worse is its definitely a manipulated market.  Wouldn't surprise me one bit if the recent rise was just another whale pump intended to drive further investment from the devoted ones which will lead to an eventual dump by said whale for profit.  This basically happened all along the path from 19k-5k.

It will still be science fiction.  Maybe 100 years but were not even close.  More likely that we figure out a way to convert other materials into gold first.  So yes a technological advance could certainly destroy the value of gold, but at the same time a technological advance could also destroy the value of bitcoin.  That's litterally what a lot of alt coins are aiming to do.  They aim to be more efficient forms of blockchain and are improved in various ways.  Also a new method besides blockchain could come along.  You never know what the future holds.  
Keep in mind that governments can still basically declare bitcoin illegal if they choose.  It's not quite as safe as people think.  If bitcoin were to become a threat to the value of fiat, its actually kind of likely this could happen.  I don't agree with it, but its definitely a possibility.
Also a lot of people don't realize this but the value of bitcoin is controlled by a select few who move the market in whatever direction they please for profit.  If your wealthy enough you can unfairly manipulate any unregulated market.  That is and has been happening.

Contrary to what you may believe we still havnt established that bitcoin actually has value.  The only value it has is speculatory.  This really isn't debatable either.

You can't get the energy consumed mining back now can you.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:07:12
Maintained its value you ignoramus.  What has bitcoin done in the last 2 years?  It's easy to cherry pick stats to try to push an agenda.  
Gold is a value storing tool.  It will rocket up to around double it's current value whenever the next financial crisis hits and the stock market falls.  The only way it can lose its value from its current point is if a massive amount of gold were to be found.  
Last thing.  Don't go around insulting people's intelligence.  The way you speak to people basically gives away the fact that you yourself are lacking, which is why you are so insecure.  Your holding on to the pipe dream that your magical coin will shoot up to 1 million dollars even though its basically impossible.  Its actually funny to people who plan their investments based on facts.  I'll be sure to get with you on the next dump though to really rub it in.
