Well clearly, you just told all of Reddit where you live. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:43:00
The reason we founded the College Cryptocurrency Network was because you couldn't learn about bitcoin in school. Now they're teaching, researching, and contributing to it. It's kind of mind boggling. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 23:59:36
So I see you've altered this presentation (in which you previously suggested crowdsales were the *only* way to distribute "Reputation," as you now call it)  You suggest instead that you only give this "Rep" (as I'll take the liberty of shortening) to "contributors." Who are these? Investors? Developers? How on earth is that supposed to create a distributed consensus system for Bitcoin Hivemind? Please explain how _your_ software plans to function.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:41:17
If we can reach a consensus on how to move forward with this matter, I am happy to present such a suggestion at Scaling Bitcoin next week. I will be attending on "community coordination" grant and I find this to be hugely appropriate. jeremy for any suggestions. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:36:18
So glad this happened.

That's what I figure. My gold would have been revoked, otherwise. Thus, either Coinbase is seriously vulnerable or just lets low-amount transactions go through with zero-conf. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 21:21:05
You're the man, David Bailey. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:48:09
He did it in the first try. Scout's honor.
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:13:47
eh, zero-conf is only used for low-value transactions. It's what's necessary for good UX. I don't blame Coinbase for doing this.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:20:47
Can't help you there.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:10:57
Hey it's being addressed. Thanks for the ping.
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:38:35
We have already paid for design for the magazine. This is just an awesome opportunity for folks that want to get eyes on their work in a magazine about something they care about. We can fill the magazine with in-house design work, but our chief designer and I thought it would be a nice gesture to give people an opportunity to have their work featured in a magazine with real circulation. 
p.s. I truly appreciate the non-judgement! I use Reddit a lot less than I used to due to the level of vitriol.

There's no incentive. The trading fee distribution is predetermined by the system's algorithms. It's a decentralized system, so there's no trusted parties.

r/bitcoin has gotten so over-censored and bad that stories from 2013 are on the front page. sick.
@_date: 2015-08-22 03:25:21
So this is what r/bitcoin has come to? Apparently, I've been missing nothing.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:03:25
Wow, is it just me, or is it striking to see Nick Szabo? Despite having chatted with him over the internet, it's this deep fascination that's plagued me ever since discovering bitcoin. I feel like my life is more complete now.
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:27:10
So I contacted ActBlue, which is Bernie's fundraising platform. This is what they wrote: "Thanks for writing! While we don't currently offer a Bitcoin donation option, we do appreciate your support and your suggestion and I will certainly pass it along. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns in the meantime."
HIT EM UP!!!!

"Gold is useful. Like Bitcoin and dollars in hand (as opposed to dollars the bank owes you), gold is not under the thumb of the government… or the banks."  It's somewhat amazing how quickly bitcoin is becoming part of the common lexicon.
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:05:25
This is actually correct.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:32:24
Both Augur and Truthcoin will have bitcoin sidechains, thus both add value to bitcoin. One will just be available sooner than the other.

@_date: 2015-07-15 22:02:57
I can't begin to express how fucking proud this makes me. One of the key team members on this project is Daniel Bloch, my cofounder of the College Cryptocurrency Network. I thought Danny was absolutely crazy when, in the face of all the opportunity us two received from our organization, he joined a team of our students from Kenyatta University in Nairobi to start a "Coinbase for Africa." These guys are so kickass, and doing such great work, it's amazing to see their efforts recognized by such an important organization. Sure, the title is misleading, but this is a excellent step forward for a continent that can use all the financial empowerment it can get! 
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:58:23
You found it perfected and witty? Thank you. Upvoted. I actually am manning a booth at a conference right now and firing away responses between (and during) conversations. (Hence why I sound so snarky.)

There's actually a lot of high-quality, Eastern European tech talent, but Estonia is definitely the epicenter of it. I just got my E-Citizenship today and they have wifi, even in the forest!
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:50:10
You're deeply misunderstanding. We LOVE bitcoin and all have deeply vested interests in its success. However, allowing there to be a working implementation of a decentralization PM platform *now* and not in 3-5 years (when sidechains are estimated to come out), is even more important than sticking to ideologies, when we can, in fact, have Augur working with bitcoin at the EXACT same time as Truthcoin, while still building on Ethereum (which will be available quite soon!)
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:00:33
This is the average (including all of the spam) transaction confirmation time. The average wait time for actual users is disproportionately longer. I used Circle yesterday (for reasons I can't remember), a wallet where I can't change the fee, and I had to wait two hours for confirmation. It's not trolls complaining about the spam, it's actual users. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:23:49
College Cryptocurrency Network is 501(c)(3), accepts bitcoin, and, well, should obviously be on this. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:17:47
Actually, he's not. He's creating an altcoin and waiting for sidechains to come out so bitcoin can be used. We're not creating an altcoin (nor dealing with the headache of mining or it's corresponding security), but ARE waiting for sidechains to come out and plan to use bitcoin on the platform at the earliest convenience (AKA just as soon as Truthcoin will use bitcoin.)
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:27:48
This will actually be built into the UI, with the ability to sort through "Trending", "Popular", and "New" Markets. However, such external applications will also be developed by Augur's for-profit!

"According to this year’s International Tax Competitiveness Index, Estonia has the most competitive tax system in the developed world.
Key drivers for Estonia’s high rank are its relatively low corporate tax rate at 21 percent with no double taxation of dividend income, a nearly flat 21 percent income tax rate, a property tax that only taxes the value of land and not the value of building and structures, and a territorial tax system that exempts 100 percent of foreign profits.
Overall, Estonia scores highly in each of the five categories in the index. It ranks first in both corporate taxes and property taxes, second in income taxes, eighth in consumption taxes and eleventh in international tax rules."

They have the world record for business incorporation (17 hours) online. I wanted to be able to incorporate overseas businesses expeditiously and online. Plus, Estonia has the highest number of supermodels per capita, so I figured e-citizenship would give me an excuse for a visit!

u/eragmus We would love to find a time to chat with you about Augur, as it seems you're mostly quite well informed about these projects. I can't say I completely agree with all of your reasoning, but I totally respect your opinion. If you wouldn't mind shooting me an email at jeremy that would be awesome! Also, feel free to join our Slack, which can be accessed on our website. I really would love to hear more of your feedback.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:36:48
Sorry, I wasn't clear: by "external applications", I meant a standalone app such as the one you outlined. We'll be building a sort of Bloomberg Terminal-like system, as well!
@_date: 2015-07-31 23:55:59
What a bizarre assertion. If this is "the most creative use of the Bitcoin Blockchain to date", Ethereum is far from the worse "vaporware" I've come across in this industry. What an insult to the remittance companies creating more frictionless payment systems for the world's poor, or Factom, which has the potential to reduce accounting corruption in both the developing and developed world.... and virtually every other innovative blockchain startup... 
@_date: 2016-02-16 21:14:08
BTC payment processors are restricted for the same reason as credit card processors. The only way this could be done viably by marijuana businesses is holding bitcoin, which is not financially responsible nor practical.

@_date: 2016-09-12 14:20:13
It's tough to be a startup, especially when you're bootstrapping. Also keep in mind that minimum is $15 here (not glamourous, but also unlivable in the Bay if you're frugal.) That being said, there are many well paying jobs if you know where to look. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:42:12
I love the sentiment, but if you're a (software?) developer, you should really consider working in this industry. There are a lot of good paying jobs and a shortage of qualified applicants. That way you can work for bitcoin in both ways! Feel free to ping me if you need guidance.
@_date: 2016-09-11 21:40:40
This literally has nothing to do with bitcoin. C'mon.
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:15:45
lol. I have built a company on top of Ethereum (Augur) and won't shy away from that decision. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different utilities, as does Ripple, potentially Hyperledger, and in the future, probably many other chains. I understand that this isn't a popular opinion on this forum, but it is the stark reality of blockchain/distributed ledger technology. Expecting the bitcoin blockchain to be the silver bullet of decentralized and distributed databases is a ridiculous presumption.
I don't really have any response to your Coinbase comment, given that we're also investors in most other major bitcoin companies. But I may have to frame this Reddit comment of the century: "*Rather than following your guidance, OP's value is better preserved by shaming your work.*" Thank you for this gem.

I've done it before. Never gotten much of a reply until now. Also I (mistakenly) thought it was pretty well known how Silicon Valley as whole and, in particular, the bitcoin/blockchain space are badly in need of talent! I'll think how to craft my message and maybe create a Medium post that I can link to here. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:11:29
Company websites, Angel.co, speaking to people who work at/run companies and to VCs, and then there are gigs on website like Coinality... Normally whenever a company announces a financing, assuming it is timely, a flurry of hirings follows, so that's always a good time to reach out.
@_date: 2016-09-22 04:01:35
I can vouch for these guys. Very trustworthy!
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:26:33

No connection between Augur and Antminer except that one of Bitmain's US reps lives in the Crypto Castle, and I know the team in China from my visit there. But the others in the thread are correct, and that this is a small industry, so for those of us that have high levels of interactions with other companies, we tend to know most players. (i.e. there's nothing nefarious going on.) Furthermore, I'm happy to say we recovered the coin!
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:51:37
This is actually not true. I met with the head of a major international investment bank yesterday and he said the diametric _opposite_. They will never use a *proprietary* blockchain. That's why they're super interested in Ethereum.
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:33:45

Sealed bids... as in I have no idea if I have the highest bid? 
@_date: 2015-10-06 02:56:48
This is mostly speculation, but I think they buy primarily directly from miners (e.g. BitFury) and wholesalers (e.g. DigitalBTC). However, don't expect any single purchase through Circle (which has a $2.5k buy max, I believe— I was a beta user and I still think that's my cap) to create any price pressure. The best way to create price pressure is through exchanges, not broker-dealers. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 01:18:46
Ripple and BTC were also in the first season when they need to wash money lol.
