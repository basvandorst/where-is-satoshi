This is one of the top 3 poker sites still available to American poker players.  The games are denominated in USD, but players are now able to deposit and withdraw using bitcoins at current market prices.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:03:21
All of the bitcoin poker sites are small and have very few players (50 or less most days with only SWCPoker getting up to 100ish on some days).  Those sites include Nitrogen, Bitzino, BetCoin (run by morons), and [SWCPoker](
If you don't mind playing in USD after you deposit bitcoin, and cashing out in bitcoin when you withdraw, then there are a variety of much larger sites that you can play on (sites with 150-1500 players active at any given time).  Those sites include [BetOnline]( [Sportsbetting.ag]( [Full Flush Poker]( [5Dimes]( [SportBet]( [Island Casino]( [America's Cardroom]( [Black Chip Poker]( [True Poker]( and [YaPoker](

He's lodging the phrase "buy bitcoin" deep into the subconscious of passersby. Is the effect measureable currently? Doubtful. Is there an effect? 
Absolutely ^^albeit^^probably^^^small
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:55:55
Absolutely. It took a huge outcry from users for Coinbase to agree to give their bitcoin holding clients access to their bitcoin cash. Whether they wanted to hold or dump them, they're in for a wait even after winning the fight.
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:17:24
$31 bucks a piece. I don't see any volume discount either! Spot at $17.13... yea, that's a healthy mark up.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:08:55


107 trillion and counting actually  
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:24:00
This is my understanding of it. That the two are so similar that the name "bitcoin" could conceivably apply to either of them. Then again, what do I know. I read one article and am swayed towards BTC and then I read another and am swayed towards BCH. I can't make up my mind so I'm just holding what little I have in both for now while attempting to wrap my head around all of this.

On the other hand there are stock analysts on CNBC saying btc 5,000 and btc 7,500 in just the last 2 weeks that I've seen.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:57:06
That might work for people with small amounts. This is 4mm. Surely his local exchange/bank(s) will notice the constant influx of money. You risk not only fines, but perhaps prison for this sort of thing!  
I think paying tax is the right play. Minimizing those taxes with a smart and legal strategy would be the play that would help me to sleep the most at night if I were in his shoes.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:26:43
That's all I read these days. Never a real source when it comes to a "big" news item. Always some "confidential government employee" or some such. Hard to tell what's what nowadays.

I have a friend who now owns a "cheap" $16,000 couch he bought from Overstock years back.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:25:56
I don't know one way or the other, but judging by the articles I've read in the last few years, they pretty much have access to all forms of communication. Thus, if they wanted to know something about a digital person of interest, they'd simply look it up in their databases.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:40:06
I assume they have a rather unlimited budget and that anything is possible. But what do I know.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:25:20
You most certainly can do all of those things with Bitcoin. If not directly, then via gift card purchase, or a service which will take a small commission to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:42:28
Do you often exchange stocks for gift cards or getting your electric bill paid?
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:34:29
I'm with you. In my business, when fees were in the pennies, our recreational users could become bitcoin users at a cheap price, quickly, and were converting at higher rates. Now that our fresh amateur recreataional players have to pay sometimes $5-$7 to move $50, they do it once, and then never want to use bitcoin again. 
It's hurting our business, hurting conversions, and likely hurting the bitcoin brand. I want the low fees back and I don't understand why it's so difficult to achieve.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:26:33
Minimum invoice is $1 from $0.04... but the recommended miner's fees these days is, as of this morning on blockchain.info, about $1.55. These miner's fees are getting out of control. A year ago the reco'd miner's fees were $0.08-$0.12 USD equivalent.  
I fear for bitcoin and [bitpay]( despite these changes. :(

I ain't got time for this life and learning shit. I wanna watch some (insert shitty TV show).
P.S. Nice post, upvoted.

How many active misinformation campaigns are there in the world now you think?

Ty for the link. I like to read things like this at times to remind myself to stick to the straight and narrow.

Who's version of History are we talking about here? You realize that "his story" varies greatly depending on which man (country) we're getting our information from.

I'd personally like to thank you for helping people to spend bitcoin. While many like to hold, if no one used them for transactions, the ability for btc to appreciate in price would evaporate. Thanks for supporting the community!

What do you think modern "education" is exactly? Truths?

People on the Internet troll?  No way!?
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:17:50
So essentially, you just hit a grand slam. And now, you have a ton of bitcoin in a tax advantaged vehicle under your own control.
Well played sir. Well played.

You can disable your 2FA after a failed login and/or change the email address. You'll need your personalized phrase to do so however.

I'm not a complete newb. I'm not going to run out and put all my business on some other wallet. I'm just hoping you'll PM me and tell me what wallet(s) you're talking about and what site(s) you've seen them on. I can further research these myself :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 06:14:12
Because it's a brand new option and they haven't updated it yet...

still down for me also
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:42:38
I know people who hae been moving btc at 60-70 rate the last few days. Takes a few hours, but all transactions confirmed.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:33:25
Yea, I agree, localbitcoins has high premiums. There are other places that btc can be swapped online, but I suppose one has to be part of the community to get in.
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:28:36
Yea. Many people seem to think there was someone/some group of people "spamming" the network with false transactions to slow things down and increase fees in recent past. It has definitely calmed down however.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:04:42
I was shocked we never tested ~1250 from above.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:55:15
Plunking a ton of money into an index fund at the top of a bull market in both bonds and stocks that has lasted nearly a decade is not a good idea IMHO.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:49:58
I think this is an interesting social experiment. I've tried social experiments on the Internet before such as telling someone how bad something was then giving them a link to try it out anyway along with a second link to show them good choices. Very few people chose the bad link, *BUT* some people did.
I expect you'll get a sucker or two. Perhaps enough to pay for the URL registration and domain  hosting :)
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:31:18
I wanted to say but forgot to add it.  
I don't disagree with your premise however. Those reviews in the appstore are probably rigged.
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:05:54
There are very few things in this world where making a 6k deposit somewhere gives out a near 2k instant return. Be wary whatever it is.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:52:14


This isn't what I used. I would simiply rec an email confirmation code that I had to plug in after putting in my blockchain.info password. I simply can't figure out how to re-enable it :(
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:48:14
Heh, I was certain that btc was going to test $1250ish from above before breaking through 2k. I was clearly wrong. If the technology interests you, buy it IMO.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:59:50
I'm no expert here, but this appears to be bids on some trading platform. Looks like there are a lot of 25, 50, and 75 btc bids.  OFC, this could be sell tickets for all I know!!
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:04:00
I'd also second localbitcoins for buying and selling in your situation. However, the spread is high there. Lots of premium being paid. A cheaper way to cash out might be using BitPay ([article on setting it up]( You can get a visa debit card there and convert your bitcoin into cash on the sell side for 1%.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:05:16
1) Gold is typically a store of value in times of financial turmoil. Bitcoin is also starting to take on a similar role.  
2) They both tend to go up versus fiat when the USD trades down.  
3) Both are used by citizens to circumvent the banking system in some countries.

Seemingly a CNBC reporter had trouble living off of bitcoin in New York City for a week. Someone should school her...
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:07:45
The government there was actively going after crypto farms. But there are more and more black market exchanges popping up. This is what happens when central banking and money printing fails and brings on hyperinflation. The people make their own markets.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:46:27
It might be a temporary issue. I've been trying for 10 min to get my 2fa email to no avail.

I suppose that you could also research a VPN that was not well known. They exist I'm told. VPN's who specialize in providing private services where their IP blocks are not public domain.

An exchange or a private sale IMHO.

And where do you think you're going to find 7% yearly interest in anything even remotely "safe"?

Very large for you might be quite small to others. Are we talking hundreds of dollars or hundreds of bitcoins?

I'll loan you my girlfriend. Lets say 10btc... get rid of that little rounding error and give you a nice flat number :)

When the number of unconfirmed transactions is lower, you can get away with lower fees, generally speaking.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:58:47
Never heard of that before. That's kinda cool.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:30:14


I beg to differ. In the online poker world, blockchain.info is recommended as a wallet to newbies quite frequently because it's online, quick to set up, and doesn't care about gambling based transactions. Here are some examples:

Believe it or not, not every "rich" person hangs out with lawyers in their free time.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:09:58
I thought most of them allowed this? blockchain.info surely does if you keep any coins online there.

In theory, zero is the lowest it can go.

Sticky pricing. Happens to consumers all the time. Gas prices are a great example. Once the consumer is conditioned to pay a certain price, dropping it down isn't necessary to do so quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:13:25
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:35:28
Good point.

That's the God of the central bankers is it not?
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:00:37
This sort of thing happens all the time in "regulated" financial markets. In unregulated markets, sure, why not!
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:53:56
Sounds like a scam to me as well.
