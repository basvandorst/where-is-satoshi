What is !Intip 100? haha so confused
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:09:10
not 100% on the whole BTC dominance but hopefully be proven wrong. 700$ worth of BTC and counting... maybe not much but I’m putting as much as I’m willing to lose, the rest in the TFSA.

Damn. Thanks Red Bagpipes ����

just reached 0.035 BTC... slowly but surely... not much but it's a start...
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:33:46
i just checked... deposit is free

I might go to Binance since I already got an account there !!
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:51:56
but i compared the fees and binance is definitely cheaper no ? and the problem is my bank BMO does not accept cryptocurrency purchases. No idea why or what to do ? Maybe transfer to paypal or something
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:43:52
is it in the app store ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:15:57
sounds about right. i usually have 1000$ left per month and usually allocate 30% of it towards bitcoin and the rest to my tfsa.

didn’t of their existence since I rather applications that can be on iphone but whats the advantage of coinbase pro compared to coinbase ?
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:27:53
don't be lazy? dude gtfoh
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:18:14
i mean with all fees considered isn’t binance the cheapest ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:02:44
just bought my first 350$ worth of bitcoin couple of days ago... adding into it slowly... hopefully hit the 1000$ mark soon !!!

That’s what I was thinking with Exodus. I guess I’ll stick to Bread since if I somehow lose my phone or something... I’ll always have the codes !! But as far as a platform to buy BTC at a decent price and fees ?
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:19:12
What do you mean fair price ? You referring that Coinbase sells slightly higher ? anyways Cashapp is not available here, from Canada
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:46:17
so instead of Coinbase what other alternative ? I guess I can keep my wallet (Bread) as is... and just change from where ai buy right ? Oh and I do have an old version of Exodus wallet on my macbook that I never used...
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:15:37
I just transferred everything into Coinbase. Then into my wallet (Bread). I got a little like 10 cents left over in Binance but I will not be using it no more. Buy on Coinbase then send to Bread, sounds about right ?
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:14:02
just transfered all my btc/xrp form binance to coinbase !! converted xrp into btc and will still to coinbase and got my wallet (bread)
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:24:44
I mean there’s going to be fees regardless whenever I would transfer to Coinbase, no?
