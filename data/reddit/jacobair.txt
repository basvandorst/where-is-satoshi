I put you on Airbitz's bitcoin business directory here  so that more people can know you take bitcoin. Airbitz's only has business that are confirmed to accept bitcoin manually so it's much higher quality than coinmap.

For a mobile wallet, try out Airbitz. It's easy to use, has a built in directory and has a good focus on security and privacy.

Looks like the first Mexican restaurant taking bitcoin. Awesome!
Can we get one that is a bit more south though? I'd go to it all the time.

This is not possible for the app the give you a choice. Not the app's fault, that's Apple's fault.
