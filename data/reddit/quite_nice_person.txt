I think the difference is pretty much this: doge is a reddit community with its own cryptocurrency, while bitcoin is a cryptocurrency with a reddit community. 
I agree that can be a crappy place sometimes, but that doesn't change my opinion of Bitcoin as a form of money.

Your understanding of a wallet as basically nothing more than a list of keys is spot on. A wallet is simply a list of your private keys and their associated addresses (or public keys). (Though the term 'wallet' is also sometimes used to describe the software used to access your bitcoin)
The reason you'll often read guides telling you to take such huge security precautions when setting up a wallet (read: generating the private keys which will give you access to your bitcoin) is that you are the *only person* who is going to be taking responsibility for the security of your wallet. Any pre-existing malware on your system could potentially steal *all of your money*, and there'd be almost nothing you could do to get it back. This is where the email analogy breaks down, because
* an attacker getting access to all of your email, while certainly not a good thing, is still probably not as life-destroying as someone stealing all of your life savings with no way for you to retrieve them, and
* access to your email is controlled by a third party (Google, Microsoft, etc), and they are taking the security precautions on your behalf. With bitcoin, it's all your responsibility.
Personally, I sometimes feel like the some of the wallet security guides I've seen take the paranoia a little too far. If you're just carrying around a small amount of bitcoin on your phone, or experimenting with small transactions on your PC, there's probably no need to be quite so worried. But if I was storing my life savings in a paper wallet, I'd probably want to take more precautions.

The issue here isn't the lack of any recourse, it's the fact that it was so easy to make the mistake in the first place.

I agree with you. Calling a list of keys a 'wallet' is a bit of a bad analogy and causes confusion. As far as the core bitcoin protocol is concerned, a wallet doesn't even exist as a construct. It's just a list of keys. 'Keyring' would be a better name, really.

If you use gmail, you could set up a filter to automatically delete/archive the messages. Other than that, I don't think there's any way of stopping the emails for an issue you've starred :/

The reason people will recommend using a computer that has never been online is that *any PC which has touched the internet could potentially contain malicious software* (downloaded through some undiscovered security vulnerability in your OS) which could capture your private keys and send them to a third party later.

Worked for me - the address is [1BitcoinfqhdmTfcsCAptsgC9bN2oSKrx1](

**Nothing** stops them from bruteforcing the private key except that it is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very improbable.

Uh, what? My post was genuine. I scanned the address with an android app and got that address.
