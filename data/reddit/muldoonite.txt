Next step is QR code on a pancake.

So once someone has the private key, how do they use it to move the bitcoin? Is this something that can be done only with a specific type of wallet program?

Anyone have suggestions on a good cheap printer to use this with?

Happy St. Patrick's Day. I'm gonna pass my bits on to a friend who's new to bitcoin!

Cool! I used an exchange for the first time the other week (Circle) and it worked great. I can't wait till I get up to 1 BTC lol. Slow and steady!

Add Trent Reznor as a supporter, throw in a little of his music in the background and Trezor will go TO THE MOON

"We've bought ourselves a really really big vault, and it was expensive, and we opened that giant warehouse sized vault and we parked a tricycle in it."  lol i love this analogy.

The app is available for Android as well.

I stream very sporadically, and the games vary. I have a QR code up as well as ChangeTip!

You think 50 Cent would ever change his name to 50 Bit?
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:13:07
This sounds pretty cool! I'm gonna test it out now.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:54:09
Seems like they extended the offer AGAIN until 5PM ET.

If you are looking for great info on bitcoin, I highly recommend talks from Andreas Antonopoulos. This is a great one he did this year at MIT. Starts at 33:37. He does a wonderful explanation of how the blockchain works which helped me get a better grasp of it.

maybe you have a secret admirer
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:18:16
when will NUTELLA make the same announcement?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:36:36
I'm not knowledgeable when it comes to art, but this Monet painting left an impression on me for whatever reason 
Same with this (I especially like the shape of the water container) 
I also remember deciding to randomly go to the National Gallery in DC while visiting my aunt and really liked the sculpture on the left of this page titled 'Amazon preparing for battle' 
I need to visit museums more. Maybe they should start accepting BTC for admission?

How's this? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:45:25
I'll probably just stick to my doge bitcoin ms paint poster 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:21:50
Can you all critique my MS Paint skills: 
i'm not homeless btw, i just like doges.

Ah, I see. I wasn't familiar with how change worked. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:35:18
the power of ms paint 
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:21:13
such worth to try :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:07:28
Whoa, thanks! I think I'm relatively new to the doge meme which is what prompted me to draw that lol.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:47:30
my attempt, brought to you by ms paint  
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:46:44

@_date: 2013-12-01 22:08:31
