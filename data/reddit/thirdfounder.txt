virtually all the demand is speculative. that's why prices are jumping around. when that demand leaves, BTC will probably go back to 500 for a pizza or whatever. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:47:56
bullshit. prices are publicly available. the fact is there was no inflation because "money printing" is a simple swap between the Fed and the banking system that does not add financial assets to the system. indeed we've experienced the weakest inflationary period of the postwar era thanks to systemic deleveraging.

it's not as though Hayek sprung up ex nihilo.  Austrian thinking evolved from the classical liberalism that was prominent in economic thinking in opposition to utilitarianism throughout the 19th century.  it has had and continues to have terrific and sometimes undue influence.
that Hayek and what followed him was not enough for any civilized country to hang economic policy on is not an error to be corrected.  it was the result of people realizing that it could not be made to work.

@_date: 2014-02-25 15:18:05
no it can not.  that is something people with zero real knowledge of economics say.
money supply as you conceive it is simply not correct.  the stock of USD financial assets in the economy has not quadrupled, which is why things have not quadrupled in price.  the metric you are deducing this from -- either M1 or MZM, i expect, or a derivative thereof -- does not mean what you think it means.  
it is instead an artifact of the balance sheet created by central banking, and not particularly meaningful in terms of private sector inflation -- which, for the record, is the increase in the price level, not in any measure of money supply.  [this is the link to MIT's Billion Price Project]( which aggregates real prices from retailers to measure the price level directly.  as you can see, it is almost identical to the government measure of CPI.

i am not saying bitcoin has to die or go away or whatever.  it will continue on, i'm sure.
i am saying that, if you just hold and do nothing -- particularly if you've sold dollars to buy bitcoin recently as prices have risen -- you will see that paper wealth evaporate as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning.
this is not price rising to some "fundamental value" -- there is no quantifiable fundamental value to a bitcoin. 
this is a speculative mania in a small market being overwhelmed by dollar inflows, and it will eventually reverse and collapse.

worse than that, actually -- a fiat currency spent into existence by a government has a guaranteed end market: taxes.  dollars are the only thing you can pay for your taxes with, and that means we all must have dollars.

the two ideas are sides of the same coin.  the value of money does rest on the guaranteed demands of tax. the function of currency in exchange relies to some extent on its capacity as a store of value. no one wants to trade for something whose value might wink out as they hold it. that, however, describes bitcoins - some other obviously superior crypto currency could emerge tomorrow and bitcoins would be all done, instantly worthless, with no willing buyer. whoever is holding becomes a bagholder. and that can happen at any time - bitcoins are completely dispensable. 
not so the dollar. you and everyone else know that you will need dollars to pay tax, that everyone will have to procure at least a third or so of their real income in dollars. that is immutable at least until the collapse of our country.
in short,  bitcoins have only consent to value them - you need a greater fool willing to trade something real for one. dollars, however, have the force of the state and his taxman behind them - they are as real as the jail time the IRS will give you for not acquiring them.

i didn't invent the story about the effects on businesses i put up there -- that the observed effect of deflationary currency spikes in the real world.  in the Depression of the early 1930s in the US, store shelves went bare because producers were going bankrupt everywhere. why didn't they just raise prices?
because there's no one to sell to -- people cut consumption to hoard the currency, demand falls, and there are now too many producers around.  so some go bankrupt -- and now their former workers aren't buying anything, forcing another wave of demand contraction. and so it goes, spiraling down until the economy is too impoverished to hoard and must spend whatever it has.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:10:49


in fact it does, insofaras it has the weaponry and loyalty to enforce upon everyone regardless of their contrary opinion the need to pay tax in whatever currency it declares by fiat.  since the dawn of the city-state, that is what makes a currency, full stop.  
all claims to the contrary are a lot of poorly grounded libertarian ideological mishmash, which the bitcoin universe is unfortunately loaded with.
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:31:31
none of that is going to happen, though, because the premise of this article is ridiculous. the dollar will continue to be the currency of the United States because it's the only way to cancel tax obligations. even if you make all your money in some other currency (be it euro or yen or bitcoins) you owe tax in dollars on your gain.
there is no Great Currency Replacement coming, and people should quit talking as if that were possible. the idea is straight crackpot and makes the whole community look cuckoo. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:55:33
mtgox may have resolved this debate by closing "temporarily".  there's some chance it will not reopen -- which may not be what mtgox intended, but it might happen anyway.
the reason markets try not to close their doors in crisis is that you cannot know if they will reopen.  what happens if, when they try, they have nothing but sell orders?  what do they do?  there is no central bank to step in, no market makers, nothing.  under that circumstance, the answer is they can't reopen.
EDIT: the quote now (10:30 CDT) at btc-e is around $70 -- that's $50 under the mtgox last trade. this is going to make it far harder to reopen, as the folks frozen there have lost a third of their value in an hour with no liquidity.  if there were a central bank, this is where they would intervene to ramp the price back up to where mtgox could open with minimal disruption. as it is, i expect it's going to be very tough for them.  they may just stay closed if there's no recovery in price.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:23:03
but it IS suffering for some.  
it's important to realize that currency is a two-way transaction -- there are holders of currency and holders of goods. and in any mature currency, there are creditors and there are debtors. 
if you are a debtor in bitcoin right now, your world is ending and you are contemplating suicide.
if you are a butcher, baker, or candlestick maker who bought your raw goods in bitcoin two weeks ago, and now can't sell finished product except at a massive loss, likewise you're ruined.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:43:01
well, the thing is, stocks are valuable because they represent in law ownership of the equity stake of a productive enterprise.  that enterprise has some balance sheet equity value in liquidation that the stock holder has claim to.  moreover, the net income of the enterprise is distributable to the stock holder -- you buy not only the net equity of the shop but the right to its net income. 
those are real assets.  you can take the dollars you earn from dividends to pay tax obligations arising from other income you may have.  the stock certificate may be an abstraction, but it grants you claim to the real physical assets of the enterprise.
bitcoin has none of that.  there is no production, no enterprise, no cash flow, no nothing -- just a confidence game.
even derivatives -- speculative as they are -- grant you real legal rights enforceable in a court of law.  when you buy an option, you gain the right to acquire some real asset at some strike price at/before some future date.  when you buy a future, you buy the right to take delivery of a real asset on a certain date.
again, bitcoin has none of that.

one difference is, though, that the CME or CBOT or whomever is going by a set of rules.  mtgox is flying by the seat of their pants.
the other thing is that there's an open debate as to whether circuit breakers are actually helpful.  some think they work as amplifiers -- increasing the panic.  in a market like the CBOT, the time can be used to marshal liquidity providers to take the order flow, but there are no liquidity providers in mtgox afaik.

so what? anyone expecting inflation out of a mere like-for-like asset swap is going to be disappointed.  the Fed could quadruple its rate of QE and it would not matter in the slightest.
the dollar at least is relatively stable in its float. the volatility of bitcoin is precluding its use as a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:19:41
pegging the currency can happen, but it has little to do with QE.
quantitative easing is simply the central bank manipulating the composition of the private sector balance sheet -- it takes bonds (or whatever asset it is buying) off of the balance sheet of its dealer banks and replaces them with reserves.
it doesn't put more cash into circulation. it can affect interest rates -- the central bank decides at what price it will fix its purchases, and lower interest rates generally mean weaker currency.  and it could directly affect forex crosses IF the central bank decides to buy assets in foreign denominations (eg, BoJ buying US Treasuries) -- and this is how pegging or floors/ceilings can be accomplished, as the Swiss central bank did in recent years or the Chinese central bank does to enforce its dirty float.
at no point has Japan pegged the yen. it intervenes at times, but to questionable effect. there's no mention of foreign bond buying here.

the words you're looking for are "**tax evasion**".  if bitcoin becomes a serious tax haven, the feds will obviously move to destroy it.  please don't imagine they couldn't.  
if you enjoy lawlessness, by all means live it -- but for your "safety" i'd recommend moving to a society more amenable to anarchism, far from the IRS and FBI.  like the Congo -- there you won't be a despicable free rider on the lawfulness of others, and actually pay the full price of the liberty you wrongly presume to be your birthright and not a product of a society habituated to law.
for me, though, this sort of statement


will always reduce me to wonder: how is it that one can live in such terrible fear of the "government whim" while being apparently completely ignorant of the caprice of a confidence game like bitcoin, which could blow away in any stiff wind?  it's amazing what the ideology of hyperindividualism will lure a man to think.

the problem is that, when this view becomes the common one among most participants, you're traditionally on the "last" crash.
the function of market crashes is to transfer wealth from the weak to the strong.  if the weak refuse to hand it over, prices continue to advertise lower until everyone who can sell does.  the more stubborn they are in the belief that this is all just temporary, the further and deeper price goes.

@_date: 2013-04-11 19:21:36


it absolutely is.
imagine a farmer with ten cows, a barn, and some seed on January 1. these are all he has, but it has a estimated net worth of $100.
he spends the year sowing the seeds, pulling weeds, waiting for rain, rejoicing when it rains, harvesting his crop; he grazes his cattle, breeds them, three calves are born, kills one to eat.
on December 31, he has twelve cows, a (slightly worn) barn, some seed and some surplus crop that he plans to eat during the next year.  he hasn't sold a thing and doesn't care for money.
but he needs dollars.
he needs them because the tax man is coming.  there are two more cows now than there were, plus the surplus crop that wasn't taken for seed. those things are worth something in real terms, and the difference in his net worth between the start and end of the year represents his income. the tax man evaluates his December 31 net worth to be $120.
our farmer owes tax on his $20 of income, which at 15% is $3.  so he is compelled to go to market, sell some of his surplus crop for $3, and hand the money over to the tax man.
that guaranteed demand, the aggregated economic exchanges of real goods for dollars needed to pay tax is how the real value of the dollar is determined.
and the tax man will never ask for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:11:30
well, except that loans increase the money in circulation -- the bank creates the loan by writing up both the assets and liabilities of the bank.

no offense, but this is a classic bubble comment. i remember reading very similar sentiments in the volatile rises of many a dotcom stock during 1999.
bubbles by their nature must inure some participants to volatility so that they can be suckers when the price finally breaks and starts to run down. typically these folks will have bought during the rise, become convinced that something really novel is happening fundamentally, and become paper-wealthy for a moment -- enough to convince them that they will become much more wealthy with a bit of fortitude.
then they become the bagholders.

no, actually, big crashes are typified by zero liquidity -- particularly in markets like bitcoin which (unlike NYSE or NASDAQ) have no liquidity providers.  bid-ask spreads were $50 at points, which means no trading gets done at all.  it's a panic hunt for size buyers, with the problem that there typically are none in mid-crash.  i wouldn't be surprised to hear tomorrow or next week that some people got filled on orders way, way down in the book -- like $10 -- simply because theirs was the only standing buy order.

that's a bit disingenuous, though.  the dollar is a currency because the United States government has declared it legal tender for all debts, and in particular is the only tender for tax obligations.  that means it has guaranteed powerful demand, as anyone who records an economic gain in the US must obtain a share of that gain in dollars to pay the taxman.  and the taxman is pretty effective in the US.  that's what makes a currency.
all else (that is, all that is not legal tender) is a commodity -- including bullion nowadays, though that was once different. 
commodities and legal tender can both be repositories of wealth, but commodities rely on their perceived utility for their valuation -- whereas legal tender relies on the capacity of the taxman to collect tax.  for commodities that have no economic function to justify their value -- eg, bitcoin, gold, natural diamonds -- their value is something of a confidence game.

no one knows, and it does not matter. 
the dynamics of bubbles are such that inflows beget more hot money inflows -- and that can continue indefinitely, until some critical point is reached and inflows very quickly reverse into outflows. then outflows will beget outflows until the entire edifice crashes all the way down.
if you can sell something you bought for under $20 for $170, take that -- at least some of that -- and be happy rather than greedy.  you will feel very, very dumb as it goes up further... and then, later, thankful as it comes down and you hear the wailing of those who were less prudential.

as someone who has participated in a few bubbles:
the important part is not where the price started, where you bought, or what the difference between them is.
nor is it where the price has gone to, where you sold when you could've held, or where it will go.
the important part is that YOU SELL SOME NOW.
be humble enough to admit that you have no idea when this will end, nor where, nor at what price.
the hardest part of being in a bubble is getting starry-eyed about where things might go, about how rich you might become. that imagining suspends good judgement, and often leads to people buying more, rather than selling, into the teeth of a massive rise. that is how spectacular losses can be recorded.
instead of taking that kind of risk, realize gains and walk away profitable. 
no successful investor ever became successful by waiting for things to get even better when things are going amazingly well. they became successful by selling into price appreciation to realize gains, and gone on to the next thing.
okay, now i've said my bit. good luck to you all.

trouble is, all these developments experienced major bubbles and collapses.
the automotive sector famously went through a couple of manias and crashes. so did the railroad sector. so did telephony. so did the dotcoms.
a famous example is aircraft -- in its early stages there was a massive financing rush as everyone tried to get in on the ground floor of the commercialization of airlines and military aircraft.  the financing bubble eventually collapsed, and it was estimated that 90% of all the money invested in the aircraft industry was lost and written off.
another famous example is canals -- there were several episodes of manias in canal financing that all eventually imploded. the most powerful one ended in the Great Depression of 1837.
just because the technology goes on to widespread use does not mean that the folks who invested in early on it did not get wiped out.  it's common for new tech to go through a handful of massive purge cycles that destroy investors, companies, employers.

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:26
considering that sellers are probably lined up around the digital block and unable to get execution, i'd say very.  it's normal in crashes for liquidity to go away.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:00:26
i'm not scared -- i don't own any. i'm simply saying, academically, this is why markets typically do everything in their power to stay open during a crisis. 
an exchange exists to balance orders and create flow. it can't do that when it closes, and it gets very hard to balance order flow when you close for an hour and the only asset on the exchange loses a third of its value.  typically mature markets have designated liquidity providers and market makers to keep things working. mtgox has none of that.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:07:57
it cannot, mechanically.  and in this case BB and i apparently disagree, as he's trying to create some inflation for his trouble.
the problem is BB is at heart a monetarist -- he subscribes essentially to the doctrines Milton Friedman laid out regarding the quantity of money.
the trouble is that those doctrines are demonstrably wrong -- which is why BB and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, both inveterate monetarists, failed to comprehend the nature of the economic bubbles they oversaw and unwittingly promoted. it's also why their policies (and like policies adopted globally) to resuscitate the economy in the aftermath of 2008 have failed so profoundly.
one of the mechanical realities of fiat currencies with floating rate convertibility (such as the US dollar) is that central bank swaps of the kind we call QE do nothing to increase the actual financial assets in circulation -- what we should think of as 'money'.  it's just an exchange -- an interest-bearing bond comes out, an interest-bearing asset called 'reserves' go in, in equivalent amounts. why should that have any direct effect on inflation? 
the answer is that it doesn't. if it did, then Switzerland -- whose central bank's balance sheet is now up to 85% of Swiss GDP, as opposed to the Fed's 32% -- would be swimming in inflation. instead, the Swiss have experienced deflation since 2011.

that is exactly correct. what the government spends into existence through deficits becomes the net financial assets of the economy. the currency system is just an overlay to the productive economy -- like a scorekeeping system, in which the government is the scorekeeper.


if you have an income in bitcoins that you derive in exchange for goods and services, you are legally obligated to pay tax just as you would if you took gold or yen or euros in like exchange. and chances are [IRS enforcement of the rules is on the way]( given the state of affairs. if you have trading gains from the appreciation of bitcoin, they will become taxable when realized.
so you definitely owe tax if those conditions apply. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:04:59
we did, but people misunderstand what that means. the dollar being convertible to some metal isn't particularly important to the use of the dollar as a currency -- as has been shown by closing the gold window.  what IS important is that you have to use it in order to pay taxes.  that guarantees demand for it.  we all need dollars if we have any taxable income, because we're going to end up having to pay something more than a third of our real income in them -- even if we made the money in some other currency, like yen or euro or bitcoins.  
that is why the dollar has value.  it has nothing to do with belief.
bitcoin, however, really is about finding the [greater fool](  you don't have to have bitcoins to do anything; they're only worth anything if you can convince a greater fool to exchange something real for them.
no one can erase them or shut them down, but then neither does anyone need them for anything. there's no reason to have one.  and that's why every other alternative currency ever tried in the US has blown away in the wind.

this is the really sad thing i keep hearing -- folks, all crashes are essentially DDoS attacks. floods of sellers overwhelm the buyers and the infrastructure, buyers spook, liquidity vanishes and there is no floor.  apparently few here have lived through and traded crashes before, but it's completely normal not to be able to get your orders through or to even get reliable data.  
in the 1929 crash, the ticker sometimes fell hours behind. in 2008 the NYSE failed and the ticker fell hours behind. this was to be expected -- and it's sad for me to see that so few apparently expected it.  lots of newbies learning hard lessons here.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:25:58
for an individual, it's obviously not a problem to convert your bitcoins to pay tax. but systemically that is not a basis for sustaining bitcoins. without a need,  the system can be replaced at any moment with something else that appears more convenient - and that something else will quickly make bitcoins worthless. and it's a matter of time before some crisis makes any alternative seem desirable.
and i beg to differ that you become exempt from tax if you earn in bitcoins. if you earn, you owe. if you think otherwise, consult a tax advisor. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:00:58
no, but that's not really fair either. there was plenty of press in the FT and elsewhere about the bubble in dotcoms, in housing, and much else once it got going.  no one can predict the genesis of a bubble. it's not hard to predict its end, though.
what happening in bitcoin is hardly a novel phenomena. the bitcoin-USD price chart is one of the most famous in investing.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:35:18
i also don't know what the price will do. 
what i do know is that rapid price appreciation in any asset almost invariably leads to some form of "this time it's different".  there's some new paradigm, some new condition, something is novel, never been seen/tried/tested before, that justifies what is clearly not justifiable in any other way.
each and every one of those bubbles have come crashing back to earth.
what you're trying to tell me is that bitcoin is different.  and maybe it is -- but the rhetoric is exactly the same.  that's good enough for me to get some popcorn, take a seat, and enjoy whatever is left in this unfolding tragedy.

@_date: 2013-04-03 19:46:38
i don't expect it would -- but if you're deriving economic gains in bitcoin, your local taxing authority probably wants its cut of that gain in its local currency (euro, yen, whatever) just like the US government does.
of course there's a difference between what the law says and what they are prepared to enforce -- the US government, for example, has thusfar not beset bitcoin users with audits and warrants in an effort to catch tax evaders. but they surely could if they desired to.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:33:46
this is going to be lost here, but i'll explain why i think bitcoin is well and truly over.  to do so, i have to explain why bitcoin -- a fiat currency called into existence by nothing but consent -- does not have an intrinsic value, whereas the dollar -- a fiat currency called into existence by the force of law -- does.
imagine a farmer with ten cows, a barn, and some seed on January 1. these are all he has, but it has a estimated net worth of $100.
he spends the year sowing the seeds, pulling weeds, waiting for rain, rejoicing when it rains, harvesting his crop; he grazes his cattle, breeds them, three calves are born, kills one to eat.
on December 31, he has twelve cows, a (slightly worn) barn, some seed and some surplus crop that he plans to eat during the next year. he hasn't sold a thing and doesn't care for money.
but he needs dollars.
he needs them because the tax man is coming. there are two more cows now than there were, plus the surplus crop that wasn't taken for seed. those things are worth something in real terms, and the difference in his net worth between the start and end of the year represents his income. the tax man evaluates his December 31 net worth to be $120.
our farmer owes tax on his $20 of income, which at 15% is $3. so he is compelled to go to market, sell some of his surplus crop for $3, and hand the money over to the tax man.
that guaranteed demand, the aggregated economic exchanges of real goods for dollars needed to pay tax is how the real value of the dollar is determined.
and the tax man will never, never, **ever** ask for bitcoins.
the dollar being convertible to some metal isn't particularly important to the use of the dollar as a currency -- as has been shown by closing the gold window. what IS important is that you have to use it in order to pay taxes. that guarantees demand for it. we all need dollars if we have any taxable income, because we're going to end up having to pay something more than a third of our real income in them -- even if we made the money in some other currency, like yen or euro or bitcoins.

this likely is that crisis of confidence for bitcoin.

to be fair, asset bubbles can be a form of a ponzi scheme -- as Hyman Minsky well articulated in his financial instability hypothesis, demand in large bubble assets are often financed through three stages (hedge, speculative, and ponzi), the last being where the cost of servicing the underlying debt must be obtained by capital gains on the financed assets.
bubbles often involve savvier operators finding greater fools to bleed holdings off to at ever higher prices in order to make those debt service payments. 
of course i doubt anything like that is going on in the little bitcoin bubble, but it's worth noting anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:33:06

@_date: 2013-04-16 19:11:17
from what i can see on this subreddit, they're not really gone -- just sitting on big losses, feeling stupid, and wondering what they can do about it. 
that makes me think the deflation of the bubble probably has quite a bit further to go.  it won't be until all these people sell -- and they will, eventually, because they aren't in bitcoin as a religion but as a punt, and lower prices will force cognitive dissonance -- that things will finally quiet down.  if bitcoin survives at all, that is.

it's zero sum, though, like any secondary market.  it's very likely that the savvy operators have been steadily liquidating into this massive rise. that's the only way large holders can take gains into the mania. 
the idea is to transfer large blocks held by the savvy into small blocks held by those drawn like moths to the flame. the money gets made by people who bought at $5 or less and have steadily sold pieces at $10, $20, $30, $50.  no wise operator jumps in at $70 unless they intend to hold for ten minutes or less -- once its gone parabolic, its just too risky.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:02:46
listen -- i traded in the dotcom of the late 1990s. here's some free advice:
if you're upset, it's time to sell at least some. don't think about how wealthy you might be or become; think about how emotionally devastated you will be if you lose it all.  this is a mania, and it will turn into a panic and a crash.  **do not wait for that to happen.**  
sell half or a third.  then start smiling with relief and sleeping normally knowing that, if bitcoin goes from $140 back to $1 -- as many, many, many, many bubble assets do in crashes -- you will have done very well.
once you sell, stop looking at the price.  it does not matter where it goes.  do not feel dumb if it runs to $400 or $1000 -- it might do that, just as it might run straight to zero.  always keep in mind the words of Baron von Rothschild:


@_date: 2013-04-11 15:07:13
i 'd put one in -- you might get hit.  market stoppages are strange things, and the longer they go on the less confidence there should be in the reopening.  panic can accumulate outside the closed doors.
there doesn't need to be, fwiw, a complete absence of buys to stay closed. what there needs to be is an overwhelming preponderance of sells with no market maker to take up the unfilled orders.
anyway, there's also a chance (a better chance, i hope) that they reopen without too much turmoil.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:16:19
what i mean to say is that currency is legal tender and can retire tax debt -- and that's all it is. definitions to the contrary are a confusion,
there is no sliding scale of currenciness. you can either pay tax in it or you can't.   if you can, it's a currency.  if you can't, it's something else. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:34:29
yeah, it looks like it devastated whatever confidence was left. 
the question now is: will mtgox reopen? they may not be able to. they closed at $120, and would be trying to reopen far lower.
EDIT: i'm not trying to sow panic, i'm just saying -- this is why exchanges try not to close in panics. what's happened now in mtgox is the worst-case scenario; they froze all their accounts only to see them all lose another third in price.  they are going to have to find a way to balance the flood of get-me-out orders in order to reopen, or there is no exchange to open.

but i would add -- evaluating AT&amp;T or Amazon as a lesson of bubble investing misses the greater part of the point.  it's probably more important to look at the Enrons, the Global Crossings, the WorldComs, the Lehman Brothers.  for every survivor of the busts that follow booms, there are a handful of ghosts.

the precise value of the dollar itself is a complex topic, and one that only gets expressed in relative terms (USD:oil, USD:yen) where the other side of the cross has its own valuation issues -- but is essentially result of the production of the country.  the tax man demands his share of the real income, and we all have to convert his share of the goods and services we produce into dollars so he will accept payment and keep ourselves out of prison.  
so that valuation is dependent on many things -- the real output of the country, the rate of tax on that output, the net dollar assets the government has spent into existence, the willingness of the private sector to expand gross dollar liabilities to cancel tax liability, and other things.
does the utility of the dollar as the universal unit of account contribute to its value?  ...  in medieval Europe before the florin, as was customary from the time of the tax reforms of the Emperor Diocletian forward, tax could be paid in goods but the value of the goods were established in law in the old Roman unit of account.  actual Roman coinage had long since ceased to circulate -- the metals themselves were held in churches and royal strongholds -- and coinage of any kind was rare.  the economy functioned on credit, not hard currency, with goods evaluated and exchanged in accordance to their prescribed values in law.
so did the Roman solidus retain a value because it was the standard unit of account in the early Middle Ages -- even though none circulated, virtually no one really ever saw one, taxes weren't collected in the coins themselves but rather in goods lawfully denominated in the unit? 
you can argue that the solidus did have a value, and that value was the product of law -- but perhaps it's easier to conceive of the output itself as having the value, and the unit simply being a system by which we apportion the output.  in those times, the value of the unit in terms of goods was codified; today, it floats at market.

i agree completely on the liquidity -- once the worm turns, there will probably be very few orders that actually can be executed between the high price and $10.  how many people here realize that prices crashes are competitive hunts for willing buyers amid complete disaster? 
in bitcoin's case, it might be worse than that -- are there any designated market makers? liquidity providers? if it really is just p2p, the severity of the crash could be stunning.

i'm not saying abandon bitcoin forever, if bitcoin is your thing.
i'm saying recognize what this is -- a reflexive bubble being driven by hot money speculation in a small market wthe price of bitcoin, and not "adoption" -- and sell some now with the intention of buying back at some point after the crash.
in any case, this kid is clearly far too heavily exposed to bitcoin if he's living and dying with the dollar price of bitcoin. he needs to lighten up so he can sleep and eat.

i think what he actually implies is that, if there is a fundamental value, no one has any quantitative idea of what it might be -- and the possibility of any fundamental value is effectively the same as no fundamental value in any truly analytical framework.  it has no commonly accepted framework of valuation -- a dividend, a profit, a cashflow -- to fall back to.

consider this: there's a chance it may never reopen.
there is no liquidity provision in these little unprofessional markets. no market maker, no central bank, nothing.
what if, when they try to open again, they have nothing but sell orders? and it stays that way?
