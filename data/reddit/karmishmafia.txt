Looks to be their existing online exchange volume instead of the physical store.

Hey guys! So it seems a lot of the trust issues for many new crypto startups and subsequent failures came down to individual personalities, Robocoin, Gox, Moolah, Neo &amp; Bee for example, as an advid HK-based enthusiast, who are you guys? what have you done before, ever been involved with any shady dealings in the past? Got a criminal record somewhere? sorry for this but a business incorporation cert just doesn't really cut it in terms of gaining trust anymore, looking forward to your updated About Us section and Good luck.

Don't bother, the shop isn't even open atm; Grand opening yesterday and shut today? Really?  and looking, quite frankly, unprofessional with just a blank, second-hand office-desk and a bill-counting machine visible from outside, no atms, no staff, obviously no money put into the decor and appearence, it screams 'fly-by-night'. IMO not at all a good image/ambassador for Bitcoin right now.

From the announcement, yes, they'll still be able to move their RMB from their bank accounts to BTC exchanges and back in to their account in RMB, the second question is not so clear to me..

Not true. Li invests in anything and everything that could generate a good return, this play has nothing to do with China's stance on BTC. Horizon is in Tech investments *not* China investments. In fact; Li's been deliberately diversifying out of HK and China in favour of Europe in the last few years. Also this is just one of 14 investments the company has made this year and it's one of the smallest at just 3mil.

Yup. Who is this guy? Not much of anything on the web relating to a Joseph Wang in banking- all i've trawled is an 'associate' of [Bryan Cave LLP](  based in Shanghai. Not sure why this guy is the defacto authority on PBC regulatory edicts.

BTC story is live on CCTV news right now..

Considering they could have outlawed the entire Chinese BTC ecosystem today, I think it's largely positive; they're giving the public the  green light to continue to invest in and speculate on BTC and seem to be legitimizing the exchanges. What worries me though is the detail, especially in the licence requirements for the exchanges at the ministry of telecommunications. There might be some stuff in there that seriously throws a spanner-in-the-works, so again, we'll have to wait and see how the regulations are implemented and enforced.

It would seem so, although they're not allowed to price anything in BTC and only accept BTC whilst 'trading' for a good or service. Again, with every annoucement coming from an official body in China, we'll all have to wait and see how it plays out day to day; is it heavily enforced or will the authorities turn a blind eye to companies buying and selling (and perhaps pricing) in BTC? . ATM, it explicitly prohibits banks/financial service companies from touching BTC. It's the govt trying to limit fraud/scams and getting out in front and essentially saying 'caveat emptor' for the individual Chinese investor.

It was barely on for more than 30 seconds, a really short piece parroting what was said in the PR today.
