FYI, what you are laying out here is not "technical analysis" - it's "fundamental analysis". TA is charts and patterns.

Coinbase via GDAX transactions are free - stop using actual "coinbase.com"!

I enjoyed reading your thoughts on BTC. I agree with all - It's taking its time but I think the trip up to the moon will eventually continue.

because bcash is crap... he mentioned the bcash alt specifically...

Yes, from GDAX &gt; outside world is free but takes hours... right now close to 12 hours... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:42
Most people here are not getting it... insider trading is NOT about Coinbase adding support for bcash. It's that it leaked from within their employees and there for the big crypto drop in the last few days. Coinbase is already putting out tweets to extinguish the fire with the community. Big names posting against what happened today... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:07:47
Totally agree. TA is just another tool. Most times generates more questions than answers.

I believe if you send your BTC to Coinbase's gdax.com, fees are less - not zero but less. GDAX is Coinbase's exchange. Coinbase is not an exchange but a store, very different.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:56
I know, that sucks... but BitPay did too just this week... I'm getting more and more concerned the bigger players are starting to open their arms to bcash...

I'm seeing this: 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:02:16
It did! and on volume! - some big player stepped in while everyone slept :) very bullish now... let's see if the current 1 hour candle consolidates and not just a bull trap...
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:56:43
You are good, man. Hodl it. Might take 3-6 months or whatever to go back up there but it will.

Triangle of Death 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:58:29
This is my chart. Lush Interpolation is the name. But I'm not alone. Lots of great technical analysts dissecting next moves at  under the $BTC.X tag. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:04:57
I'm seeing an ascending triangle (bullish). 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:12:03
I don't see it...
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:11:05
One thing is that these charts and the lines, annotations and patterns I'm seeing are not "mine" - every trader, investor, player is seeing the same things... it's a chicken and egg things, does price drive technical analysis, or because everyone is seeing the same things, we end up with a self-fulfilling prophecy... I for one, am hoping we don't get sucked into the triangle of death but rather begin some nice sideways consolidation in the $15K range... but let's see what happens...

Are you hodling (accumulating) or trading?... if hodling, why not place a Limit order at a specific price so that it triggers while you are have a nice and peaceful night sleep :).
See these 3 buy regions? 
What I like to do is that I set how much I want to invest in total. Say 1 BTC just for the sake of the example. I then buy 0.25 BTC (25% of my total allocation) on the first stop on the way down. Then another 0.25 on the next one... and then the big one of 0.5 BTC at the lowest buy point. It's hard to determine bottoms or what price will do, but this way I "average down" my position. Worst case scenario is Buy 2 and 3 never trigger but 1 did (the top one) and that's ok. Save your other 0.75 for the next down turn...

Per their blog post, they said they would only allow sells, now they changed to full trading... They didn't notify via email. They didn't do it on January 1st.

Look for "Winklevoss Twins" in YouTube. You'd simply need to open an account in Gemini, get your Gemini BTC wallet, and then from Coinbase send you BTC to that address. Transfer only little 0.001 BTC or something like that and make sure it works and you get it there. If all good start moving all or chunks. Also like others have suggested, you can go to  (Coinbase's exchange) and transfer your BTC there from Coinbase, then transfer from GDAX to Gemini. You do not need to create a GDAX account because it's Coinbase so your Coinbase account works the same (same login and password).
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:13
LOL - good analogy.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:07:19
We just had a nice bullish outcome to the triangle of death we've been following for the last few days. We are not yet out of risk for going lower but this is promising for a healthy sideways consolidation (hopefully, above the rising green trend line there...) - let's see if BTC can hold it up there... 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:50:36
oh! - didn't realize. Nothing I should worry about then, I guess :) thx!
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:06:37

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:50
I might be wrong but I think this is the bottom...  
It's the bottom of the mid-year uptrend channel... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:56:17
Sure! These are trend lines from previous price touch points. We want The King to exit this triangle so we aspire to a healthy sideways correction at the $15K level or a bit higher (notice rising purple channel). But if the King fails to breakthrough the top line of the triangle, this will act almost as a funnel down to $8.5K range. For HODLers this doesn't mean a lot, only that we might need to wait until The King is done with this current (tough) battle. For traders this shows entry and exit opportunities.

Investopedia is a great resource: 
Also, look for Technical Analysis (for Beginners) in YouTube. Lots of great content there, like this: 
Finally, I highly recommend watch stock market technical analysis videos. Check  or look for "Live Day Trading Videos". While you might not be doing "day trading" per se, the very same principles of trendlines, overbought/oversold conditions, moving averages, volume analysis works on larger timeframes...

I agree. When it comes to discussions, it's just Bitcoin. Core is a different thing, friendly to Bitcoin but the coin is simply Bitcoin.

I wouldn't call it "hardest"... we've had plenty more of those... this was simply below a key support level in 2018...
