Indeed, their logo is not even fully round, see the top blur.
Their customer support is apparently:
 &gt; Customer support 24/7
Yet their business hours are:










Their newsletter sign up doesn't work either. Tried test
Lastly, and **worst of all**, their 'Get in Touch' header is in some kind of Comic Sans derivative.

Quick question, if €382,117,521.83 can be transferred in less than 1MB, how many blocks do we need for the current market cap; 15?
Better yet, can someone ELI5, what part do blocks play in transactions?
Would more frequent blocks be as possible as increasing the block size?
Does a transaction for e.g. 500,000 BTC in one swing take as much bandwidth as lets say a 1 BTC transaction?

Thanks! That clears it up for me
@_date: 2012-11-27 18:16:57
Just to update this, 18k blocks remaining

Thanks for this; but I really don't know how to even calculate these input figures (EU here). More importantly, I'm not in it to make the big bucks, just doing some curious investigation really. Want to see how easy it is for the average joe to set up and start mining. Kinda difficult really for the less tech savy user.
I found the whole thing very interesting though. Will keep that link for future reference

Aha! I found it thanks to you! I am mining with bitcoinpool.com and didn't see the stats &gt; user profile. Thanks for that.
This is pretty cool :)
@_date: 2012-11-27 16:02:18
Also, how could one optimise to increase the Mhash/s figure (provided that is the important one), if that is in fact possible.

I'm only new to this, but all I see is MtGox complaints, like all the time.

Took me a long time to figure out the exact model, but judging from GPU-Z and wikipedia, I've got the Radeon HD 5870. Not sure what significance that has and it is quite old actually.
Is it worth an upgrade? Not just for bitcoin terms, just in general? I'm not quite with the recent tech because this rig has been doing so well for me.

It says that -k doesn't exist, even when I'm in the correct directory. Below is the code for my config
~~ ~~
    [general]
    autodetect = +cl -cpu  autodetect for all OpenCL devices, except those which are CPUs.
    verbose = False  verbose logging?
    backend =   primary backend.
     =    space seperated list of backup servers.
    failback = 120  between attempts to reconnect to primary backend when using backups. (0 to disable)
    queuesize = 1  size of the queue
    queuedelay = 5  before work expires to request more work (WARNING: don't change this unless you know what you are doing!)
    statusinterval = 1  between statusbar updates
    ratesamples = 10  of samples to average for hashrate reporting
    logfile = False  this option to log to a file.
    [web]
    disabled = False  the RPC server?
    bind = 192.168.1.2  to bind the RPC server to
    port = 7780  port
    password = phoenix  password
    root = C:\phoenix2\phoenix2\www  directory for the web server
    logbuffer = 1000  many logs to remember in the getlogs() RPC call
    [cl:0:0]
    autoconfigure = False  configure this device?
    kernel = opencl  kernel to use for the device
    name = GPU 0  name to display the device as (default is device ID if not specified)
    start_undetected = False  not start the kernel if the device is not present
    disabled = False  this device?
    worksize = 256  group size, tweaking this option may improve performance
    vectors = True  unit2 vectors? (enable this or vectors4, not both)
    vectors4 = False  uint4 vectors? (enable this or vectors, not both)
    bfi_int = True  BFI_INT instruction on ATI VLIW GPUs?
    goffset = True  OpenCL 1.1 global offset?
    fastloop = True  fast internal loop? (ideal for low aggression)
    aggression = 3  of nonces to test per kernel execution (lower value = less desktop lag, higher value = higher hashrate)
    [cl:0:1]
    autoconfigure = False
    kernel = phatk2
    name = GPU 1
    start_undetected = False
    disabled = False

I just changed the aggression from 3 to 7 and am getting 330 when idle. Do the web portals take an average value? Because it's never what it says on my cmd prompt.
No overclocking or anything, don't know what I'm doing in that dept.
@_date: 2012-11-27 16:12:01
Hmm I installed wallet today maybe an hour ago. I only have 34k blocks remaining before sync but I read that you can mine even before syncing, this is on bitcoinpool.com by the way
@_date: 2012-11-27 17:45:21
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's only worth running one miner per machine correct?
So should I have this BTCOxygen over bitcoinpool.com? And have bitcoinpool.com as a backup?
Thanks in advance by the way, and for your previous comment

You do realise there is 21,000,000 full BTC. But it can be divisible down to 8 decimal places. Fiat is only divisible to 2 decimal places but has infinite places on the left hand of the decimal place.
If the total number of bitcoins is: 21,000,000.00000000
And hypothetically of course, if 0.00000001 BTC = $1
Then Bitcoin could cater for $2,100,000,000,000,000 (2.1 quadrillion)
This would mean that nothing can cost &lt; $1 though. So to keep the cents, we need two decimal places (not official)
So if 0.000001xx BTC = $1 (xx = cents)
Bitcoin can only cater for $21,000,000,000,000 (21 Trillion). Huh, not that impressive actually
