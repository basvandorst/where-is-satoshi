Looks like the market is moving sideways for the moment fortunately.

Stoll, is actually an interesting cat completely Manic creative astronomer by trade who was responsible for uncovering a german hacker recruited by the Soviet Unions KGB back in the 80 when people would dial in to university and military networks to hack. The book the Cuckoos Egg chronicles the story and is a interesting and entertaining read.

I would say that good news may not have moved the price to new highs but recent good news and the strength of the btc ecosystem has kept it from collapsing. People can see how far BTC has come in a year and how many problems it has weathered and what its price was last year before it started its astronomic climb to 1000+ and see that its intrinsically more valuable this year than it was last year.

I think that a lot of people that are burned on Bitcoin are people that are trying to trade it and especially when jumping in to the market indiscriminately or trading with high frequency and not knowing trading scene you are more likely to get burned than bank unless you get lucky. But there is the trading value and the value it has to have to cover its use as a means of moving value around and the two kind of have a which came first the chicken or the egg relationship.

It picked a hell of a time to go down. It looks like the api is down also.

I think millibits a thousandth of a BTC work just fine. Maybe a symbol for millibits would be an improvement.

Or let you deduct losses due to devaluation the way losses on loans to foreign companies denominated in foreign currencies can be deducted if  money is lost due to currency valuation.

Losses on loans to foreign companies due to changes in currency prices can be deducted it would be nice if they could give us the same deductions that banks and corporations get.

I am really curious to find out what happened. I am not so sure that it was a bot, if it was it was a bot with out any limits on it and a lot of euros on tap. If I were to venture a guess some one took a 7 figure loss.

So much for the sideways movement.

I have seen them on btc-e a few times in the past.

The pump yesterday was across all exchanges so far as I could tell.

Actually I think the order was Coke, Dollars and then Arms.

You are getting downvoted for saying that bitcoin isn't a currency and I get what you are saying. There isn't a bitcoin supply chain, it would be difficult to sell something and then restock and pay workers in bitcoin at the moment. Getting suppliers and wholesalers to accept bitcoin is the one of the next major hurdles.

Thanks but I think that BTC $120 less than current market sounds too  good to be true

You don't pay a tax for changes in the valuation of the currency you use to pay your taxes. Well you do because the value of the currency has changed and if a currency has experienced extreme inflation taxes might rise in an attempt to compensate for the decreased spending power of the currency. But  the change in valuation is is not seen as a capital gain.
What would be really progressive is if a country allowed tax payments in bitcoin. This actually wouldn't seem like a bad idea for a country that had a cratered currency anyway.

All of this makes me wonder what the repercussions would be for a small country that switched over to bitcoin as its native denomination.

What is hard to believe is that crypto export laws  on a ip technology as well documented as SSL had any effect at all except to lock out U.S. companies.

Thailand and Argentina should give up the fight trying to prop up their currencies with regulation and switch over to bitcoin or maybe launch a cryptocurrency of their own. I am sure rich foreigners love the exchange rate though.

Here is the section of the current US tax law regarding currency trading  
Its a dense read of particular interest are the provisions regarding loans to &gt;10% foriegn corporations.
It would be pretty sweet/fair if losses on dollar denominated loans of bitcoins could be treated as losses for tax purposes
Maybe some one skilled at Magic the Gathering can make better sense of the tax law.
