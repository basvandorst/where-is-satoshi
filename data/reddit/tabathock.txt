What's your point? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:53:57
Because - a) there isn't enough liquidity in the market, b) the kind of code would take a team of people to write - it would be expensive and the trading volumes are too small, there isn't enough liquidity in the market to justify it. c) It is too volatile because there isn't enough faith in the currency or liquidity in the market.

Good God, if this was a real currency I'd love to write some code to steal money from the day traders.

That's really good logic, congratulations.

Or look at the charts from previous bubbles.

Hahah. So the only thing that was anchoring the price is removed?

You have absolutely no idea what you are doing do you.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:56:18
Why would anyone want to do that?

You can't be, Bitcoin isn't large enough. Which is why I said - "if it were a proper currency".

It's terrifying and a rather nasty aspect of reddit that people have been able to hype up an online currency by playing on political prejudice. If I had bitcoins I would have been hyping them up to the max. People haven't had the gambling aspect properly explain to them.

Only on the internet could someone be delighted that 50% or around $500m has been wiped off the market. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:57:41
That's the same with everything though. You're house isn't worth $500,000 because of the bricks and mortar. If the property prices plunged by 20%, $100,000 would have been wiped off the value.
