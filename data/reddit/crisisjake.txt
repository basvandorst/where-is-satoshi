There will never be a shortage of idiots, haha.
As long as you're not the lowest hanging fruit, it's pretty unlikely you'll get any attention.

I know you probably don't know better because the media almost unanimously gives the FBI credit for it, but the operation was an HSI/FBI joint operation, and Homeland Security Investigations did most of the heavy lifting; HSI Agents were the ones that arrested him, not the FBI.
I know, I know, who cares? They're all federal agents.
But... It matters to those HSI Agents who worked incredibly hard to bring him down, yet in media everywhere, "Another huge bust by the FBI" with minimal or no mention of HSI at all. This is literally the worst part of working for HSI.

A good practice, indeed.
I remember reading that Ulbricht's laptop had less than a 10 second idle/lock enabled. The *feds* needed use of a mouse jiggler (literally plugs in via USB and constantly moves the mouse a couple of pixels) to prevent the computer from locking.
Edit: clarification.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:18:10
Although they're pretty much the same thing, HSI is the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, and because of that, they have different (and arguably greater) authority than the FBI does.

It was actually more exciting than what I described; those are just the details that I remember to be most accurate.
It was definitely an elaborate and well executed takedown.
One of the HSI Agents, who took over one of the moderator accounts for the silk road, messaged Ulbricht through the account regarding an administrative issue, which resulted in him having to log into the administrative panel of the site immediately before they took the laptop and arrested him.
The feds had the laptop with his account logged in and everything; it couldn't of been a better takedown.

If I recall correctly, they waited for him to log into his laptop at the public library where he did most of his communications. Multiple federal agents approached him, immediately took his laptop and restrained him; because the laptop was on, the hard drive encryption he used was useless. 
At that point, it's relatively trivial to acquire everything on the computer, including passwords and private keys.
Had he had enough time to close his laptop or if an agent mishandled it/accidentally turned it off before a Computer Forensics Analyst could do a RAM capture on it, it would be virtually impossible to get anything off the laptop.
Pretty crazy how close of a call it was.

Yeah, it would be incredibly hard for us to do something like this again.
It's becoming more commonplace where criminals take the battery out of their laptop so it only works when it's directly plugged in; the slightest nudge and the laptop immediately turns off, enabling encryption once again.

The price locks in when you buy. You won't receive any BTC until the money clears, though.

Didn't see the show, but... that actually sounds hilarious. 
I stopped watching the show a long time ago; I might try to see this one.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:05:10
Just finished it. It was alright; like you said, watchable.
Not really sure if this helped or hurt Bitcoin, honestly.

Think of buying 1 coin as buying a bag with a million marbles in it, then you buy another coin and add another million marbles to your bag. When you sell one of the coins, you'll pull out a million marbles that belong partially to both coins. Make sense?

I use the app "Blockfolio"
You add the exact amount of BTC you own, what currency you want the conversion to be in (USD), and what exchange you want the minute by minute price to pull from (GDAX).
It's pretty great.

I think he means from one of those Reddit tip bots?

Nobody can predict the future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:17
Yeah, and Coinbase is clearly in collusion right now. Bcash is at a price freeze on GDAX that is more than double all the other markets right now.
This can't be legal. Blatant market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:30
2 days from now, it will be like the dip never happened.
Don't worry too much about it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:52:19
You held BTC before the fork, that's why you now have BCH, too.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:01:07
It's still trending downward, with minor fluctuations. I would not be surprised if it goes down a few hundred more within the day. That is usually the trend after major spikes occur like the last 24 hours. (Obviously speculation)
The dip is relative to when OP bought, not what it was a day ago.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:45:19
What app is that?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:07:57
10% growth in a single day is unsustainable. This dip was inevitable.
Hold and believe. It'll climb back again.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:36:15
Yes, absolutely.
You both will get through this. I would rather have an honest spouse and lose a $25k investment than a dishonest spouse.
Your marriage is not built on Bitcoin. Things will be alright.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:58:45
This growth is nuts.

If you don't have access to your private key, your BTC isn't your's.
A coinbase "wallet" belongs to coinbase. It's best to not keep your coins there.

It was $9,197 shortly before and trending downward.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:34:24
I hope not. It's at $10,833 right now ALREADY. O_O
