DPR was the FBI the whole time!
But actually though, it's possible that he had a backup of the wallet in an unencrypted, poorly encrypted or a 3rd party reversibly encrypted location.

Electric bills are monthly tho, and don't necessarily arrive at the beginning or end of the month.

Because, as we all know, an article in the opinions section of the telegraph about the US dollar has anything whatsoever to do with bitcoin.

Many governments are hesitant to make a stance one way or the other because they cannot do much regulation on it today without it being a huge failure, but at the same time they don't want to confirm people's confidence in the currency over their own due to the always present lingering fear that they COULD. Ambiguous answers seem to be the preferred tactic.

Multibit and the others that have been mentioned don't require any chain synchronization (which is space-consuming and time-consuming) since they handle all the blockchain information on their servers rather than requiring it on your computer.
I personally use Multibit since it's tiny and has cross-platform support, fast and easy to use, and has yet to give me troubles.

HallucinatingHorse AKA DoD AKA MDMAThrowAway1 is at it again with the conspiracy theories it seems. 
Always remember this when dealing with conspiracy theories:
When there is limited information, it is extremely easy to make an argument that "makes sense" since there are an extremely wide variety of explanations that can fill the void. In these situations, however, "Making sense" does NOT make a theory valid just like "not making sense" does NOT make a theory invalid. Back in the day, the earth being flat made a whole lot more sense than it being round since we simply didn't have the science.
So take everything he said with a grain of salt. I know for a fact some of the stuff he said is invalid, though it'd be pointless to give a testimonial as you should not hold my word to be fact either.

You can also just set up security cameras and if anyone double spends, post up their pictures and maybe file a police report. The matching timestamp makes it way easier to identify than counterfeit cash.

It kind of did. BTC dropped by about 10% the week of the shut down, which is pretty consistent with about 80% of transaction stopping and 20% shifting to other markets. At the same time, the popularity of bitcoin spiked with all the coverage, along with people now knowing that bitcoin can survive without SR, which effectively raised it back up.

My theory is that the site showing that image was a failsafe put in place by the SR staff in case they were ever compromised so that the feds couldn't take over the site silently and run it as a honeypot. Now, any sensible failsafe would also delete all the sensitive data from the servers, which still could be true considering the FBI wouldn't need the originals: they have an image of the server. Anyone know if the timing of the site being shut down matches up with Ulbricht being arrested in that library? I envision him initiating the failsafe when the FBI confronted him on his laptop

That is just pathetic. The whole point of the rewards is to show that you earned something. You won't fool anyone with a plat border and victorious skin playing like the Silver you are. All people doing this shit accomplishes is making their team lose whenever they try to play until they drop down to their true MMR. Quite a scumbag act if you ask me.

It's also self-enforcing. Seeing that bitcoins don't go haywire the moment SR gets shut down increases consumer confidence quite a bit, which keeps up the value, which then further increases confidence. We have seen it survive the extremely poorly labeled "crash" earlier this year, and now we've seen it survive the SR shutdown without even hitting a major dip. My confidence in its longevity is at an all-time high. At this point if something caused it to crash down to $80 again, investors would not hesitate to buy them.

Also, use has gone up quite a bit, while the market value has skyrocketed by upwards of 20000%. When they finally legalize it, supporters will accept basically ANY ludicrous tax rate, comparable to cigarettes in New York, and the profits will be absurd compared to the standard sales tax on the $20 an ounce it'd be worth had it stayed legal.
It's a conspiracy, mannnnnnnnn! (sarcasm)

This is a good technique. For a more traditional approach, you can also keep your private key backed up in a safety deposit box. Something like a flash drive for digital storage, and a paper backup just in case. It's also worth also having passwords linked to accounts with monetary value, as well as things like safe combinations.

The 2FA is for the inputs.io account, but if the private key behind that account is compromised, the contents of the wallet can be taken by pushing a transaction using the private key. No matter how many security illusions they show you, having your private key held by a 3rd party is risky business.
Not accusing them of this, but what's to stop a company from faking an attack and running off with the bitcoins?

Considering the FBI gave up on cracking the wallet since they couldn't technically prove his ownership, I don't think that'd have any legal standing in a court of law. Reasonable doubt will have an interesting role in the trial. Anyone can pretend to be you online if they have the right information, so a link between an anonymous identity, even a picture of your face, is not poof beyond reasonable doubt when things like framing and scapegoats come into play. Imagine, as a demonstration, someone ordered a box of ID's to every juror with their face on it. The same could be said for the cocaine and the attempted murders. Be sure to melt some butter for your popcorn.

It's the principle of the matter. I have no interest in using any of this stuff myself, but seeing the hydra effect where 3 pop up every time one gets shut down paints a much clearer picture of the failure of the war on drugs. With these websites, the more they crack down on the ones with faults, the more the public knows about them, which raises the monetary incentive to create more sites that are even more secure. Short of blocking the tor network or breaking RSA encryption, all they can do is throw gasoline, and of course taxpayer money, on the fire. Considering a "shut down" only took them down for a month the first time it happened, there could be a new DPR in a week or less the next time they catch one, which will only become harder and harder (as tricking them into conspiracy to murder won't fly). Or, of course, they could just legalize it, tax it, and be done with it.

Don't concern yourself with that. In fact, recycling wallets is a good way to preserve your anonymity.
