Well, A. They don't have the hashpower.  B, bcash has a rolling 10 block checkpoint, C, other coins have been 51% attacked and still exist. D, where's all this shitcoin profit coming from?  Why do they even have shitcoins in the first place? E, what is the measurable cost vs. Benefit here?  All that risk for questionable gain and optics.
As I said, nice little dreamworld ya got there.

We aren't talking about a nation state.  We are talking about Blockstream.  And if we were talking about a nation state I dont think spending 1 trillion dollars 51% attacking a chain is how I'd go about it.   One software update and POOF, your trillion dollar investment ain't worth shit.

Schroedingers blocks.  They're both 1MB and greater than 1MB at the same time.
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:35:14
And the odd 4MB spam block.  Every time I think about the reason for 1MB blocks and then the "SW is a block increase!" I laugh my ass off.

To be fair, your name is pretty lame.  Have to say, I'm with Mr. Hill here - sorry.

They have absolutely no obligation to use SW.  One of its selling points was that using it was optional.  Let them do what they want.  You have no obligation to use their service.  No one using their service? Then their lack of SW doesn't matter.  Pretty simple.

Hmm.  Seems your argument doesn't really translate as well as you hope.
Your 5mbtc has a fee on top.  Which is on top of the fees you likely paid to get it in the first place.  Then, a functioning adult in the 1st world is already going to have a credit card.  Plus you can use the CC to delay payment giving you a time value benefit. Not to mention any CC rewards.
Anyways, pros and cons to both.  Even the local idols here recognize that.

What are you trying to say?  The CEO of the company I work for has no idea what I do, what decisions I make, or how I go about getting my tasks done.  My managers may, but my managers aren't the CEO and I would not be surprised if the CEO had very little idea of what my Managers do and the calls they make.

Hi propaganda.  Nice to see you again.

Do you have proof Jihan personally created or personally directed the creation of Antbleed? This assuming it was intended for nefarious purposes which has never actually been proven.
Do you have proof that Jihan mined with ASICBoost, or that Bitmain did at his direct instruction?
Do you have proof that Jihan personally made BCH and that he used it to usurp power on a network that doesn't have a single entity to usurp power from and is not owned by anyone?
Please think critically.  Trust but verify used to be a thing here, what happened to that?
I don't take conjecture and rumour as fact and I suggest others do the same.

Yeah, "bank run day" is brilliant.  Don't know why no one has thought of doing that before.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:25:15
I'm sure it also had nothing with them being a large miner fighting against moving transactions off chain where they won't benefit from tx fees, which is how miners are supposedly to be paid, in entirety, in the future. Or moving to SW over larger blocks which gives them less fees overall per tx sent.  Nahz couldn't becsny of that.  Or fighting the change in narrative which is that the miners were the consensus mechanism, except for when that didnt suit some and now it is nodes that didnt matter.
Or you know, any of the other variables that have been in play for the last 5+ years.

Well, seems like you don't understand how banks work and why a run on one is entirely possible without them being unethical in the slightest.
Ultimately we're talking about public perception.  A bank run causes havoc and is not something we should be encouraging.

This sub routinely advocates not keeping your coins on an exchange.


So encouraging everyone to do all of this, for the first time, without providing adequate information on how to do it safely and properly, during a proposed run on the exchanges, where the chain will backlog, hot wallets will go dry, etc, is a good plan?
Give your head a shake, mate.

Friendly reminder, running 25 nodes isn't any better than running 1 node.  In fact, it's arguable  that it makes propagation worse.  Also, running a node is only really valuable if you're using it to validate your own transactions.
This is friendly PSA.
