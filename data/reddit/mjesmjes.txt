It has been a long time since I first heard about the "blocks are full" BS. My theory is that it is the only practical way of disrupting bitcoin ATM, since it became obvious that XT and that other crap was going nowhere. 
I have used bitcoin since 2012, I have never had any problem sending bitcoin to anyone. One time, when I on purpose tried to send bitcoin with practically zero fee it got stuck for a day. 
There is no problem with full blocks when half of it is garbage. Sending a transaction with normal fee will put you in the first block most of the time.
This post has only one effect, spreading disharmony in the bitcoin sphere, shame on you. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:43:40


Yes, why would you try to get free money.... 
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:22:24
Shorting is the practice of borrowing bitcoin, selling them and hoping for the price to go down so you can repay the loan(btc) and pocket the difference. If the price does not go down but up the person who borrowed must use some of his own money to balance the difference, because the bitcoins is now more expensive to pay back. When a short is liquidated the person or business that gave you the loan wants their bitcoin back, this is also called a margin call.

Shorting bitcoin is a practice where you loan bitcoins and sell them, the point is that you want the price to go down so you can repay the loan and pocket the difference. If the price does not sink then you will eventualy get something called a margin call, it means that you have to repay the amount of  bitcoin you loaned at the current price. someone got margin called and lost aprox 2 million dollars.

The thing you want to watch, if you want to learn about these people, is The house of Rothschild:
A rather boring movie, but it must be looked at like a history lesson.
The movie pretty much just brags about how rich they have become by  usury. The movie starts with Mayer Amschel Rothschild hiding money away from the tax collector, and acting like he and his family is so poor they can't possibly pay the tax they are asked for.
It seems like It was made before they understood the importance of hiding their wealth and low ethical standards from the public.

This is reddit, of course we are simplifying.
My idea is that there is always a person or group behind every action, nothing unnatural happens by itself, war dont just spontaneously happen. Think about it, no one wants war, no one wants to kill other people(excluding mentally ill people and people in moments of passion), so to make a war someone or something must apply a tremendous amount of force in that specific direction, someone must have war as their most wanting need. 
Who wants war? people who can benefit from it obviously.
Who can benefit from war? Obviously not the people fighting it.
Just follow this logic and it becomes obvious for anyone who makes wars.
I am not saying the Rothschild family is 'The creator of all wars', I am saying they are today in a perfect position to benefit from wars, and they have the means of creating and facilitating them. When I say 'they' are the reason we have wars I simplify it, I mean everyone like them or any people or group in the same position as them.
If anyone is interested in this, do some research on wars through history, and try to compare wars today with what wars was before the Rothschild came on the scene. When you can print money out of thin air and in theory never run out of it, you can keep wars going for a very long time.

Surely, one must not underestimate such low tier character traits like ignorance, nationalism and such, war can probably not happen without people like that, but by themselves I am sure they are harmless.
Like I said in my previous post, people just don't spontaneously gather and form an army with a strict hierarchy. Obviously a lot of investment must take place, both in time and resources. The logical conclusion is that anything that has been created, a wooden chair, a car, a house, city infrastructure, wars, everything started with an idea manifested in the head of a singel person. The responsibility and eventually the blame must lie at this person.
When someone creates something good he stands forth, proud of his creation, wanting everyone to know he is the sole creator of this thing. even tho it took maybe 100s of workers to create that thing, he knows he is the master of the idea, the god if this creation.
When someone creates something evil he tries to hide, ashamed of his creation, he wants no one to know he created it, and he tries to shift the blame to the 100s of people working on his evil creation, but he is still the god of this evil abomination, because the idea manifested in his head, and he acted on this idea.
Don't hate the player, hate the creator of the game. Ignorant people can be players, but they are never creators.
It may be that I am insanely wrong, it may be that war is totally natural, and it is inevitable that it will happen. I think Plato wrote something like that basically war is inevitable because people always want more stuff, and eventually there is nothing more to take without stealing, and that's when wars happen. 
Probably I am both wrong and right, and I just can't see the true picture because of the complexity.

Right! I have not done any math on it, but in theory they could just slowly exchange new printed fiat for bitcoin until the fiat system collapses, probably already doing that. I wonder how many % of the total bitcoin supply they could suck up before the collapse....

True, but you get in return full anonymity and instant exchange.
