Mine's all still there?

I totally agree. I'm just waiting to access the site and then I'll moving my BTC to TradeHill, where I've been trading the last week. Also, BTC trading has flatlined on TradeHill. I think that everyone is literally waiting to see whats going to happen on MtGox.

Its back! Very slow though.

I'm sorry but what does mtgox being down have to do with market price of BTC? Why would their site being down (for whatever reason) suddenly kick off a selling spree?

Somebody else might have tried to reset your email? Or accidently typed your username or email address?

Same here, still redirecting. Stupid question here, on what IRC channel/server is MagicalTux?
@_date: 2011-06-25 16:18:53
Thank you.

I'm holding as well. Everyone selling is just making it worse.

I can't help but have a sneaky laugh at that other MtGox user that is so patriotic towards them. I mean, what type of a site doesn't even have load balancers in place for exactly these types of events? Just because everyone is logging in now and putting the site under stress doesn't mean that the problem will go away. What happens in the future? I'm sorry but it just doesn't cut it. I can't see how everyone is not getting this? How can you trust a site like that?

I couldn't have said it any better myself!

Somebody is really sure of themselves?! I on the other hand think that BTC/USD might sit around the $20 for some time. Its constantly testing the $20 resistance line but it can't seem to break it. Also, volume is down the past 2-3 days and the rally that everyone predicted on Monday never materialized. Its like everyone is just waiting to see what is going to happen.
Of course I would LOVE for it to go back up to the high 20s as I've got a few trades waiting to be filled but only time will tell.
PS. What are the sources of your rumours?
@_date: 2011-06-25 16:18:31
Your reasoning is very backwards. What you are saying is that because MtGox failed us and the BitCoin community we should now reason to stay with them because TrendHill WILL do the same? What? How illogical is that? I'm moving to TradeHill.

I finally managed to get a message from the support at Mtgox:
@_date: 2011-06-27 07:13:52
SOMEBODY understands what Im also trying to say here! Thank you!
@_date: 2011-06-13 16:46:58
I've been using Britcoin as well. Super fast and reliable and the admin's got good communication!
@_date: 2011-06-25 15:45:01
Good plan.
@_date: 2011-06-15 09:11:45
About 24, using them to trade all the time :)
@_date: 2011-06-25 15:44:13
It took a while to log in (to be expected), busy withdrawing my BTC and moving it to TradeHill.
