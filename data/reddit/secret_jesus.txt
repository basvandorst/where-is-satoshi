Regardless of your opinion of him or his industry he knows more about markets and the economics that drive them than everyone here combined. You don't have to take his opinions for gold but it would be dumb to ignore them completely.

Turning ourselves into a victim anytime someone doesn't agree with our every opinion is weak and doesn't help our cause.

If there is money to be made JPM and others will find a role to play even if they may not be in total control. Cryptocurrencies, although revolutionary, have a lot of faults (being naturally deflationary is one of the most glaring) and you're going to need mass adoption. JPM is a market maker and you'll need companies like that to get as many people involved as possible.
If you trust the technology you shouldn't be worrying about big banks destroying it. You should be leveraging them instead.

This is the most retarded financial analysis I've ever seen

Using technical analysis to predict price changes has about the same success rate as asking your Magic 8 ball

This isn't how GS chooses its positions. This is how it generates market activity which generates revenue for them.
