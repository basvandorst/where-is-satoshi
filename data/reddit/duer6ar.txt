Seriously, who cares?  
He said something pretty ignorant, and you think his credentials are meaningful?  If you're that easily bamboozled by names and credentials you must have a hard time watching the news and not believing all of it.

It's a nazi twitter.  Can't believe people are promoting that garbage here.

By they you mean twitter?  Twitter isn't a state so its censorship is the same as me not wanting to hang around with racists right?  So nazis can go hang out on gab, no one is stopping them, the issue I have is people are promoting it here.
And as a point of note, there's never two sides, there's an infinitude of bs, one needn't know every bs position, not only is it impossible given the finite amount of time that we live but it's also a waste of time to try to fully understand nonsense.

Who's arguing against free speech?  Is it anti-free speech to not want people to promote racism here?  No.  Literally no one is saying gab should be shut down by the state.  Why is it "free speech" has come to mean, "you have to listen to and like my racist rants"?
