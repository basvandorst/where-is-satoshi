Tbh I don't see why big companies shouldn't use it - getting them into blockchains would go a long way to getting everyone else into blockchains, too! But yeah - this wasn't built for them.

Check out the repo, build the client and see for yourself! It's up and running - the only question now is what functionality gets built in next.

I wasn't spamming you or this subreddit. I was expressing agreement and clearing up ambiguity for anyone who might not have got the reference.

"Do not give up and try to sell the idea to big companies" - we have no intention of doing so. In fact, towards the end of Part 1 you'll have noticed we've disclaimed our copyright in the platform. It's our hope and expectation the community takes charge of the project and builds whatever they want with it - we just put in the groundwork, and we're happy to turn this over to the world to do with as it sees fit. I think the explanation on the repo will be more straightforward:

Except they won't. After Year 1 Bitcoin is more inflationary than Doge until the year 2147. See:  
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:16:43
Dogecoin's linear inflation rate means Bitcoin won't have a lower one until 2147. Think about that for a second - none of us will be alive when DOGE becomes "inflationary" (I prefer saying expansionary as it is the money supply which is expanding - "inflation" refers to price) vis a vis Bitcoin. Until that time, Dogecoin is LESS expansionary.

I'm also a middle aged lawyer. And I agree.

Dogecoin of course.

Only if you consider a symmetrical triangle continuation pattern "tanking."

We're profile-agnostic. If Bitcoin forks to allow smart contracts on it there's no reason why Eris couldn't be built on it.
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:10:34
Not only a demo or screen, there is actually software and furthermore it works exactly as described in the white paper. You have to build it in conjunction with the Ethereum C++ client but it does exist

Quantum marmot of chaos?
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:29:55
The whole thing. There are no servers at all, even in v 0.1. It relies entirely on BitTorrent and the Ethereum blockchain (currently testnet) as its public network.

Wow such. +20 doge

Much obliged! +200 doge verify

I donated money to Doge4Nascar - I wasn't really thinking about the demographic, I was more thinking about "it would be hilarious to put Doge on a car." 
Plus. If crypto is going to take off, we need to target *everyone*. Southerners who like NASCAR are just as good as silicon valley bods - and considering they're an untapped market where there's no competition, they may be even better.

It's likely by year-end Dogecoin will have picked up more users than Bitcoin did in its year 1. I don't follow.

Go nuts.

I'm reading the thread as we speak. So many engineers disagreeing. 
Here Jackson would just go "we're calling it a 'pup'" and everyone would go WOW SUCH AWESOME and leave it at that.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:23:18
Such wrong.
Network effects brah - which for Crypto is everything. Just because a bajillion currencies exist doesn't mean the big players stop being relevant.

Hardly vaporware. Version 0.1 is more like a decentralised Reddit - we'll get to Facebook and Kickstarter in due course, but we only had three weeks to design, build, and implement the thing so appreciate being cut a bit of slack!
