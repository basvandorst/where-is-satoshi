None that I know of, but it is used in place of USD and is treated as such in places. The main distinction of a fiat currency (other than being recognized as legal tender) is that it is not backed by a physical commodity and takes no value from what it is made of (in this case electrons). A currency by definition is a system of money that is in general use in a country, usually a type of legal tender. Bitcoin bills itself as a currency and isn't that far from being considered legal tender.

I mean literally. If they went and took money off the conveyor belts they would be thrown in jail (hopefully). But with bitcoin everyone is just trying to own their own conveyor belts, but only the rich can really afford them.

What is a dishonest miner? If I mined for profit is that dishonest?

Thats how I feel. Bitcoin is like a stock with the highest shareholders (the early adopters) benefiting the most from increased usage and mining.

It feels like the middle

Security is a huge con if you ask me, you disguised knowledge of security as the pro..
I can see the instant transfers as pros but that is the same as online bank transfers, paypal or square isn't it? 
What do you mean it is low level and can be built upon?

Right but bitcoin is billed as a currency not a startup company

Couldn't bitcoin be controlled in the same way?

I guess i don't look at the miners as protecting anything rather than just being competition for everyone else, also they are the ones devaluing the currency. But good point about the banks.

Bitcoin is a fiat currency:
"DEFINITION of 'Fiat Money' Currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of." 
Bitcoin is made of no material and has no use. Gold is used in electronics and computers as is silver. (Stuff that makes bitcoin possible)
I will agree that the early gold miners benefited but gold has been discovered in many places and many different times in history. Bitcoin can never be "re-discovered" and a new supply "unearthed"

How is bitcoin owned by anyone if there are rules you must follow? Who enforces the rules if no one is in charge?

Interesting point about the miners, they seem to be my biggest question in all this. 
One thing silver is used for is my silver solder i use for soldering wires :p
And gold is also used to coat the connectors of the wires.

There are "rewards" for solving a "puzzle"? What does that mean? what kind of currency has rewards and puzzles? Sounds more like a video game..

So if a government were to declare bitcoin a legal tender would it then not be considered a fiat currency?
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:39:42
Only the rich can afford the expensive servers needed for the mining (now that so many have already been mined). Its not like you can just discover bitcoin somewhere and mine a whole bunch for cheap.

I have researched bitcoin, I still had lots of questions. I thought I would ask these questions here because I felt I could get some good answers. I am taking your info seriously and have even upvoted a couple of your comments. Kind of rude to insinuate that I am trolling. Bitcoin is very confusing man, I spent a lot of time trying trying to learn about it and try to mine but couldn't get it, I could have spent more time but I got frustrated. Here I am 3 years later and I have been hearing a lot about how bitcoin could have been the solution to the Greek's problems and these questions all came at once.

Please do, this is not an attack against bitcoin I am seriously trying to figure it out. How does it appeal to me or the masses? How is bitcoin not a fiat currency as well? It is just mined from nothing, a bunch of random numbers, there are no tangible uses (unlike gold or silver). I can't make a dollar but I can exchange it for a good or service, and even the guys in charge of the fed can't just dip their hand into the printing press.
