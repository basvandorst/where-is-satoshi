We don't need any more shitty stupid altcoins. Bitcoin was all the innovation we needed and anything more is fucking cancer. Fuck concensus, and fuck scams.

Honestly. These fucking morons don't understand that none of this matters. All that matters is bitcoin adoption and right now memes help that

Why does he? Because he brings up ceddit, a tool used to see banned discussion?
If you're afraid of a tool like that, it makes me wonder what it is you're hiding...

Bitcraft.io runs the Blockexplorer.com website, I've hired them for a project - they're good and all in the US.

Have tried it. It's pretty nice, the entire flow tries to work "in the moment" on mobile vs others where the mobile experience sucks.

Alright cowboy, lots of things to look at there.


That's awesome! I think this solution is for those situations where you can't (like Target) 


Who's trying to fool you? Are there even discounts in this? And if there are, why are discounts a bad thing? Are you not in control of your money with this method?


I'm sorry, did you except every company to have a personal interest on what you do? Yea, I guess for these guys it's still a sale when you buy that card - but try it out. They actually try to make the process easy for you when you want to buy stuff in store. Arguably if they didn't make the process as easy as possible people like myself wouldn't use them because it'd be a hassle. If you're looking for a value proposition that's it.


Okay, I see what you're getting about. But what if I'm in line at Target and I know my bill is going to be roughly 100 dollars - I buy a 100 dollar Target gift card (I haven't used fold for gift cards yet but I assume this will be how it works) and then pay the cashier with the barcode. In that case I'm not prepaying, I'm buying in the moment. Don't understand what you mean by who's the product in this case.


Alright detective, it's literally posted by and links to their medium article lmao. 
I think you mean well but you've got a tin foil hat on
