I feel like you must be relatively new to crypto. 
Back in 2013 and before, almost nobody was into crypto for the riches. It was almost exclusively people who distrusted centralized banks and who were interested in technology. 
It’s hard to imagine now, but in those days the big trend was to spend crypto wherever possible, and to give it away to your friends to encourage them to use it. 
Back then there was no talk of Lambos. I don’t remember anyone speaking about crypto as a way to get rich. Talk primarily centered around making crypto (BTC) a viable alternative to fiat currency. One that was free of political manipulation and fear of inflation. 
To be clear, I wasn’t one of those people. I’m not here to get rich, either.  (I don’t hold any crypto and never have.) I’m just pointing out that the get-rich-quick aspect of crypto is a relatively new phenomenon, and the tech/politically-minded enthusiasts were, up until about 18 months ago, the rule rather than the exception.

He just means that if you are attending as part of your job, you are receiving your salary.

You say Turkish Lira is “crashing,” but all I see is Turkish Lira “on sale.”
Just another opportunity to buy more Lira while the weak hands are flushed out.  
Hodl your Lira!

 It’s just the semantics around the discussion. 
People have to frame the discussion around “BTC vs fiat” because that’s bitcoin’s way forward: as a replacement for fiat. 
But as an investment, you should compare bitcoin against other investment strategies like the stock market or real estate or whatever.

I’m not sure if you guys understand how stupid you sound. 
Bitcoin is no more “immune” from seizure than hidden cash / gold or any hard asset. You can lie and claim that you lost or forgot where you put those assets as well.  At the end of the day they’ll just put your ass in prison.

“Save on taxes.” LOL!
This reminds me of Goodfellas. “We didn’t think of our husbands as criminals. They were just normal guys willing to take some risks to provide for their families.”

Just HODL and the IRS doesn’t care.

This a million times. 
I always hate when I go into a small business that (1) doesn’t accept cards, and (2) has a private ATM in-store.  
They say it’s because they don’t want to pay transaction fees. But the reality is that they really are under reporting their income to dodge taxes, and are gaining a revenue stream by either charging rent to the ATM operator or are running the ATM themselves and collecting the $4 service fee for each withdrawal.

Are these Gypsies selling used bras? (In the front left of the books on the table.)

I’m glad someone else remembers it this way. 
My memory from a few years back was that the vast majority of the conversation was around trying to get people and businesses to use bitcoin.  Lots of threads about supporting businesses that accepted bitcoin, and people giving away bitcoin to family and friends in hopes that they would spend it and generally increase adoption. 
Been a long time since I’ve seen talk of giving away bitcoin...

Please follow-up and let us know how this goes!   ��

I’m generally a no-coiner myself, but I don’t support people piling on and kicking people when they’re down. 
Uncle Frank and Cousin Tim who are going to continually bring up the BTC price crash aren’t being helpful or insightful. They’re just people who were scared that they’d missed the boat on the single greatest investment opportunity of our lifetimes, and are now relieved and being jerks about it. 
You don’t owe them anything, and certainly shouldn’t give them any ammunition.

The standard response is: “I got out before I actually lost money, although my profits were a small fraction of what they could have been had I sold near the peak. I still believe strongly in the future of crypto long-term, and I’ll likely look to reinvest once the market stabilizes.”
It’s good because you fall on your sword re: Bitcoin as an investment without saying anything bad about it fundamentally, and you offer those looking to mock you a piece of flesh in the form of lost profits without admitting actual losses. 
Say it regardless of whether it’s true or not. In the end, your finances are none of their business.

Not sure why he put crashed in quotes. The price did crash, regardless of whether it subsequently recovered.

What’s this meme from?
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:14:04
Meaning? (Sorry if stupid question.)

Ok, so “brigading” is when a lot of people with a certain interest or point of view flood a thread with their ideas?

r/bitcoin: “Bitcoin is down huge today. It’s on sale! Time to buy!”
Also r/bitcoin: “Bitcoin is up huge today. We’re mooning, boys! Time to buy!”
At this point we should just have a sticky at the top of this sub that’s just that “lottery expert” from the billion-dollar powerball saying “my advice: buy as much Bitcoin as you can afford!”
