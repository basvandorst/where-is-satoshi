Hi, i have been waiting for a while to claim my bitcoin cash (just a small amount, ~0.04 BCH). I created a new wallet on electrum, sent the BTC from my old wallet to the new one (paid fees - error  and then tried to sweep the private keys on electrum cash on my laptop instead of my desktop. pretty much as is described [here]( Alas, i get an error on Electron Cash telling me "no inputs found. (Note that inputs need to be confirmed)". After some research, google tells me that means i do not have BCH on that private key but blockchair tells me otherwise - i should be in possession of ~0.04 BCH. Where is my error? Would be nice if anyone could explain it in a relatively BTC-noob friendly way! Thanks so much in advance !

yes i got my coins about 2 weeks ago. Didn't do anything at all, just opened electron cash for the first time since the split and i had the coins on it.

i tried this too like so: 
the problem is, it tells me i do not have funds on my address - but i can SEE that i have the BCH on my address. any ideas?

i installed electron cash on another machine and tried sweeping there, maybe i am too dumb or i am overlooking something. i'll send you a pm with my public key, if that's okay with you.
