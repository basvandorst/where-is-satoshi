You forgot to mention that you could send millions of dollars worth of bitcoin almost instantaneously to anybody on planet earth with an internet connection for a few cents without a trusted third party.

Paul Krugman is probably the most high-profile and the most ANTI-Bitcoin, even calling bitcoins evil.

"Most consumers couldn't give a s about bitcoin - and they're probably right at the moment" Ya because the ability to transfer  thousands or even millions of dollars worth of assets for a few cents almost instantaneously to anybody with an internet connection couldn't possibly be of use to consumers.

It is apparent that David S. Evans has  a lot of research to do, first of all Bitcoin isn't run by the Bitcoin Foundation, or any central authority at all. The Bitcoin Foundation is really just a posse of glorified cheerleaders. "frequently used for evading the law" The dollar is still the currency of choice for criminals, both in and out of government."There isn't a scintilla of of evidence that a Bitcoin payment system could more efficient than current ones", jeeze I guess the ability to send millions of dollars worth of assets to anybody on planet earth with an internet connection and a bitcoin address almost instantaneously and cheaply without a trusted third party could possibly prove to be more efficient than the traditional banking system! This guy is a total tool.

Speaking from experience, you probably shouldn't by a bunch of bitcoins all at once. If you intend to dump a lot of money into buying bitcoins, you should make small purchases over the course of at least a few days if not weeks.

Kill everyone on earth. There can't be terrorists to accept bitcoin donations if there are no people.

Overall Coinbase has been working fine for me, although I did get really pissed off with them once a time ago around November when they had a delay with bank transfers for a few days when the price of bitcoin was continuing to explode.

Okay maybe you can't say that there aren't fees in the literal sense, but you can still send millions of dollars worth of bitcoin from one address to another for a few cents.

Exchange spread is negligible if you plan to spend or convert bitcoins within minutes of purchasing them, if you are a merchant, bitcoin exchange fees for converting are currently lower then credit card fees so you could choose to entice bitcoin sales by passing on these savings to consumers by offering a discount to bitcoin users to the extent where it would be equally profitable if they had just used a credit card. You also wouldn't have to worry about capital gains taxes because the price of bitcoin isn't going to rise so much before you spend it that the IRS will bother to come after you. And even if they do, bitcoin is a digital currency, it wouldn't be all that hard to create a user friendly program that calculates the amount of money getting robbed from you by the IRS. The fact that most people are hoarding rather than spending bitcoins does not detract from its use as a payment system.  "Which is why Overstock's bitcoin sales have plunged over 90% since it stopped being a newsworthy event." Correlation does not equal causation.

"but you can trust me to shoot you straight because I am impartial and honest" The fact that you have to tell other people that you are impartial and honest really supports your credibility.
@_date: 2014-08-13 04:41:08
You would think that after almost a year of significant press coverage (The Silk Road bust, Mt Gox's collapse, and Overstock.com and Dell's acceptance of bitcoin, etc,) that the media would think about actually putting a little bit more research before reporting on bitcoin. What a world we live in when you can trust a wikipedia page more than you can an established news outlet.

I had the same problem months ago. The identity verification questions are apparently based on your credit history. If you are a college student like me then you would most likely not have had a credit history until you got something like a student loan. This is important because if you get the question "How long have you been associated with this address" and you lived at the address all your life, entering "more than five years" will not be the correct answer. Instead it will be the length of time you had a credit history. To be sure you should get a credit report from Equifax, Transunion, or Experian. I think you can get at least one for free.

Its good because you can receive and send money to anybody on planet earth with an internet connection and a Bitcoin address within a few minutes on any given day (banks are closed on the weekends). Its good because you can receive or send millions of dollars worth of bitcoins directly to somebody and it would only cost you a few cents in bitcoin. Its good because in order to use bitcoin you do not have to give out sensitive information like you do with credit cards (think about the Target hacking incident). Its good for merchants because there is no charge back fraud like their is with using PayPal.

The Chinese government is "trying to do the right thing" through the use of violence and coercion. If there was a reason for the bubble to burst, it was because  the Chinese government pointed guns at people to compel economic consequences. Can these guys suck the government's dick any harder? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:36:51
If you use bitcoin purely as payment method and immediately spend bitcoins after purchasing them or receiving them, you could benefit by cutting down transaction costs while suffering no risk due to price volatility. "I am impartial and honest", sure you are, just like Federal Reserve and Wall Street.

I've been buying and holding bitcoins since the start of October last year, but I made a large investment at around the the $700 range. I have still retained the majority of my bitcoins though and continue to buy more when I can.

I'm 21 years old. I've been aware of Bitcoin since May 2013 after the whole Cyprus banking incident. Its been a wild ride so far and I can't believe how fast things are evolving for Bitcoin.
