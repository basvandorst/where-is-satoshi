Quadriga does tiny volumes, so if your buy order is much lower than the current sell order, it might take hours or even days. It really depends which way the Bitcoin price swings.
You're better off buying at the current seller's offer if you need the BTC fast. Or if you want to make money by trading, then move to a bigger exchange.

Because right now the price of Bitcoin is low. They can hold onto them until the price is inflated, and they know it will inflate because the supply is constrained. They may decide to exchange them gradually, but it is much easier to dump large chunks at a time.

If you're new to Bitcoin I suggest googling for the answer because it's a long explanation to type out on my phone. If you already know what the conventional methods are, then you would know that while it's very difficult to pull off it's still safer to wait for at least 2 confirmations for peace of mind as a business owner.

Can you write off money stolen from you? (honest question)
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:22:15
Most people who use these services are new to Bitcoin and do not properly understand its protocol. They are choosing convenience, and these companies are taking advantage of that to make money off of them legally. Coinbase isn't as bad in my books because they are the most user-friendly exchange, and you can take your bitcoins off of them once you have bought them. You do have to give up your banking information, but for most people it's worth it. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:13:34
Correct, but I think cold storage is a symptom of the problem, not a solution. It doesn't allow for widespread adoption, and you still have the problem where there's a private key available to be stolen.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:35:41
The fact that you think you're being accurate in your assessment of what I said tells me that you either have trouble with reading comprehension, or you find it easier to make up things for your arguments than to directly challenge what the other person is really saying. I do not want anonymous ATMs, that's not even possible and is stupid. Why would anyone trust an anonymous ATM? What a stupid thing to say.
Let me help you understand. Please read carefully, as you might miss my points. I don't think Robocoin is bad because of any of my personal views. I am judging them based on Bitcoin's ideology, which is grounded on privacy and being decentralized. Robocoin's first offense is collecting very private information about the users of Bitcoin, which exposes not only how many bitcoins they have, but also how they are spent. This goes against the decentralized and private philosophy of Bitcoin because the government now has a database of people they can apply their laws to. If you spend your bitcoins in a way they deem is illegal, you will get fined or arrested. There's also the possibility that they can seize your bitcoins or ban you from using them anymore. That is why I do not approve of what Robocoin does. Since this is the only way to have ATMs without the operators going to jail, then it should not exist.
None of this seems to concern you, but I thought it important to clarify what I meant. I'm not against Robocoin exclusively, I'm against any company that tries to tarnish Bitcoin's core concepts for profit. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:30:24
Wow that's a very interesting find indeed!
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:22:07
I don't recommend waiting an hour for a coffee confirmation either. For online orders, it's possible to wait up to an hour before shipping the item. For Bitcoin to succeed in the retail world 0 confirmations will have to be the norm, but to do this the business order will need to use a service like Coinbase or Bitpay to absorb some of the risk.

Granted the method you've described offers a fairly high level of security, but from a usability standpoint it kind of stinks. I don't see non-technical people carrying their cold storage around with them and pulling it out when they make transactions. There has to be a more elegant solution, or Bitcoin will never catch on in the mainstream.

Seeing physical money as an IOU is actually quite funny. The more money you get, the more people technically owe you. Your friend who gives you $100 for some good or service is actually in debt to you by that amount. Money is then really a form of debt. And the best part is we created a credit system on top of the debt system, so really everyone is extremely poor and broke as fuck, but we pretend to be the opposite. Funny thing finances are.

Operators of Robocoin? That's their problem, not mine. Why should I give up my identity to help their cause?

Considering that there are almost 13 million bitcoins, your trading is negligible. Store them somewhere safe and buy things with bitcoins. Sell them to your friends. Donate them to strangers to get them started. These actions will do much more to help Bitcoin than trading 20 at a time in unsafe exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:38:19
Even that is too much in my opinion. If there is no way to make an ATM without giving up your full identity, then we will have to find another way.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:56:06
Large transactions like that usually require a fee to be confirmed in a timely manner. Check back again in a few hours. If you want a speedier experience next time, include a fee.
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:16:51
Very hypothetical scenario, but I would assume that bitcoins would be assigned arbitrary values in the beginning for common items based on how many bitcoins have been mined at the time. After some time has passed, the value of milk, bread, clothing, gas, etc. will be determined by what people are willing to trade. In the beginning one litre of gas might be 10 satoshis, but then go down to 3 satoshis. Basically, we'd stop valuing Bitcoin against fiat currencies and it would take on a value of its own.
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:57:35
Yes and no. For reassurance it's still better to wait for more than 1. 6 still is the best way of making sure the transaction has successfully gone through. You can wait for less, but that's up to you and how much risk you want to take. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:12:55

They for sure use the block chain, but they probably also monitor other exchanges and have their own algorithms that analyze all the data in a specific way. You'd have to ask them to be sure, but they probably wouldn't tell you.

Wait for multiple confirmations (rule of thumb is 6) before processing the payment.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:47:11
I completely agree. If he were an online retailer I don't think it would be a problem to tell them customer their order has been processed after 0 confirmations, but it would be prudent to wait for at least 1 or 2 block chain confirmations before releasing the order for shipment. I have my reservations of Bitcoin's viability as a retail method of payment, but services like Coinbase or Bitpay do make it possible.
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:55:29
You're getting downvotes, but you're the only one making sense here. When thallium205 is working for another company in a year, he's going to regret spending so much energy pushing these shitty ATMS onto people who don't want them. Robocoin does NOT understand Bitcoin nor its users. They are "trying to keep people out of jail" but if their ATMs did not identify people, then how would the government know who to put in jail?

Prices rise depending on how supply is reduced. If you knew that a commodity has gone scarce only because a large portion is being held by one entity, you are less likely to pay more. Why? Because you are aware that the supply has been artificially reduced, and that this one person will try and cash out at a high price in the near future. When that person decides to cash out, Bitcoin's value will nosedive. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:54:34

Has Litecoin been stuck at $14 dollars for a while now? You'd get about 0.125 bitcoins if you traded 5 of them, which is a nice amount to start with. I don't think Bitcoin will dive down to $400 again soon, so if Litecoin is stagnant go for it.

Firstly, we do not know for certain that 750K bitcoins were stolen by a single individual. All we know right now is that a large amount of bitcoins have gone missing, and that they're most likely gone forever. But let's assume these claims are true. If this individual decides to spread and mix his bitcoins across multiple addresses and then keeps them in his possession for a very long time, the value of bitcoin will most certainly plummet. This basically equates to 7% of bitcoins no longer circulating, almost as if they have vanished. This will leave people feeling vulnerable, especially with the fear of a mass sell-off looming over their heads. I really hope that it won't play out like that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:11:04

The Mycelium wallet has the option where every time you want to make a transaction, you need to input your password. I'm not sure if they're encrypting the private key (probably not), but I do know that your private key is encrypted when you back it up to a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:59:50
I'm talking about private keys, not public keys. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:02:14
I misunderstood that you meant the operators of the ATM are the ones who are anonymous, my mistake. However, I do think people should be able to anonymously use a Bitcoin ATM. That is unfortunately an impossibility, which is why these ATMs shouldn't exist. New Bitcoin users do not fully understand how it works, and I'm assuming many will buy their first bitcoins on ATMs like this. They will regret it, because they won't be getting the proper experience. 
As for how Bitcoin is private, I think it's fairly straightforward. The block chain identifies you as your public address, not by your name or any personal information. You are able to remain private as long as there is no affiliation between your public address and personal identity. Robocoin is taking that part out of the equation by associating your identity with your public address every time you make a transaction at their ATM. The government can then track that address in the block chain and monitor your activity if they wish to. This eliminates the ability to operate privately, and the more people that can have their transactions traced will further reduce the value of Bitcoin.
By the way, I am not vilifying Robocoin here in any way. My main problem lies with the US government's (and other governments) desire to regulate Bitcoin. However, I also don't like that Robocoin is giving them an avenue to do so. You seem personally offended when I criticize Robocoin (are you affiliated in some way?), so I thought it was important to clarify that.
Finally, there is a good reason why the most popular exchanges are NOT located in the US. People want to remain private whether you think that is important or not, and the only way to do so is by not complying with US laws. I don't approve of people using Bitcoin for illegal or illicit activities, but I also don't want to give a government the resources they need to stop those people if it means making Bitcoin decentralized. No one should be able to tell you when you can or can't use your bitcoins. If they do, how is this better than a fiat currency? Bitcoin's value is derived from its openness and freedom, and if that is ever compromised its value will drop to zero.

It can be pretty risky because when there are 0 confirmations, you can try to spend the same bitcoins multiple times before the next block is mined. That means you could buy a coffee from Starbucks and then walk across the street and buy a doughnut from another store with those same bitcoins. When the block gets confirmed one of those stores will be swindled out of those bitcoins, and the other will never know they almost got gypped. This is called a race attack and it remains the biggest obstacle for retail. You can read about it more here:

Do you honestly believe there's a law that limits how much money a person can carry around? I mean, I can understand a cop being suspicious and asking you where you got that money from, but you can freely tell him to go fuck himself and keep going on your merry way if that's what you wanted to do. There is no law telling you how much you can carry because that makes no fucking sense. Go read a book and stop talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:23:20
I think you're confusing volatility with inflation. Since there is a finite, pre-determined amount of bitcoins that can be "printed" at a known controlled rate, the value of of Bitcoin should only go up. This is different from fiat currencies where the amount of printed dollars is continuously fluctuating based on demand. If too much is printed, the value deflates. That's the big difference.

So it is possible, though the proposed method seems very rudimentary. I'd bet there's a way to circumvent the lock feature after every failed attempt, but it probably depends on the phone and OS version. Anyways, when you said password I was under the impression you meant your Mycelium pin code, which if I'm not mistaken does not have a phone lock feature. Either way, it wouldn't take long for a phone thief to gain access if they really wanted to it seems.

How would they be found? Public addresses do not reveal who owns the bitcoins in the real world.
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:32:15
Bitcoin will only go mainstream once sites like Amazon or E-bay begin to accept it. We don't need any half-baked ideas like Bitcoin ATMs to try and increase its popularity, especially if it sacrifices the one thing everyone in this community cares about: privacy. Giving up your entire identity to make it a little more convenient to buy bitcoins at a few select locations is stupid. Anyone who disagrees does not understand Bitcoin nor why it exists.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:22:04
Fair enough. I hope it works out for you and your friends.

@_date: 2014-08-28 02:53:41
Oh yes, I've learned about this before. It makes iOS 7 (and soon 8) invulnerable to rooting, which could lead to losing your bitcoins from a remote hacker. This is definitely the prudent thing to do if you are a developer and want to build a wallet app on iOS, but unfortunately it's not perfect security. Interesting though, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:36:51
It makes sense for the government-run banks, but why does it make sense to you?
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:55:17
Because, as you already know, it's never a good idea to have all of your eggs in one basket. Bitcoin at this moment in time is still an experiment, and while it may succeed, there's always the possibility that it won't. It might get regulated/banned to death, or it might get replaced by a better crypto-currency. Not to mention the fact that there's always the possibility of being robbed, even if you are taking all the precautions not to be. It's just the prudent and sensible thing to do.
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:04:18
Giving someone money doesn't erase debt. Money is a placeholder for future services or goods. If you want to give me $100 dollars for my goat, I can decide to accept that $100 because I know I will be able to buy a sheep from you sometime in the (hopefully) near future. When I have your $100, it is basically you telling me "I owe you something of equal value as the goat in return." This money is proof that someone owes you a good or service equal to what you initially traded for the money. If Bitcoin one day prevails, it'll only be because people come to think it's a better system than fiat currency is. People once thought bartering was the best way to trade goods, and one day I think people will think proof of work is best.

I've been learning about Bitcoin since January, so it feels great to finally own some! I don't have enough to buy anything yet, but I will after tomorrow! I'm meeting someone through Mycellium's new local trader app to buy a usable amount. It's exciting!
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:32:57
Yes I think so. Litecoin is still profitable to mine, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were better options out there. However, if you're not responsible for paying your electric bill I'd still go for mining Bitcoin. Even if you only mine 0.1 bitcoins in a year that'll be worth a lot more than mining 10 litecoins :P
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:14:41
True, but you're speaking from the consumer's point of view. As a business owner, waiting for 1 or 2 confirmations will help you sleep better at night. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:57:55
I already know the best way to store fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:48:57
So use your other funds to pay for those things? No one should have their entire fortune stored in bitcoins. These ATMs should serve the purpose of making it easy for newcomers to buy bitcoins and experience it for themselves. Anything more right now is risky.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:06:25
I just went to tigerdirect.com and tested your theory. I chose a random item, and the final price was $701.27. I chose Bitcoin payment option, and it came to 1.0492 BTC. That worked out to be about $672.
Conclusion: some businesses will give their customers a discount, some will charge the same amount as fiats, and some will try and charge more. Don't use the ones that charge more.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:35:27
The risk is indeed low, but as a business owner your number 1 priority is to mitigate risk. If waiting another 10 minutes can do that for you without detrimenting your customer's experience, why not do it? Especially when you're still new to Bitcoin and don't exactly understand how it works yet and thus don't fully trust it.
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:33:46
This. Educate yourself first and weigh the risk vs the reward before putting your money into anything. I did 5 months of research before buying 25 dollars worth of Bitcoin this week, and my friends still think it was a bad idea. Always start small and never invest more than what you can afford to lose. Don't forget, this is still in the experimental phase. It could go to $1000 by the end of the month, and it could be back to $400 the month after.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:15:50
Pretty cool! Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:46:18
If the US government won't let you buy bitcoins from users anonymously, then why not make an ATM that only sells bitcoins like the one in Montreal? This would allow you to bring Bitcoin to the people of the world how it's meant to be.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:32:07
I want to respond to some points you made, but you don't seem the type for debates. You had the opportunity to make counter-arguments that might show me why ATMS are viable, but instead you chose to tell me that I'm self-important and that I nominated myself to be the Grand Decider for Bitcoin. Was this an attempt at humor? I gave my opinion, not orders. Don't like what I have to say? Then tell my why my arguments are wrong, but don't attack me personally. I'm simply an enthusiast in the subject like everyone else here, so please stop being a prick.

Oh no, I seem to have insulted one of this community's golden boys. But while I'm at it, I will say that having a degree or two isn't much of an accomplishment in my books. Most people in my generation of the Western world will have at least one degree. I myself have a degree, and I don't count that as much of an accomplishment. I haven't contributed to academic papers, but that still doesn't qualify him in my books to make these radical claims. Has he predicted anything significant that has come true?

@_date: 2014-02-25 07:58:53
It's not entirely known how all of these bitcoins have been lost yet, but one of the ways was from transaction malleability. That basically means bitcoins were being sent multiple times to the same customer because they could fake that the bitcoins never arrived the first time. This is not a problem with the Bitcoin protocol, but instead a problem with the exchange's code. Other exchanges were also vulnerable, but once they realized it they patched it up quickly. Mt. Gox never did apparently, so they kept losing bitcoins. As to how these transactions can be "hidden," I think it's done by sending them to your other addresses, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:35:26
I think they said they take a picture of your face and match it to your driver's license. This doesn't really make me feel better though. It sounds like they're compiling a database of Bitcoin users. What happens if the US outright bans the use of bitcoins, are all of those people automatically going to be questioned? Sounds like an unnecessary risk.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:10:58
Public speaking 101: don't say "right?" and "okay?" after every point you're trying to make. Your point might be convincing, but your delivery won't be. Also, this guy is why people don't take Bitcoin seriously. Young and naive white male that probably hasn't accomplished anything in his life proselytizing how Bitcoin will change the world. Kudos to him for trying, but he has a long way to go before anyone takes him seriously.

The company Dish recently decided to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment from its clientele, and they chose Coinbase as their service provider. The user here tried to name his Coinbase profile "dish" in hopes of receiving payments from people trying to pay for their monthly subscription fees to Dish. Coinbase did not let him.

Why do you keep stashing your bitcoins in exchanges? Move them somewhere secure and you won't have to worry about other people's greediness.

The new technology would be the ability to assemble private keys when they are needed, and destroy them when they're not. So the private keys are never stored anywhere, and therefore there would be nothing to steal as a hacker. Would this make you want to change wallets?

Bitcoin is advertised as a currency so I guess it makes sense to check someone with a Bitcoin sweater for it. They obviously had no idea what it really was, but they were just checking to be sure. It's ignorant, but that will change with time.

Me neither. I was so ready to build my rig (I even watched those 1-hour tutorials on YouTube), but then I saw a talk from Andreas Antonopoulos where he showed that by the end of 2014 you'll need a commercial set up to make a decent profit. If you're happy making under a dollar a day with one ASIC go ahead, but I don't think it's worth the effort.
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:43:15
Bitcoin is the first crypto-currency, but it doesn't hold a true monopoly in the sector because it's still in the experimental phase. Some people wanted more than 21 million coins to be released and at a faster rate. Some wanted faster confirmations for the blockchain. Some wanted a different type of hashing algorithm. And some just wanted to have fun (you can guess which one that is). How they affect Bitcoin today is mostly positive in my opinion - it gets more people interested in the subject, like Dogecoin for example. In the future there will probably be many popular and valuable altcoins, but that shouldn't alarm you. They'll be easily interchangeable, so if you want to buy in litecoins you can convert quickly from bitcoins. Think of it like the US dollar versus the rest of the world's currencies. If you go to Europe, using Euros is more convenient than US dollars. If you go to a specific website, it might be more convenient to use Dogecoin.
And I didn't even mention the fact that some of these altcoins aren't even competing with Bitcoin directly, meaning that they aren't necessarily trying to replace Bitcoin but instead build on it. Some are just using the technology for really interesting applications that have nothing to do with money at all. A few examples include: namecoin, zerocoin, and ripple. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:19:40
They're on the ledger, they just belong to new addresses. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:12:11
No, you tell them how many dollars/euros/pesos/whatever you're paying them in. Value of Bitcoin changes almost every minute, so it's almost meaningless to tell them how much you're paying in BTC.

@_date: 2014-03-21 07:24:35
Decent article, but I'm not sure who their target audience is. Is it meant as an introduction to people who have never heard of Bitcoin? They don't really do a good job explaining what it is. Is it meant for people who have heard of it but think it's a scam? Nothing there to make them think otherwise. Is it for people who believe in Bitcoin's potential? No new information for them there. Kind of a useless piece of journalism, but any press is good press, right?
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:30:21
Didn't they have major financial troubles just a couple years back? I don't think they can afford to experiment with an unproven technology at this point. It would be cool, but good luck convincing their executives. Only reason the app went through was to promote customer loyalty. Bitcoin has that appeal as well, but the risk outweighs the benefits in my opinion at this point.
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:43:31
Which is what Bitcoin developers will do for the average person.

This is so unnecessary. Focus on writing documents for different peer groups, not genders. Teens will use Bitcoin differently than young adults, who will use it differently than middle-aged people. Promote ease of use for online shopping to teens, decentralization to young adults, and lower fees to middle-aged people for instance. This just comes off as sexist and depraved.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:04:28
You just answered your own question. The main issues is that journalists are not educated on the subject, yet that doesn't deter them from reporting on it. If you're ignorant on a subject, then you should have no authority to report your opinions as facts. Educate yourselves first, then educate the public. Isn't that your job anyways?
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:57:07
It's old fashioned.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:09:46
Gox used to be the leader with about 70% of the world's exchanges going through them, but before their bankruptcy they were only handling around 15%. Also, exchanges are just a small part of Bitcoin's future. They are essentially unregulated banks, and people are now becoming aware to not trust them. It's a steep learning curve for most, but it will ultimately benefit the entire community. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:32:28
Customers are used to walking into a store, paying for their item, and walking away with it. This entire process takes only a few minutes, but Bitcoin payments would add about 7 minutes on average to the entire process while the owner waits for a confirmation. The business owner could risk it and let the customer walk away without a confirmation, but there will always be bad people taking advantage of a stranger's trust. That's why services like Coinbase and Bitpay are needed to absorb risk by taking the financial hit if the customer double spends like a jackass. That's my only criticism of Bitcoin when it comes to retail. For online transactions, like a purchase on Amazon, Bitcoin is perfectly suited to improve the entire experience for both consumer and business owner.

Excellent response, thank you for taking the time to break it down for me. One thing I didn't understand is when you said Coinbase and Blockchain.info are online wallets, while Mycelium is not. What did you mean by that? Also, if there was a new wallet that offered enhanced security and required less thinking and careful attention to detail from the user, do you think it would have a distinct advantage? I find hot wallets in their current form might be better suited for Bitcoin enthusiast, and less so for the curious layman or grandmother. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:27:08
Do you plan on joining a mining community? Check Blockchain.info and you'll see that over 90% of the blocks are being mined by just a few groups. Your share in that group will be tiny. I don't see how you'll be making a decent profit in just a few months. Like everyone says, Bitcoin will either take off or crash in the next few years. Either scenario is bad for small miners like us.

@_date: 2014-08-27 03:51:38
Ideally yes, but there are many scenarios where that might not be possible (phone lost in a foreign country, for example). And the wallet is putting a lot of pressure on the user to transfer their coins "in time" or else. I think a more elegant solution might be available that would reduce the stress of owning Bitcoin, and would make it more accessible to more people. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:05:20
You should never trust other people with your money without legal backing, whether they're strangers or well known to you. Simple as that. Is it sad and unfortunate? Yes, but I'd rather be sad about having to be cynical than sad about being robbed for the 100th time.

I can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you what NOT to do. Don't bring it to an Apple store and see a genius, they'll just tell you to reset your phone.

Exactly. You buy BTC low, and use it when it's high. You're starting to get it now.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:57:26
It means I spread my money across multiple banks and investments. Homes, commercial properties, and other real estate opportunities are probably where most people's money is kept. I don't have any bonds or stocks, but that's another way people choose to preserve their funds. I don't own any gold or other precious materials, but that's another way people keep their wealth. I don't keep my money in multiple currencies because I do not follow multiple economies closely, only my own. And fiat currencies may be in decline, but they are far less volatile and risky than Bitcoin is right now.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:13:35
It's not up to the developers to make it more digestible, it's up to the big corporations. Once they accept it as a form of payment, they will do everything you just listed. Only way to get corporations to accept it faster is by asking your favorite ones when they will implement it. If the demand is there, the supply will come.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:26:43
Not to mention that these coins cannot be confiscated and returned to their owners. They're gone, and the only thing that can be done is to hold the operators of Mt. Gox responsible. This terrible event will ultimately serve as a learning opportunity, but it is definitely a tough lesson to swallow for many.
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:05:38
Of course they will impose those laws. They want to control Bitcoin, and your employer is giving them a way to control Bitcoin. That goes against the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, which is where its real value comes from. Take that away, and Bitcoin is worth nothing. If you are really in support of Bitcoin, then you would not be making these ATMS.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:16:37

You can copy-paste the address into  and it'll tell you if it's an unused address or not.
Multi-sig means you need more than one private key to sign a Bitcoin transaction, sort of like how you need multiple people to sign a particular contract before it becomes legitimate. If there is a signature (private key) missing, then the deal (transaction) can't go through.
2FA is a little similar in that you need more than one factor to authenticate. There are traditionally 3 factors to authenticate: something you know (ex: password), something you are (ex: finger print), and something you have (ex: phone). For example, you might need to know a password and have your phone in order to login to a website because the phone gets a text message with a second code. If you don't have the second code, the login won't work!
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:54:56
He didn't specify if he was using a service or whether the orders were being made online or in person, so I suggested a general rule of thumb that still applies today if you're doing a peer to peer transaction. Better safe than sorry, especially in the beginning.

It is impossible to reverse transactions. I did not mean that they are now unusable, just that the people who lost them won't be seeing them again.

When you are placing a purchase in the app it shows you how much BTC you are buying before any money is sent. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:07:34
Same way they do it now. They can earn bitcoins by selling goods or providing services, or they can buy them off of people in real life. These are the best way to maintain your privacy today. I did not say Bitcoin was anonymous, so please do not clump me in some stereotyped group you've formed in your head. If people don't mind giving up some banking information, they can use Coinbase if they're a little tech savvy. And I promise you there will be better and more mainstream ways in the near future, but these ATMS aren't it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:21:51
Self-important posts? I didn't know giving your opinion was a bad thing. My point is that ATMs do not look like a viable option right now for bitcoins, so let's ditch them and figure out another distribution method. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:12:10
If you have a PayPal account and an iOS device, you can purchase bitcoins with no verification process (other than an email) by using ATOMBIT Wallet. Bitcoins are sent in minutes and customer service is responsive.

I'm working for a Bitcoin start-up that's going to be launching in a few months, and we're developing a wallet that behaves in the way I described. I can't explain it to you fully now how it works, but basically we're using newly patented technology that allows users to destroy keys into useless parts, and then the user can regenerate the key with those parts. That's as far as I can go for now.

All of the options listed in responses so far have you storing the private key somewhere, which means it's possible for it to be stolen. By far the best solution is ATOMBIT Wallet, which deletes the private key and then allows you, and only you, the ability to recreate it. That means it doesn't exist until you sign a transaction, and then it's gone again. It's not stored anywhere, which means there's nothing that can be stolen.
Give it a try and let me know what you think.

Does your mom know how to use an iPhone? Does she have a PayPal account, or can you hook her up with yours or someone else's? I ask because the easiest way I can think of is by downloading ATOMBIT Wallet, buying BTC through them, and then sending it using that wallet. You buy just by setting the amount you want to buy with a slider (very easy, for amounts between $5 - 100), and then signing in to your PayPal account. Then it'll arrive to the wallet (she'll get a ding), and she can send it to you by scanning your QR code.
Give it a shot and let me know if it worked!

Just to be clear, I wouldn't say Canada's parliament has looked into it. Their senate committee did, which is very very different than the American senate system.
But it was a positive step, either way. I think the best one could hope for right now is what Europe has done, which is declare it a currency. Or treat it like Canada (excluding Quebec) and do not regulate it.

Unfortunately PayPal does not protect customers from anything they deem to be digital goods since it cannot be proved that the "product" was "shipped." Only way to get your money back is to claim your PayPal account was hacked or to call your bank and tell them you didn't authorize the purchase.

Thanks! Quick question - do the differences in the miners' clocks change how the network processes blocks? If I'm a miner and I publish that I solved my block at 1:00 PM, but my clock is 5 minutes slower than most other miners' clocks...how does that affect the network?
