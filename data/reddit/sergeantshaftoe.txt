Well, the sats that I buy might have some history of illegal activity, which I don't want to have anything to do with. So, mixing/coinjoining bundles my sats and a bunch of other people's sats and mixes them up so that the history of each sats is blurred.

Started stacking sats. Going to buy continuously, regardless of the price, probably every month.
Started an libreoffice calc sheet to keep track of my accumulation process. Probably gonna calculate dollar rate average, etc.
Also, determined to run a full node. Probably gonna set it up in a month. Then I plan to use wasabi/samourai to do coinjoins/mixes to wash my coins.
For the long term, I will set up a lightning node, too. And probably buy a coldcard.
Going to become my own bank. Full self-sovereignty. Which also brings full responsibility, too. Probably gonna have to look up network security and opsec stuff.
Good times.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:30:03
continuing on my effort to put up a full node. my prev post:
I have used etcher to burn ubuntu 18.04LTS to a 32 GB sd card. Slipped that thing to the odroid hc1. however, the blue heartbeat light does not blink on odroid hc1. and I have no idea why.
I guess I will continue tomorrow.

I am out of the loop with this "average cost" thing. Can you point me to a post/article that started it?
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:10:35
it is not smear campaign: samourai doesn't only accuse wasabi. but give some evidence/weight behind his accusations.
on the other hand, uses some software bug of 4-5 years ago to smear incompetency on the samourai devs.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:56:23
yeah, probably because my exit node ip address has been used for some ddos or something. but still it sucks having to pay for the damage that someone else has done.

Working on setting up a full BTC node. I am using odroid hc1. Poked around my routers settings last night, wanted to assign a static IP to the odroid. However, got lost in the settings -- so many tweakable thinigs that I don't know the meaning nor the importance.
It seems like a basic networking knowledge is necessary, not just to setup a bitcoin node, but to protect your node/or home network from possible attacks?
I mean I can imagine a scenario where I set some router thing wrong and expose my odroid setup and someone else connecting to my node, and possibly stealing my btc's and stuff.
Would appreciate any help.

@_date: 2019-07-12 19:08:53
yeah... my post was more like trying to provoke others to share similar experiences.
My main concern is this: this router/networking stuff is so alien to me that I am scared that I might leave myself open to attacks in my home network.
I am following this guide:

Actually I try to combine a few guides: Stadicus', 402PaymentReq's youtube channel, Alon Ganon's, etc.
Main hurdles: 1) setting up OS in the machine. odroid seems to be using some modified versions of ubuntu as listed on their own website: 
And I am not comfortable with using some modified OS, I do not know why/how they modified it, what did they inclulde (there might be some keylogger hiding in that .iso file?)
2) Networking: after assigning an IP to my odroid, which will presumably have 192.168.etc.etc. how am I going to connect to that odroid when I am outside of my room? (I would like to connect my Samourai wallet to the full node in my room)
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:57:08

trying to setup a full node is real work! especially if you want to get it done right, and really understand what you are doing.
following the commands of some random web guide may work, but if you are really willing to open up a virtual bank in your room, if you are willing to take that much of responsibility, you better get that damn thing right!

Not all Bitcoin ATM's are anonymous. Some are. But some require you to give your email address, your phone number, and scan your ID -- they are reprehensible, to say the least.
However, if you find an ATM that let's you buy without doing these, once you bought your Satoshis from the ATM, you should scan an address that your mobile wallet created. You can use Samourai wallet -- 
Once those Sats are in your mobile wallet, then send them to your Wasabi wallet.

today or tomorrow. it doesn't matter. the halvening is coming closer and closer. so, stock-to-flow will double and it will make bitcoin more scarce.
also, i see constant improvement and skilled maintainers on and around bitcoin protocol/code. further, everyday, new bitcoiners open their eyes and join hodlers -- these are the people who hold their bitcoins for the long run, and contribute to making bitcoin even more scarce.
people are waking up.
