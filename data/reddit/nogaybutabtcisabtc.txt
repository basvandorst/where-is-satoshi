So you are interested in how to get away with a scam right?
Well my advice to you is, stay away from such thoughts. Wash your face, brush your teeth and go to bed. You will feel better tomorrow:)

Yeah. Where the fk is the golden lambo. Cant wait to drive to the moon with my lambo and meet Neil Armstrong and drink beer with him on the freaking moon. After the moon i might drive to mars. We will see hehe

Yes. And when banks and governments start to buy coins people will move their money from the stock market and invest in coins. In the future the cryptomarket will be bigger than the stock market. Why? Well the stock market already bloomed in the 70-90s. Nowadays you earn pocket money on the stocks. People love money. People will always be drawn to money and soon everyone will wake up and realise that crypto is the new stock market. Mark my words my friend

Well 7h sleep per day is 49h
1h per day for gym is 7 hours
Work 40h
Doing laundry 4h per week
Cleaning maybe also 4h per week
Need to spend time with my wife (we got married almost a year ago) thats 35h
Gotta be social with my friends so 5h there
So the total amount of hours i spend on these things is 144h
Then i have 24 hours left and i spend those hours reading about crypto/ pooping
Thats why i need moon hehe. I hope i clarified my situation to you :-)
