He didn't say "difficult to use and understand but that's okay." He said "easy to use and understand."

lmao the average transaction costs $20, trending up.

Wow, it's neat that you can just say that without supporting it. *My* point stands!

If your gripe with banks has anything to do with the fees they charge, I can't imagine why you would like bitcoin.

Which is weird because it's the only part that has been solved.

How did you arrive at the 99% figure?

If we assume the problems go away, there are no problems!

Holy shit, that's awesome. I switched to firefox when "Quantum" came out, and I never realized it could do this.

I agree with you, man.

The average bitcoin transaction costs [TWENTY DOLLARS]( 


We're really not. We're talking about currency, and the study of currency already has a rich vocabulary. This vocabulary incorporates these concepts where necessary and discards them when all they would do is unnecessarily confuse the conversation. 
Put another way, if you asked an economist about whether the Venezuelan bolivar was a good currency, what do you think they would say? They would say, "well, it's a terrible store of value, and it's a terrible standard of value because prices are unofficially denominated in USD, so it's a bad currency." Or they would say, "well, the inflation actually isn't quite *that* bad at the moment, and the official prices in bolivar are useful to buyers, so it's actually an okay currency." What they would *not* say is, "well, in the context of money being an aggregate of signals in constant flux..." 
Economists manage to talk about currency in simple language, without going off on tangents about "information theory . . . chaos and . . . complex adaptive systems"—why can't you? 


So, if you agree that those are the fundamental questions, why do you disagree with those who attack bitcoin on the basis that it abjectly fails at all of them? It's currently a bad medium of exchange because transactions are expensive and it is not widely used. It's a bad store of value because the value of a bitcoin fluctuates radically within even a single week. It's a bad standard of value because if someone said "this car cost ten bitcoins," that tells you *nothing* unless you know which month they bought it in. *Bitcoin* is a bad currency. Maybe some better cryptocurrency will come along, but there's no reason to think it will be Bitcoin.


This is wrong. The "underlying fundamentals" of the Venezuelan bolivar are unchanging, but the supply of it is increasing more than the demand is increasing, so its value has plummeted. It is therefore a bad currency. "Store of value" just means that a unit of the currency is worth about the same today as it will be tomorrow, because currencies are supposed to *store value.* If a currency *does not store value,* it is not a good currency, even if you have some novel interpretation of "stability" that suggests otherwise.

See, that *would* be a protection racket. 


What does this even mean? You're using some abstract terms, with the effect of obscuring the actual practical effect of such a system. I'm not clear on what a "colourful range" of private solutions means. I'm iffy on "changing reality of internal and external security." And I'm not clear why divorcing security from electoral politics is supposed to be a good thing.
All in all, I'm leery of any solution that would give us Wells Fargo presents The Police™.

My favorite part is how made some bullshit waffley reply and then deleted it after he got called out.

Yeah, Lehman Brothers in particular made off like bandits. It's fucking obscene how well they're doing now, and they started the whole damn recession.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:55:36
It does seem a bit unfair to characterize the collapse of the issuing government as being a failing of fiat currency itself. That's an acknowledged risk, and all it suggests is we ought to consider the stability of the issuing government when deciding what currency to use. So too with hyper-inflation.
Moreover, 99% of cryptocurrencies will never be used for any serious purpose. By your reasoning, that seems to cast doubt on Bitcoin's viability as well.

They're lying about being an economist, so why should we presume good faith?


Some enterprises may be established in the hope that they end well for all involved, but when that hope is unrealistic, and when those marketing the enterprise are insulated from the cost of failure *in direct proportion* to the amount of support they can drum up for their failing enterprise, and when failure means the early adopters will make money and those they've marketed to will lose money—I think that makes it a scam.

Problems go away because they're solved, not because we assume they can be solved. "If you assume the problems you mentioned are solved, there are no problems" is totally vacuous.

See, this is the "judges (and opposing counsel) must be idiots" thing. Of course Bitcoin is an asset. It's a thing you own that has a sale value. This is like saying you think you won't have to split up your valuable Magic the Gathering collection, because maybe a court has never considered whether trading cards have "tangible worth."
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:47:06
I'm sure this will go nowhere, but I'll indulge you. "Asset" is well-defined: it is anything that "is owned and has value." "Asset" extends to non-tangible goods. For instance, it extends to the goodwill a person holds in his business, or to intellectual property. 80 A.L.R.5th 487. In general, courts have broad powers to ensure that property is distributed equally. 146 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 197. 
In other words, there's no fucking way that a judge will say "I dunno if bitcoin counts as an asset." Non-tangible things already count as assets all the time.

"Judges are idiots, right?" 
Seriously, this is up there with "I forgot what I did with my gold."

The obvious substance of his comment is this: it's fiscal policy, not monetary policy, that's causing debt to rise.
