Two main reasons. 1) there's a greater attack surface on Windows because Windows is more widely used. It's like Linux is a bullseye on a dartboard, and Windows is the entire dartboard. 
2) Any person and their dog uses Windows, meaning there will be a greater amount of people who don't understand security methodologies compared to the population who uses Linux.

you say that, but it's not 1 in 10 and it doesn't just include numbers... it's 16bit, so goes 0-f

Bitcoin and similarly Litecoin are the only coins (worth mention) that solely focus on the purity of their blockchain. Coins like Etherium are amazing with tokens being added in their blockchain although it creates massive bloat. Their developers are trying to resolve that issue at the moment. Etherium is so young compared to Bitcoin although performance for the same task and blockchain size are ridiculously larger.
Bitcoin is also releasing sideloaded blockchains that will create the ability to use similar token software, without creating any bloat on the core blockchain. This alone will devalue all other tokens as the Bitcoin processing power is exponentially higher than any other protocol. 
Also the fact it's "not really anonymous" isn't a bad thing at all. It has certain drawbacks, but for governments and companies who want to tax you, it's a good thing. I'm not talking about centralising the coin, although you can prove transactions for legal purposes. In that sense, it's more likely to receive approval by vendors and governments.
The only reason Bitcoin will lose number 1 status is if there is a flaw discovered that causes distrust in the software.

The only effective method to "hack" a blockchain is to have more than 50% of the computational power and then flip a coin.
