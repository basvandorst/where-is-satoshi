Idk what improvements will be desired or necessary in 10 years but I reject the idea that it's perfection because nothing humans have ever made before or after has been perfection. No one backs it up because you'd need to see into the future to back it up.

Very true. I have no idea what the metrics for comparison would be. But it's still a product that people have to believe in and buy into or not. If it sucks and doesn't have cool features that draw the crowd it loses. Whether those features are making great toast or smart contracts. You need them to beat the competition. If a coin comes out tomorrow with a huge block size, a bunch of scaling issues solved, cheap transactions that still manage to pay miners handsomely, the smartest of contracts, then Google Microsoft and Apple all pledge dev resources and refuse to accept payment by other means are you gonna stay on the Bitcoin train? Cuz that's not an impossible thing it could happen... Next year maybe not tomorrow but it could happen.

We want mass adoption. The masses are idiots.

This is not the internet. It's not a good comparison. It's a product like toasters. If everyone buys in then a particular brand may be on top but if another comes out with better features and the current top brand doesn't adapt it'll die. With the internet we didn't have options. We either made it better or went to the library. LOL

If BTC remains then either the core team kicks an amazing amount of ass adding new features or mankind's ability to conceive new ideas has failed. Cryptocurrency is in infancy. Bitcoin is like the alpha version of a tech that has a very long way to go. It's the abacus to an eventual quantum computer.

Sound logic. I need to sell my Google, Microsoft, Intel, Tesla, and Apple stock. Sure they've done well but that's no guarantee and without that it's just gambling right?

You're not looking out far enough. I agree people may not catch on in our lifetime but a BTC you buy today buys your kid a luxury car when they are 30. The tech is good which means it'll be hard to kill since the advantages for the folks in the know will be so good. Wallstreet is taking blockchain tech for use in it's accounting systems so it's only a matter of time until SOME cryptocurrency breaks through to wide adoption. So yes you may die a BTC believer only able to buy a few things with BTC in your lifetime but the next generation will see where this is going.

If I want stagnation why not a savings account

I didn't say only good enough for a car I said they'll get a car with it. Luxury at that. 5k today buying a 120k car in 20-30 years. You can't do better with mutual funds. My kids and family is what I do this for I don't expect BTC to make me rich. I think of it like diamonds before everyone decided diamonds are expensive. If my kid happens to have a stash when the world wakes up they'll be way ahead of the game.
