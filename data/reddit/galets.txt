I don't want this to sound like a conspiracy, because it probably isn't; but my withdrawal-on-hold suspiciously coincided with a DDoS attack...

If this is true, it is pretty frustrating on the side of dwolla... Second time they are changing APIs such that MtGox fails to function. Either MtGox folks are not too good at programming, or dwolla is handling business is a very annoying fashion. Really... You can't just go and change API at will.

you can get almost anything by buying amazon gift cards, on sites like [btcbuy.info]( and such. There are also some other retailer cards you could get there (btcbuy), and usually it's very quick too, at least with amazon.

[btcbuy.info]( has not visa prepaid cards per se, but you can buy amazon or newegg gift cards for almost current rate with a very small surcharge. there's also some cards there with no surcharge at all, and recently they started selling [giftcertificates.com]( super-certificates, which you can convert to a huge selection of other vendor's cards. Basically, if you use in USA, you most probably will get what you're looking for using just btcbuy cards
