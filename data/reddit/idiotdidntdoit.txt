It was a guy that was trying to deposit etc into an ETH account and didn't get any txs so he tweeted it with the insolvency question, whereas it was really just a software incompatibility issue. 
Calling ?

Well actual first there were rumors of Coinbase being insolvent, then the was squashed as a misunderstanding, then Coinbase Marc Armstrong tweeted "the civil war is over" but it was just a joke photo, and then bitfinex was hacked.
It's been a tumultuous 3 days, and I've been on board since 2014.

There was a meeting between core and the miners. I don't know what the results of the meeting was, but this is the first sign i've seen.

This is really gonna start the real next rocket. As soon as their yearly earnings call is in, and they can say that they have been able to leverage blockchain for their bottom line, things are gonna get [nuts!](

Yeah you’d hope for the developers wanting to find every possible conceivable flaw in the code and fix it before it goes mainstream and an international embarrassment tarnishes the brand. But if history is any indication the developers seems to be doing a good and steady job at making solid progress.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:46:11
The machine on the right can actually get software upgraded to sell bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:56:02
Well that’s an idea. I like your sentiments young man. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:30:30
Couldn’t they just use something faster? Everyone would have to buy bitcoin and exchange into something else. Why don’t Microsoft or steam make their own coin? They could make it as fast as they want. And it’d be easy to convert back to bitcoin and dollars if you’d want. 
I hope they are working on something. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:08:14
Here. 
It's at a point of no return. I'm currently dealing with paying taxes in my home country, and in order to do so, I have to send money to my bank there, then transfer it to their account, and then wait for them to see the transfer and manually add it to my file on their end. It's incredibly cumbersome and takes about 2 weeks.
So many layers of inefficiency. And that's just one example. Real estate is just as convoluted. 
The amount of money that can be saved with the tech because it requires no trust is not something you can dial back.
Money talks. The savings will eventually win over everyone.

It would pretty simple to make a 'rewards' script. Every time a user spends from the same address (which would then be a feature), a certain amount is paid back to that address by some variable. Like every 10 times.

Someone need to invent a quick online converter/exhange that can be used to get bitcoin in less than five minutes. Just to have all the parts in place for this to escalate. 
If this is happening on march 15th and there's isn't an online instantaneous way to get bitcoin, then we will lose out on a lot of inherent propellant.

Connect your bitcoin wallet as a "card" in passbook, and pay everywhere where applepay is accepted. If you then set up a instant buy back on coinbase, you'd be perfectly set up to spend bitcoins everywhere.
And if two phones could send bits to each other via NFC.... you'd circumvent the whole bank think. It would literally be like cash. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:18:28
i figured it out. or at least it'd let me log in again. but it was something i did where i went to log in to the regular Coinbase, after having another tab of the exchange open. That just shut me out of the exchange. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:11:52
Will this crash the price ?
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:01:20

@_date: 2016-01-29 03:26:12
Just waiting for this to come to New York. My biggest worry is credit card fraud or someone scanning my card and suddenly all my coins would be at risk. I guess I should keep less coins with coinbase.

But others might make other crypto currencies that will outperform Bitcoin. Wouldn't that make it more like GeoCities ?
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:43:00
The easiest I've seen is ATOMBIT Wallet, which let you buy bitcoins with PayPal. It's not THAT straight forward though, and you have to jump through some hoops to make your first purchase.
You can download it on the AppStore. I would start with a VERY small amount, just to make sure it works, and then I would move the money off AtomBit to a wallet like BreadWallet asap afterwards.
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:22:56
let us know when you've watched it. is it good? worth buying?
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:50:01
i think the former. you can't kill a good idea.
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:16:37
doesn't this inherently up the value processed per day, if they start doing that on a regular basis? and wouldn't that by token raise the price?

@_date: 2017-03-13 07:00:17
So if it splits into two? Could someone write an FAQ about what the heck would happen?
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:11:17
I do remember the whole DAO debacle. Does segwit have a chance to activate before a possible BU split? It seems to adopt pretty slowly. And could it even get to 95% without the BU people's hashing power ?
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:42:21

@_date: 2017-03-13 07:05:34
What's gonna happen to price? What will happen to my coins on Coinbase in my wallets and on Gemini?
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:51:32
I'm no expert but I imagine just leaving your coins on both and let it play out would be the best course of action. 
I'm no fan of a split and I hope this whole thing blows over soon, but the benefit of a split is that at least the debate would be over, and we'd be able to move forward. 
It's gonna be interesting. Not sure I have the stomach for it but what the other guy said was probably a good idea. Drink some beers. Wait it out. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:25:00
i guess that's not too bad. What happens when you move it then? What chain will they be on if there are two? Just depending on what chain that's being mined at the moment?

Thanks for a very elaborate and succinct response. How long are the periods? That's all I haven't figured out until maybe exactly now.  2016 blocks? Why specifically 2016? Because segwit was conceived in 2016?

@_date: 2016-06-24 03:49:46
and the halving is like 2 weeks away. what are the odds of all these things converging?
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:49:06
I think vanity adresses actually could be a thing that spurs Bitcoin closer to the main stream. Imagine a URL shortener putting it's magic on a public bitcoin key, and then with some vanity in there too... your wallet that ANYONE could pay to could be something memorable, like: WernerHerzogbitcoinwalletadressZ0n294be
It happened with the world wide web, which was just IP addresses before.
I'm sure it'll happen to bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:01:14
He’s probably not wrong. As automation goes up, the value of time goes down since we will have more of it. And since we all will benefit from automation, except for being out of a job, money it self will lose value.

and why is the DAO dead? is it really dead? It was such a good idea. I just had an idea today, that someone should make a Ethereum version of a password manager. Something that can be truly trusted and absolutely secure.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:05:08
Should we worry that this would affect price ?
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:09:36
Thank you for actually being sensible and reading it for us. Doesn't sound anti Bitcoin to me either. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:51:06
yeah, that makes sense.
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:22:31
I'm at the conviction that recently prices tend to hover in 128 increments. Which means that either it drops to 512 or goes back to 640. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:10:32
i think it's that BitFinex keeps halting trading that's hurting BitCoin.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:21:08
I guess they haven't thought about it yet ? Seems pretty obvious to me. Maybe it takes some time to create new accounts on kraken and get verified or whatever. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:42:41
When? And what? Do you have any links?
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:19:30
What block size increase are you talking about ?
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:37:29
Cool. Look forward to it. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 06:00:08
Will bitcoin lightening be fast enough ?
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:03:49
Yeah like two plus years ?
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:08:36
6275. Smallest increase in a year since 2011/2012
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:11:47
Does Trezor allow you to make your own seeds ? Does breadwallet ?
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:14:36
Can you guide me through how to do this in Trezor. Or breadwallet? I don't see any function for this in either. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:17:37
What’s after ten?
@_date: 2017-01-21 05:23:25
What's BIP66? Is that a competitor to segwit ?
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:35:57
Are these the ones supporting it or the ones lacking supporting it?
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:31:47
right. true, that is very likely if the volume isn't migrating.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:54:31
would you, really ?
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:21:37
I guess that's good for the transaction backlog and the mempool issues?
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:13:25
What’s bat ?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:31:54
*RemindMe! In one year was 2017 the year of bitcoin*
Edit: I guess that didn't work. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:09:50
so like a bitcoin mining oven?
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:42:21
Yes it absolutely does. Whenever it goes super high it always falls back in line with the logarithmic growth since inception. It’s been infallible so far. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:25:54
You mean like a craigslist?
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:04:00
I feel they talked about it way long before they released it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:29:26
What's this site? Where do you see this progress bar?
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:49:42
I don't know. I'm an idiot :) thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:13:20
well the price is dropping like a rock now.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:30:48
so you have investors and you're running through a burn rate that will sustain you until you become profitable in 10 years?
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:12:56
Chinese traders can just move their coins to exhanges without fees. It's not like bitcoin is limited in its mobility. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:19:22
I didn't even know that you were talking about something actually in existence. Link?
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:38:37

Too bad it isn't his pick for the SEC. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:15:05
But won't SegWit Bitcoin be a shit ton faster with lightening network? I mean, billions of possible transactions per second, vs... whatever their hashrate and block rate is.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:51:18
I sold a bunch at $300. Kicking myself.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:07:13
Sounds good! I'll keep my eyes peeled on the blog.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:27:55
Don't look.
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:21:33
That last link didn't work. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:59:56
I think I did create a password. I should probably verify that.

I just downvoted to follow the locked in rules. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:20:38
I wonder how they will manage to keep the voting anonymous. 
Link to company with said blockchain voting solution for the lazy:

What’s ant shares ?
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:12:12
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:42:30
OK. It’s official. I love these guys. 
But.... what is their business model? How do they make money to run their business? The app is free. 
Do they take a cut for transactions?
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:54:53
The only other one I know is the bitpay one. I was just considering if it would be possible to make a service where you have your own wallet siting on a computer at home working as a server for a debit card that sends does the backend communications with visa?
So you have your wallet on your mac at home. Debit card in hand out and about. You swipe it in a deli. Server running on computer sells the amount in bitcoin, sends the money over the visa network in seconds, and the transaction at the deli goes through. 
Could someone make that ? 
Then you would literally be spending your own bitcoin that you held locally on your own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:47:38
For majority of people who don't have wallets or know what bitcoins really is. This would be for the main stream normal person market.

Can we make a new internet now, like they talked about in Silicon Valley on HBO? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:31:16
since you seem to know what you're talking about, I've had this idea to decentralized raw processing power over the internet via lightning, so you could literally rent out your CPU while you're not using it for bitcoin. Or vice versa, rent more CPU power when you need a faster computer, in exchange for bitcoin.
Is that a thing the lightning network could be used for? Obviously we'd be talking billions of micro transactions per second, if one were to sell processor cycles by CYCLE.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:09:30
not fast enough. With lighting network, yes.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:33:17
So how technically do I get my bitcoin cash out of bread wallet, without touching my regular coins?
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:16:30
Yeah if you mean the pin? You can buy a fresh Trezor and use the recovery seed to restore the coins. I think I made a password but I'm not sure. Is that for that? It can't be restored without the password that goes along with it ?
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:55:51
A snowballed sow call effect. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:39:50
Do we think the price will surge after it activates? It seems to be on a holding pattern right now.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:52:54
Amazing. Good to hear !
Now we are on the subject. You need a UI overhaul. 
Would you take a candid look at proposals?
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:20:51
who prevents double spending in the mean time?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:34:25
how did you do that? Did you send the bitcoin cash from bread wallet to Electrum, and keep your regular coins behind in bread wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:01:22
Cool. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:11:16
and Storj coin ?
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:25:34
So how do I take my bitcoin cash (without touching my Bitcoin at all) and move them to a Bitcoin Cash wallet? Can I just tell bread wallet to read another node, and keep both coins in bread wallet at the same time?
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:14:32
Can you explain how you did that ? I’ve got a bunch sitting on paper wallets, Trezor and breadwallet. 
I’d like to cash out a little bit. Could you do a guide ?:)
@_date: 2016-11-11 18:48:36
I'm seriously considering what the best practice would be to transfer private keys post mortem. Everything I can think of requires trust in a third party. 
It's a real problem that needs to be solved.

I'm expecting to see 800 within a very short amount of time.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:26:20
probably a good idea. You might start teaching bitcoin classes.
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:28:48
Haha. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:29:56
Yeah that’s more accurate. I have a wolfram script lying around somewhere. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:22:36
Yeah I'll have to look into this. It's infinitesimally small what I sold in 2015, but 2016 should definitely be reported. I guess it goes both ways? Gains and losses right? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:52:48
Maybe I should get a fidelity account. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 06:06:09
Is it being released as a soft fork now?
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:39:35
anything we can do to convince the miners that are on the fence about it?
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:32:54
If it's really so profitable to mine bitcoin in Venezuela due to government subsidies on electricity, what's to stop the actual Venezuelan government to pick up mining themselves as they control the electricity network in the first place? I'm sure they would cut themselves a good deal.
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:18:28
When will this come to pass ? I need it for my new bitcoin invention I'm working on.

@_date: 2018-06-06 02:08:38
Love these!
@_date: 2016-11-11 23:58:15
Something needs to be done to make that easier but that's a good solution otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:47:10
You're contradicting what another comment said. He said that it could only be reversed with a hard fork. Are you saying that miners COULD reverse segwit if they wanted to?
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:30:33
right. long confirmation times is the only thing I can think of that is annoying about BTC. But that will eventually be solved by the lightening network.
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:29:27
I'm expecting a lot will use bitcoin as a hedge in event of a market crash. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:54:36
I thought they only took bitcoin for hotels?
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:52:52
Why would new miners jump in as signaling percentages are going up? What would the incentive be? Rising prices?
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:15:16
I would absolutely use bitcoin to pay airbnb things. I don't use it that often. But when I do I prefer it. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 05:58:03
You could undercut people that take regular euros, because of the saved tax. That would be an incentive to the employers too.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:15:18
I would assume that the public keys would show the same balance on the Bitcoin Cash block chain. But where exactly that is viewable I don’t know?
@_date: 2016-12-22 05:26:29
That's reassuring, but do you care to elaborate a bit? Couldn't an ISP shut down bitcoin traffic if they wanted to, or slow it down to a crawl if asked by the new administration ?
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:15:14
It's almost like bitcoin is acting like the gold of the millennial(s).

My friend and I were discussing this the other day. Did the white paper come first, and then someone else started coding it, or was it satoshi that started the first mining’s and then others afterwards joined in and helped with the code?
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:24:56
Second round is if you have had income in bitcoin. The previous round was capital gains.
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:34:02
Ah ok. I had no idea. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:11:48
Would it do me any good to just delete my Coinbase account?
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:56:38
why did coinbase stop doing that? Isn't that hurting the adoption? Or are they gonna have something else in place?
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:18:11
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:13:13
Would it even help if I buy the 21.co bitcoin computer which can also mine and set it to mine on that pool? Will that contribution actually make even a slight difference ? Because if so, I may actually want to do that. I just have never done any actual mining before. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 04:20:52
calling @_date: 2016-11-26 03:44:02
Is that unexpected that they would join?
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:35:07
I still don't get why we should pay capital gains on a currency. Does this happen with other currencies?  If I buy a lot of euros and sell them again a year later for a profit, do I pay capital gains on that ?

I think it’s a half and half. Might actually be the connective tissue we need for onboarding people to cryptos. We’ll see.
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:21:58
I read somewhere that because segwit is a softfork, that miners could decide to roll it back with only 51% majority and then all the segwit transactions would be up for grabs for anyone to move. And because of that flaw, miners would be incentivized to do so. Isn't that a big issue, or is the comment I read wrong ?
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:33:11
Way back when Sandy hit, I remember reading something about an internet that would run between local nodes. Meaning that the internet could work by using peripheral devices (devices around you) as a means to find a connection. So for instance if the internet around you goes down, but everyone around you is running this alternate net on their phone, you can connect through them until you get someone with an actual internet connection.
I forget what it was called. Something something distributed something. But it was a clever idea. I wonder if we'd need to invent something like that? I guess, services like that could be paid automatically with satoshi's dependent on how much info you need rerouted through this alternative net.
EDIT: Basically if the government were to shut down the internet, we would be able to circumvent that and run on our own "local area network" between devices using bluetooth and wifi. Especially in dense cities, this could very well be feasible. Probably not very fast, but fast enough.
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:32:53
maybe that'd be a way to actually support the people you like on twitter. some easy way to 'tip a tweet'. I guess all you'd have to do is be able to add a wallet to your account.

They would make their own currency. So you can tip with just a click (a QR code requires too many steps). 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:16:39
I still don't know how to make a Segwit transaction, or how it's better? Is it faster and cheaper?

dollar cost average your buys. Meaning set up an auto buy so you buy in for a small amount weekly or something. Then you spread out your risk (and your gains) over time.

If I have mine in a paper wallet and on a Trezor am I screwed then if I just wait it out and see how things play out? Can I split or move them later, or will I be screwed no matter what ?
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:10:47
well are they working on something that would?
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:49:58
is that for implementing it into bread, or are you saying that you too are waiting for those features?
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:49:31
Will all these different apps be compatible with each other? I saw that other guys app called Zap the other day. Would this be compatible?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:00:25
what does this mean?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:22:12
and the evidence is in the committed GitHub code?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:18:39

I feel like we just witnessed the digital equivalent of a massive bank robbery. It was super well coordinated, and executed. Even if they didn't succeed with the plan of taking over the 'bank' so to speak, they would still get away with millions in profits from the inside knowledge alone.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:26:41
maybe it's false flag and supposed to make us turn off our core nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:58:07
not yet I think. but this is pretty close to something someone could manufacture. but again, the problem is trust.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:43:44
Which is basically illegal?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:36:40
But how are they gonna use it? It’s not ready to scale that fast yet? I hope at least they will be using SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:58:16
They are basically this close to making their own coin, which I don’t think is a bad idea. Amazon wouldn’t adopt bitcoin. Amazon would make their own token. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:02:09
This is gentlemen. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:43:01

ah, so you're helping the network by making your transactions in Segwit instead of regular transactions. Got it.

It wouldn’t really be hard to put some GPUs or dedicated chips into a thing like that, make it already configured for a mining pool. Basically a plug and play miner with the added feature of a space heater.

Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: A Story Of Prioritization &amp; A Healthy Competition In Money
As an offshoot of Bitcoin (BTC) known as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged past $2,000 this weekend, an influx of people reached out to ask the same question: Will Bitcoin Cash pass Bitcoin in terms of value and adoption?
Let’s look at the puts and takes of the two to better understand where they differ, my view on each, and why competition between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash is a net gain for the industry as a whole.
A difference in priorities
At the end of the day, the two are more similar than different but the major divergence between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) comes down to ranking of priorities.
In its current construct, design, and roadmap, the BTC community is focused first on keeping Bitcoin decentralized so that it can remain as a public, permissionless, highly censor-resistant network that anyone in the world can use and build on top of. Fast, cheap payments are a secondary priority.
In contrast, the BCH community is focused first on enabling fast, cheap payments over the network. The BCH community believes that by focusing on these features, BCH will onboard more people and this increased adoption will foster decentralization.
Blockchain Capital
Priorities- Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash
To be clear, both camps also want the other camp’s feature: So, the Bitcoin community also wants fast, cheap payments—but not if it risks Bitcoin’s decentralization.
Similarly, the Bitcoin Cash camp also wants to maintain decentralization—but believes this is a second-order effect of a widely adopted network that enables fast, cheap payments.
The difference all comes down to an order of operations: Which one comes first? Do people want to use Bitcoin because they can make fast, cheap payments or do they want to use it because it’s un-seizable digital gold?
At the end of the day, it’s a “chicken or the egg” problem and nobody can say for certain which should come first or which is the correct path—this is all new ground. Reasonable people can disagree as to which approach is best.
My view: I see more value in Bitcoin’s approach than Bitcoin Cash’s
My view is that Bitcoin’s (BTC) approach which emphasizes Bitcoin’s value proposition as a public, permissionless, highly censor-resistant network will prove most valuable. This is the amazing novel innovation that Bitcoin brought into the world.
Much in the way that the internet enables a public, permissionless, and highly censor-resistant network of information, Bitcoin is novel in that it introduced to the world a public, permissionless, censor-resistant network of money.
In contrast, the world has many options for fast, cheap payments. People rarely complain about the speed or transaction cost of their credit card or mobile wallet—it’s just not a big problem in the developed world today.
In my view, Bitcoin’s features as a public (anybody can use it), permissionless (anybody can build on top of it), highly censor-resistant (nobody can block your transactions), and un-seizable form of money all stem from its decentralized architecture. If Bitcoin loses its decentralization, then it’s just an inferior form of centralized institutions.
A fool’s errand: Competing with PayPal for fast, cheap on-chain payments 
The Bitcoin Cash community would like to compete with centralized institutions like PayPal to offer faster and cheaper payments. Ultimately, I see this as a path destined for failure, for the reasons below.
First, and most importantly, we need to consider the underlying architecture of a decentralized network like Bitcoin Cash vs a centralized network like PayPal’s. Both are essentially just databases.
When Bob pays Carol, PayPal simply updates its database—it is fast and cheap for PayPal to make this database update. In contrast, by design, Bitcoin Cash must notify tens of thousands of nodes (“databases”) around the world of the transaction, wait for them all to get in sync, and then ask all of these nodes to store the transaction record forever.
From a fundamental architecture standpoint, it’s clear that PayPal has an advantage for processing payments quickly and cheaply—to put it simply, it will always be easier to update one database (PayPal’s) than to update thousands of disparate databases around the world (Bitcoin Cash) and asking each to store the transaction forever.
Unbounded demand for cheap block space
Second, there’s unbounded demand for really cheap block space (cheap transactions). For Bitcoin Cash (and Bitcoin) to process an on-chain payment, the payment must be included in a block. There’s limited space in each block for transactions, so each transaction pays a fee to be included. In exchange for the fee, the transaction is stored on thousands of nodes on the world—forever.
There’s a real cost associated with processing and storing these transactions and people that want their transaction to be processed and stored by thousands of nodes should be prepared to pay for that feature—after all, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. But that’s exactly what Bitcoin Cash hopes to offer: a free (or artificially cheap) lunch.
The Bitcoin cash community would like to artificially suppress the price for processing a transaction (despite the fact that it has a real cost on everyone supporting the network).
My concern about this approach is that the cheap block space will be consumed as fast as it can be created so, in short order, we eventually end up with higher transaction costs anyways. Even worse though, in the process the network will have failed to appropriately compensate the people that support the network by running nodes and processing transactions.
If those parties aren’t appropriately compensated, they will not run nodes on the network, and Bitcoin will lose its decentralization and fundamental features as a public, permissionless, censor-resistant network.
Instead, in this scenario Bitcoin Cash morphs into a centralized network with only a few mega-nodes that process and store all the transactions—if so, we’re just back to PayPal or any centralized financial institution and we’ve lost what was novel about Bitcoin.
Instead of a public, permissionless network that enables censor-resistant transactions and un-seizable money we’re back to a model of gatekeepers that decide who participates when and in what form. That doesn’t seem novel, interesting, or empowering—it’s what we already have in the current banking system.

I wanna see the eventual movie about that whole thing.

It’s like saying there’s no underlying value in email which is why it is free.

How did you get the time to have a red squircle under it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:10:56
Do you know if there’s a way in nicehash to see or set exactly what you’re mining?

Connect to the internet and put in your public wallet address and stay warm in the winter while you’re earning money?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:05:53
I think it'll land around 4800 and go back and hover around 5 for a few days until it suddenly shoots up towards 10
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:48:25
Surely a hard fork would be implemented to fix that. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:38:23
Thank you for this guide. I’ll definitely run this on my synology when I get back to my server. 
Would this work on the black one with five slots in it ?

Encrypt my details with a private key I can make up. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:22:12
have no idea what he's talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:54:13
we need stamps for comments. bitcoin would be perfect for that.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:09:10
If they made their own token and that could be exchanged on regular crypto exchanges, I wouldn’t mind if they ran their own block chain as long as it’s public so everyone can see what’s happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:59:34
Well also think about the wasted opportunity to be at the forefront of technology by doing the opposite and adopting it country wide. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:42:22
So the rule is; after the fork. Don’t send bitcoins to other addresses than the ones of which you hold the keys. I like it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:31:04
Nope. The drop from 1100 to 236 was a massive 86 some percent.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:51:34
What are you predicting now?
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:39:34
You never printed out that bitcoin armory recovery seed thing on a piece of paper when you set up the armory thing?

Yay. Make it work on LTE too. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:41:57

@_date: 2017-11-12 01:15:16
I love this! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:16:52
thanks for explaining that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:00:59
More than 10% drop, I personally would call a correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:20:40
we need regulation for sure, otherwise this is gonna keep happening.

EDIT: Basically November 13th is a good thing for us?
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:38:58
AIs know how to read those.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:16:30
it sounds like a movie, which is the time line we are living in these days.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:14:57
I would think one reason to create your own coin as a company would be that you get to own your own currency that people use and can freely exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:20:48
I imagine amazon would let the users process their transactions (mining and rewards) in app to incentivize users. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:53:19
Yeah a little more restrictive post policies would be good. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:15:18
And that’s the key difference. That’s what would make people buy one. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:46:56
General rule with bitcoin. Buy on the way down, sell on the way up. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:33:43
Nice rig!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:27:39
Does that mean that it would be better to keep the coins on coinbase as they are easier to split there, or will I have an option to split later from a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:11:10
They usually make them themselves. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:00:05
If it’s really a cryptocurrency then it should be exchangeable.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:36:44

So right now it's actually a little over valued. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:41:42
i just want something that will automatically send the bitcoin to my wallet address.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:17:14
not sure what this would mean?
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:20:06
that's crazy amazing.
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:48:43
i think it will go to $2200 this time, and drop sharply to around $500...
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:01:34
I think so. But I honestly don't know, and I'm no expert. But if we imagine that SegWit blocks can hold 25% more data at least at first, then in that case 50% of the blocks would be containing a quarter more data, reducing the need for blocks to gnaw through the mempool.
But again, I don't know what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:30:06
This kind of makes sense. I wonder if ... if someone makes a proof of concept of that, if people would 1) use it. and 2) would it get popular? What gap would it fill? The unbanked, becoming able to buy services from strangers in other countries without ever having gotten a bank account?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:33:22
Who’s to say they don’t all turn on around 16th?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:50:29
Right I guess they can’t be allowed to get as hot as actual heaters without overheating and melting?
Couldn’t it just run with a few GPUs and mine whatever coin is most profitable? Like nicehash? With a good pair of GPUs a space heater like that could generate 10 bucks a day in profits. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:19:55
WHOA! mind blown... are you kidding? my money is INSIDE the passphrase of those 12 words? How the hell does that even work? That's crazy!.....

Oh good. Pretty sure I have a plus model. By the way, synologies rock. I wish I could mine on mine. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:43:12
when the price just kept going up and up... i would say that was "high fashion"

totally may. but the legacy that ICQ left behind wasn't just ignored. as you said, it laid the groundwork for a completely new technology.

i'm just not clear on how the 12 words are gonna help me recover my wallet? What if I lose my phone, download bread on another phone... will I be able to recover my coins using those 12 words, or do i need the file that was on my old phone?
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:14:40
wouldn't that cut the price in half? i guess with the halving coming up, it might actually cancel itself out?
@_date: 2016-02-08 10:25:01
That's a lot of pals to pay 
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:33:26
Well there's been a patch to fix it now. I assume that most miners are staying up to date with software.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:02:23
What WOULD ostensibly happen if 70% of the hash rate disappeared overnight ?
I assume confirmations and blocks would take a lot longer for a month or so? But if we had lightening activated by then, it might not even matter. ?

it's like people have forgotten how ridiculously complicated it was getting online back in 1992,
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:58:11
you mean; This is it, gentlemen?
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:55:09
so nodes that don't understand segwit wouldn't have segwit transactions that could be moved anyway. I guess that makes segwit fine :)
@_date: 2019-04-02 03:46:38
but it also no guarantee that it isn't.
@_date: 2016-02-10 05:45:54
hmm:  looks like it.
@_date: 2016-02-10 01:43:53
i'm trying to remember that there were some competing entrances to the world wide web. I believe GeoCities was a first attempt, and AT&amp;T had their own "landing platform". Even Apple had their eWorld:

Sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:57:06
I read your post three times and I haven't gotten a clue as to what half of it means. A core shill? I don't know any of those people you mention but I assume they are important in the scaling debate ?

How is that different in percentages since February 2018? How many were active then? where can one find this metric to keep tabs on?

now grammatically does that mean a singular bitcoin, or is the plural of bitcoin (the amount of coins) also just 'bitcoin', or is it 'bitcoins'?

@_date: 2017-09-25 05:22:26
Let me just say I love the word “bitcoinization”. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:12:50
Right. I think that's what I've realized. It's gonna be all these microcosms of economies. Everyone has an incentive to make their own coins, as it will be a more precise measurement of the value of a company than stocks ever were. Is the coin being used, then the value will be high. If the coins aren't being used, then the value is low.
And it's 24/7 and completely transparent.
Although I have no idea technically if Facebook would be able to keep their blockchain private or redacted in some way. When everyone can write their own coin, we may actually need a protocol for them to talk with each other?
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:45:17
Yeah some might be confused. “I thought we already did the segwit thing”
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:38:39
What about solar flares?
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:06:26
So the replay protection isn’t gonna keep us from being able to sell them?
I haven’t really looked into Segwit2x yet. 
Will the same thing happened that happened with BCH?
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:09:22
in 2020 this is gonna be all that people are talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:28:09
I still don’t get it. Even if they are able to dismantle/discredit bitcoin if that’s what their end goal is, another alt coin would just take its place. 
A good idea is like a parasite. Once it takes hold it will have changed you forever. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:31:02
It has a QR code but it states that it’s just the same as the root code above which I don’t believe is a private key. 
It says it’s one string of text that contains all the private keys, future and past.

It would be micro micro transactions. Like stamps for messages to people you don’t know. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:22:37
This one is gonna go to half of the previous low. So I'm still sticking with $3200 in my mind. Have no idea of when
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:55:20
Does that include electrum and Trezor ?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:57:27
Is this possible to do before the split ?
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:08:07

Bitcoin is like cats.
@_date: 2016-10-03 22:48:22
I think I just realized why they are actually doing it. They are doing it to move money amongst their own branches. Instead of settling with FIAT, it's fast to do it with a private blockchain. In that sense it doesn't matter that it's not a trustless ledger, but it matters that mistakes are impossible. I think I read somewhere that it will save the banking industry up to 20 billion a year.
I can see how settling fiat is probably slow as there are a ton of checks and balances to prevent errors. That's not needed with a blockchain.
Then they can settle at the end of the week into fiat, or month even.
@_date: 2016-10-08 04:07:02
Automates the whole process. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:38:17
if there's anyway i can help i would.... I have a few computers. Would it help running a node on each? or is it hashing power that matters?

@_date: 2016-10-22 14:11:58
I really believe that the utility of bitcoin is not gonna be human to human transactions but bots to bots transactions, which absolutely necessitates a network that can handle billions of transactions per second.
@_date: 2016-10-12 05:46:02
Nope.  Nothing physical. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:02:48
Well I guess there is no better place to start with bitcoin as a test for a national currency than Iceland. It's small in population. It's got a progressive government. And it's cold as fuck so they could do a lot of mining there. 
Perfect test scenario to run a country and switch currency or run it side by side to their current national currency. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 23:01:00
I imagine that Bitcoin would become the transitive currency in the public. So everyone would have their bitcoin wallet, to send between friends, and their bank wallet app.
@_date: 2016-10-08 04:48:54
Yeah I got confused. That's of course the FEATURE. that it isn't connected to anything. It should even run on batteries. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:39:01
they can only do 50,000 transactions per second. not even close to what my project would need.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:38:39
Where do I do that ? Sorry for being a noob here. Can you direct me to a pool I can donate to that will actually result in more hashing power ?
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:51:56
Is this the build that includes SegWit?
@_date: 2016-10-14 19:10:00
Thanks for the write up. That was helpful. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 05:27:54
As far as I've heard it would be to buy hashing power from a pool that supports core. But who and how, I have no idea. I wish to know this too so if anyone would care to elaborate and explain it like I'm five, I'm all ears.

Value of Pounds have gone down. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 01:33:43
I've been thinking hard about what the first break through to the mainstream would be for bitcoin. It seems to me there's a huge market in ATMs which enables people without bank accounts to send money to each other. 
I think it will hit a critical mass when you can expect a bitcoin ATM that both allows you buy bitcoin, but more importantly to SELL your bitcoin for whatever local currency. That would enabler a semi ubiquitous network of bitcoin ATM's to be a serious threat to western union and the likes. 
But I think the missing step is really more of a gap. A bitcoin ATM and a fiat ATM shouldn't be two separate devices. ATMs should be both. 
Someone would need to develop an upgrade kit to current ATMs that would allow them to accept bitcoins and pay them out. 
And yet again, someone would need to make bitcoin ATMs that also works with debit and credit cards and fiat. 
At some point the use of specific bitcoin ATMs and regular once will eclipse, and by then they will be everywhere.

This is where the lightening network that can do billions of transactions per second would come into play.
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:51:44
I haven't received any message. Would it appear in my PayPal account? I didn't get any email. Glad it wasn't a big amount. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:24:06
This makes absolutely no sense!   If there is a speculative attack by bitcoin users against a currency (let's say, the Euro), it would mean that people who hold Euros are selling them in large quantities to buy bitcoin (i.e., using their Euros to buy bitcoin).  This would only affect the exchange rate between the the Euro and bitcoin (i.e., the value of bitcoin in euros).  There is no reason it would have any impact on any other exchange rate (e.g. between the Euro and the dollar), and so it would be a speculative attack that would have no consequence for anyone other than bitcoin holders.  
The article uses quotes from the IMF about bitcoin becoming more important, and those points are valid.  But those quotes have nothing to do with any speculative attack, and the article weaves them into a story about speculative attacks as if the people at the IMF are worried about it.

How did you get to that this is the third wave 
@_date: 2016-10-11 03:17:25
I was thinking that in order to cast fake votes would be the same as double spending bitcoin, and in order to do that you would have to out hash the entire network which is basically impossible. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:48:32
How can I try this?
@_date: 2016-05-17 03:51:19


@_date: 2016-10-03 22:34:42
Is this significant: 
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:40:50
But what pool? And does that actually increase hashing power so the percentage can get above 95%?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:30:17


@_date: 2016-10-08 04:17:39
I think there will be a time where it would be handy to pass notes with bitcoin amongst people in the real world with a tamper proof way to make sure the private key hasn't been exposed. 
But maybe that's ten years in the future. Or maybe I'm just high. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:46:19
If this is not the perfect way to test and publicly show the strength of SegWit, I don't know what is.

Hey thanks! 
@_date: 2016-10-03 22:51:05
I think I understand what their motivation is. It costs a shit ton to move money between branches. If they can move them virtually and immutably in a system that makes mistakes impossible ... then they could dispense with the checks and balances that's been put in place in their system to settle a fiat transaction.
Read 20 billion a year somewhere.
@_date: 2016-10-08 04:36:55

Does that mean that I still have classic ether too still?

I really want Joe's coffee in new york to accept bitcoin: 
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:00:22
Is this only if you have bitcoin "with" you, like on your phone? Does this include Coinbase, which is basically like a bank account?

Lightening network ?
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:45:39
Yeah wasn't that like a whole obstacle speed bump?
Oh now I know why it's significant. It means that everything that accepts PayPal, technically accepts bitcoin.
If you don't have a bank account, but you have bitcoin and can fund a coinbase account... you can now pay for things that you could not before.
Who those people are, I don't know. But if there was someone that had that problem, there is now a solution. Maybe homeless people.

When the iPhone came out people claimed that 
     "it was nice and all, but no-one would be buying a phone that cost $500 and it was a short lived thing."
When the iPad came out, people said 
      "What do I need it for? It's just a bigger iPhone". 
When bitcoin went big, people were saying ....
     "It's not tied up on any real value. It's a bubble."
