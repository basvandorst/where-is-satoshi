  Portable low power satellite TRANSCEIVERS are currently a realty in a number of GPS units marketed  to the "adventure" inclined.  Could it be they are proposing a small 2 way SAT enable hardware device that could enable TX's from anywhere?   If they are, why not piggy back on the Iridium SAT system that already covers 100% of the earth.

Yes..  Bitcoin is the escape hatch for the financial elite.  They will/are embracing it before the inevitable collapse.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:52:29
They should use an Iridium 9522B L-Band transceiver for sending TX's from anywhere in the world. low power, no satellite dish, no pointing required...  I'm totally onboard with the block distribution via sat though..

BitFury is involved... So that gives this whole venture some credibility.  I hope they pull it off.

If it works anything like Dish Network or Direct TV "on-demand" services that pre-load movies on to a local HD, there are several streams broadcast.. one with the latest block and other(s) continuously broadcasting from Genesis block and other checkpoints in a loop.

This is great, but there is technology in use today by GPS manufacturers that allow portable, low power 2 way digital comms with the SATs, ie Iridium already covers all of earth.   Blockstream should focus on a hardware wallet like Case, but SAT enabled, maybe that comes in  the second phase?

thanks for the clarification.  Now what if segwit2x activates before BIP148, does it "cancel" it out?

Maybe it's time for a group of big whales and exchanges to throw 20 / 30 million into an alternate ASIC deisgn and take that monopoly away from Bitmain.

BIP91 does support Segwit.  I believe the difference is it has a lower/faster activation level (%80 hashpower over 2 days) vs ( %95 hashpower over 2 weeks)

Is it true that coin dance and xbt stat sites are using the block version to report on BIP91 status? Can this version number be faked or is it included in the block header?

Yes. if it locks in before August 1st, BIP148 ( UASF) will no longer fork. But there is still a possibility of a hard fork on November 18 (2x hardfork)
