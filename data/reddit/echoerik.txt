Not Exactly, I don't think I could have bought when I was 12.
Nothing magic about it going up. I'm ready to HODL.

Chill the fuck out. I was just happy that there was a dip when I was buying.

Cause they don't make an effort (why should I) to try to find out on their own with google. Which most of all their questions will give multiple good explanations. If they ask a more complex question that is harder to find a good explanation r/Bitcoin is happy to help.

If you read the article and you ask "I want to transfer something with my digital apple. Let's say it's a digital banana.
In theory could that digital banana have value?" Firstly, how the fuck are you transferring something with a Digital apple aka Bitcoin. That sentence does not make sense. Secondly, What the fuck is the digital banana? Its is A different concurrency? An actual Banana? I don't fucking get it. It literally makes no sense. So if you actually read the article and you ask a question like that I have no clue how to help you. Good Luck in life.

@_date: 2017-01-08 19:30:36
It's not even the googling its the asking question that make no sense and acting like it does make sense that bothered me.
