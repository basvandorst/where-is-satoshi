Pretty sure he's a troll.

Well, I've been holding for years - but there are certain points when it seems obvious to sell and then buy back in later.
I'm not talking day trading really, but the recent dip on the Korea FUD was a good time to sell everything and then buy in lower, for example.
**I'm not looking for trading advice**, i'm asking a specific question about limits.
ie I'm trying to learn more

Yeah, I wondered if there were specialist brokers facilitating large trades.

lol, I'm a LONG term holder, just wondering if I can trade large amounts on obvious bad news.

3 day old account. He's a troll.

How? I can only sell $5k worth a day. I want to sell $xxxk a day. Not to transfer to my bank, but to hold in escrow until I smell a dip.
Should I simply talk to the exchange and ask for a higher limit?

So the recent Korean FUD wasn't obvious bad news to you?
rofl indeed

Sure, and I'm just asking a technical question.
This other guy is being a bit of a dick tbh - he seems childish.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:35:31
The market is extremely skittish on bad news.
Anyway, **I'm not looking for trading advice**, I'm looking for technical advice.

Can't use it for trading here :(
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:56:22
Yeah, i mean selling with the intention of buying back in at a lower price.
If I could quickly sell my entire stack, and then buy back in with the cash, I could (potentially) make a fortune on the dips (or lose a fortune). This is normal when trading shares, but seems impossible with crypto.
I never mentioned withdrawing.

This is not a helpful reply.

Ever see this story?
