Socialism has done it's part in destroying the UK too. I'm in my thrities now, born and bred British and I've seen the changes over my lifetime. Totally destroyed families.

Today I bought 2000 GBP worth of bitcoins via localbitcoins. I arranged the sale yesterday, and meet the seller at an agreed location in Central London.
Buying 5000 GBP would be a piece of cake.

FinCEN has about as much legitimacy as the old South African apartheid laws that prohibited black people from entering skilled trades. It is as moral as the American Medical Associations original policy of banning blacks from becoming doctors. This is nothing more than the elites shutting potential competitors out. This is tyranny. FinCEN is another example of the medieval trade guilds formed to transfer wealth and power to it's members at the expense of non members.

I'm a British expat living in Kuwait. I have a nice little bitcoin stash tucked away on a second hard drive. I also know of a bitcoin miner who lives in Kuwait, I met him via the bitcoin talk forum. Are there only three of us?
It occured to me that mining in Kuwait could be a good path to take, worlds cheapest electricity in the worlds most air conditioned country.
I definitely game for a meetup group.

I looked into this, online quotes suggest 1KD to transfer to India. I didn't believe it could be that cheap so I discretly ran it by an Indian taxi driver who turned round and quoted me the exact same price.
Wealthy Western expats remitting money back home is a different matter though. I would suggest that market is more lucrative. just need a British bitcoin trader to partner up with. Anyone game?
