Ah okay so you are just adding to the network then.

For those with the popcorn watching from the sidelines.

I have no idea, I'm a btc noob, I'm just using common sense. If I had a fortune in BTC I wouldn't risk them all getting hacked by putting them on an exchange all at once. But yeah you should always minimize the time you 1. have your currency in an exchange, (because despite what people are telling you, there are tons of shady exchanges and wallets and people who want to take your btc from you, just look at Mt.Gox, $250m USD hacked LOL) 2. hold onto currency (like in real life currencies, holding onto a big investment is bad... I have some money in foreign currencies but not a lot, if you buy a bunch for speculation you want to sell quick).

Currency is clearly meant to be hoarded as a speculative investment... Who actually spends their currency? You fiat shitlord.

Gold does have real value as you mentioned. But it is almost facetious to imply it has any relevance to its value. Gold is not above 1000$ an ounce because people coat headphone jacks with it.

Also, no need to put all your coins on an exchange at once. If you have 1000 btc, you're not going to sell them all at once. I don't know their liquidity, but you would put as many as you can sell on at a time, then rinse repeat.

Bitcoin isn't an investment it's a currency. Everyone who "invests" in it is merely speculating. Buffet didn't get rich off speculation.

No it's not unless the currency you're talking about is gold. If it's fiat then it's not like that in the slightest.

It might be different where I'm from, but can't you be charged with obstruction of justice or something else if you fail to provide, for example, a password for a computer with data on it that is evidence? In the same way, wouldn't the bitcoins be evidence so Roberts would be compelled to provide the password to access them? Though, I'd probably rather be stuck with obstruction of justice than evidence of $80m in drug money.
