The price of Bitcoin is going up because of unconfirmed txs, so people can't get out

Thanks, is there a tutorial about how to configure a LN node over TOR that works only over TOR and it hides the open port if called via normal IP?

Which service and at which rates do the Bitcoin LN &gt; USD conversion?

Ethereum isn't digital gold, because the txs cost so little. Moving a premium top class altcoin like Bitcoin is more expensive because the gold is more heavy

More than 10 days ago I refilled my ADVcash credit card with Bitcoin, but the transaction got cancelled. They say I will be refunded, so I asked for a Transaction ID but they didn't replay back anymore :(
What can I do?
EDIT: added that ADVcash is a bitcoin credit card
