The difference between crypto and all of those is they actually had a real reason for regular people to use.
 The average joe doesn’t even know how to buy cryptos let alone be convinced to actually do so besides the reason to be able to speculate on the value of it—we need to understand 99% of people will never read a crypto white paper.  
Once they lose money speculating on it, they don’t return. Also, why would anyone want to use a highly volatile ‘currency’ to pay for anything? One day they can buy an apple for 1 Made Up coin and the next day this amount only buys .75 apples. What reason besides to speculate does one have to actually use this on transactional basis?
Electronic messages are faster, more reliable, more secure (depending on the usage), more efficient in ever way. Crypto is an inconvenience to work with the entire time.
Online streaming makes video accessible to all from the couch. It’s cheaper, it’s faster, it’s more efficient. 
I believe crypto’s place is going to be seen in use not in financial transactions per say but more incorporated into existing infrastructures and systems to improve efficiency—as we are seeing today.

Crypto will never replace cash. Industries will adapt to use crypto technology for other things but it will never become a currency, the barrier to entry is absolutely massive to become a currency in countries where the currency is worth anything.

So the more apps I download the more clickie coins I can make? Kind of like mining but better because I can use my Galaxy S2?

Sneaky bastards. i thought I was downloading $100K of bitcoins but now I'm sitting on $10,000 of low yield bond funds. Oh well you know what they say, HODL! Silly me.
