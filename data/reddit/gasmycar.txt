I think that's covered well in the Terms of Service. A lends 400 to B , who has 200, to buy bitcoin. B buys bitcoin at 600. Under normal circumstances B would get stopped out at down 33% and his remaining 400 would go back to A. But under this scenario if B's wallet was hacked, he effectively got stopped out at Zero. So now he's in defecit of 400. However he owes that to A, not to Bitfinex. So A is shit out of luck

For those affected.  .64 OR 0
For those unaffected .64 OR x, ((1-L)/(1+rt))&gt;x&gt;0, where L= legal fees (of both plaintiff and respondent), r= opportunity loss interest rate and t=time to resolution. 
I'd bet L=0.3 ($20m), t=5, r=0.05.
That make unaffected recovery .56

I just read the kickstarter terms. It is quite possible that a project to crowd fund the purchase would fall under their prohibited activities. 
However I have opened a ticked stating that I would contribute the initial $200k for a deposit (which is refundable). I have a US bank account which is also a requirement of the Marshall. I will let you know what I hear

So having made a nice profit on 796.com during the last week I had 25% of those profits clawed back due. The way the exchange works is that when traders are automatically stopped out the exchange closes them out. If the close out price leads to a loss which exceeds the margin amount that a trader has pledged , then all the winning accounts share the deficit. This protects the exchange and shifts the risk of exit slippage to the profitable traders. So while there was an open arb for a while it there was a large unhedgeable risk. The total socialised losses were over 2000 coins. This makes using this exchange fraught with risk. 
Any other experiences to share?

I don't have a solution in mind. I like what BitcoinCEO is saying. It seems to me that at some point one must simply "define" that the person who sets up a wallet, perhaps jointly with me, and proves he has control is de facto the owner. Ie even if bad actor routes the BTC via that wallet good actor essentially "owns" those BTC at that point. In fiat we know well who owns an account however nothing would stop such an owner passing off all his login details to someone else. Any liabilities  with that account however would be for the owner if such control was given over willingly.

When you trade on 796.com you select a margin amount which in turn determines the amount of leverage you are taking. So if you select 10% margin and deposit 10 coins you can trade a 100 coin position. When your position moves 10% against you (in this example) you will have consumed all your available margin. At that moment the system liquidates your position. In a volatile market the price at which your position is liquidated may be lower that 10% away from your liquidation price. They system will then incur losses as there will be insufficient margin to cover the losses. So they system socialises the losses among winning traders at the end of the weekly cycle. This last week the losses socialised amounted to 25% of profits made. I made 148 coins and was taxed 37 odd coins. This makes the 796 exchange extraordinarily risky and not fit for purpose if arbing to other exchanges. 
Any other experiences, thoughts or fixes to share?

kickstarter for example charge a 5% fee on successfully funded projects. it sounds like a lot, say $25 per coin, but I would plan to bid $100 below market - where, given the nature of this auction, I think one might get filled

Thanks for initial two comments. Le me take the problem a bit further. Let's suppose there is a "good actor" who you think you know and you are prepared to accept BTC from him. Having identified him, he tells you he is sending you BTC from his wallet. However he does not own that wallet, that wallet is owned by his accomplice, a bad actor who has obtained the BTC illegally or stolen them. When you ask for a message from signed with a private key the good actor tells the bad actor to sing that message - so deceiving you into thinking you are getting BTC from a good actor whereas in fact you are getting them from a bad actor

to answer the two questions from readyou and kryptcoin, assuming kickstarter would approve it. I would identify myself, I think i could demonstrate that I am a fit and proper person - I have a number of regulatory licenses. As to whether people trust me is totally up to them. If I were successful then I would simply distribute the Bitcoin in a secure way pro rata less any direct costs from kickstarter, legal services, custodian or escrow. I would detail and evidence these costs - they shouldn't be too much. I wont take any cut for myself

Interestingly the address which came back to me as "Bitcoin address" in the receipt shows as never have been used on Blockchain.info. I checked on my coinbase account and that shows "this transaction was done off blockchain with no fees".  I am not quite sure what that all means.  anyone?

Also disagree. This fund will have private keys for all the coins in which it is invested.

Can someone give an intelligent comment on this: what if the lower custom difficult on BCC offers better mining economics than a slower BTC fork that takes 2 weeks to adjust difficulty. Then as more miners go for a quick BCC buck, the additional hash power boosts price &gt; virtuous circle &gt; BCC wins ??
