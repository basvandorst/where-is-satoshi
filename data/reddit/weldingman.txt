does is matter what he did after he took everyone's money? No. The expression "took the money and ran" still applies, as no one has their missing Gox coins.

I think people are more worried about a Gox type thing happening because you don't control the private keys to your bitcoin.

Is english your second language? I'm not implying that he went to a track meet.

Does it not have escrow? And how do ebay and amazon prevent this? It seems like what you're talking about is just as easy with amazon (and indeed companies get caught leaving themselves good reviews all the time)

Gox didn't crash, the owners took everyone's coins and ran. No amount of security will save us if the owners decide to not use it. So it is perfectly fair to still fear unregulated business owners taking everyone's money.

they have an inverse relationship when you plot them on a price chart, but are independent variables.

He was actually using it in the sense of currency inflation. You are the one confused. 
Bitcoin, or any currency for that matter, will be [deflationary]( as long as the increase in demand outpaces the increase in number of coins. Bitcoin has been primarily deflatoinary it's entire life, and will continue to be so unless the demand drops.

well good on you! I gave you the upvote on that thread too. I'll read the whole thing and decide if you get to keep that upvote when I get home.

I wasn't even being condescending, you started this by nitpicking the applicability of the literal translation of a figure of speech that I used. That could have been because English was your second language. 
Now I'm being condesending because you were nitpicking my statement just to be a douche, and got butthurt when I called you out on it.

All of that has literally NOTHING to do with Gox-type concerns. Coinbase has great security when they use it how they say they do, but nothing can stop the management/owners from taking everyone's money and running. The only way to stop that is by purchasing your coins through coinbase and then moving them to cold storage where you control the keys. It's not even hard, if you're not "technologically inclined" enough to figure out how to send BTC to an address you just created then how the fuck did you buy BTC? It's harder to get verified on coinbase than it is to move your btc to cold storage.

probably not. I'm willing to bet that his person bought or mined their bitcoins in the early days. This person made a huge profit. Might even be Satoshi himself redistributing his bitcoins from his early miners at a time when the price was low? That would be some next level altruism but I like to think it's possible.

so... we stopped making them in late 2013 and then made a whole bunch of them in janurary 2014? 
Your logic doesn't make sense.
