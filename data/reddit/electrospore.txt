Ya online wallets are very scary. But also very easy. People will think they are like their online banking site but not realize there is no insurance / regulation protecting them. 
I think you over estimate the skill of a typical person when it comes to easy hell I know people in IT that still don’t know what a live CD is.
The hardware wallet is going to be a learning curve. Not screwing up paper wallets will be a nightmare for many.

Ledger Nano and TREZOR 18 to 24 English words for this reason.
Memorize the words or deal with storing them somewhere.

You are basically shifting functionality and ease of use sliders between exchanges, software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets.
**Exchanges/Online Hosted Wallets**
Pro: generally available online and from anywhere, thus highly convenient. Advanced features such as currency exchange and address randomization built in etc.
Con: unregulated and hold all your keys, could disappear or get hacked. You are not in control and it centralizes your decentralized currency. 
**Software Wallet**
Pro: you hold the keys, can be portable / smartphone app. You get transaction anonymity features like address randomization. Smartphone apps are highly convenient for face to face exchange.
Con: malware on your computer can skim the keys, you still typically need to backup / secure it with a paper key / phrase backup
**Hardware Wallet**
Pro: More resistant to malware, almost immune to online attack, you hold the keys, can be portable / smartphone app. You get transaction anonymity features like address randomization. Most secure option for someone who wants to both send and receive regularly.
Con: you still typically need to backup / secure it with a paper key / phrase backup, the actual device is protected only by a pin and a short set of trys. If someone sees your short pin or can guess it. they have everything. If you lose one of these it would probably be important to immediately restore to another device and move the funds to a new set of addresses based on new seeds. Needs a full computer or supported smart phone for many functions.
**Paper wallet**
Pro: you have the keys, they are offline, can receive funds offline as long as you are fine with the key being static.
Con: Convoluted multiple steps needed to create the wallet correctly offline and if you ever want to send funds. Paper doesn't age well, and some print can fade over a surprisingly short time.. Make sure you have a quality copy or a few in VERY safe places. This method seems to be only useful for long term cold storage.
Edit: I think hardware is recommended the most as many on here will assume a user will want to by and sell online, which it is the safest and easiest option for doing.
Edit2: more on exchanges / online wallets.

In hardware wallets  or they deal with the security provided by the software wallet.

I think a better way of putting it is: 
Your coins move from an address where the exchange holds the keys to an address that you hold the keys to. The addresses are part of the block chain and always part of the network.
The ledger ensures that the KEYs are never directly seen by the computer or anyone.
Your ledger keys are generated by the master 24 words you get generated when you first set it up.
Essentially these 24 words become the KEY to all your future KEYS stored on the ledger. If anyone ever gets ahold of those 24 words they have access to everything you stored via the ledger.

Then you do the smart thing and migrate it to the latest secure platform when this ones starts to get near end of life.
Technically the recovery words ARE the master seed to all keys created by the hardware. You can use the seeds on some software and other hardware that uses the same generation method.
The hardware is just a safer way to use the keys semi online.

TrueCrypt hasen't been supported or updated since 2014 and is not recomended for use.. There are alternatives now.
The truecrypt site states:

The general public is important for wide spread adoption. You can’t be picky who you want to use your currency or there is no point.

Accept you don’t want to half ass or stumble though security. 
I know many people that are generally incapable of assembling a computer reliably or in a reasonable amount of time. They don’t want to learn that. 
So if you want crypto currencies to take off they have to both be easy and secure which is a hell of a challenge.
