@_date: 2018-01-29 11:58:24
is there a way to lock time a bitcoin adress(for exemple 1 year) to only be able to send funds to one specific adress? and if not moved from in 1 year the condition will be canceled, but during 1 year if i want to move my bitcoin i only can send it to that specific adress.
If this is possible i would like to know how to do it.
thank you

“We should stress that, as money, cryptocurrencies should have low expected returns in the long run, despite their high returns recently. Digital currencies should be thought of as low/zero return or hedge-like assets, akin to gold or certain other metals.”
Before this we need to be at 2 Trilion+ market cap

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:44:29
if we all hold 100k its super easy target for 2018! if theres almost no sellers and only buyers for such a limited product just imagine how far we can go in price.
Remember theres almost 40 milionaires in all world for less than 16 milion bitcoins today 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:08:21

@_date: 2018-05-18 13:40:41

lets take this dissertation to the MOOON
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:34:02
is it possible to send less than 1 satoshi via LN ? or 1 satoshi is the minimum requirement?
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:51:49

@_date: 2018-05-17 16:16:36
where is this come from ?
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:49:33
Dont waste your bitcoin buying PIZZA! you are crashing the market !
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:20:19
if bitcoin goes from  8000 usd to 1 usd ..trust me thats worst than 0 for most of us
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:32:32
Can we send 0.1 satoshi via LN ? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:35:24
for those waiting for the dip this is great news for bitcoin. Nice red day everyone
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:01:56
i prefer use a currency that gives me more purchasing power  day after day then a currencie that burns every day i hold it in my hands
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:36:26
there people waiting for 7k also
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:12:29
thats kinda cool. every shop sould do the same till it gets viral!
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:14:09
everyone is saying crypto will go to the moon! is this where Humans will be very wrong about predicting the future?
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:38:40
I repeat : I prefer to USE a CURRENCY that gives me more purchasing power day after day then a currency that burns every day i hold it in my hands.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:41:28
right now bitcoin is not for everyone. but you can be sure that there are some % that dont have the same opinion as you for their own reasons. And are this people that day by day wil make bitcoin more stable year after year and that will bring more people in that can handle with less swings until it gets the same volatility as a fiat currency
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:51:31
i will buy more bitcoin! i am falling in love day by day
@_date: 2019-03-28 04:15:19
dumb people will always buy the big TV like me. you cant assume people would not spend like crazy on a bitcoin economy.
Also most of us here would bought a fucking LAMBO if we go to 10 milion BTC. Do we really need a lambo when an used FIAT can do the same job?
But you are right, this would kinda solve the over consumption that we are living today.
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:40:22
You might be correct saying that theres alot of manipulation on bitcoin transactions/volume whatever. But bitcoin itself is not a scam. No one controls bitcoin. And even if there are some guys waiting to dump their coins (even satoshi) they can only do it once.
Hope i made my point clear to you and that you dont miss the biggest oportunity in your lifetime.
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:24:50
welcome to this awsome game. BUY BITCOIN!!!! NEVER SELL
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:17:05
of course
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:58:50
I feel sorry for you not being able to have some % of your portfolio in liquid assets like money. But most of people here work and have savings acounts. You can hold bitcoin as an investment right now, because bitcoin is not used as a currency by mainstream, and if you expect it to be some day, it becomes a YUGE investment. Good luck trying to buy bitcoin with your fake bills when bitcoin becomes the main currency.
More demand for less supply year over year, thats been the trend. Only a fool would not put some on this trend. Odds are pretty massive right now
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:06:43
I am buying SP500, only a fool would be 100% on bitcoin. thats an active bet, and in long term ative trades pay the price. I am diversified : 33 % sp500,33% bitcoin and  33 %bonds are my bets for long term. If bitcoin goes wrong i still have sp500 and bonds to back me up.
@_date: 2019-03-27 02:44:56
this time i will sell because i expect a dump like every single time i see a post like this.
but you migh be lucky because when i sell the market pumps.
@_date: 2019-03-14 14:20:31
im not a bcasher lol
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:33:14

when i have fake bills i  try to use it as fast as possible the fake bills first.

ok you are on dumb level again. 
Im done.
@_date: 2019-03-30 03:31:14


thats not true at all
@_date: 2019-03-13 20:13:22
does it matter if someone has more money than you when everybody is getting a better quality of life?
Also, thats not the quantity of money you have that will make your costumers keep consuming your products.
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:12:25
Are you really that happy? wtf. i never saw someone telling on internet how happy he was when bought 3900 usd worth of X stock. cmon...it smells like a fake story just to pump your bag
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:38:13
LN can do it
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:30:41


i repeat, stop assuming a fantasy world and give exemples from real world. 
your post is all of it a fantasy world...jesus. Do some math. A bilionaire will spend like a FUCKING BILIONAIRE. if he spends more than his wealth gains in purchasing power every year, he must work to keep being a BILIONAIRE.  Its human nature to want more and more. Stop being an idiot who doesnt do shit for his life and think that every winner in life is like you. This guys work because its their passion, money is the result of that passion.
@_date: 2019-03-14 20:10:06
Bitcoin and SP500 are safe investment. We need to balance and not only go all in bitcoin.
Just look at the goldbugs, they been talking the same since 1980 ( i used to read about them back in the days). Banks are not stupid, they know better then all of us what they are doing, they also know that people trust the dollar and i dont see it change it in the next 10 years.

thanks for the detailed answer. now i really get it.
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:43:03

LOL. money speaks for Warren Buffet. If he is beting on banks, he has his reasons to think they have more value in long term than bitcoin. Theres no reason for him to explain to people why bitcoin doesnt work.
PS: Im short on banks. but i dont think Warren Buffet is more stupid than me.

Tech is deflationary, and look at the lines 24 hours before of every fucking Iphone release.
What i mean is, people dont need an incentive ( taxin their money at 2% a year) to spend, people will always buy things that they really want. and more purchasing power means more spending/investing also.
You need to educate yourself about deflation. theres a really good youtube video for that. I will post it here :  [

I prefer to zoom out bitcoin chart for the same time period to get my conclusions.

The good thing is that it never happened, and as an open source software anyone can review the code and help it. And i belive theres more good guys than bad guys, and even the bad guys need the power and the luck to got this inlfation bug work without anyone knowing.

People always want more. by doing nothing you gain less ( like 0.5% per year) then doing anyhitng else ( business/investments can gain 10% per year). So thats a stupid assumption.
Also if the most rich person on earth stoped his business, like Rockfellers, that would give oportunities for other people to take it over. And most important, they cant eat their deflationary currency, they need to spend it to live ! thats more money injected to people who want to work
People need stop to think in exemples from fantasy world and put their assumptions on how the real world runs.

@_date: 2018-10-29 02:55:40


If this happens this is bullish news for bitcoin. Because people would prefer to use a cryptocurrency that they can control and not one that is controlled by governament 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:05:12
i get that 1btc has another purchasing power in 20 years from now. but if you dont do nothing in 20 years and 10 bilion is only what you have left,  you need to spend it to survive. so in 20 years you would have less than 10 bilion, even it that would have more purchasing power you would have less money that went for another person pockets. that thing/person was saying that he was geting more money all the time in a deflationary system without doing nothing.
to finish, everyone benefits and it doesnt matter if someone has more purchasing power than you if your life quality is getting better and cheaper every year. if you want more, you must work like eveyone else. in inflationary system its harder and harder to have a good quality of life, and only those in power can benefit
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:28:47
I would never decide for milions of people what currency to use as a national crypto even if i had the power to do it. i would let people decide for themselves. Only the market can decide what is the best sound money to use, not someone from above!
And you talk about control. what control do you have over USD ? do you know the inflation rate for the next 20 years? hmm i think not. i can tell you exatly the inflation rate of bitcoin :) now you have to think...where do you have more control and power? with bitcoin/math or paper currencies/shitcoins?
Creating their own crypto its the same as create another fiat currency. People from governament wants to controll the money supply thats why they decide to create their own shit coin, that they can print out of thin air for themselves. They are not doing anything new with that decision.
@_date: 2019-11-07 00:04:22

@_date: 2018-10-27 14:59:51
You are wrong when you tell people cant decide what currency to use.
Bitcoin has properties that fiat will never have. If i want to send money to any country of the world in a matter of seconds/minutes any day of the week i will have big limitations with fiat. 
Also if i want to pay some service or good in multiple nano transactions i cant do it with fiat, and i can do it now with bitcoin.
My money will never be confiscated or censored if i use bitcoin, but i expect that from fiat.
And of course, bitcoin is deflacionary, while fiat is inflationary and will go to 0 in long term like every other fiat currency in the history. What do you think people would prefer? A daily burning currency or bitcoin that gets you more purchasing power every day ?
This is just a few exemples why some people/bussiness in a country would opt in to use bitcoin and push others to do the same.
Market can decide what is best for its economy and not a guy in a governament. Of course he can tell fiat is the legal one, but if people prefer to use bitcoin, they will use it! and theres nothing governament can do about it.
You talk like you are an expert in the field but it looks like you cant see away further from the present. Of course right now bitcoin its not preferable over fiat. People are with too much fiat right now, and me and most of people are using the bad money first while holding the good money.
Thats whats happening right now all over the world, and when theres no more fake money or when people start to not trust the fake money then bitcoin will rise strong and be accpeted as the main national or market currency of the world. Thats a fact and history proves it from many exemples of our human history

if bitcoin gets mass adopted its going to be stable and it would be used as main currency. no need to have a shitcoin for each country. if i was selling from Spain to a G10 country i would only accept bitcoin and not a shitcoin from that country.
PS: it would be more stable than USD when mass adopted, and unlike USD that only goes down bitcoin would be up in purchase of power every day

LOL. I say it will work for fundamental economic reasons. But no one knows :) only people can decide for themselves what do they want use as money. If a shitcoin or sound money like bitcoin.
And guess what! If bitcoin finds to be the chosen one the volatilty goes way.
We only have fiat today as main currency because of laws that protect it. Let technology do its work like its being hapen since the rise of Internet.

its good to know that everyone thinks bitcoin is going to top at 100k and drop to 50k.
since people are 90% of the time wrong, the most possible out comes will be:

People are thinking that when coinbase allows BCH there will be a dump ! i can tell you that if price is over 1k and pumping while bitcoin is going down i bet you that this is BULLISH for bitcoin cash!
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:17:57

dont listen tone vays, he is geting paid to spread FUD. Bilionaries are geting into this game and they dont want to pump it hard while they are buying into this thing.

Dont dump it at low price ! BCH has a lot of pottential ! miners know what they are doing when they cancelled BT2x. They know bitcoin will not have LN soon enough. I can see months of upside for Bitcoin Cash!
Bitcoin is done for the year.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:38:48
this is nice on words, but money speaks LOUDER! Bitcoin cash is the mid term bet ! huge sell wave coming this month on bitcoin. Be ready!

in 10 years? dont think so. might be the case for a bigger time frame
I would like to add that a 99% of 0 usd for bitcoin and 1% for 1 milion BTC its still a 100usd +ev bet assuming you invest 500 usd right now
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:25:35
no one can predict the bottom but when theres alot of hype for an event the price drops. it happened last halvening and at the open of every future tradind plataform

crash will come a day or two before fork.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:59:15
LETS PUMP IT HARD !!
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:50:49
that doesnt eliminate the risk of losing all money on that transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:00:04
You saying that because of price going up ! ignore the price and get ready for the attack, because it is comming with full power !!

you will get tested this week ! potencial BIG drop in price coming for this  fork ! Gl
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:47:00
are we going down to 1k? Mr Novogrataz say we have battomed out !
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:30:18
this fork is completly different from last fork ! last fork was created a new alt coin. in this fork without replay protection there is going to be a FIGHT for the real bitcoin !
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:01:26
sure, it will be their last strategy though
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:58:50

dont care its just stupid go all in in crypto and dont hodl stocks, thats a moron bet that only poor people make
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:02:09
i am not talking about the price ! thats another problem with bitcoin. people think too much about price
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:56:05
The damage is done ! BTC wil take months to recover from this attack. The true strength of BTC will be tested on this next months. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:11:38
they want newcomers to buy while they are selling it
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:09:56
why you think that?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:14:24
BTC is done! CME already priced in, LN delayed to 2 or more years.
And when people realise that CME Futures could be used by bilionares to crack down the price and profit from it bitcoin might go to 1k again !
Sell it while price is really good !
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:07:08
actually it was not 1% of the world. it was more
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:20:04
because an exchange can shut down at anytime, they arent safe for hodling your coins.
in my opinion the best move is just to dont hodl any BTC during this mess. wait for the fork and then re-evaluate. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:15:08
i think the saffest way by far is just dont hodl any coin till fork! no need to take an huge risk when i cant see bitcoin going up during this mess
@_date: 2019-06-15 09:56:53
tell me

dude, no one expected that, but 50k and 100k everyone talks about it now because of the insane run to 20k...so it will not happen. if we hit 20k again its an insane number already. i hope it happens , but dont dream about 50k or even 100k. thats delusional

BCH was not an attack to kill bitcoin on first strike.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:30:05
most people dont have more than 100bucks to buy crypto, why should they care about investing in a cold wallet that is more expensive than the BTC they bought?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:59:35
if you can buy an house with 0.1 btc, 1 BTC is alot of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:06:54
The dev delay is not an attack !
An attack is what BCH is doing because its taking advantage of the delay. When bitcoin gets LN its GG for BCH :)
Talk to me in 1 year from today 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:52:08
If the post is to take down on BCH its all fine on this channel :D
guys when you need to take down on a coin to promote bitcoin it means that things are getting fucked up for bitcoin side !
I am a huge bull on bitcoin long term, but mid term i am getting the fuck out off this PANIC!! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:21:04
so why you say bitcoin miners want the best for bitcoin future?
i think you kinda answered it saying that they invested milions on equipement and then they must be doing the best for bitcoin. But the real fact is they just do the best for themselves and not for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:43:34
what a fuking boss !! i am doing same thing with a 10k loan !

I sold it yesterday at 7300 ! i think i m done with bitcoin for a couple of months. this is looking really bearish to me.
LN is dealying for several months now, CME Futures already priced in! there is no more bullish news to come! i think we going down for rest of year. Gl everyone

@_date: 2017-11-07 14:33:10
you are doing it wrong! sell it all now. wait for panic/ bad news and buy it all again. thank me later
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:40:19
no, thats stupid, i already have that with eletronic cash. look at gold. it has none of that properties and its market cap is at 8+ trillion.
it just needs to keep decentralized and runing 24/7, those properties will be built in third layers like we have today with paypal per exemple on eletronic usd.
1milion per bitcoin sounds crazy but in theory its possible. Though i think 50k is almost a garantee if bitcoin network keeps working like it has been for the last 10 years. If not, zero (close to dead) is the other side of the coin.
PS: the more governaments go crazy with their policies for limiting privacy and liberty on peoples money the more bitcoin will rise in price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:12:48
PUMP THAT BITCOIN !!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:14:05
this is crypto ! Miners are constantly trying to take down on bitcoin! this fork will be their last and strongest strike for this year ! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:13:43
Person A has 20 bitcoins worth $10,000 total.
He buys mining equipment and now has 0 bitcoins. He plans to use this equipment to mine Bitcoins.
Why would he want the new Bitcoins to be worth less? Why did he spend $10,000 worth of assets to buy equipment that can mine Bitcoins?
1- he can easly make money on exchange buy manipulating the market(talking about big mining pools like Antpool)
2-he wants to profit from fees! mining is geting alot harder and core wants to implement LN that will take almost 90% of profits from fees.
3-They are business man, they  didnt invested 10k USD they invested milions that they want to capitalize as fast as they can !
I´m done for the day! 
Dont sell LOW !!!

Are you a US citizen?

@_date: 2019-12-21 03:57:36
Are you an hodler of last resort?
@_date: 2019-12-21 04:03:57
it will not reach 100k at 2022, because most of reddit hodlers will try to not repeat the same mistake at 20k. They will make a massive sell before hiting 100k. from 7k to 100k thats an huge profit
PS: and dont forget that most of guys who made the mistake of not selling at 20k might had a 25x, but at those times their investment was alot smaller. Today they might have in USD value the same amount that they had when bitcoin was at 20k and they will be happy with a 2x or 3x.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:29:11

For safety reasons its better take out your coins

@_date: 2019-04-15 01:31:39
If bitcoin ever hits 100k its a dumb move to sell it for USD. I would never sell BTC, i would use it. I wish i could ever hodl 1 bitcoin, but thats almost impossible for me. Its at fucking 5000 usd ! thats pretty insane if you think about it, people dont even realize how big bitcoin already is. and as a deflationary asset, this only goes up and up (assuming more people would want BTC)
@_date: 2019-04-24 14:22:04
if they pay the fees, its fine for me. of course i would prefere that they dont make a spam but if to change the code for less spam the bitcoin code becomes less secure i prefer that it stays like it is now
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:33:59
the problem is that they dont buy bitcoin, they buy USD. they dont have money, the last thing they need is another volatile currency, so they go for the USD.
Sorry guys, you can downvote hard

if you are here for short term profit the best advice is forget about invest in bitcoin. If you are here for long term investment just buy right now because the best price is always yesterday every single time since 2009.
And if you came here asking for this kinda of question i advice you first to learn about decentrelized money, and keep way from puting any dollar in BTC because you will insta sell if bitcoin goes down
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:09:07
lol u expected to go to 1k today? cmon
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:25:38

@_date: 2019-04-03 22:31:47
What about making sure CB has the reserves? We need to take all of our bitcoins all the time. Its also heps pumpin the price because forces CB to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-24 03:37:31
scarcity. more people learning about money brings more demand for bitcoin, because bitcoin is the only hard money. better than gold
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:05:22

people sometimes say bitcoin is like a ponzi because there are guys like you triyng to dump the bitcoin on someone later. but you can only do it once. then you have 0 bitcoins and you are risking everything on the dollar (assuming you sell all for usd).
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:57:57
this sould pump bitcoin  + 1k usd.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:00:56
no one cares about china ban anymore.
now they ban it and bitcoin pump. crazy times

Yes TA is Bullshit, and no one makes a living profiting from tradings. The profit come from comissions, selling scam advice and so on.
Warren Buffet made a 1 milion dollar bet 10 years ago that no one would beat SP500, and he won. theres not a single  person who beated the market in 10 years of a sample !
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:13:55
thats a life time for me. but i will be watching prive every day and decide
@_date: 2019-04-01 20:10:57
try harder. BTC keeps moving up. And the funny thing is that we experienced almost an ATH on transactions last week and fees were less than a pennie. So your argument is not valid
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:52:54
hahah. what a scammer you must be to not acept 2500 usd bet :) you can also claim 1 milion from warrent buffet why dont you do it ?
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:10:23
WOW. this is HUGE.
6.5k end of week for sure

HEy Hey Hey !!! 
Thats a scam!!
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:49:23
yes, i belive if bitcoin suceed it will lost its volatility. but you are missing the main point. people without money dont want volatility. So in argentina people in hyperinflation go into USD, not in Bitcoin.
Sorry to desapoint you with some reality about argentina
PS: same hapen with solar power, only enthusiast people with money will invest in such expensive new technology, like it hapens on Bitcoin.

you can always buy 1 satishi. but you seem to be a complete noob on the space. so my advice is learn more before investing any USD.

LOL. no one knows because there arent any. Its a fact and theres big databases from Wall Street that can prove it.
And there are on internet hundreds of guys who claim that they beat the market, and no one claimed the 1 milion dollar bet :D wake up bro
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:47:48
I would make a bet for less money. you are betting 1 milion because you know i would never acept. dont be a child and bet 2500 USD !I would go all in easly.

@_date: 2018-11-06 16:05:25
people will learn that a new rally like 2017 will never occur again. but it will take time. 3 years from now and i bet price is still between 10k and 6k ;) hold your bags, but you have to know that the money you will make it will be for your grandsons. thats how much time will take to get the price that everyone is dreaming to occur in next year lol

@_date: 2018-11-20 21:12:12
theres must be someone buying at current price for sure.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:19:28
actually theres alot of people. in % is just a small number of course. just think about it...i would prefer to live in a rented house for 5 years while having a bunch of bitcoins. i hope it goes to 1k, but i dont think it will. 3k maybe. and i will not sell my house at 3k. but i will save alot of money every month to buy it at those levels
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:55:07
yes it will. and for me its greater than my other investments.
its not fud, just facts
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:53:12
yes they realize that! thats why they are working with crypto. Do you think you are smarter than this lords? wake the fuck up
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:46:57
Who is founding lighning labs ? whats theis monetary incentive on working full time for lightning labs assuming theres no one founding them. do they have revenue ?

 i will sell  half of my bitcoin today also because its going down. but at same time i wish it goes up because i will have my other half 
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:06:53
it depends. if 1 milion only buys a pack of cigarrets i am not fucking selling it
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:08:36
thats why nobody is hodling...people are waiting for bitcoin to go back to 10k levels again before thinking about buying it. its a safer bet and a less stressfull one
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:39:36
if bitcoin goes to 99, 999 usd i dont mind eating my dick

there is no newcomers, all the fomo guys got rekt and they will not come soon. its also good for bitcoin that we hold this 10k for 1/1.5 years.

Is this 100% true? Or it can be manipulated? I am asking this because people is happy about the number of transactions on chains of bitcoin being on an uptrend for 2018, but this could be a couple of guys just sending it to each other just to increase the number of transactions.

@_date: 2017-09-01 23:37:27

no way it getx 5x with ETF approval! do your search
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:53:11
ok but if some bitcoin is tagged as stolen bitcoin even if you trade it for monero the person who got this stolen bitcoin is fucked! the guy who stoled bitcoin is now anonym ok, but the bitcoin itself is going to be forever taged as stolen coin.

if there wasnt a fork comming price was 2x this month! i m all in bitcoin!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:30:17
now i get it. if i have to worry about an attack like this on bitcoin most other major companies and banks would get in trouble first! what i mean is if someone has such power to take down internet itself it would never focus on bitcoin that has such a small market cap.

"As for channel factories, they're nonviable as a scaling solution because:
- They can be attacked, flooding the chain by forcing everything on chain. How do you attack them? You join a payment network and go offline. Anything that can't stand up to a simple, cheap attack is worthless. You still need the chain capacity if you don't want bitcoin slowing to a crawl and freezing up for weeks with backlog of transactions any time anyone decides to attack you. 
- An attack isn't even necessary - an internet outage somewhere (there have been a few major ones every year) can have the same effect. Reliability is going to be very low.
- Cost is unreliable. Multiple things will often force you on chain, at tremendous cost as bitcoin scales. You don't know if you'll pay 1c or $50 for your $30 transaction, and have no control over it.
- They can be spoofed
- The DDOS problem isn't solved and doesn't appear easily solved (this is separate from the issue above)
- Mainstream users aren't going to accept flakey solutions that require constant work adding and funding different channels. There's a chicken or egg network problem here, a bit like FB or MySpace, but a lot worse."
Is this true ?
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:45:35
want a really good advice?? buy more 3 at this price ;) thats the way to win on this game. if you dont have the balls to buy more when you got the opportunity you need to sell right now and never thinking about investing in bitcoin again.
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:28:43
this means they are selling right now. be carefull.

i remember guys like you on 2014...they all got depressed and there was a story of one guy that killed himself because he couldnt handle the fact that he lost a 50 million oportunity during 2017 bull rise because they sold it on the bear market.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:43:43
I am here to sell only when bitcoin hits 100k+ and i know this will only be possible in 10 years+. so right now i just want this coin to dump hard for me to be able to buy more.
Am i the only one thinking like that?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:19:19
we need bitcoin to go to 3k and then we buy like crazy that cheap coin

As a noob trader i think this should put BTC in high price again because people that have shitcoins like Ripple,ICO´s,Potcoin....can trade it to BTC before 1 of August and double their coins and buy back again their shitcoins. what do you think ?
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:00:37
this is against 53%+- Euro and euro is on upswing and in long term euro is going down faster then dolla, so this post is useless
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:14:02
i sold my bitcoin now with nice profit. i knew it market would dump shit coins for BCC before 1 of august. now i think they will realize that BTC is too high and will get cheaper at 1 august and its better put it in a coin like ether to make more profit when btc goes to ~2200 because of BCC ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:49:19
i can afford to lose some money ;) nice comment btw
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:22:14

its the same for today. no one knows. looks like most of us here know are like 90% sure we will go to 100k and beyond just because btc hit 20k before, but if that even happens it will not be in 10 years. and if in 10 years we never go past 5k i bet most of guys who hodl on their own wallet they will lose their bitcoin like the guys from 2010.
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:51:41
i dont believe u did, you are a hodler and inside you are scared as fuck. dont worry i will join this war at 1k. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:31:13
the amount lost it by people who lost their keys, hard drive, paper wallets is really high. i think no one can say if its bigger than gox, but it could be if you assume satoshi lost it too and their family will not have acess. and if it was on coinbase her wife could have it
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:46:17

inflation is bad for the economy. boom and bust economy is not good for anyone.
Also "deflation incentivezes saving", after saving comes the spending, investing and all the goodies that the economy need without creating stupid bubbles like we see on a cheap money economie.
You need to learn some basic economics because you sound like keynes, witch was a complete idiot
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:36:09
he will never admit, because he makes money keeping with the same stand at bitcoin. There will be always people to listen him expecting him to say bitcoin is better than gold. He got paid alot for speaking on this show, thats a profit he will never had if he admited bitcoin is superior to gold.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:12:51

Go check how many wallets from 2008-2012 that dont have any action even when we went to 20k last year. you can assume they are real holders but most people will not belive that when we had segwit and bcash fork. at least they would move it to another wallet. wake the fuck up and learn from your own reasearch
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:36:58
vegeta in the end would be better. we need to hit 9k first of course
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:11:58

@_date: 2018-12-05 16:20:55
while we have so many guys feeling great about hodling bitcoin we will keep going down and down. bitcoin reddit must go to only 1k to 500 users online and then we can go up again.

damn. i guess its impossible to compare with bitcoin. Maybe it took 100+years to be adopted as a mean of exchange and in 6000 years that´s really fast time frame. Any data about that?
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:37:08
Its not out of my ass its pretty ease to get a clue with an error of about 20% to 30%. man your math is so bad. its obvious it grow 10000 because a  one or 3 guys put more then 400 BTC on the network. wake up. LN is not growing at that rate. sorry if reality hurts.
PS: If i had a bussiness like an exchange i would also put more than 100 BTC on LN just to keep having speculation into my business.

Venezuela should go full ANARCHY and start adopting bitcoin as main currency. it would become in top5 biggest countries in less than 15 years
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:49:35
because gold is not a currency. if it was there would be alot of people -.- people who have  grams its for jewlery of in some tech, and not to use it as means of exchange. What a nonsense comment.

@_date: 2019-05-21 13:10:53
only a fool would think Peter is not heavly invested in Bitcoin. He just wants to keep some fools buying his gold, thats why he will never admit in public bitcoin is superior to gold
He also has a good image from the past, where he predicted the 2008 bubble , that he knows will make idiots belive in him even after 10 years of wronlgy predicting the next bubble
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:32:09
If he says he is not invested in Bitcoin, it means he is ALL IN BITCOIN.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:13:20
thats like last year when we where below 1k no one predicted 20k for end of  year. the low it will be one that no one will expect ;)
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:40:59
lol you come with the choice answer? i can say its hodler choice to have money in third party also. leave them alone. Actually someone who dies and have a family, its most likly someone on his family will know he owns bitcoins. and if he has on an exchange someone will get it back, if he owns on a paper wallet or he is the only one who knows the private keys, its GG btc coins! Gone forever
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:20:00
are you paid to someone here on reddit or do you actually live on reddit ?
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:41:02
Most of bitcoiners are becoming zoombies, that dont think for themselves and just follows what others have to say. this is pretty scary and opens a YUGE door for market manipulation. thats why i will leave my small amount on exchanges and will wait to see how market behave on this zoombie trend
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:51:10
if we hit 40k its still early and you can dump it on the next sucker who buys the new top ;)
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:11:40
damn. no one thinks.. " this looks a bubble". i mean cmon theres still a possibility we could go to 500usd. bring the downvote!
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:04:49
what if the shortqueeze just happens at low 500usd? what will be the target for you ?
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:24:29
wow nice. how much % of people who buy/sell bitcoin use it ? hmm let me guess... 1% ?

i think in the end bitmain is doing the right thing...this is just inside trading like litecoin
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:42:38
i dont think banks are that stupid. i think they selling thats why we going down. they buy gold, and if they want to go into crytpo they would sell/create their own coin. wake up ! bitcoin its their enemy they just want bitcoin to go down and down till 0
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:39:25
I think that most of people who hold bitcoin already did it.
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:55:01
If bitcoiners were prepared for 80% crash we would never had a 80% crash -.-

tone is a scammer like every loser who give "TA knowlodge". the way they make money its "teaching" TA, because they know they cant make money on trading. Then every single one has an excuse of why they dont trade, but some how they really know how to make the others geting rich trading.
PS: and that dude called Tyler is another scammer who paid Tone for him to promote his hypergarbage. thats a face up scam, but there will be always dudes who like to listen him and take him as a true trader. Tone is like Roger in a certain way, in order to push for their agenda

A stock market bear cycle will mostly put bitcoin under 1k for sure. People need money to buy goods and services and at the moment, for 99% of people, money is USD. Also the guys who think bitcoin willl pump in a dollar collapse are wrong. At this moment it will be really bad for bitcoin also. Bitcoin is not ready for a global currency. We need more 5 years of hard work. then i think we can all join together and short to 0 all the fucking FIAT
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:57:28
When everyone wakes up about how Tone is scaming everyone who listen to him, he makes this good move.

@_date: 2018-12-07 18:10:25
i am not that rich yet. need it go go lower. like 500usd
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:31:50
we need to go below 1k. i think thats the level where most of us will give up. thats  what real capitulation is.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:59:58
theres no correlaction for this. SP500 will go up in long term, even if BTC hits 100k

I will not do it. I will wait for a huge flash PUMP to sell it. the money i invested is money that i can lose so i dont give a fuck about this.

of course, if i only had 1 bag for 100 coins, i would prefer 100 coins of bitcoin then 100 coins of BNB or any other kind of alt coins. With just 1 BTC i get 6000usd, thats alot of money for just one coin

litecoin shill? :)

i will not do this. i prefer risk it with a third party who has more incentives than me to dont lose their money (they hold billions) than myself who dont even have 1 bitcoin. I trust more their security then my own security. Most of people who secure their bitcoin lost them over the years.
And i also get the advantage of puting a sell order over a flash pump.

Doesnt make any sense what u saying becase a real hodler bought below 100usd and never sold it till today doesnt really care if it would call panic if he moves his coins on a wallet from 2010 that is assumed to be lost forever. And its really stupid to say that theres no reason to move them when bitcoin is upgarding like evey year

i was so happy when i saw the crash..i was ready to buy some cheap coins but then i saw the price in coinbase :(

almost everyone is doing this already...you should go to shitcoin reddit

Some people dont know about it because they didnt spend the same time you did reading about bitcoin. the other group just hate it because the missed thE gainz.

Bcash supporters should pay a big price by investing in such scam
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:30:34
What about keep going down lower than 1k? The bitcoin community is still overall bullish, but the market never does what everyone is expecting. Also i will say that 90% of people who is in bitcoin dont expect levels lower than 1k. My bet is 1k or lower bitcoin and below 5k to year 2024. then we migh see another bull run. 
People are still away too confident we will rise in less than 5 years. This market will test everyone even guys who think that will be long term bulls forever.
