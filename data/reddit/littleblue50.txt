maybe it's because I live in Tokyo?  
Theres a website listing alot of known ones but theres restaurants near where I live, Bic Camera (the major electronics chain I mentioned), hairdressers, DIY, all over...
I mean here is a list of just 226 shops/chains that take it here.

I'd rather take the chance of it hitting the floor while I slept and gambling on buying in again a bit higher or lower the next day from around what I started with than losing 50% overnight and being SOL.  Thanks for the confirmation :)

I see alot of people warning about being prepared to lose 50% of what they put in.
I'm fairly new to the trading side of things so if someone could point out where I'm going wrong with the following theory, I'd appreciate it:
Say I put in $1000 (as an example) at 15k/BTC and I'm planning to HODL, as it starts to rise and hits 16k.  I put in $1000 at 16k/BTC and it rises to 17k.  Now, if I have 2 stop orders: $1000 at 16k and $1000 at 15k, surely the worst that happens is I get what I put in back minus fees?
Please tell me if I'm missing something.

I just read an article that said Bitflyer forces you to sell if BTC drops more than 3%... That can't be true can it? What am I missing?

In Japan it's a legal payment method as of April so you can use it in a lot of places on and offline, including (arguably) the biggest electronics chain in the country.
