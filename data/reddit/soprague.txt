I don't care if Expedia converts my BTC or my GBP debit card to USD when I spend it.
It's better if my money is more widely accepted and useful.
Bcash vs. BTC is not about merchant adoption.  Both of them benefit from pushing for merchant adoption.
The debate is all about scaling strategies and a power struggle to control development of features like Asicboost.

Good point.
  
JoR must be the largest producers/distributors in the world, and they only accept crypto.
  
Crypto has made synthetic drugs more accessible, cheaper, and higher purity than ever before.
