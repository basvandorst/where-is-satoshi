Thank you!!! I'm very sick of this circlejerk of my country. It's just so wrong and plain disrespectful. A lot of things are very, very wrong in my country. Not like anyone cares though, they just want feel-good headlines about this fantasy island in the arctic, where everyone is a genius musician and a part-time parliament member.
Great to witness your neighbor getting evicted, read about single mothers starve on Christmas -- well, no more on Christmas than any other month, highly educated people moving abroad because there are simply no jobs here and then come online on Reddit and read some huge circlejerk about my country and how everything is perfect here, oh we have a tiny problem about bitcoin? No problem fixing that! You guys fixed all your others problem so easily, right? What a wonderful place.

I don't know why you are being down voted, probably because people have gotten used to the idea that Iceland is the shrine for democracy and the bane of all corruption through these headlines I see about my country all the time, not like anyone cares to do any research them selves.
My country is backwards as fuck and its time people realize it. It's fucking illegal to have Netflix here for fucks sake.

No. We. Didn't.
We nationalized them.
Iceland isn't some dream country where the average citizen gets what he wants and is represented in everything here. That's the impression karma circlejerking thread headlines give you.
A lot of people here are losing their homes here thanks to financial ruin, government doesn't do shit about anything except our previous ones answer was to tax everything super high and the current ones answer is to lower taxes on everything. Nothing changes, ever.
Stop this fairy tale bullshit about my country please.

Man I'm sick of this Reddit dream land bullshit about Iceland.
Things up here are not that simple.
