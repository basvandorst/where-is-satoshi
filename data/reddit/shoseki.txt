Lets assume for a moment that we have a *semi* benevolent warlord in charge right now that at least pretends it to be a democracy. I can think of far worse...
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:59:58
This is actually my main criticism of bitcoin - if everyone uses bitcoin, taxes collapse, states collapse, warlords take charge...

It was more a discussion point than anything... I still don't feel comfortable enough that I understand enough to invest in bitcoins, and if the main purpose of bitcoins is anonymity, then it seems that anyone who can come in and buy up most of the bitcoins (or accumulate them honestly through trade) could "become their master" just the same as in real life currency. Except that in real life currencies, governments chase banks for accounts for the super rich to pay their taxes etc, in bitcoin that isn't possible... so my question sort of still stands - how is it possible once bitcoins became owned by the 1% to reclaim, other than simply walking away from the currency? And wouldn't that worry people enough to never engage with it?
@_date: 2012-06-28 13:35:43
The thing about bitcoins, is that it makes it easier for the 1% to far a shit ton in anonymous accounts and then you can literally do *nothing* except abandon the currency...

Before, you could put what you wanted through their platform, and their business model didn't collide with yours. Now they are saying - our business model &gt; yours.
@_date: 2011-09-13 19:45:52
I'm not saying they need to run anything. They go into a voting booth and vote as normal, but the systems uses a cryptocurrency as it's base unit.
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:27:54
Same question keeps coming up again and again... its the people / network / perceived value in bitcoins that gives them value, not purely their existence.
Shocoin, the new Bitcoin - worth exactly nothing for a long long time... but you can trade them in for sexy time :D

If you are going to approve them, it isn't scalable. I'm not going to have the solution for you I'm afraid...

1) Make the add-on free and opt-in.
2) Do a test to see if it is available in order to view certain content.
3) Fake addon lets you see the same stuff.
4) No profit!

Is it not possible to make a linux build with only the software required, then remove the ability to install any other software and burn it as an image, then distribute that image?

Checksums etc? I'm not going to be able to come up with solutions for every issue... I wanted this to be a discussion...

I'm pretty sure that something I already saw (at v low resolution thankfully) looked extremely close to illegal... I just immediately closed the page.
@_date: 2011-09-13 21:52:07
Then you create an independant "issuer", which would anonymise who was issued which coin.
Users cannot transfer coins to each other, the software allows them to only transfer between the addresses allocated per choice.
It wouldn't be called "Votecoin", anyway... it would be Votecoin092462 or whatever the current issue for voting was.

The idea of the wallet, is that when they go into a booth to vote, their randomly generated account/wallet which has the one vote, is the one that votes. There is no way to tell which user cast which vote (except potentially within the system, but it must be ensure/checked that the internal address is not kept.)
If you are worried about the network, don't make it public. Make the boxes sealed off, with no public access, not internet facing. Run your own network. And when the transactions need processing, run a transaction farm.

The finite quantity of bitcoins means that the value has the ability to stabilize, for short periods of time. Even if there were no limit to the number of bitcoins that could be farmed, the number of bitcoins actually in circulation would act as that finite limit. However, as more became farmed, the ones currently existing would lose value, but then as more people use them, they'd increase in value.
As there is a finite number of bitcoins, as more people use them, they will simply increase in value, but there is no way to increase the circulation. On the other hand, because there are no physical constraints, there are no (physical) issues with trading in 0.0001 BTC etc.

Circuses, movies theatres and restaurants are not gambling related activities. Gambling is a pastime for the rich and the stupid (take it from me, I've wasted enough on it). At larger scales, it is a simple redistribution mechanism. It exploits peoples' misunderstandings about how the system works, which is why it is such an effective business model.

But attrition is inevitable...
@_date: 2011-10-23 11:07:15
I don't get it. As long as bitcoin retains any value whatsoever, it can be traded for goods and services if people are willing to trade in it.
Its the stabillity that is frustrating. It just has to stay stable for long enough for people to trade in, and it has value.
It is such a disruptive "technology", that of course everyone wants it to fail, just as they want every non-dollar currency ultimately to fail...

I don't need to do the attack, I am not an expert and I don't pretend to be such. As simply a potential user, all I am interested in, is how you'd stop someone either from the outside or from within from wiring the money to whoever you feel.
Have to say, I personally hate lotteries as a wealth redistribution mechanism - it usually takes from the poor and gives to the rich. Good business model though.
@_date: 2011-06-29 08:43:20
And, you can make it even more anonymous by wearing rubber gloves, leaving no fingerprints.

I do not doubt that some people find great enjoyment from gambling, however a large part of that is the "thrill" of winning.
When they win, they think they deserved it. When they lose they curse everything around them. Rational analysis of the situation is not part of their approach, as it would take the fun away.
Take it from someone *who had an extreme, life affecting addiction* to gambling, its a con. I don't deride them because "they value something that I don't". I deride them for their inability to see *why* they value it, and that this lack of vision does not help them make decisions.
People can jump off cliffs without parachutes if they like, they might get a thrill out of it, but if they did it, you wouldn't question that they were bloody idiots, would you?
@_date: 2011-10-31 15:50:18
So, what stops you from creating some dummy accounts and simply saying that they won?
The biggest problem with gambling is proving fairness.
@_date: 2011-09-14 01:52:43
It wasn't my intention that anyone would "farm" the coins.
@_date: 2011-09-13 14:15:02
I was thinking :
1) Addresses correspond to choices so if you have to pick between three people, they would all be the same "currency" but a new one would be issued per vote.
2) A different generated coinset per vote, so people can't generate / horde their own "votes" they have to be issued from a central body.
3) The voting booth and all software would have to be transparent, publically verifiable, so people would trust the booths.
4) You could still have a semi-paper system if you wanted - get the user to fill in a short form and have the computer scan it right in front of them, before putting it into the central box. Then people are essentially "counting" their own vote, but there is a paper fallback.
@_date: 2011-09-14 13:32:48
You vote in a booth to stop people standing with a gun to your head saying "vote Red".
@_date: 2011-11-04 09:54:55
Incidently, I guess this means that over time bitcoins will inevitably increase in value as more and more people lose their bitcoins!
I see a rise in value in the forseeable future...

Have an open source system build , and inspect it. Could you be a little more specific with some of the issues you wish to discuss?
I am throwing the idea around, if there are particular problems, I'd rather face them than just think "no" and move on...
