I personally side with only offering things I literally can legally.  This is mostly because I want to be able to sleep at night without anxiety but also because I have been online (and on reddit for 5 years) for a long time and knew I'd be pitchforked if I fucked with it. It gives me the freedom to have such open conversation online, which I think is easily worth it. Getting copyrights is a serious pain in the ass with all different levels of designers, so I can see why people don't really care. It adds a lot of work for me and ontop of everything I do... it's ridiculous hours I put into this.
But common knowledge of copyright and actual risk of being sued is quite a bit different than the internet typically thinks. A lot of competitor companies don't give a shit about it and really have very low risk of a monetary hit from what they're selling. If you're a major label or company, then they'll be more inclined to sue you. Most issues result in a cease and desist email (which I haven't had). Copyright issues are all over and the major groups don't even really give a shit (redbuddle, zazzle, etc.). Lastly, Reddit is a key proponent of copyright issues and yet most of the images here are copyrighted.
I was happy to do my daily look and see my own site here.

That stuff is on the buyer to understand, not me. I've shipped to ~60 countries since launching midyear.
Amazon may know that stuff but you can't expect most online retailers to understand your laws in [crazy country name here]. Buyers are always responsible to know their import laws and cover the taxes involved, just as it's stated in every shipping FAQ I read/modeled ours after.
I've had someone in an African country end up paying $100 because they have harsh harsh import laws. That's not on me. I'd immediately turn off Intl shipping for **everyone** if that was the case.
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:31:21
You know the answer to this. Why even bother asking.
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:59:44
I'm talking consumer-level. Making sure everything meets code for 60 countries is more work and it's a grind to get everything out. I don't mind it, I find it easy. But everyone I've tried hiring never can seem to remember all of the nuances and then I get a ton of packages back that not only do I need to email them and re-ship but also take a cost hit on. I've had intelligent part-timers never have an issue like that as well though. Doing things internationally can be a big stepping stone, even if laws aren't in your way.
This is very rare but as fate would have it, I [received an email about this earlier today](
I'm a little heated, moreso than almost any other commenter would be, just because it have so many obstacles when it comes to shipping and the time / costs involved. Amazon and places have set a standard that isn't really able to be matched, which is awesome when I order there, but most businesses will have difficulty.
A lot of the companies doing bitcoin's black friday are smaller in nature. So, I wish there was a difference in how people interpret / understand these obstacles for the businesses themselves. Should more places have shipped int'l? Yes, because they missed out on sales. But I see why many wouldn't, especially when already discounting their products and lowering margin.

It would be advised for any first time entrepreneur to stick with the job (it sucks, I know from experience) and get a few fails under their belt before taking the jump.
Corporate jobs can really make a person miserable though. I work more hours now than I did when it was a full-time finance job + startups but I'm infinitely happier. 
The thing is... every entrepreneur makes the same mistakes when they head down this path. Some people can adapt and learn, some people can't. Some know when to call quits on a project they've sunk their savings and a year into, and some go down with the ship.
I was just putting the tombstone on a year or more bitcoin company when I started this one. It's difficult because people relied on me, but it wasn't going to happen. Then this one was a lot more fun, way more suited for my personality, and pretty much an instant hit.

@_date: 2014-04-13 05:34:42
Sure. So... in a corporation you have the shareholders (those who own stock) and the executives + board. The executives are supposed to act in the interests of their shareholders. Well, since the system isn't perfect, a CEO can make decisions ([sometimes catastrophic]( in his own interests.
Now, let's say you want to automate the top-level roles of a corporation... you could code in the functions and decisions he faces catered to your company / business and enable the stockholders to change those rules based on a selected majority vote (51%?).
Big decisions especially could be democratically voted on by the shareholders, rather than them watching the news to see what they did after-the-fact.
This is probably not 100% correct either since it's how I interpretted it. Generally... anything you can code (in the case of a company's "rules" it could even include AI technology) can be written on top. That includes a derivative of bitcoin *cough* "sidechaining-ish" *cough*.

It's only over about a week. They started off large with our email blast since we had thousands of peopel signed up and have stayed pretty consistent. I'd like to do some cool shirt design contests in bitcoin.
Our process is simple, people make shirts on shirtmockup.com and then either add it to a on-going thread or submiy to Then I make a survey with all of the designs and people choose which ones they like. Then next wave of shirt designs are hosted.
I have an extensive past in cryptos, so it hasn't hurt my margins. Plus the uptick in BTC has been good and I was personally really lucky with an investment in DRK about a couple months ago.
Here are some additional means people want to pay with:
 Best User-suggested payment methods:
    My jizz, Sex, I'd probably pay with cash in a bloody
    paper bag., slave trade, Cocaine and my body, bag of dicks (high
    quality...no limp dicks), Chickens, upvotes, Blowjobs., pubes,

    LeNewMemeNiceMayMayManCoin, cp, bricks of gold,

A decade from now would assume two things, 1. a bitcoin is worth over $300k, 2. it also outpaces inflation on top of that(that $300K would likely be $350K or whatever in future dollars).
Or you're predicting Bentleys will be worth way less by then. Are we talking about a 2014 used Bentley 10 years from now?

Shit, I learned something a couple days ago that was annoying. I noticed the new tape I bought wasn't sticking to a couple packages so I used the priority mail tape a tthe post office in a small areas just to be sure. The fuckers sent the package back to me. Such a waste.

You want to discuss companies that would be in bitcoin black Friday or one of the longest standing consumer electronics companies in the world? I missed the point in your conversation where you were talking about international corporations.
Not to mention even they almost cratered a few years ago. Corporate companies have less and less people doing stuff like that.




The short answer is: international logistics and order tracking is difficult. Not even adding in language barriers with customer service / order changes, different countries have different requirements and import taxes / laws. In general, international shipping is 5x more expensive than domestic as well and the costs vary by country. 
Let's say I charged $14 for shipping to Australia and it actually cost me $18. That's fine, it's built into the product margin and I'll make it up on domestic. Then the package needs a size swap, the package comes back for any million reasons, etc. I need to ship the order back out for another $18. A person can charge for that, but it's more decisions and everything takes more time &amp; focus away from you growing the business.
Businesses need to prioritize their time. If Int'l is less profitable and has more headache, then it can be unnecessary at that moment. [Shipping a group like this]( takes me a full all-nighter.
This thread is becoming annoying. You commenters are so misinformed / underestimate the actual time and knowledge required to be an entrepreneur.

Agreed, I run an online platform that caters to bitcoin users and a small fraction are bitcoin purchases. Maybe 5%, probably more like 1 or 2%.
If someone is focusing on the bitcoin market, I'd suggest doing low volume big ticket price items or something that directly benefits companies / users in a meaningful way. The second option still probably needs investment... and I went down that path with bitcoin. It's not as prevalent as this sub may lead you to believe and I knew all the right people (I've been around here for a long time).

The images may be funny but the quality is top notch. It's also the reason we can print such high resolution and so many colors. Can't be easily mass-produced though... especially since every step is based in the US.

Oh yeah? Let's say you start a business that takes off. You, not understanding how difficult international logistics is because you're a noob, has half of your 1,000 orders needing to go to around 30 countries.
How do you manage the order fulfillment, pay for the shipping, understand the rules and requirements of all of those countries import laws, have the correct shipping materials for that quantity, and how many man hours does it take to physically package, print label, and drop off ~1000 orders?
Where do you begin?

Thanks fixed it. We added cryptos a bit behind launch with a ton of people buying once we did. GoCoin's API was a bit tricky for us since we made sure security and the inputs are protected from the moment you enter our site.

You're not doing a very good job at making yourself clear or getting your point across. You are correct and he is wrong but sadly you've managed to not state your case and likely continue the miseducation here.
These international policies are common because I can't take liability for every one-off country that exists, their changing policies, and their potentially explosive import taxes. It's either this is a consumer liability or most websites close their doors to the majority of countries. Pick one.
It is more labor and cost to ship internationally in every way. If it was between the US and YOUR country, then that would be easy and repeatable, but there are a lot of countries ordering stuff online.

 Cryptocurrency was a main focus from day one. Everything about this came together very quickly and actually was born from a reddit post that hit front page and we total 10k upboats, thousands of comments, hundreds of shirt designs, 2500 surveys taken to choose them, and now have total $1k per day in sales.
I made all the decisions for suppliers via who accepted Bitcoin and chose gocoin because they let us accept Bitcoin, ltc and doge.
Doge and Bitcoin users are both potential customer groups for us. Id like to eventually have full control over the information the government sees about us.

The price is basically in direct correlation to the amount of investors and amount they're putting in or taking out. 
So, the amount of investors is likely lessening or their confidence is weaker. This doesn't predict future. Typically these lulls have been a good time to investor historically.
Now I wish it would slowly rise but China has been a constant bruise. It would need Wallstreet players to get in, startups to do really well outside of the exchange space, or organically grow faster in more countries. There are a million variables that can contribute or take away from BTC's current and future price.

Some of the other difficulties are also product-based. For me, it's a lot more simple to send something made of cloth than someone distributing food or potentially explosive. Electronics have all kinds of barriers and costs if the laws are bullshit.
It can be a "scary" endeavour and if you're not financially literate or computer literate, you can charge the wrong amount for shipping to all the countries. It's not worldwide "international" shipping. The process is very similar but still on a per-country basis of operational requirements and understanding.
I've had troubles getting someone good hired, actually, because they always seem to mess it up. It's simple to me since I understand it, but one little mistake and the package is coming back to you. Now that order is unprofitable.
In my case, to further my previous comment you replied to... shipping international takes a little more time and I ahve a ton of orders. I am very happy to be an international retailer, but most people don't have the drive I do. I went to bed at 6am this morning and woke back up at 10am.

Ethereum makes sidechaining pointless already if it's implemented as the white paper expresses. A person can literally code contracts and their own functions into the blockchain. Through that, you could set up voting on a per-group basis (highschool proms to political voting), automate the decisions of corporations, create stockmarkets much like havelock but built-in... and many more. Really anything that can be coded.
Zerocoin is important too because the transactions on its blockchain are completely anonymous. It really is more of a currency to bitcoin's property (ie: gold-ish) characteristics.
Some coins have inflation built it... kinda important... I disagree with  the deflationary economics of BTC.
Datacoin uses its blockchain as a storage network. Messages, pictures, files, etc, hosted on its blockchain are decentralized and can't be taken down. Wikileaks *should* be hosted on something like it.
Namecoin is a concept Satoshi himself created. It's a decentralized hosted DNS server. You use the coins as claims to URL addressess (I think? I haven't looked into it much). This is interesting because the US can't take over or take down a website on it like they did Silkroad or Mega Uploads. The URLs also theoretically have more intrinsic value than bitcoins (Google.bit).
Some of the altcoins generate prime numbers to hash. This aids in scientific research.
Ripple has it's own set of potential benefits but that is good as vaporware to me.
The list goes on...
To be fair, I am more bullish on bitcoin than any of those cryptos but they are more useful in their own ways. I think zerocoin will spike when a blackmarket starts accepting it and I think Ethereum has a good chance to truly compete with BTC if it is released as described.
Most side-chain convo and anti-altcoin rhetoric appear to come from fanboy mentality. Bitcoin has a rocky reputation and low market cap... a crypto could come around that just kills it.

I wouldn't rely on investors in this industry. The large majority of investment goes to a very select few companies. The better goal is to get a proof of concept working and traction.
OP, you should come up with 5 new ideas everyday and tirelessly try to validate the best ones. I suggest starting a blog or Twitter or something so people interested can follow you. You should always be selling yourself at this point. Get people interested in you and your projects.

The fabric is the same stuff as that expensive workout clothing that has become popular but it's a bit thicker and feels closer to a soft cotton. It's spun poly which is a necessity of our printing method. We vaporize ink directly into the garment, so you can't feel the image and colors won't fade either.

Don't try to use narrative incriminate someone you don't know. I've met him at a couple bitcoin conferences and he seems to be pretty standup. I'm sure he knows a lot of shit that he keeps hidden away but that's what lawyers are supposed to do.
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:21:39
Very if true.
He took unaccounted illegal revenue, pushed it through his own system which had tons of bottlenecks, cashed out into dollars as fast as possible, and basically completely controlled the exchange market (aka price) at that time. MTGox was the **only** exchange back then. Simple code could have manipulated the bottlenecks, fake trade volumes, or anything else. If true, it means he used MTGox as a money laundering service for himself.
Bitcoin insiders basically all agree the Chinese exchanges were doing it too not all that long ago.. which contributed to the huge bubble we saw last year.

I don't think he profited immensely from my opinion. He is on the payroll of the Foundation as far as I know. Nothing about his personality, how he conducts himself, or the things he owned would suggest he is rich. Also, his entire life... as well as any BTC entrepreneur's... revolves completely around FINCEN. It's all anyone talks about.
Regardless, I am just saying that pitchforks are easy to pick up and usually counter-productive. I really don't know the guy well, so I'm not really defending him personally. I'm vocally placing my opinion against what you've written and how you've written it.
Most of the people on that list I can't stand for one reason or another. Their actions speak for themselves.

The implications would be completely different.
The defendants in court are trying to say Mark more-or-less framed Ross and that Mark was using Dwolla and various other means to xfer his illegal revenue into dollars. Additionally, there is an accusation that he pointed at Ross in return for immunity AND gave up millions of his customer's dollars for this. He's trying to put someone in jail for life + destroyed many people's financial lives. That'd also mean the personality and objectives created on Silk Road were a front for a scam.
Ross, if he was DPR, was a vocal leader of libertarian markets and combined two technologies that will have forever changed the war on drugs and what the government controls over you. The DPR from forum texts was someone that people trusted and did right by his community / their objectives.
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:21:21
What I meant is he could have easily facilitated the bottlenecks that created / pushed those bubbles and used it as an opportunity to sell out at a higher price. His Dwolla account was confiscated at that time, he was under investigation that he couldn't talk about (which we now know was Homeland Security) and if you were around then... he was very paranoid about the development of MTGox. He was the only person with access to the code.
