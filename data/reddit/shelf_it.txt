it's best to wait at least a few days then google it. I think the basic strategy is, on each chain, to mix your coins together so they become new coins. Then if you sell a coin and someone tries to do a replay attack, they can't, because that coin didn't exist before the fork.
The mechanics of how to do that I'm not aware of. I'm one of those people who hasn't sold a coin in a year so ... I don't really pay too close of attention to how to do these things.

B2X will not have replay protection. You send all your B2X coins to some dickhead, he "replays" the transaction on the BTC chain, now all your coins are gone.

it's protection from a replay attack. A replay attack is basically if you send someone coins on one chain after the fork, that receiver can pretend like you sent them money on both chains.
So they fork and create BTC2X, you dump your shitty new BTC2X coins to some shady jerk, and he "replays" that transaction on the BTC chain. Now all your bitcoins are gone on both chains. :( 
I'm not sure how replay attack protections work but BCASH for instance made it so this was impossible after they forked. Because BTC2X won't implement a protection, the way Coinbase and others will protect users is to mix their bitcoins around after the fork, so that your wallet ends up with all new coins. If someone tries to reply your transaction it won't work on the other chain since you're using coins that didn't exist before the fork.

I think a 2% move is a pretty serious bet for an established investor.

 watch out for replay attacks

lol. I don't think that's why... I think higher net worth folks tend to be pretty defensive. They have hundreds of positions so a 2% move is a fairly big move.
Fwiw, I think this dude, Novogratz, runs a hedge fund. I read the fund manages $500m in assets primary for the purpose of investing in crypto. I'm just guessing but I assume this was a move on behalf of the fund. I'm pretty excited to see wall street start showing up to the party.

It's a private equity fund

The idea that Coinbase's UVP is tax evasion... If that were the case their failure is a foregone conclusion. The IRS isn't going to look the other way forever.
