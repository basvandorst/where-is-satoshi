On that note, I don't understand why GDAX withdrawls are not batched yet. They are bleeding money in fees.

@_date: 2017-12-23 09:14:21
And there should be way less on chain transactions then correct, since it will only be done to open/cose? Lowering the fees?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:17:40
You can buy from Coinbase with a bank account and get coins at current price, but have to wait a few days to access them due to ACH bank transfer. You can buy with CC or debit card to get instantly.
To buy from GDAX you need to transfer USD in first, and wait until it transfers to buy coins.
To send coins out of Coinbase, you can transfer to GDAX for free, then send out of GDAX for free. Sending out directly from Coinbase will have a transaction fee.

Ripple seems to be a good hedge against everything else.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:27:06
Basically the difficulty adjustment algorithm periodically sets the average block time 10 to minutes based on the current hashrate. If hashpower increases after this then the average block time can go down (as OP mentioned 9 minutes), but if hashpower leaves then it can go up. Eventually the algorithm corrects again to an average of 10 minutes.

So you're saying you have that much BTC but don't understand fees?.... How??? Early buyer?

They paid everyone back who lost money, doubt it was an inside job.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:59:56
Do you have the transaction hash? Probably just need to wait longer if you paid a low fee. The network is still a bit bogged down but it's clearing: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:02:07
It's different for each coin. See here 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:46:40
Old blocks are not edited, one transaction can only be included in one block, the block it is mined in.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:25:00
If you want the current price you should use Coinbase, but you'll pay more in fees. If you can wait a few days, use GDAX. Always send coins to GDAX first before transferring out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:09:03
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:51:32
Exactly. Nothing illegal happened AFAIK, but the whole situation is sketchy. Coinbase should have given more than an hours notice.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:05:35
Yes, at block 491407.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:59:11
Yes once your transaction is in one block, your transaction is complete and your coins are no longer in the original address and they are now in the address you sent to.
The entire blockchain is distributed and hosted on full nodes. Wallet clients connect to these nodes in order to determine how many coins are in your addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:16:52
He has to, otherwise a troll.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:07:19
The full nodes are distributed servers storing the entire blockchain.

LOL, that wallet is garbage and they have it, why can't Coinbase? Sheesh.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:03:38
Maybe I'm focusing on the price too much. The main thing I really want is for crypto to replace fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:41:35
No, it will just be recorded in the latest block when miners include it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:58:37

I believe the only difference is 4 blocks per 10 mins instead of 1, and 84 million coins instead of 21. It can currently handle more transactions than BTC, but it can suffer from the same problems.

How so? Ripple is kinda the antithesis of BTC. When everything crashed a few days ago Ripple went up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:37:20
Your transaction is broadcast to the network, where it sits in the mempool until a miner mines a new block with your transaction. Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees first. 
The blockchain is simply a public ledger storing the transaction history (and this data also indicates what wallets coins belong to)
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:50:59
No problem! =)
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:39:06
Problem solved: @_date: 2017-12-25 05:11:34
So why won't second layer solutions like LN allow it to scale?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:59:46
Last I checked a TX of with around 3 USD fees was going to take 1-2 days, but I may be wrong.
How many satoshis/byte did you pay?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:43:03
Only temporairly. The difficulty adjustment algorithm adjusts periodically to bring average block time to 10 minutes. But as hashrate increases this time can go down until the algorithm adjusts back to 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:30:05
No idea where you got the idea to multiply the entire blockchain size by the average block time...
1mb of transactions can fit in each block, each block takes an average of 9 minutes. The entire blockchain does not need to be processed each time a block is mined.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:23:13

I'm not super familiar with mining, but as I understand it:
Most miners connect to pools and the pools provide the miners the necessary data to mine. The pools need to store the entire blockchain but the individual miners do not.

The official website does not ask for your private keys.

@_date: 2017-12-20 06:59:37
Transfer to GDAX first, you won't have any TX fees when moving it out. 
If you want to HODL: Get a good wallet app where ONLY YOU control your private keys and send your coins there.
If you are trading: move to another exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:52:27
Not entire pools, but yes miners do this. If enough hashrate leaves BTC then blocks can take more than 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:22:05
"Outcome: Coinbase needs to buy BTC from other exchanges. It does so, but it also has to fragment the coins into millions of utxo. This fragmentation causes mempool congestion. Transaction fees spike. Exchanges becomes illiquid."
Sorry, but what? You're incorrect. All Coinbase orders are market orders on GDAX. Traders will be buying and selling. Coinbase does not sell or buy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:29:00
Why do you say BTC is not fungible?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:25:56
Are you serious? People like that are ruining all of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:06:18
Do you have the transaction hash (ID)? I've never used that wallet, but if you have the transaction hash or know how many satoshis/byte you paid we could help give you an estimate on when it will go through.

I agree with everything you said, and also thanks for mentioning that the cap could be increased.
I think it's clear from the genesis block message that it was designed as a secure way to store wealth, but it was also designed as "peer to peer electronic cash" as the paper is titled.
Please note that I'm not shilling for BCH, I have both and BTC is by far my largest holding, I'm just really concerned about the current state of affairs with tx fees. Hopefully LN and other solutions will solve this.
Long term, small blocks and high fees make sense since we need a fee market when all BTC is mined, but short term isn't looking so good.

Edit: Look at the GDAX order books, there is plenty of liquidity, why would they need to buy from other exchanges.
Individual traders buy from other exchanges, that is called arbitrage.

Crypto is not fiat, what are you smoking? 
And # of transactions has nothing to do with power used.
Edit: First of all on chain transactions can't handle that capacity. Blocks are always 10 mins and can only fit a certain number of transactions. Power used depends on how many miners, not transactions. Lightning network is needed for BTC to even come close to 30% of transactions, and it will not consune as much power as mining.
And whats up with your giant font size?
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:48:50

@_date: 2018-02-06 05:49:58
Why would it be bad if it was stable? Sure, you wont be able to make crazy profits off the votality, but I would expect the market cap to be higher if BTC is used for more than speculation and trading as it is mainly used for today.

@_date: 2018-02-06 06:56:12
Yeah, it's entirely possible BTC wont reach it's ATH again, but I'll eat my dick in 20 years (not gonna gamble on 3 years) if crypto as a whole never goes past the market cap ATH again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:27:46


Exactly what I said, but that wont require more mining power. We could have 100x the mining power being used and the transactions/second would still be the same.


This is true.
And yes, technically it's not backed by anything. But it is a secure, decentralized network. Which I believe gives it value.
