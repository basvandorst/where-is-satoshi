I am also at a loss.  What is going on here that is worthy of note?  Does it have something to do with the large rise in the price of Bitcoin in Euros that seems to occur in the last two candles?

As far as the numbering convention goes I am in favor of either of the following:
21,000,000.000 000 00
424,242.424 242 42
19.337 194 12
0.001 342 27
0.000 000 01
Personally I would like the first set’s style to be the official standard with the second set being an acceptable alternative, because the interpunct, used so extensively in the first set, is not on most standard keyboard layouts.  If the interpunct is deemed too subtle the bullet (•) could be used (exempli gratia: 0.001•342•27).
As far as naming convention goes I am good with bitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin &amp; satoshi each having their place.  So 19.337·194·12 (or 19.337•194•12 or 19.337 194 12) would read “nineteen bitcoins, three hundred thirty seven millibitcoins, one hundred ninety four micro bitcoins, twelve satoshis”  It breaks the number up for people into somewhat manageable brackets, like the old british money system of farthings and shillings and the like.  I don’t think it’s all that easy, but it seems better to me than saying “nineteen point three three seven one nine four one two bitcoins”.
Now if we are talking about what to display as the default for software or mobile phone apps and the like, at current price levels anyway, it seems like millibitcoins is the way to go.

The interesting thing to me about this one is that it is so rigid.  I have seen "price walls" before, but this one is by far the most impenetrable of all of them.

It looks like 1LNWw6yCxkUmkhArb2Nf2MPw6vG7u5WG7q is/was Mt. Gox's "green address" wallet:

Ah, thank you for the link to the chart.  Looks to me like it says a total of 1.45 bitcoins traded durring the 20th hour of 2014-02-18.  Seems like one heck of a small amount of volume to be moving the price that much.  Supper thin order book?

Where can the information that Josh Jones controls more than 50% of the bitcoins in Mt.Gox be seen?

Is the trade volume at that point 90ish or 3-4ish bitcoins?

So is this indicative of one party buying all the bitcoins up at a certain price?  Is this a price wall naturally formed by the market because it is around the April 2013 price peak?  Anybody have any thoughts.

I have also noticed that ~$261.20 has been a lower bound for price on Mt.Gox for a while now.  Definitely stood out to my eye.  In my short time watching bitcoin trading markets I have never seen anything quite like it.
