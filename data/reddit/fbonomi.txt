You say:


So, the coins are still in that address? Let's say that address is 1abcdefgh.....
All you need is verify that the address 1abcdefgh.. is yours, i.e. is in that wallet
it takes 15 minutes max!
1) Download Bitcoin Core wallet.
2) NO NEED to let it sync: when the window opens, it will say "Recent transactions not yet visible...." press Hide
3) Close bitcoin
4) Copy your old wallet.dat in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin, overwriting the new wallet.dat
5) Start bitcoin, again click Hide
6) Click on Help - Debug Window, then click on the "console" tab
7) at the bottom of the screen, where the "&gt;" characther is, type:
       dumpprivkey  1abcdefgh..
(replace with your address)
if it says "Private key for address 1abcdefgh.. is not known (code -4)" then the coins are NOT in that wallet, even if you sync it you won't find that money
if it says something like 5u845jr0d835..... then YAY! you have them!
that 5u845jr0d835.... is your private key, you can import it into any wallet to get your coins, even without syncing
BUT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING WITH IT, be sure to do it in a safe way!
EDIT: version 0.3.24 was not deterministic, but the method I outline works for non-deterministic wallets too

alas, they are lost.
You didn't have (even at time) the private keys of your wallet within Silk Road.
As they haven't moved, they aren't in the coins seized by the FBI, and are probably lost, unless Ulbricht has the keys hidden somewhere. 
For the sake of curiosity, how much was it?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:05:05
no, don't get a bigger drive.
1) do a clean install of bitcoin core, without the extra config
2) start bitcoin core
3) it will start downloading the whole blockchain. There's a "Hide" button to close that window
4) stop bitcoin core. This was just to have it setup everything
5) copy your old wallet.dat file over the new wallet.dat
6) re-run bitcoin core
7) again hide the "downloading blockchain window"
8) extract your private keys:
Click on 'help' in the menu bar 
Click on 'debug window'
Click on the 'console' tab
If your wallet is protected by a passphrase unlock it by typing
walletpassphrase [password] 600
if all your bitcoin is in a single address, type
dumpprivkey [address]
otherwsie type
dumpwallet 
(this will list ALL the private keys, next to each address)

You also could get them from faucets.
But .... you only could get VERY  LITTLE, like 5 btc :-)
Seriously, this is true. This was THE ORIGINAL bitcoin faucet, operated by Gavin Andresen:

Polls are in slight favor for NO.
But  as perhaps you might have heard :-) polls haven't been that accurate in the last important referendums or elections.
Add a few rather populistic moves that out government has put in place:
500 Euros for "culture bonus" given to every 18-years old (a few weeks ago); 
an agreement for an average wage increase of 85 Euros for public employees (today); ...
Finally, a general FUD campaign (If No wins, Berlusconi will be back! If No wins, 8 banks will go bankrupt! If No Wins, Italy will leave Euro! Italy will leave OTAN! Fascists will be back! )
So, I am not that optimistic

You don't give enough information to have meaningful answers.
How much is going to be stored in it?
How often it will need to be moved?
How tech-oriented is the final user of the cold wallet?
All this said, for small-ish amounts that need not to be moved for very long times, a properly  made, encrypted paper wallet is hard to beat speaking of cost/security ratio

Another way to put it in perspective: in 2012, the world used 20.000 TWh of electricity
A year is made of 24*365 = 8760 hours, so world uses 20.000TWh / 8760h = abt 2.2TW
2.2TW is 2,200 GW aka 2,200,000 MW
Compare this with the power required by the bitcoin network (200MW)
200/2,200,000 = abt 0.0001
We are therefore using abt 0.01% of our electricity for Bitcoin.
Is it a cost? Sure yes!
But do you think this is worth it? I do.
Also it has to be considered that bitcoin being immaterial, mining can be strategically deployed where energy costs less, and where the use of renewable sources is higher. So, the environmental cost is lower than that.

It isn't the same people, they are different people, and they are alas smarter than the Onecoin people.
But they definitely are a scam, and perhaps a more dangerous one. There's an Italian site that has exposed some of their lies, I'll also link to the Google-translated version:
(TLDR: they claim to be miners  because they have a couple hundred of GPUs mining, but that's insignificant, all the payouts are their from Ponzi scheme.)
and about their offices:
(TLDR: they lie about their offices, re-uuse stock photos of other offices and claim they are theirs. It links to a video by Ante Kelava in a Regus office pretending it's a Coinspace office and boasting "This is not only just small company, this is so BIG company, Coinspace growing everydays" )
It's worrysome because for thousands of people this will be their first encounter with crypto-currencies: a scam

There are many many changes to the Constitution in this reform, and this has been criticized by many because if you package together 10 different reforms and the ask for a Referendum on it, people won't be able to say Yes on a subject and No on another subject. It's a single vote.
The main reform  is definitely a change in structure of the Italian Parliament, currently composed of two chambers, Camera (Chamber of Deputees) and Senato (Senate)
The reform would reduce the number of the members of the senate, and mainly change the nature of the Senate.
Instead of being elected from the people, members of the Senate would be selected in other elected bodies, such as the "small parliament" each Italian Region has, and mayors of the town.
Proposers of the referendum say it's a way to reduce costs (these new Senate members won't be paid) and to make politics leaner (the two chambers have currently very similar powers, and laws need to be approved by both chambers)
Opposers of the referendum say that if really they wanted to reduce costs they could cut wages of members the other chamber too (currently Italy has the highest-paid MPs in Europe) and that if they wanted to make lawmaking faster they could take away the Senate completely.
Also, having a whole body of the parliament selected by other politics, rather than from the people, is seen as a weakening in the democratic process.
As I said, there are several other things in the referendum, but this is the most strong - and divisive - point.
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:17:02
I'm against, for the reasons I stated above.
Plus, there is a new electoral law in Italy which STRONGLY favors the first party. 
If the  first party gets 40% of the popular vote, it  gets 54% of the parliament's seat.
If no party gets 40%, the first two parties get voted again, and the winner gets 54% of seats.
Italian Politics is VERY fragmented, and with this law, it may very well happen that a party with 20-25% of popular vote gets an absolute majority in parliament.
Combine this with the proposed reform, that also  makes it easier for the parliament to change the constitution again, and you could EASILY have a rather small party that changes our constitution in its favor, to achieve a lock-in effect. Dictature, anyone?
With the current world-wide trend towards populism, this is not something I look forward to.
Our Constitution was written just after Fascism, and used to lean on the "prudent" side, with several mechanisms that made it difficult to install an authoritarian government, at the expense of making it a bit more difficult to govern.
That's a cost I am more than willing to pay.

As an Italian: that article is bullshit
The referendum is NOT about "banking resolutions" 
It is true that a vitcory of "NO" could mean that the government is in trouble, and that MAY mean market instability, but it's not a referendum about banks, as the article states

Old-ish laptops had removable Wi-Fi adaptors. If you can find one of those, you can open it and physically remove the Wi-Fi board.
But you should check if they are compatible with today's software.
