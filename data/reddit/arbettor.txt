Thanks for the reply!
I hear you regarding the marketing aspect.  It's not one of my strengths either, but I've noticed it can be an important element differentiating successful games from unsuccessful ones (especially Kickstarter campaigns, since the platform has soooooo many boardgames nowadays that it can be difficult to separate yourself from the pack).  One suggestion would be to contact Richard Rahdo via  and see whether he would be amenable to creating a Rahdo Runs Through video if you send him a prototype copy of the game.  Kickstarter campaigns that include a Rahdo Runs Through video on the campaign page tend to meet their fundraising goals more often than those that don't.   Considering he has a background in video game development, perhaps he would have a soft spot for the crypto theme of this game (complete speculation on my part).  One factor might be how well the game plays with 2 players....he tends to play/review 2-player-friendly games more often than those that aren't.
I think there are a lot of potential benefits from collaborating and cross-pollinating between the crypto and board game communities.  Game theory is an important component of each: how incentives are structured can have a huge impact on the proper functioning of a board game or crypto.  I think board games and crypto are a perfect match, so I applaud your devoting time, money and effort into creating this game.
I'll throw up a post on Boardgamegeek to help spread the word a bit.

There are definitely times where I avoid trading because I don't feel like making a new entry in my spreadsheet, or creating a new sheet for a new coin.  I'm forcing myself to immediately account for each new trade and the USD-denominated cost at the time.  Hopefully it will help me avoid headaches down the line.

Owning bitcoin allows you to access/use the technology behind bitcoin.  So yeah, as the tech improves, your utility achieved by using bitcoin also improves. 
Regarding your second point, we could generalize our discussion to the entire set of existing or potential cryptocurrencies.  Do you believe cryptocurrencies are a zero sum game?  I would argue they are not, based on the previous points of tech and utility improvements.  The fair value and utility may fall or go to zero for individual cryptocurrencies, but the overall space should enjoy a tailwind from improving tech and utility.  Do you disagree?

Emails and cryptos are entirely different though.  Emails don't have a digitally scarce token of value as a foundational aspect of the protocol they use.  The incentive structure that makes cryptos work relies on the existence of that token and the fact that it has a non-zero value.  Otherwise, the various stakeholders in the system would not be incentivized to act in way that promotes the proper functioning of the protocol.
Also, emails are not fungible or scarce, nor is there a way to prevent 'double-spending'.  Emails are not designed to facilitate value transfer, like cryptocurrencies are.  You're comparing apples and attack helicopters.
Your last point opens a whole different can of worms.  I'm not going to argue that bitcoin is an efficient currency for all purposes right now, but I don't think it has to be one in order to have value.  Plus, currencies fluctuate in value all the time.  The USD lost about 0.5% of its value today.  Obviously that's not huge volatility relative to cryptos, but it's also not displaying perfect stability.  Perhaps at some point bitcoin will be used as widely as the dollar, and its volatility will subside.  At that point, it probably won't be a great investment vehicle any more, but by then early adopters will be able to enjoy the massive increase in utility created along the way.

But BCH is down more than BTC over the past hour, day and 7 days according to CMC.  I think your explanation misses the mark.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:25:30
Yeah, and the stock markets are at ATHs and have climbed for nearly 9 years straight with barely a pause.  At least buying BTC at 40-50% off its ATHs seems like a relative bargain.
Plus, it's not like stocks vs. cryptos is necessarily an either-or decision.  Do you invest in just stocks or just bonds or just real estate?  Diversification across asset classes is recommended according to Modern Porfolio Theory, and since cryptos have shown little correlation to traditional asset classes, it makes sense to allocate a portion of a well-diversified portfolio into cryptos IMO.

Technology improves -&gt; Utility Improves -&gt; Price trends upward over the long term as more people seek access to that utility.
Also, keep in mind that as the supply of worldwide fiat grows more quickly than the supply of BTC, the fiat-denominated value of BTC should trend upward over the long term, even if the technology and utility are unchanged (assuming no increase in competition for deflationary stores of value).

I haven't tried bitcoin.tax, but I've heard good things.  I figure my spreadsheet probably gives me more flexibility with choosing specific lots, and also lets me keep track of the exact dollar value at the time of a trade (instead of just using the day's average trading price as bitcoin.tax uses IIRC).  But if I were starting from scratch now, I might be tempted to use bitcoin.tax since it's surely a lot simpler/easier than building an entire spreadsheet.

I hear ya.  In some ways crypto and TA are similarly self-fulfilling: if enough people believe in them, they have value.  But they can also have value/utility that is independent of people's perceptions.  It can be difficult to draw the line between the inherent value and the value attributable to people's perceptions.  To a point, it doesn't really matter where you draw the line: do whatever works for you.

That's why Lightning Network is important.  Most transactions would be transmitted off-chain and wouldn't be subject to the on-chain transaction fees.

GDAX batches withdrawal transactions, so sending from GDAX instead of Coinbase is a net benefit to the mempool situation.
And if you choose to close your Coinbase account, at least send your coins out via GDAX first so you don't contribute to clogging up the mempool on your way out.

TA doesn't provide perfect forecasting of the future.  It provides tools to better understand the present.  If you have a framework to identify the current trend and important areas of support and resistance, you can optimize your entries and exits and trade alongside the prevailing trend instead of against it.  Even gaining a slight edge can pay off in the long run.  If you're counting cards in Vegas you won't know with 100% certainty what the next card will be, but shifting the probabilities even slightly can be quite valuable.
That said, if you're referring to Tone Vays's 'Random Number Generator', I don't find that indicator particularly useful.  I think the best TA is simple and easy to explain, justify, and replicate.  Simply watching the patterns of highs and lows, as well as patterns in volume, is enough to put you ahead of the crowd IMO.

The only aspect that gave me pause was the mining/trivia mechanic.  I'm not a huge fan of trivia games, and it seems like a strange feature to fit into what is otherwise a pretty strategic (looking) game.  I guess it could create some fun interactions and add some tension from having to come up with answers quickly.  I'll be interested to see how it plays.
Great choices for the heroes' (villians') faces on the paper currency.  They support the theme and could inspire some great conversations about each of the characters' impact on the space.

There's no requirement that markets be regulated in order for T/A to 'work'. After all, Japanese candlestick analysis was developed prior to the 18th century when I'm sure they didn't have anything close to the rigorous regulatory regime that US financial markets enjoy today.
If participants have emotions, then there's an opportunity for T/A to assist in analyzing shifts in those emotions.
But in any market when there's low volume/liquidity, there's greater potential for manipulation which can lead to some false signals and noise when performing T/A. That doesn't mean T/A doesn't work...just that you have to be more careful and be ready to unwind a position if a move turns out to be a false breakout/breakdown.
I dispute the premise that T/A doesn't work in crypto. A simple moving average-based trend-following strategy works just fine, but most people want or expect T/A to predict the future with certainty, which it has never promised to do.

That relationship isn't very reliable. Both were down in 2018, and both are up in 2019.

The more they are adopted, the more fees will tend to drop.  The fees depend on demand for block space, and each of those will make better use of the block space.
The cost of transactions will also drop in dollar terms when the price of BTC drops in dollar terms (all else being equal).  So even though the mempool is pretty full right now due to all the panic and transferring BTC to and from exchanges, when this decline settles down the dollar cost of transactions will likely be much lower than a month ago.

I don't see any reason why the relationship would be different now. I assume there will continue to be some days where they trade in the same direction, and some where they trade in opposite directions. Bitcoin mostly marches to the beat of its own drum.
But I think it depends on what is driving the stock market higher or lower on a given day. If it's trade tensions, currency volatility, and crashing interest rates driving the stock market lower, then yes bitcoin could benefit. But sometimes the stock market rallies on bad news because investors expect the Fed to be more accomodative, which could lead to BTC and stocks moving upward together. Alternatively, when BTC is in the process of consolidating massive gains (like now) it would take a pretty big news event to move sentiment so I think on days like today BTC doesn't care much what the stock market is doing, and will drift toward support to see whether that support holds.
If anything, nowadays I suspect they might trade in unison more often than not. The stock market is hanging on every word by the Fed, and bitcoin probably also appreciates having more liquidity sloshing around. But there's a lot of bitcoin-specific news/sentiment that could flip that relationship on a dime.

Yeah, I think your message is important.  I'll be concerned about a high likelihood of a massive sell-off when too many people are taking on too much leverage to buy BTC.  By definition, that's not 'investing what you can afford to lose'.
The bull market will be healthier and more sustainable if hodlers limit their purchases to amounts they could comfortably afford to lose.  Otherwise panic will inevitably become self-reinforcing, and flash crashes will destroy some people's financial futures.  
Just as the health and stability of the code must be maintained, the financial health and stability of hodlers is important to the success of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-04 21:45:41
Good point.  I also wonder whether the wash trading rule will apply to bitcoin, i.e., if you take a loss on a sale and buy the same asset within 30 days, you cannot claim that loss but instead adjust the cost basis upward on your newly-acquired holding by the amount of the loss on the previous sale.
As far as I know there is no clear guidance on this issue, and it could severely complicate the 'use and replace' BTC methodology.  It's also not an issue as long as BTC always goes up, so hopefully the BTC price continues to always go up. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:27
I see your point, and yes I think true adoption as a currency for smaller transactions will require a successful launch of LN.  It's currently useful for larger purchases where the fees are predictably small relative to the overall purchase (houses, lambos), and it's useful as a currency for trading altcoins because it's the unit of account in the crypto space.
Like you indicated its use as a currency is limited until LN is released.  But I agree with thieflar that investing in BTC as a store of value is an important use-case at the moment, and I believe it will be more useful as a currency eventually due to the fact that its adoption as a store of value is expanding greatly at the moment.

One point of clarification: GBTC is not an ETF (which is an open-ended fund that can create/redeem shares to keep the market price in line with the net asset value).  If it were an ETF it wouldn't trade at a premium.
The trade Citron is recommending is basically a bet that an ETF will be approved before you get margin-called out of your short position due to an expanding premium.  Alternatively, the bet could succeed if enough investment interest is diverted from GBTC into futures that the premium falls.  It's a decent bet if you have the liquidity and patience to wait for it to play out.  But just going long BTC is easier and likely more profitable.

*Coinbase* is investigating.  I doubt Coinbase will come to the conclusion that Coinbase was guilty of insider trading.  
If a low-level employee or two is found to be in violation of Coinbase's policies and fired, then will that put the matter to rest, or will the mob demand that the CFTC, SEC, FDIC and DHS all launch their own investigations?
I just think this is all a little silly.  People are mad that BTC is falling in price and BCH is rising in price, and I don't like seeing those trends either.  My crypto portfolio is 65% BTC and &lt;2% BCH.  I understand that people are already mad at Coinbase for their S2X support, and their slowness in rolling out Segwit.  I think that creates an environment where any technical or communication error gets blown completely out of proportion.
The fact is, no matter how well they communicated this move or how many people did or didn't facilitate insider trading, the market sees BCH as more valuable and BTC less valuable than it did yesterday morning, given this news.  And begging US government agencies to start sticking their noses in the largest US crypto exchange won't change that fact.  But it certainly may have unintended consequences that the community will like even less than the price charts of the last 24 hours.

If I'm presented with a single hedge fund or financial institution whose decision to avoid investing in BTC hinges on some redditor's misspelling of 'hold', then I'll see more merit in the argument.
The market price and growing adoption indicate that it's not really hindering BTC's success.  'Hodl' is simply one element of the culture that has formed around BTC and cryptos.  And it has an important message embedded in it: prepare yourself to ride out some volatility if you want to participate in this space.  In that sense, I think hodl is an efficient and catchy method of transmitting that message to noobs, and is an asset to BTC instead of a liability.

Agree on your first paragraph.  But you lost me in the 2nd:
Any technology that expands the use-cases and improves the utility of Bitcoin should increase the value of the Bitcoin protocol.  If the currency's value is related to the number of transactions (as you indicated above), then the addition of technology that enables fast, cheap transactions on a second layer should increase the value of the currency.  I think the technology that makes the protocol useful is an important element of the valuation.

And to complicate the issue further, the base unit is IOTA, but it's usually quoted in MIOTA, like in your post.
It's all arbitrary.  It blows my mind that people can't understand that.  
It's sort of a double-edged sword for BTC because the high unit price of bitcoin reinforces in people's minds its high value, but also makes people think it's too 'expensive'.  And yet if 1 MIOTA reaches $100, many people would still think it's cheap even though that would equate to a market cap greater than BTC's.

The thing is: everyone doesn't do the same thing at the same time.  A majority can certainly be trying to aggressively get in or out of an asset at any given time, causing a huge spike or slump in price, but the change in price causes other people to come into the market to take advantage of what they see as a good deal.

Yeah, I have a hard time reading the sentiment in the crypto space right now.  Many people outside it are confident it's a bubble and are thus very bearish but unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.  Many longs are saying it has run too far too fast, and are either taking profits or buckling up for some volatility.  I don't see too many people expecting prices to go much higher in the short term (although it's hard to rule it out as a possibility, based on the recent past), so even given the run up I don't think sentiment is excessively positive.
I don't know where it's headed from here.  My base case is a 'sell the news' pullback early next week after futures are released.  But I don't really expect significant or sustained downside (I consider touching 10K insignificant).  The uptrend has been driven by sharply rising adoption and the beginning of institutional interest.  Those factors will not disappear overnight even in a sell-off, and I'm still surrounded by people who want to put more money into BTC but are constrained by deposit limits or other barriers.
We've seen sharp pullbacks and sharp recoveries.  The availability of shorting could make those recoveries even sharper and more panic-fueled.
In summary, I don't think the price is an obvious long or short in the short term.  I expect volatility in both directions.  But I wouldn't count out the long side.  It's rare that a rally dies just at the moment that institutions start taking an asset more seriously, and gain greater access to it.  Usually the big top occurs after institutions have sold to the 'dumb money', and I think that doesn't happen until an ETF is released.
But we shall see.  To borrow your words: "I could be wrong of course".

My response was at least half serious.  All the people who are 'sooooo tired of HODLing an asset that only has lost value' since they bought it....when they finally throw in the towel, sell pressure will evaporate and a bull market will likely begin to form. No offense intended.  That's just generally how speculative markets work.
If you're seeking words of wisdom from some of the same people who said it wouldn't go below 10K, 9K, 6.5K, etc., then you're investing in hope rather than Bitcoin.  Nobody knows exactly when the market will turn, and as long as a good chunk of the hodlers are desperately holding out hope that a bull market is imminent, it probably won't be.  Markets like to inflict the maximum pain possible, and when there's more sustained pain to inflict on bears than bulls, then we might start seeing bullish behavior.
Or when an ETF gets approved.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:22:38
Is it really that big a problem if other coins are given space to succeed in their own unique ways while Bitcoin follows its own path in a deliberate manner?  Especially assuming no one coin consolidates all the investor, developer, and user interest.
Decentralization within Bitcoin is important, and decentralization in the crypto space also strikes me as important: i.e., a multitude of coins with different characteristics and use cases further insulates the crypto space from external attacks.
If people want to move away from Bitcoin because of the fees, then the transactions and fees will decline.  The bitcoin can then move to stronger and more patient hands who are willing to wait for LN.  I don't see a problem with any of that.  It would cause the price to cool down in the short term, but would that be such a disaster?  I could survive a few months without a fresh all time high.

Does your valuation model account for the probability that LN is successfully launched, and the effect it would likely have on the number of transactions?
Markets usually anticipate future value, so it would seem that a model focused only on current metrics misses a key component of the market-driven valuation.  For example, I could value Amazon based on their current P/E and assets, but investors generally base their valuations on projected future cash flows, earnings, and assets.  If I only considered the current metrics, my valuation results would be overly conservative, no?

Death of Mt Gox, Death of Silk Road, S2X....just to name a few.
Each one compromised people's faith in a structurally important aspect of BTC: major on/off-ramp, major use case / source of demand, and the cohesion of the community itself.
Futures just create a derivative tied to BTC price.  Will it cause extra volatility or dampen it?  I'm not certain, but the BTC community is used to volatility so higher volatility won't shake faith in the protocol.  If it lowers volatility....that would be okay too.
If people want to short bitcoin they can do it right now.  But it's an extremely risky activity, and will still be risky when futures are available.  So I think most shorting will be hedged by long positions in other futures or actual BTC.  
But really it doesn't matter.  Real BTC is more powerful than BTC derivatives...derivatives are not uncensorable or immutable.  So I'm confident that real BTC will dictate how the futures trade, rather than vice versa.

No, the ideal bitcoin would be one with LN, so it can be even more useful than it is now.  But store of value is a legitimate use case in the meantime.
Merchant transactions will have a greater demand for quick inclusion in blocks than store of value investors shuffling their assets around.  I agree that someone trading millions in bitcoin won't care about a 10 dollar fee, but I think the goal is to reinforce store of value for now, and spread it far and wide until LN is available for quick/cheap transactions.
But really, anyone can use it however they want given the characteristics of the network at the time, and their needs.  But the cost of those uses will be an important consideration for most people.  Thus, we need LN to widen the scope of use cases.

Meh.  BTC needed a pullback.  Coinbase can add whatever coins they want and they don't necessarily have to tell anyone.  If they had told everyone they were allowing BCH trading weeks beforehand, the price would've pumped in anticipation.  Now the surprise is getting ripped off like a Band-Aid (whenever their BCH trading actually starts working).
I think the level of freaking out and anger at Coinbase is a little over-the-top at this point. People are suggesting getting the SEC involved....absurd.  If BTC can't handle this type of 'attack', then it's not as antifragile as everyone always says.

Then add testnet lightning network to the list.
Network effects include more developers working directly on BTC, or working on second layers or additional services built on BTC.  The utility can improve, and many hodlers expect it to.  One man's rampant speculation is another man's rational estimation of the value of future utility.
I've had no issues converting BTC to fiat.  I've avoided large fees too, by purposefully sending transactions when the mempool isn't full....also by keeping some BTC on GDAX and letting them batch and pay the network fee on my behalf.
Alternatives can claim superiority, but they can't prove it until they are tested at scale.  Ethereum getting bogged down by a cat breeding game was unthinkable a couple months ago.  Other alternatives may not get the opportunity to prove they can scale better.
Feel free to diversify within the crypto space in order to spread out your risk, but I'm 75% bitcoin because of the features I listed above.  Bitcoin has a higher likelihood of success than any alternative, in my estimation.

Fair enough.  We'll see.  I think Tether is more of a meme than institutional investors.  I've spoken with some institutional crypto investors...there are definitely hedge funds focused on the space.  I'm not sure how much they're raising and I certainly don't think it will be a widespread institutional holding overnight, but it doesn't take much to move the needle.  
I think Tether concerns are overblown.  If Tether were printing more USDT than the market demanded, the price wouldn't be pegged as well as it is.  But maybe it'll blow up some day - if so, good riddance.  BTC dominance would likely go through the roof.
I think we'll have a bitcoin ETF within 18 months regardless of what happens (or doesn't happen) to Tether.   But I guess we'll see how it plays out.

@_date: 2018-08-17 20:14:28
Yeah as a current hodler of GBTC I like it less, but I should probably just switch to the ETN while there's still a GBTC premium.  I assumed any significant premium shrinking would accompany an ETF approval that would boost the BTC price and be somewhat of a wash for GBTC's price.  But instead the ETN hasn't gained as much attention or boosted BTC's price as much as a widely reported ETF approval likely would, so I seem to be getting the short end of this stick.
I generally avoid ETNs because of the credit risk, and I haven't yet looked into the issuer to gain comfort with that risk.  I guess it's time to look into them before the premium decays more.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:45:34
That's a pretty bold call...potentially beyond the depths of the last bear market?
Personally I don't see reasonable likelihood of any price below 1300 unless something breaks in the protocol.  That was the previous high that had to be broken 5 years ago, and the network has advanced significantly since then: ubiquitous hardware wallets, institutional custody, futures, potential ETF, not to mention the entire crypto space around Bitcoin.  Its fair value is much greater now than it was then.  That's my opinion at least.
Would you buy it if it reached your $100-500 target?
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:16:54

All else being equal I'd prefer stock buybacks which aren't taxable events for investors, versus paying dividends which are taxable events. And really they're just 2 ways to return capital to investors.
The underlying issue that I think you're raising relates to the fact that so many companies aren't finding adequate ways to invest in growing their companies so they return capital instead.  That's somewhat problematic...but as an investor I'd prefer that situation to the one where the companies spend carelessly.
Overall I disagree with the characterization of buybacks as manipulation, and agree with the points raised by u/NotSeeTroll.  As long as their actions are publicly disclosed I don't see a problem with a company managing their balance sheet as they see fit.

At times I wonder whether we could use some Teddy Roosevelt style trust busting.
But I'm not sure it's appropriate for many industries nowadays. I think one reason US administrations are hesitant to go down that path is that competition is more fierce internationally than it was in Teddy's days.  Various countries like China have their State Owned Enterprises and can provide them regulatory or financial support long enough for them to grab market share.  Plus, what would breaking up Google really accomplish, for example?  There's nothing preventing someone from using an alternative service, and there's nothing preventing the majority of people from using the same service.  And as we've seen with Bitcoin, network effects are of paramount importance.  If I had to create a profile on Facebook1, Facebook2, and Facebook3 just to keep in contact with all my friends I might give up on the whole thing (more than I have already).

It's not an either/or situation.  Gold didn't stop having value when people started using fiat.  Bitcoin can serve people in many ways that distinguish it from digital fiat or physical metals.  Namely, if you're afraid of a debt or currency crisis in your country, you might want to store some of your wealth in an asset like bitcoin.  If you want to protect your wealth from inflation while taking advantage of multisignature capabilities and without reliance on a custodian, you might want an asset like bitcoin.  If you want a noncorrelated asset to diversify your QE-inflated portfolio, you might consider an asset like bitcoin.
Digital fiat can be useful, but I'm not going to hold any significant value on Venmo for any length of time.

Different professional investors look for different characteristics for their investments.  Some seek illiquid and high-volatility investments because those markets are less efficient, and because they can often generate higher returns over time to compensate for the additional risk.
Bitcoin could be (it's probably too early to say for sure) an asset that will tend to move with low or negative correlations to traditional asset classes.  Many professional investors like to own assets with low or negative correlations to their existing holdings since doing so can lower the risk of their overall portfolio.  As bonds and stocks have exhibited higher correlations with each other recently, managers are looking especially hard at assets that won't correlate with those two asset classes. 
I don't think professional investors, broadly speaking, are avoiding bitcoin because of volatility.  I think custody concerns and the imprecise nature of any valuation method are probably bigger concerns than the volatility, but a handful of professional investors are willing to dip their toes into the water.  As custody options improve, I suspect even more will do so.

Each side failed stay on topic.  The question debated was (paraphrasing b/c I watched this morning):
"Bitcoin is not in a bubble, and will continue to exist."
Neither side gave an argument for the current 'fair' value of BTC.  One could argue that bitcoin was in a bubble in Dec/Jan, but does that mean it's still currently in a bubble?  And just because something was in a bubble before doesn't mean it's worthless now or overvalued now (see Nasdaq circa 2000).  But no one brought any analysis to the table showing that BTC at 8K is a fair or unfair price.
The second part of the topic wasn't given enough attention either.  Patrick addressed it a little, but I think the discussion could have benefited form more discussion on the robustness of the protocol.  It survived huge fluctuations in hashrate last year after the BCH fork.  It survived a period of full mempools and fees spiking higher.  It's survived numerous bubbles and crashes.  The protocol itself has proven quite resilient, and I think the debate needed more focus on that topic.
Regarding the opposition side's arguments, they were particularly off-topic.  Posner kept bringing up a study that 25% of transaction are illegal.  I recall a separate study that concluded less than 1% are illegal, so I would have liked to see that brought up in a counterargument, but regardless the percentage of illegal transactions is irrelevant. Bitcoin's value comes from its censorship resistance, so some of its transactions will likely be used in a manner that some governments don't approve of.  So what?  The market knows that's the case, and yet still consistently values bitcoin&gt;$0.
And Tett noted a $500M 'bitcoin hack' in Japan, but I'm sure she was probably referring to the theft of NEM.  That was a mildly annoying error that probably won her side a few points.
I can only take a bitcoin bear seriously if they give an argument for what the fair value actually is.  If they say zero, I can ignore the rest of their arguments since they obviously don't understand why markets consistently value BTC above that level.  If they say $1K I'll stick around to hear their reasoning.  But simply saying it's a bubble or used for illegal activities is not a compelling argument.  A network for censorship-resistant value storage and transfer is worth SOMETHING (especially a network as widely-known as Bitcoin), and if they don't understand that fact they shouldn't be debating the topic.

Over what time frame?  Anything &gt;10 months and BTC wins.  Of course there's volatility and a predictable bear market after a multi-year 100x bull.    
Position sizing mitigates the impact of the bear markets.  0.1 - 5% BTC in one's portfolio depending on risk tolerance is reasonable  for most people.  A Turk with 5% BTC, 10% gold, 10% USD, and 75% Lira would have less risk/volatility than one who's 100% Lira.

Your whole post is nonsense.


You just pulled this entire paragraph out of your ass and plugged numbers in there to make it seem more legitimate. "500" "guarantee" "100 to 1".  You're welcome to post your opinions but plugging numbers in between your opinions doesn't make them more legitimate.
Are you asserting that 99% of professional traders who use TA will lose more money than they make?  How has TA persisted if it's so overwhelmingly successful in leading people to ruin?
There are entire firms and investment strategies based off trend-following.  There are academic papers studying the momentum factor in stocks and whether it provides excess returns, and most papers I've seen agree that it does.
And there's rationale behind it.  If institutions are accumulating an asset, they often do so slowly and methodically over time.  If a fundamental change has occurred, it often takes markets some time before they have fully discounted those changes.  If you can determine the prevailing trend and trade alongside it instead of against it, you're better off than the person buying and selling blindly.
One thing most of these TA rants miss is that TA is often about figuring out when *not* to trade, rather than figuring out with precision which direction the market is going to go at all times.  Avoiding making bad trades is much more important than making good ones.  Plenty of 'fundamental' traders have lost money too but I'm not going to carelessly throw out some 100 to 1 losers to winners claim because I don't have that data.  And it doesn't matter either.  There are skilled fundamental analysts and skilled technical analysts.  And there are shitty versions of each and they're usually the loudest in the room.  It doesn't mean that it's all luck and we should just give up at improving our FA and and TA skill sets.

Yeah stock market investors have become complacent, so today's drop was pretty jarring.  And many market segments participated in the fall, some of which are seen as noncorrelated or less-correlated: public REITs, commodities, etc.  If BTC can simply continue to stay relatively stable during stock market declines, its attractiveness for institutions will increase.  Modern Portfolio Theory highlights the need for truly uncorrelated assets, and hopefully BTC will continue to prove its value in that sense.

One thing that I haven't seen answered by the paper is this:
If Tethers are printed by Finex and converted into BTC en masse suddenly during a pullback in BTC....why doesn't that crash the price of USDT/USD at least temporarily?  And in order for traders to arbitrage the price back to $1, they either need to sell some crypto into USDT (offsetting the impact of the alleged manipulation) or put more USD into Kraken to buy USDT directly (but the paper indicates Kraken isn't a meaningful source of volume during the pullbacks).
And wash trading is not an acceptable answer in my view, since maintaining effective wash trading would be roughly as costly as the alleged benefit Finex would receive from the USDT printing.

Okay....but that doesn't answer the question.  What makes this cycle different?  BTC wasn't used for taxes in 2013-2015 either, and yet the market crash still found a bottom above the previous highs.
BTC is more widely known and understood than in the previous cycle.  The service providers are more robust and reputable (on average).  Institutional custodial services are now available.  Lightning is available.  I see many reasons why the fundamentals are better than in the previous cycle, but I don't understand how you see BTC's market cap heading below $1.7B.  
A protocol that stores and transfers value in a censorship-resistant manner has some value, regardless of whether it's used to pay taxes.  Why is that value now less than $1.7B when in the bleakest depths of the last cycle the participants thought its value was greater than that?

If your 401K plan is structured in a way that allows you to purchase any security in it, you can buy GBTC directly via your 401K brokerage account (as long as you're comfortable with the premium to NAV).  However, many 401K plans are more limited in the investment options they offer.
I've heard of a Bitcoin IRA product.  That would involve rolling over your 401K into an IRA, and setting up an account (I think through Gemini) that would hold your bitcoin.  When I last looked at it, the fees made it fairly pointless for smaller accounts so I didn't delve into the details.
Regardless of whether you opt to buy GBTC or hold BTC in an IRA via Gemini, you're going to have to get comfortable with trusting a custodian.  There may be an option to set up a self-directed IRA where you hold the bitcoin personally, but I haven't explored that option.
There shouldn't be any tax implications if you do it right.  Rolling over a 401K to an IRA is not taxable.

But Putin tends to by driven more by pragmatism than ideology, so if he can be shown that cryptos can lead the world in a direction that he desires, then I think he would be willing to forge a tactical alliance with cryptos.  I think he's still trying to assess the impact cryptos will likely have on the world become committing to one side or the other.

Transactions don't require a significant amount of energy (in LN or main chain BTC). Finding blocks requires energy. Thus, 450 kWh/transaction is an extremely misleading metric.
Since LN transactions happen off-chain then more transactions can be processed every minute or hour, compared to on-chain transactions. So in that sense they are more efficient energy-wise. But it's not very relevant to compare energy cost per transaction since the transactions themselves aren't energy-intensive.

Not necessarily.  GBTC trades at a premium to its net asset value ('NAV').  That premium has been as low as 20% and as high as 100% (IIRC).  In a sell-off it may decline more than BTC, and in a rally it might increase more than BTC...all depending on whether the premium is expanding/contracting.  There was a significant rally in BTC where GBTC even went sideways.  So while the NAV of GBTC will track BTC, the movement in GBTC's price is less certain.
That being said, I own some GBTC in a retirement account because it's the easiest way to invest retirement money in a BTC-linked security.  But I bought when the premium was toward the low end of its range, and now it's toward the high end of the range.  So at the moment, buying BTC directly is probably the wiser move, especially outside a retirement account.

He still hasn't set up an exchange account, and now says BTC's too expensive.  I'm not sure what valuation metric drove his original decision to want to buy at 5K, but I suspect he'll eventually be FOMO'ing at 10K or 15K.  Or maybe he'll just be counting his regrets instead.

True.  The legacy banking system will continue to be the factor preventing ultimate price efficiency.  I'm not a huge fan of UDST (although I'm not as concerned as some about its potential to blow up in the short term), but perhaps it can help deliver some pricing efficiencies for the exchanges that list it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:43:59
Any chance this is driven by the on-again-off-again forking prompting people moving coins to and from exchanges to try to claim them or sell them quickly?
It looks like most of the buildup is in the 120-160 Sat/Byte range.  Above or below that range it's not too crowded (except on the really low end, where it at least looks as crowded as normal).  Spamming at 120-160 Sat/B seems like a strange and expensive strategy when cheaper fee levels are wide open.
Edit: Never mind.  I read your post more carefully and you're making the case that the high fees relative to the amount sent is an indication of spam.  I still wonder if there's another explanation.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:23:45
Agreed.  I support the proposed bill eliminating tax consequences for purchases below $600 using BTC.  However, the current rules are what they are.....unfortunately.
If the USG's only defense of the dollar is making the tax consequences of using BTC burdensome, then I think BTC has a great future ahead of it.  Software can eliminate most of the headaches.

It's a curious feature of the banking system that they will give you quick access to your funds when you don't really need them, and give you slower access to your funds when you do need them.  Bitcoin doesn't care how long I've been a customer or what my normal balance is.

Yeah, that's why I initially thought it was exchange movement, since exchanges often have a flat withdrawal fee regardless of the amount sent.

I would not have a stop-loss in place any time around the fork.  That's a good way to get your coins shaken loose by fork volatility.

Totally agree.  It deserves a premium because of how accessible it is in regular brokerage/retirement accounts.  If/when an ETF gets approved, that premium will shrink, but the explosion higher in BTC price should more than compensate for that falling premium.
I bought some 2 weeks ago in my 401K account, and I'm already up 35%.  I'm looking forward to my BCH dividend, and hoping they'll treat S2X similarly.

As soon as an ETF is approved, BTC will likely rocket higher and offset much of the premium decline from GBTC.  In fact, until the ETF is actually released, GBTC will probably still carry a premium, albeit a diminished one, because it'll still be the only way to access BTC-like exposure in a regular brokerage account.
I'll probably continue to hodl it in my 401K even after the ETF announcement (but sell before the ETF launch).  +115% in 40 days is by far the best trade I've made in a retirement account.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:40:50
You might want to hodl onto GBTC until after the 6th to claim your BCH dividedn.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:25:12
I'm not worried about futures.  It's simply the next step in bringing BTC exposure to a wider audience of participants.  Additional next step: ETF.
There are both bulls and bears on Wall Street.  Some may want the price to fall, while the others are eager to squeeze the shorts.
Hodlers still have the power, since they have no carrying costs, and since their actions on exchanges will determine the settlement pricing for futures.  Institutions can only truly hedge their futures exposure (to the extent they want/need to) by buying/selling/borrowing actual BTC.  Shorting BTC can be dangerous....especially in the midst of a huge bull market.  I'd be worried about an institution's ability to survive shorting bitcoin, as opposed to bitcoin's ability to survive an institution shorting it.

Yeah I'm sure some institutions will pay it.  Hell, I'm paying a 2% management fee for my GBTC shares, not to mention the premium over BTC's price I paid at time of purchase.  But it was worth it (to me) for the convenience of easily getting BTC exposure in my 401K.
I guess I'm spoiled by constantly falling ETF fees, and now spoiled by 0% GDAX trading/withdrawal costs, and zero storage fees for my own BTC.  But you're right, institutions can easily pass along a 1.2% cost, and their clients will happily pay it for the convenience and perceived security.
Once the market matures a bit, those custody fees will surely come down though.  Otherwise, I'll need to get into the institutional BTC custody business.

TA can be applied generally because the human emotions of fear and greed are similar regardless of the asset being traded/analyzed.  But I disagree with their interpretation.  The chart shows a triple-top, but that doesn't necessarily suggest we're heading into a bear market.  The chart is consolidating on low volume in a fairly tight range near the highs.  The strength of the run from 5800 was extremely bullish, and the fact that the consolidation is sideways on low volume suggests to me that we're heading to new highs after the market has caught its breath.  
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:32:59
Obviously they're not the same. But if there were any chance of anything significant coming from the impeachment we'd see it in stocks first since they're a more liquid and efficient asset class than crypto. Hence, the lack of impact on stocks implies there's not going to be any effect on crypto either.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:39:25
Technically it's not an ETF, because ETFs must allow Authorized Participants to create/redeem shares in the ETF at the net asset value.  ETFs are open-ended funds with fluctuating numbers of shares outstanding, while GBTC has a fixed number of shares outstanding, thus allowing it to trade at a premium or discount (theoretically).

Thankfully my policy covers all types of asteroids, meteors, and meteorites.

Technically (per the IRS) spending bitcoin IS cashing out profits (assuming you bought the coins at a lower price than the price when you're spending them).
If the coins came from outside Coinbase, then Coinbase can only report the dollar value of the purchases at the time, and would not know the cost basis / net profits / hodling period.  But to avoid getting a nasty letter or audit notice from the IRS, you should maintain some good records of the dollar values at the time of each purchase and sale (including purchases made using BTC).
If I ever get a Shift card, I'll only spend coins bought via Coinbase so the record-keeping is hopefully easier.

What an absolute non-story.  I wonder if they compared "Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card" trends to "Buy Bitcoin with Cash".  Because the charts look very similar.  I also compared "Short Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin is a Bubble" and their charts look similar to the others.  In fact, "Short Bitcoin" is searched more often than "Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card".  How does that factor into their sentiment analysis?
There is a confounding variable they're ignoring.  "Bitcoin" is the common factor in all these searches.  Perhaps people just want to learn more about it.  And it doesn't concern me if a few noobs open Coinbase accounts and max out their weekly Coinbase buy limit of $500.  That's hardly a sell signal in light of the incoming futures and institutional interest.

No, a new block is found roughly every 10 minutes regardless of how many transactions are in it, and regardless of how many transactions are happening off-chain via LN. 
If no transactions are put in that block, the block still requires energy to find. And regardless of whether 1M transactions are made via LN or zero are made via LN, the cost to mine the main-chain block will be the same.
The energy cost is for securing the network as a whole, not related to the transactions themselves (in any meaningful way).
TBF the number of transactions that can fit inside each block on the main chain are limited. The benefit of LN is that the number of transactions that can be made via LN are NOT directly constrained by the block size since LN transactions occur off-chain.

Yeah, governments could certainly conspire with banks to manipulate it - higher OR lower.  But the CME's circuit breakers could limit the effectiveness of that type of attack.  Also, we saw with the China ban that strong reactions to policy news can be reversed nearly as quickly.
With futures, and eventually ETFs, BTC is becoming more insulated from wild policy shifts (in the US at least).  There are progressively more stakeholders (and more powerful stakeholders) who would be impacted by policy changes, so more discussion is needed prior to proposing and justifying any major changes in policy.
I'm increasingly convinced that policymakers know they have to prioritize economic growth and productivity growth in order to keep the financial system humming along.  They may not fully understand or like bitcoin, but they are beginning to understand that they cannot simply ban blockchains and must try to live with blockchains.  To that end, it would be foolish to try to restrict 'legitimate' uses of BTC or blockchains in financial markets when other countries would gladly step in to fill the regulatory void.  ICOs are the easier targets, and at this point regulators aren't even coming down too hard on them, so I think BTC is fairly insulated from a regulatory perspective at the moment.

From another perspective, BTC spent most of 2017 below 3K.  And it's spent all of 2018 so far above 5.5K. (+83.3%)
Alternatively, the average price in 2017 was roughly 4K and the average price in 2018 has been 8K. (+100%)
Either way you look at it, if you smooth out the effect of the outlier months the price is reflecting a significant increase in people's confidence in BTC from 2017 to 2018.
It's hard not to focus on the couple months of extreme hype, but I'm quite encouraged when I step back and consider the price in the right context.
I remember how excited I was when BTC hit 3K in August of last year.  Sometime around then I predicted it would hit 20K by the end of 2020.  Back then I would have been pumped if I'd known BTC would be at 6300 now.  
I'm keeping my focus on the long game.

Why would they be borrowing and shorting OTC instead of simply selling (OTC or otherwise)?  If they wanted to lower their exposure to BTC selling outright is the cheaper and simpler way to do so.

Somewhere I saw that they were considering spinning off a separate trust for BCH and distributing it to GBTC owners so they could choose whether to sell or hodl.  That could get really messy, and unnecessarily expensive for them to manage.  BGold Trust?  S2X Trust?  All distributed to holders as of the date of the respective forks?  What a mess...
I hope they find a simple, elegant solution.

Good question.
With BCH they said they would distribute those proceeds pro rata to the holders as of Aug 1.....once I realized that, I was disappointed that I couldn't consider BCH as part of the post-Aug 1 NAV.
But that plan seems quite tricky logistically, and AFAIK they haven't enacted it yet.  It might be a race between GBTC and Coinbase to see who can deliver BCH 'winnings' the slowest.
But back to S2X: I haven't seen any indications of whether they will treat it the same as BCH or differently.   I'm curious about BGold too, for that matter.
As a unit holder, I wish they would just liquidate the alt-chains as soon as they can safely do so, and buy more BTC with the proceeds.  I suppose that would be problematic if one day an alt-chain became the new BTC and they liquidated before that became apparent.  Perhaps if they waited a month or two until it was 99.99% clear which chain had won, then it could lessen their risk greatly (and also lessen the benefit to the NAV).
Some clarity on these points would be nice.  I can only imagine the legal, tax, logistical, and fiduciary duty implications of their decision.  Hopefully they find the optimal path and clarify/implement it soon.

What is the best way to account for network fees (i.e., the cost of making a transaction on the BTC network)?  Should I adjust the cost basis of a lot by the USD value of the network fee at the time of the transfer?  
As an example, let's say I buy 1 BTC at $8K.  I transfer it to a hardware wallet when BTC is trading at $10K, incurring a .0001 network fee ($1 at the time, but $0.80 at cost).  What is my cost basis of my remaining .9999 BTC?  The original $8K? Or $7,999? Or $7,999.20? Does incurring the network fee constitute a taxable event?  Have I essentially 'realized' a gain of $0.20, while incurring an expense of $1?  If so, how do I best account for those costs to offset some of my realized gains if/when I sell?

The premium is lower than your calcs suggest.  The market value of .09258535 BTC is around $555, much higher than $380.
I believe there's also some Bcash still owned by the trust, although I'm not certain on that point.
Even without the Bcash, that brings the premium down to ~26%.  Previously the premium was around 70%, so it's normalized quite a bit.  I've been watching it for a while, and had some cash to deploy in my 401K so I bought some GBTC yesterday.  I had been uncomfortable with the premium, but it's low enough now that if an ETF gets announced/approved, I feel the NAV will move up enough to compensate for the shrinking premium.  And if an ETF doesn't get approved soon, the premium will probably/hopefully remain in the 20s or higher.

Do you really want the $100K or do you want the purchasing power it represents?  If my bitcoin is worth $100K I don't need to sell it for USD.  I could exchange the bitcoin directly for any number of goods or services.

"Both stocks and BTC could fall hard. In fact I suspect the nightmare scenario is that stocks, bonds, BTC, etc all crash in unison."
Sounds like you've been reading too much ZH....haha j/k.
Capital has to flow somewhere, even in a crash.  Where would capital flow if it were leaving bonds, stocks, and BTC at the same time?  Physical cash (surely that would be BTC-positive)?  Short-term bonds? Real estate (which has also become quite pricey)?  Gold?  
I agree there's a potential for a broad sell-off in various overpriced assets, and I think BTC might be used as a source of liquidity at times, like gold was during 2008.  But that might just create a temporary buying opportunity that pays off when the printing presses get fired up again.  I would definitely be an opportunistic buyer if BTC sells off during an equity/bond crash.

Dunno.  I guess this is the first time we get to see a hard fork's effect on the SW/non-SW transaction mix, so there are a lot of potential explanations. Most cold storage will probably be in non-SW addresses, and people are more likely to pry their coins out of cold storage around the time of a hard fork.
I assume most exchanges send coins from non-SW addresses.  People moving their coins from exchanges could be enough to shift the mix.
It could also be explained by the intent of transactions.  I'd imagine if you're sending a $50 transaction to purchase an item, you're more likely to use an SW address.  But if you're moving 10 BTC from one wallet to another then you may not care if it's SW or not.  Around the fork the transaction mix is skewed toward 'pre-fork positioning' and away from purchasing inexpensive items from vendors.
Those are the best theories I've got.  It'll be interesting to see whether the SW% resumes its climb in the coming days.  fwiw, this fork incentivized me to put more coins in SW addresses than ever before, but that will only become apparent in the data when I later spend from my SW address.

The fund management company can't just buy a bunch of bitcoin and move it into the fund when it gets approved and then launches.  First, they don't know how much demand there will be.  Second, that would be seen as a conflict of interest...they'd have to buy and sell at prices available at exchanges/OTC or they could get in hot water with the SEC.  Do you think the first bitcoin ETF isn't going to be watched like a hawk by the SEC?  They will be extremely careful in the way they operate.  No front-running, no self dealing, etc.
Furthermore, the management company has plenty of potential upside from being the first ETF.  They don't need to speculate on the decision by buying up bitcoin beforehand.  They don't really care about the price of bitcoin....they'll collect their management fees regardless of the bitcoin price.
Individual people at Van Eck or the CBOE certainly may own some bitcoin but you're suggesting the fund itself is already invested and that there will be no actual purchasing of bitcoin if/when the fund is approved and launches.  That's not how ETFs work.  Bitcoin will be bought and sold, potentially on a daily basis, based on the demand for the fund to ensure the net asset value of the fund tracks the bitcoin price.  They can't just buy a bunch of BTC at 7500 and plop it into the fund when the price is 10K and pocket the difference.  The fund itself will have to be formed and funded before it can purchase bitcoin.

There will certainly be some funds that are more focused on trading or arbitrage, but I suspect the vast majority are long-only or long-biased.

Awesome article.
You mention that you can't switch between specific lots and FIFO. But I assume that if I'm using specific lots I can still choose my earliest-purchased lots on occasion, and then choose recently-purchased lots later.
Another way of asking the question: isn't FIFO a subset of specific lots?  I could effectively abide by FIFO for a while and then abide by specific lots, and then return to FIFO....but technically I'd simply just be choosing FIFO lots at times and recent lots at other times, all within the specific lot rule set.   Does that make sense?
I guess I'm asking why one would limit themselves to FIFO when the specific lot designation method allows more flexibility while also allowing one to choose the oldest lots when they want to.
Anyway, thanks for the article!

True, but good hedge fund managers should know how to manage risk, and accordingly should rely only on the 2% to keep the lights on instead of the 20% which isn't guaranteed - especially in an asset class where 10000% up-moves and 80% down-moves are common.


But if they're shorting to hedge, they will have to cover their short to realize the profits at some point anyway....presumably at a short term capital gains rate instead of long term.


True, but usually they're shorting similar but distinct securities, or hedging an individual security long position with a broad market short, in order to capture only the idiosyncratic risk related to a specific company while hedging away the broader equity market risk.  I'm not aware of any hedge funds who short the exact same asset/security that they are also holding long.  But I could be wrong...do you have any links that would indicate this is a commonly-used strategy?

Maybe it's not an either/or situation.  You can own real bitcoin in your own custody and also own a bitcoin ETF in an IRA.
The anti-ETF arguments remind me a lot of the anti-bitcoin gold bugs. "But what if the power goes out all over the world?  What will your bitcoin be worth then?"
There's a concept known as diversification.  Even when considering one asset, you can own it in different forms and within different structures for tax purposes.

@_date: 2018-07-13 15:53:36
GBTC trades at a premium to its underlying bitcoin holdings because shares of it aren't created/redeemed on a regular basis.  An ETF would allow APs (authorized participants) to create and redeem shares of the ETF so that it would trade much closer to the value of its underlying holdings.
Thus, an ETF would mostly eliminate the risk of expansion/contraction of the price premium and provide exposure just to the BTC price.

"Fix the problems, don't throw out the baby with the bathwater."
I'd suggest that dismissing ZH as anti-American propaganda represents 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater'.  It definitely has an anti-establishment message and highlights information that is not readily available in other financial news sources.  It certainly has a bearish bent, but that bearishness isn't focused solely on American stocks.  They've covered various European and Asian financial imbalances quite regularly.  
All too often nowadays, anti-establishment sources can be easily labeled and dismissed as anti-American or anti-European, or anti-whatever.  For example, Assange is considered to be running a 'hostile non-state intelligence service'.  But I think he's provided important information to the world, and he played a role in increasing popular awareness of bitcoin too.  If someone dismisses him as an anti-American propagandist, I think they will be missing out on some important information unavailable in MSM echo chambers.
In general, I don't shy away from anti-establishment news sources because I feel the only way I can get a balanced perspective is to seek them out as a counterweight to the numerous pro-establishment sources that accost me on a daily basis.  I recognize that I am surrounded by a cacophony of propaganda from all sides, and I try to weight each piece of information independently.  ZH may or may not be propaganda, but the rise in the value of tech stocks can be measured sufficiently objectively that I'm comfortable sharing that link without appearing anti-American.  I'm pro-America too, but that doesn't mean I'll ignore criticism of our leaders or policies, or ignore an innocuous article filled with objective facts because of accusations that the source is anti-American.  To each their own, I suppose.
Back to the topic at hand: any thoughts on the disconnect between US tech stocks adding $180B in market cap in day with a noticeable lack of bubble accusations, while a P2P payment protocol is widely considered a bubble for its $100B value earned over the course of 9 years?  
It strikes me that while $100B sounds like a lot of money to most folks, this story highlights how minuscule is still is in relation to global financial markets.  If we are indeed seeing the emergence of a new asset class (and I think we are), some of the more bullish price targets aren't unrealistic.

Do you have an example of a regulation that would send BTC to $0?

No I don't, which is why I was surprised to see the amount of cheerleading they did.  I'm noticing the change in the cheerleading trend, and wondering what's driving it.  Part of me thinks that some of the MSM have been made to feel guilty of their BTC cheerleading by Dimon and others.  Dimon basically placed the preemptive blame for his predicted BTC crash on MSM for talking about BTC every time it hit a new high.  Now they seem less eager to discuss the recent ATH.  I'll be watching closely to see their reactions during the next one.

Is taking profits in anticipation of a pullback also unethical?  The net effect is similar.
What about miners shorting BTC in order to lock in their future profits?
Having differing market views, and expressing them, doesn't strike me as unethical or less ethical.  In fact, I respect short-sellers more than the ignorant FUD-spreading nocoiners who don't even have the balls to put their money on the line.

Which infection are these economists suffering from?

Because risk appetites for one speculative asset with relatively little usage are correlated with risk appetites for another speculative asset with relatively little usage.

Exactly.  On top of that, an ETF is simply a wrapper and doesn't HAVE to track an index.  There are actively-managed ETFs that don't track indices.

tbf the ETF will be managed by the same lesbian Anunnaki who killed JFK and faked the moon landing, so I can understand people's concerns.

Schwab took almost 5 minutes to confirm some trades I made toward the bottom.  Reminded me of Coinbase during times of high volume.

No.  When you log into GDAX you hit the Deposit button, and there's an option to transfer from Coinbase instantly for free. Then the withdrawal process from GDAX is similar to Coinbase's.
Your only potential challenge might be daily withdrawal limits depending on how much CB/GDAX has approved you for.  But that should be the same for either of those platforms AFAIK.  If they make you split your withdrawals into smaller amounts then that could be annoying but that's all the more reason to withdraw from GDAX since you wouldn't be racking up network fees each time.

Yeah, if we're going to get excited about reaching an arbitrary threshold, let's at least make sure we're accurately measuring the arbitrary threshold.

Prediction: Robert Mueller's statement on the the Russia investigation will consist of only 2 words, "Buy bitcoin", followed by a mic drop. And then we immediately rally to 50K as my entire office gives a standing ovation.
But then again maybe not. DYODD.

In the US, if you hold longer than a year the cap gains rate is either 15% or 20% depending on your tax bracket.
If you sell before holding a full year you're taxed at your ordinary income rate, up to 39.6%.

BTC showing its lack of correlation, and the dampening effect it can have on overall portfolio volatility (when used somewhat sparingly). Bullish for institutional interest.

Someone should publish a list of poor addresses (and include one of mine) so the poor can also get accidentally 'gifted' some BTC.

GBTC isn't an ETF. It's a trust that isn't continuously offered (and was only originally sold to accredited investors), thus it trades at a premium (or theoretically could trade at a discount) to its actual net asset value.
There's a lot more regulatory leeway for products that are only sold to accredited investors in a private offering, as opposed to an open-end fund like an ETF.
