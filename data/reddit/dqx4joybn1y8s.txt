It is not. I question whether anyone should trust the outcome of the conference as a form of, or leading to, consensus. 
Right now we are communicating over a forum which, as a matter of common knowledge, is manipulated to favor OP's views. So a rational actor will not trust it. And I am asking the same about the conference. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 14:39:11
Why should anyone trust this conference as part of a consensus-building mechanism? Who was on the selection committee for the talks, who appointed them, what were their criteria? Are opposing viewpoints permitted? Is is just part of a stalling strategy?

I am running Bitcoin-qt on my laptop and therefore relinquishing ~20GB of HD space already. If I were to install Armory, could I store the required image of the blockchain on an external HD? I realize each time I used the wallet I would have to spend some time updating and synching, but, if it is possible, I think that would be preferable to giving up another 20GB of memory.
I should mention that the reason I would like to run Armory is to have an offline wallet on an airgapped computer so that my keys are never exposed to the open net. I take this to be the main advantage of the software, which the review did not cover at all.

I have tried to use coincove and it is basically not worth it. They sell BTC at a significant premium over coinbase, and even over bitso.com, a ripple gateway and full exchange based in Mexico. (BTW,  mexbtc.com, which someone else mentioned ITT, has not updated their page in 2014, and has not officially launched. So it is vapor.)
At the moment of this post BTC/USD is $620.16 (bitcoinaverage.com). The official exchange rate of MXN per USD is $12.9281 (oanda.com), so BTC/MXN should be around MXN $8017 (and so it is on bitso). Yet price on volabit (coincove.co) right now is $8217.73. Hence they are charging a premium of MXN $200 per coin, i.e. $15.47 USD per BTC, or around 2%.  
So volabit is an improvement over Western Union, but far more complicated for the average user. The kind of user ready to buy BTC in Mexico at the moment can easily do better than that. Indeed, the amount paid to transfer money using volabit is no better than the commissions for using SWIFT transfer between mainstream Mexico/US banks.  Silbert just invested money on a company in search of a business model (and apparently also in search of a name).
In any case, $250k is a pretty small investment, let's see what they can do with it. 
EDIT: I forgot to mention that 2% is the premium volabit is charging over USD/BTC exchange rate. But the user also has to pay fees to the bank or money transfer service used to fund the volabit account. These vary, but are not small. All in all, it does not add up.

This is known to be defeatable by blockchain analysis. You might try what implied, i.e., use your BTC to purchase some relatively stable altcoin on an exchange, convert back to BTC, and send the (presumably unrelated) coins to your virgin address for storage. If it's a lot of money, do it in chunks.

so how do you purchase lindens? at some point there has to be a fiat interface. you can be sure the same interface already exists for BTC (buy with a credit card, link to your bank account, use an ATM, deposit at a convenience store . . . )

Savers are not free riders. They limit the money supply for as long as they are taking their coin out of circulation, and hence temporarily increase its value for everyone else.

insightful comment as usual 100 bits @_date: 2014-07-24 02:38:07
I take it that anyone who is going through the hassle of setting all of this up at the moment is interested in moving more than 1.28 BTC. And anyone who is moving less than that amount might as well use Western Union brick and mortar windows without setting anything up. 
Furthermore, I would think that a good proportion of the people who are interested in BTC in Mexico right now already have access to US bank accounts, and hence to coinbase. So the argument involving the time to get money into BitStamp is not convincing. Add to this the fact that there already is at least one working exchange in Mexico, bitso, which can also receive funds from a Mexican bank account within hours, using SPEI transfers. 
Clearly I would like for a service like this to work in Mexico. I am simply saying that the price structure is not yet there: potential customers will shop around, and at the moment they can find better options.

Hey thanks! 
You might enjoy [this]( 1996 paper by a Fed economist and director (see esp. pp. 2-3). The basic idea is this: the little pieces of paper we call money just serve as a physical reminder of how much purchasing power each of us control. But that same information could be stored in a massive common ledger, in which case money transfer would simply become a question of updating this ledger. With this kind of accounting in place, there would be no need to physically transport pieces of paper at all. 
Bitcoin exploits the fact that such a ledger (the blockchain) has become universally accessible and updatable. And the bitcoin network is setup in such a way that it is essentially impossible to forge the ledger in order to spend more money than what you rightfully control.

If they are spending and not buying back, they are increasing BTC supply and negatively impacting price. 


Why can't they have been selling all along -- but the pressure is now felt b/c we have gotten to the point that most mined coin is immediately sold.

The problem is that at present number of sold coins per day &gt; number of mined coins per day.  Someone is increasing supply, thus suppressing price, i.e. dumping BTC.

First of all, thanks for your time and effort. 
Regarding cold storage and security, the issue is this: if your computer is compromised (for example, if you inadvertently downloaded &amp; installed malware such as a keystroke logger; windows machines are especially vulnerable), then an attacker could get hold of your private keys whenever you sign a BTC transaction, and empty your wallet before you know it.  
Armory protects against this by helping you create a setup where you sign transactions in an offline computer then manually take them over to your online machine for broadcast, ensuring that your keys are never exposed. This is the real security feature. The rest are interface/usability improvements over the bitcoin-qt wallet you are already running.

This makes no sense . . . it is not as if you are sending the BTC to wherever people are . . . you are just moving entries around in the blockchain.
The blockchain is the most secure database in the planet and can be accessed anywhere on earth. In principle not even an internet connection is needed, as it can be broadcast over radio and satellite networks.

I read this differently than The fact is that the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank said he is interested in Bitcoin as a technology;  ["That's where I think the interest of it is, myself, as opposed to a new currency that's going to drive the U.S. dollar out of circulation."](
In other words, an important academic economist and president of a regional Federal Reserve Bank, who is the author of a 1996 paper that analyses the fundamental characteristics of money and concludes that money is memory (and explicitly predicts that a technology just like the blockchain would reduce the transaction costs of fiat) merely does not expect that, in some reasonable amount of time, Bitcoin will overtake the US dollar. 
This is MOST remarkable.  
Add to it the statement by chairwoman J. Yellen in which she acknowledges that ["The Fed doesn’t have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way"]( and it is safe to conclude the makers of US monetary policy understand very well what is going on with Bitcoin, don't think it can be stopped, and are developing their thinking accordingly.
EDIT: do read that paper.

BTC inflation will be permanently &lt; 5%, from 2016, and permanently &lt; 3% from 2021.
It is necessary for BTC in its early stages to be inflationary, otherwise there can be no coin distribution, and no network effect.
BTC price goes up and down, like any investment. If you want an investment that is guaranteed (as anything can be) not to go down (too much), you can buy 10 year US Treasury bonds.  Yields are currently 1.87%, while yearly US inflation has fluctuated between 1.5% and 3.6% from 2005 to date.

Wouldn't that be nice ... but let's think it through a bit further:
1) Even if FB is planning on deploying something like this, its widespread use would require either (a) prevalent and streamlined BTC/fiat interfaces in participating markets, such as low-fee BTMs, or (b) a much wider array of options for how to directly spend BTC. Otherwise people can send each other BTC but have little to do with it afterwards, which gets us nowhere. 
It will take time for (a) and (b) to develop. This gives FB time to implement a BTC-based solution, technically and legally, with fiat transfers over existing payment rails as an initial, complementary step. 
2) The David Marcus connection is compelling. Unfortunately, his being at FB means he is not at PayPal. Hopefully the new leadership at PayPal also sees Bitcoin as their way forward. 
3) FB need not even attempt to directly monetize a BTC transfer solution (e.g. by charging some minimal fees). They may simply want to add services to offer its user base and give them reasons to stay.
4) The first world / third world categories are not creditable. The analysis would improve if they were replaced. 
Of course this does not imply that the economies of, say, the US and of Bolivia are going at the same speed, or that the living standards in those countries are comparable. Just that the 1st/3rd world distinction does not help to  understand the differences clearly.

The official currency in Ecuador since 2000 is the USD. It was adopted to limit inflation. This has been a hugely popular policy which has stabilized an economy that was on a wild ride during the 90s. However, it leaves  the Correa government no control over monetary policy. Since the government certainly would like to expand the monetary base, but cannot because of dollarization, they have come up with this digital cash solution. Their plan is to pay government employees and contractors with this freshly minted money. In other words, they are creating a parallel currency which they can inflate at will. 
In my opinion, this will end badly for Ecuador. In any case, it poses no threat for Bitcoin.
