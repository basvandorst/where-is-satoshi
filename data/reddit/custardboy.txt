Almost every single miner claims to be doing it for profit. Therefore, they're going to behave exactly like I described at the right time.
This is an especially sweet deal for early adopters. They mined when it was easy and bitcoins were cheap. The fact that the value of BTC has increased from $1 to $8 in May alone means that these people are doing one thing: Sitting on it. Since the value dropped to $6-7, I imagine some of them already offloaded, but it's hard to tell due to the anonymity of the whole thing.
The thing is, the BTC economy can't grow. They've essentially capped the supply, and even made it so the currency can be permanently destroyed. This wall in supply can only lead to massive devaluation. I mean, how is it supposed to grow? I've heard of these mini-denominations like mBTC and such, does this imply that the value of a BTC will grow? Is the plan for them to become infinitely valuable?
This is exactly what happens in a demand-based economy. I feel really bad for people buying into this because some of them are really tech-savvy software engineers and such and think that it qualifies them to be economists as well.
edit: "I read that satoshi nakamura (bitcoin creator) has 12% of the bitcoins created. Might not be true however."
I couldn't google a source for this so I'm just going off a reddit comment, but if it's true I'm completely unsurprised.

Intent is determined by what the vast majority of users are using it for. You can cry 'alternative currency' all you want but if 90% of the transactions end up being illegal, then it's money laundering.
I'm not implying that's what it's being used for, as right now the intent is speculation more than anything, but it could head towards that path.

The genius of deflation: Most people speculate instead of spend, they hoard instead of consume.
Inflation encourages people to actually spend their money.


No, the temptation is to sell their bitcoins for USD, not spend it in the economy.




There are no necessities you can buy for bitcoins. Only drugs and junk food, and then you have to wait for delivery.


So you admit that bitcoins are just a gamble, like penny stocks. You could strike it rich!!! Or go broke. Might as well be an online casino.

It's generally not a good idea to treat stocks as a currency. People aren't actually 'investing' in bitcoins, they're speculating on their dollar value.
At the end of all this, people will only use bitcoins for what they can't with dollars, which is illegal transactions online.
Actually, you can do that just fine with dollars, so the people ALREADY doing illegal transactions with dollars could switch to bitcoins.

The only way the second model can work is if major merchants crop up after the bubble (of course some merchants will accept bitcoin now, the value goes up so they're getting more than the current USD value), but the true test is whether or not they'll accept it once it's stabilized. If not, then everybody has these $1000 coins they can't exchange for anything.

Rewarded with over 2/3 of the current bitcoin supply? You seriously believe this?
This is how a currency starts? Give 2/3 of it to a handful of people?
Like, I can't imagine what you're thinking. I just can't imagine it. Sure if they invented some device or technology or service or whatever, they deserve to be rewarded for their risk.
BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A CURRENCY. In what world is giving 2/3 of the currency to a handful of people conducive the growth of the underlying economy?

Actually, if I look at trends it seems that they're selling off small quantities of bitcoins at a time when it hits $9, causing the price to swerve downward for a bit.
@_date: 2011-05-27 05:01:37


Bitcoins have no intrinsic value. Their price is driven entirely by demand; ergo the price people ask for them determines their price. Nothing else.


Bitcoins are a commodity, not a currency. They don't have any intrinsic value so their only value is determined by what people say it is and by other people believing it. Where is the 'store of value' for bitcoins? Bitcoins will never stabilize because the supply dwarfs the economy by exponential magnitudes. You may claim that an economy will emerge to match the supply, but I doubt it.

The worst case scenario is them spending their coins in the economy? That's the best case scenario, the worst case is them dumping everything for cheap in a race to offload them.
The second worst case is demanding eclipsing supply because all the sellers will have sold out, creating an infinitely valuable bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-20 01:47:30
It's weird, the concept of bitcoins is trustless, yet the execution requires a great amount of trust. In the early adopters to not crash the markets, in the markets themselves to not do anything underhanded, in the exchanges to have proper security, in the users to promote activity that encourages spending, in the merchants to start accepting bitcoins.
There's a lot in this that requires trust.
@_date: 2011-06-09 00:47:54
All of that is just a guess on your part. We're talking about the very reality of a stock being treated as a currency, and about the early adopters having 2/3 of the stock.

No, that's not what I am saying. Bitcoins are tied to other forms of currency, therefore all they do is add middle men to the process of money transfers.

Well, from your plan it would benefit you greatly if you got everyone to believe there was a crash, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2011-06-04 05:05:09
He's absolutely right. 
Bitcoins are trying to skip all the necessary steps to becoming a legitimate currency. Most of the people getting into it are doing pure speculation; they're gambling, buying now so they can sell later. They're not planning on actually spending the bitcoins at any of the merchants.
His point is that you can't trace bitcoins to anything with intrinsic value. If bitcoins collapse, you can't just use them for their use value, because they have none. 
@_date: 2011-08-04 00:51:10


Nice reply there. You can refute me by offering me all the other economies that started by giving a handful of people a large portion of the new currency, then distilling the rest of it down to the common people and THEN creating a merchant-consumer environment for them, in that order. Oh wait, you can't. Because that's not how it works or how it's ever worked in history.


Yeah, we'll see all the way to $0.02/BTC.
I'd reply to your other stuff but all your replies are "SO YOU SAY" without actually attempting to refute them, just making up economic terms that aren't actually applied to anywhere in reality. "Speculation stabilizes a market," amazing. The act is speculation is what DESTABILIZES A MARKET.

@_date: 2011-06-25 03:31:16
No, what I was saying was that bitcoin does not provide an easy mode of transferring money. You're the troll if you're inventing arguments for me.
edit: Let me try to make it simple. Let's say someone in China wants to buy stuff with bitcoins. However, nobody is selling anything for bitcoins there, so the Chinese person would have no reason to get bitcoins. The merchant has no reason to accept bitcoins for payment, because nobody in their country has them. There's a chicken and egg problem for convertibility.
You could say: "Well, the merchant could start accepting them in advance," but there's the issue of convertibility. If nobody is willing to buy them in that country, then they can't convert them back into their local currency. You could have trading between merchants, maybe selling to people at a discount to encourage spending with them, but ultimately this will be niche at best and an outright failure at worst. This is a post-mining scenario, so people aren't getting them that way.
@_date: 2011-06-26 00:15:54
It was brought up to me as one of the primary uses of bitcoins. With bitcoins, they said, money transfers are supposed to be easier and cheaper, but I don't see how. You can't buy essential goods and services with bitcoins, so when you talk about using bitcoins to facilitate money transfers, you have to convert them back into a currency that can actually buy these things.
For example, third world countries. How could they ever, EVER adopt bitcoins if they can't do simple money transfers with them? Merchants have no reason to accept them, and investors have no reason to own them.
@_date: 2011-06-25 02:11:59

Well you can have more dollars in the system than physical dollars, and it can be converted into paper currency at a moment's notice. If it can't be, then it deflates.

No. In other news: 


So unlike every other commodity that experiences such a drastic bubble, this one will recover after crashing. Also, that Plateau only applies to actual innovations and products; BTC are just random strings of numbers. They have no inherent value.


You can sell a couple BTC in 20-60 minutes. Retailers need to sell hundreds, thousands in the same at the end of a week or a month. A small price fluctuation means ridiculous amounts of money lost. Why take the risk?
edit: "Your bank -&gt; possibly a credit card company -&gt; dwolla -&gt; mtgox -&gt; the guy who sells you bitcoins

Pyramid schemes are all about exploiting people's ignorance of a system/product and building imaginary hype about it. It's about giving a huge advantage to the people at the top of the pyramid.
Currencies aren't supposed to be built around this central group of people that essentially control it. They own 2/3 of the bitcoins right now. It's not an issue of fairness, it's an issue of how you can legitimately say this is going to become an alternative currency when you put so much of it into the hands of the few.

Right now, bitcoins are being treated like a stock or a commodity. But people want it to be a currency.

I'm still confused how a decentralized currency benefits from the early adopters currently owning 2/3 of all of the supply.
You say that you trust these people not to crash the market for their own profits. That they will use their supply to facilitate the economy and spend the coins on products/services.
But why is this type of faith good? What is different about this faith from the kind you have in The Fed? These people can manipulate the market how they want. Isn't that what bitcoins was supposed to prevent?

The problem with bitcoins is not that speculation is used as a driver of the underlying market, it's that it IS the market right now. They're not the grease, they're the entire car.
By the way, speculation is NOT a necessary driver of all markets. That is untrue. Speculators are what drove oil to $140 a barrel for no other reason other than speculation, and that HURT people. It increased the cost of goods and services.
Speculators are the people who have caused currencies to go belly-up and caused human suffering. There is a giant difference between investment and speculation. Speculators benefit from people's stupidity, from things being worth more than they really are. They go out and pump it, then dump their shit and leave people who just had no understanding, just got scammed into it and holding a bag of nothing.
Speculators are no better than scam artists.

It will drive the price up. However, the supply is finite, the demand is going to hit a wall where nobody is creating anymore BTC, just trading them around.
Here's the deal: Once the speculators are in the market and the non-speculators are out of the market, there will be no more demand. So what will they do? They will start to sell. What happens when someone sells 1% of all the BTC? The price will disappear. It'll go back down to 2 cents.
@_date: 2011-06-07 06:58:33
Bitcoins are like gold, except they don't follow the rules/history of gold. They're also like fiat currencies, except they don't follow the rules/history of fiat currencies. So I'm the 'lazy debater' if I don't just hand-wave away any possible explanation that compares bitcoin to ANYTHING? Or if they're comparisons that you don't like because it's so ~different and unique~.
What problems do they solve besides making it a lot easier to facilitate illegal transactions? 
Not only that, I'm looking at the latest unconfirmed transactions and there's a fee of like .024 BTC, and converted to USD that's already higher than most banks charge for credit card transactions.
It's not stable, and it never will be, so it's not a good alternative currency for stability.
I'm just not seeing the advantages for a legal spender.

You can always turn dollars into paper. The government always guarantees the dollar as a medium of exchange, and more importantly dollars started out being backed by gold. Once the economy was big and the supply large enough so that the faith of the government was enough to back it, they removed the gold component.
People think BTC can skip this important step. It can just start out as fiat money and guaranteed as legal tender by... nobody. That means that anybody who starts using BTC as a medium of exchange can stop at any time for any reason. You can't go to any store and have them refuse to take your dollars; they are legally compelled to.

I don't understand why decentralization is good. Also, there are tons of different entities you can go through for wire transfer. Last time I had a transfer for several thousand bucks it only cost me like 3 dollars for a money order. Bitcoin fees are much higher than that. Even then I could just get a cashier's check for free. 


I thought transactions with fees had higher priority than those without. Is there some upper limit or something?


But people derive the value of bitcoin primarily from MTGOX. If MTGOX says bitcoins are worth $10, that's what every bitcoin holder believes. They have all the power, none of the exchanges even matter.

There is no exchange of goods and services. There's very few marketplaces for them. The only thing backing up their value is the speculation of high demand purchasing them for speculatory purposes. Think about it: Most BTC are being traded between people. Very, very few are actually being used to buy things. 


Nobody's going to do that because they change value. They can be worth a million dollars one day, and 10 cents the next. That sounds like a good way for people to wait until prices are high, buy the goods, leaving the retailer paying out the difference after the prices fall.


So what's its purpose? Buy slim jims? Its stated purpose is to become a genuine currency, which will never happen for the reasons I described.

If they sell on the open market, the price goes down. If they buy on the open market, the price goes up.
If they sell/buy on the dark pool, nothing happens to the prices on the open market. If you look up the definition of a dark pool, nothing that MTGOX does fits this description. Its 'dark pool' is not actually a dark pool, it's just using that title to mislead you into thinking it's a legitimate market practice when it's actually a separate market meant for early adopters to cash out without crashing the prices. There is zero other purpose for it.


Welcome to the early adopter problem! What's better: Providing a more even spread of the initial wealth, encouraging people to actually spend them rather than hoard, wait for the value to go up, and cash out making them worthless-
OR rewarding the 'risk takers' for their diligent duties of leaving their computers on for a week doing CPU mining in 2009/10 and getting tens of thousands of bitcoins by giving them the power to completely destroy the market at a whim.
MTGOX's 'dark pool' offers a vehicle for these people to cash out, and guess what? Just like Forex trading, this is a zero-sum game. If those people cash out, there are tons of people who are just outright losing money. They just take millions of dollars out of the bitcoin economy.
The fact that you think we need a dark pool in order to let early adopters cash out without crashing the market is proof that the initial seeding was completely flawed. This system only puts money into the market through new speculators, then takes it out through early adopters.
At the end of the day, anyone who jumps into this and buys bitcoins is going to be left holding the bag. If MTGOX doesn't disclose its dark pool transactions, then it's 100% complicit with screwing the speculators. Why not make that information public so anyone jumping into this will know the ACTUAL liquidity of the market, not just the liquidity that MTGOX was nice enough to show you?

Bitcoin is not fully decentralized either. It still needs a transaction server to verify exchanges.


Most people with BTC are speculating. If this turns out to be false and all the BTC buyers and miners are NOT intending to cash in at the peak of its value, then I will have been wrong not just about this, but human nature in general. There's especially no reason for a free market enthusiast and/or libertarian to believe that these people wouldn't do what nets them the maximum possible profit as well.


You mean illegal transactions? Because that's their only use right now. In fact, if the prices weren't changing so rapidly, drug dealers would possibly think about adopting BTC. However, since there's nothing to determine price except demand, no launderers are willing to take the risk of half their money disappearing overnight due to how volatile the BTC prices are.
Think about it, man. The people who created the original supply didn't tell ANYONE about it until they made a lot of it. It didn't go viral until precisely when they intended it. For 2 years they created the first couple million and now they're sitting on it, waiting for the right time to unload without immediately crashing the market halfway through their first 10k BTC. If we don't see this soon, we will likely see this at the peak of supply.

@_date: 2011-06-07 20:31:19
The argument that bitcoins offer no or less transaction fees than banks/credit cards is complete bunk.
Each of these has a 0.01 BTC fee for the person who discovered the block (is that right?). I saw some that had a ~0.025 BTC fee as well.
If bitcoins are worth $20, then .5 is $10, .1 is $2, so .01 is 20c. That's already higher than most credit card fees, and it can only go up from there if the proposed solution to being 'mined out' is to continue running your GPUminers for transaction fees.
Bitcoin exchange sites and early adopters who mined out tens of thousands of the initial blocks are going to be making bank, free money off your participation.

If bitcoins weren't tied to real currencies, it would be worthless. If bitcoin ever became a "legitimate currency," the government would be all over it.

Because it doesn't? The vast majority of those with bitcoins are speculating. They're not actually planning to buy anything for bitcoins, just to sell them off for USD.


How and why a currency is created is not relevant? If the case for bitcoins as a currency involves ignoring what makes a currency legitimate then it's not a very good argument.

Yes, it cost electricity to generate the coin. But the rate was constant. You can make 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes if you're alone. Even with 100 people that's 0.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes, and that's not counting the fact that the difficulty was almost nothing so you could just have a 2nd, normal computer doing some GPU mining (negligible electricity cost if you have a decent job) and get hundreds or thousands of these babies per week.

You don't understand, that's PRECISELY the time that's it's profitable. It was much easier to acquire a BTC back then because the difficulty was much lower. You're probably wondering: How could they possibly know it would be so valuable? I'm not a Ponzi Scheme expert, but if you ask any of them and they'll tell you the same thing: People are stupid.
Look at this not as something new and unknown, or rather don't put it at the level of other currency. Look at it as any other commodity and imagine or even remember what happened to that commodity after its value spiked up 8x in a short period of time.

You don't know what intrinsic value means.


No, the supply is capped and based on the rate of generation for the blocks. Demand is increasing much faster than supply, which is driving the price up. This is called a bubble.


I don't use your simplistic definition. Currencies are one of two things- Commodity money such as gold and silver coins, which have intrinsic value, or fiat money- which is government-guaranteed to be used as legal tender anywhere in the country. BTC is basically commodity money with no intrinsic value, its only value is determined by how much people want it. That's not 'intrinsic'.


No major retailer will ever accept them, so I'd say it's an educated opinion.

@_date: 2011-08-03 20:04:52
Bitcoin is a flawed currency because the supply easily dwarfs the demand. 
A currency is supposed to grow with the economy, not the other way around. It's also extremely volatile, which is also bad for a currency, which is why emergent currencies in the world tied their value for gold for a while in order to retain stability long enough that simple exchange rates aren't fluctuating wildly.
Bitcoin exchange sites are FOREX scams. You're sold a bill of goods about how the currency will rise and fall, and most people involved in the FOREX market are net losers. A currency never grows by its exchange rate with other currencies, it grows by how often it's used to buy essential goods and services.
Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary, which is terrible for a currency, and lends itself to an unpredictable demand-based market based on fabrication and speculation. The value is going down right now because almost nothing is happening in the bitcoin world. Miners are mining and then immediately selling, some people buy but not enough to offset the sells, so you have this slow steady decline into irrelevance. If the exchange market represents 95% of bitcoin activity (hell, even 50%), then it's doomed.

Every currency started out being backed by something with intrinsic value or as fiat money.
What is bitcoin backed by? Nothing. Which central authority guarantees it? Nobody.
Its value is determined entirely by demand. It's a commodity, and like every other commodity, it's subject to the whims of the market, which makes it completely impossible to use for any enterprise that requires stability. Major retailers have zero reason to take on this risk, and without them BTC will only get you slim jims, porn, and drugs.
That said, I am not immediately against alternative currencies. However, everything about bitcoin from its inception, limited supply, insanely huge speculative factors, the fact that a handful of people probably have half the supply, to its volatility that makes the Weimer Republic look like a joke makes bitcoins a good way to lose money hard and fast.

You can transfer USD to anyone else securely as well. That is not a unique feature of bitcoins.


What? Nothing was actually being sold. People were just trading bitcoins and dollars back and forth. It was like a stock. Economies aren't formed by having so many stock shares that they suddenly decide to buy things with them. If the merchants are put off by this event, bitcoins is hurt, it's not 'more stronger than ever'.
How many people own bitcoins is completely irrelevant to the economy. It is 100% dependent on who decides to accept bitcoins as payment.
@_date: 2011-05-24 22:52:09
Most of the speculators DON'T understand the fundamentals.
Most of these people are not buying BTC to spend on the market. They are buying them to sell them at a later date. That is textbook speculation.
Related: 
The technology is NOT innovative.
It is NOT the first of its kind.
A business has a LOT to lose by accepting BTC. It accepts the BTC and even if they try to convert it to dollars as fast as they can, they put a contract up and the very volatile price of BTC can and will change during the course of that contract. If the asking price changes, they have to put a new contract up. So, they end up constantly putting contracts back up and don't sell the BTC unless they sell it for a loss. The point is: They couldn't actually sell BTC on the fly as purchases are made, they would have to aggregate them into an account and then sell them at the end of the month/week and they would HAVE to take the price of the BTC at that point. Why take the risk? Why would a company with high volume of sales take on a risk on EVERY purchase?

Look up the purpose of The Fed in the US. This is common knowledge. When your economy grows, you increase the money supply to prevent your currency from deflating. 
Take a basic macroeconomics class and you'll learn why deflation is ruinous to an economy. Look up deflationary spiral. Something like BTC that can deflate to the order of 6000% in a month? What's the lowest BTC denomination? 1/1000? So what happens when BTCs are worth so much that 1/1000 of one is worth $20? You couldn't buy a candy bar with it, it would be impossible.
Think about it. Gold. Pretend gold was our currency. And it continued to deflate. And it deflated to what gold is currently worth nowadays, because gold used to be worth a lot more. The amount of gold it takes to buy a big mac would be so tiny you would lose it. You would kill yourself accidentally inhaling it. So what good is it? Large purchases like a house. Then you would collect gold in a wheelbarrow to buy things. That's the problem with deflation.

You're talking about bitcoin to bitcoin transfers. I'm talking about money. You can't use bitcoins to buy basic necessities in any country, so what does it matter if some guy in another country has bitcoins? They can't spend them, so they have to convert them back into their local currency.




Incorrect. It's more like handing someone a certificate for a bundle of cash, redeemable at MTGOX for example. In fact, you don't have to use a simile, you can easily just transfer money to someone over the internet without the use of bitcoins, with tons of different fee-less services. I'm not sure what unique feature bitcoins add to this process.


If nobody in another country is accepting bitcoins as a medium of exchange, it's clearly not money there.

This is not going to convince legitimate merchants to adopt bitcoins.


It's not even remotely possible if the price stays where it is. 21 million bitcoins at $20 is only 420 million dollars, which is not enough for the kind of economy a currency needs. At current levels, we barely have 100 million dollars worth of bitcoins, and half of that is sitting in wallets that haven't been used in a long time.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:04:54
It's really that hard to understand? Sell on the dark pool, MTGOX will never record the transaction (the way every dark pool in the world does), meaning that the transaction won't move the market. It obfuscates the actual liquidity of the market, and if you have enough early adopters colluding then they can just buy a few thousand every now and then to prop up the market then sell tons of stock at a slight discount in the dark pool and never affect the price.
@_date: 2011-08-23 01:54:54
Downvoting you proves that a crash is imminent? How does that logic work?
@_date: 2011-06-06 08:06:30
There is no reason for major retailers to pick up bitcoin because it's so volatile.
Also, yeah, because 99% are in it for speculation, one person making money is another person losing money. It's a zero-sum game. And if the market crashes, all that (USD) money is literally destroyed.
@_date: 2011-08-03 19:45:30
Holding onto extremely volatile commodities that have been trending downward for the past month with no sign of reversal does not exactly fit the market definition of 'rational'.
Especially when those commodities represent very little redeemable value. And I'm talking about things you can redeem them for, not concepts that are inherent to cryptocurrency.
Unlike a company that issues shares and can have the share's value increase due to the value of the company increasing, bitcoins have no 'use' value aside from the rapidly-disintegrating supply of merchants and honestly, all of that stuff you can do with dollars.
@_date: 2011-06-30 16:28:02
It's not about demand, it's about the total 'value' of money in the system. You could barely supply a small town with the total bitcoins in circulation, much less any global development.

The problems with bitcoins aren't technological, and the author doesn't even assert that. You're inventing an argument for the sole purpose of defeating it.
That said, if you take the stance that the history of currency doesn't apply to bitcoin because it's so new and different but then turn around and say that bitcoins will become a new currency, you're deluding yourself. Either they're a currency and the same rules apply to them, or they're a commodity, like beanie babies.

Nice job posting the first thing you googled for 'intrinsic value'. I wasn't referring to its definition in reference to STOCKS. Look at the actual definition: 


What does this mean? Are you saying that it is inherently immune to deflationary spirals? That is tripe.


The definition doesn't just stop at 'currency'. You then have to go into what KIND of currency it is. It's like you saying you bought a car, and they ask you what kind it is, and you go, "Oh the one with four wheels."


I never claimed fiat money had intrinsic value. Learn to read.


In the US, the Fed can adjust the supply on the fly to make sure demand doesn't exceed supply. To make sure we're in a state of inflation instead of deflation.


A weasel word. All of the services in that list are completely garbage or trying to rope people into paying for something cheap while they speculate.

Who's to say they aren't already cashing out, albeit slowly? There was a big wall at the $9 mark. There was another one at the $19 mark. They could just be manipulating the market at this point. Buying from themselves in the open market and selling in the deep pool.

@_date: 2011-06-19 11:14:05
What are you talking about? You're just making assumptions. Why not just make that information public after the transactions? Then we'll know what people were willing to pay for it, and the person who made the buys/sells is still benefiting.
Realize that in REAL markets, the dark pool is just a vehicle for anonymity. It's not this separate market that doesn't record its transactions. That sort of thing would be illegal. In fact, in Forex dark pools are not allowed at all.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:19:46
I don't understand your logic. Simply having a large supply of bitcoins will somehow make you liable for arrest? They're somehow responsible for what OTHER people do with bitcoins? That makes no sense. They have no risk.

So how are you going to convince these poor people to buy bitcoins worth $30 or more?
@_date: 2011-06-11 05:00:21
I think I was confused because it prioritizes transactions with fees over ones that don't, and I thought the ones without fees were 'completed' or something.
Here's the deal: Right now fees are low/non-existent because of a gentleman's agreement between block owners. Once it's no longer profitable to mine, people will put mandatory fees on every transaction or jack up their fees.
I don't understand how it's good for a currency to put so much power into these people's hands. Bitcoin owners are literally at the whim of the owners of the blocks their bitcoins are in. How is that decentralized? It's centralized to advantage the block owners.
There's a huge amount of trust involved in bitcoin, the very thing they said we would get rid of. You have to trust MtGox to not just up and run with everyone's money, and already we can't trust them because of Dark Pools, because they do not publicly disclose the trades there after they're done. You have to trust the owners of the top 1000 wallets, who own 51% of the current supply not to manipulate/crash/do anything to the market. You have to trust the block owners to not jack up their transaction fees.
It's insane how much trust you need to have in order to be part of bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:06:33
Early adopters own roughly 4 million bitcoins.
What other scam could they have made tens of millions of dollars on in two years?
edit: Honestly I'm sick of seeing this argument. That they could've spend their time elsewhere and made SO MUCH MORE money doing something else because there was no way to know this would take off. Do you think everyone who starts a pyramid scheme knows 100% it will take off? I mean, really.
@_date: 2011-06-02 00:05:14
Holy shit.
You're saying the government can use the RICO Act and just claim that that everybody that has ever bought a bitcoin has participated in human trafficking. They can actually do this.
They can just claim bitcoins are just a form of money laundering, and in the case of Silk Road, it is.

The early adopters have all the control. They can crash the market at a whim. I won't be surprised if they're just waiting for bitcoins to reach a peak price and then try to sell off their stock.
