For the record, I have over 200,000 Karma, and I have no need for any more. I post what I think will be interesting. I am also a Bitcoin advocate, simply because I think that separating *currency* from *government* removes the temptation for all manner of corruption and idiocy.

There are any number of good ways to do it, and your idea would work fine. The problem is that we need to get a lot of people to receive the data, not just a few. For that, simpler is better: audio from any TV or FM radio into a soundcard, everything else in software. Alas, that is to slow for something like a multi-gigabyte blockchain. For that, digital TV is ideal. Each commercial broadcasting terrestrial television DTV channel in North America is permitted to be broadcast at a bit rate up to 2.4 megabytes per second.

When evaluation possibly-bogus statistics about crime you need to take into consideration the nature of human desires. For example, most people desire cash, and indeed theft of cash is very common. Theft of bagpipes, on the other hand, is rare, simply because most thieves and most buyers of stolen goods have no desire for or reason to want a set of bagpipes. In the area of sex crimes, most normal adult males are sexually attracted to 16-or-17-year-old girls, and indeed that is one of the most common sex crimes. Far fewer men are sexually attracted to fireplugs, which is why public sex with a fireplug is an unusual crime. So, what percentage of males are attracted to prepubescent girls? Doing a quick search, I can't find any statistics by actual scientists as opposed to people who's funding depends on inflating the figures, so I am going to pull a number out of my hat and say it is far less than 1% (even lower for females) and assume that any claims that a large percentage of Bitcoin transactions involve CP are bogus.
Come to think of it, some of those fireplugs are sort of cute... Maybe we should start a subreddit.

"The Finnish national broadcaster has partnered with Kryptoradio to broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain over the digital television network making it accessible over a non-Internet channel to 95% of the Finnish population."
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:19:10
Two reasons.
[1]: The security model of the Bitcoin blockchain has vulnerabilities, including the lack of diversity in its transmission mechanisms.
[2]: The standard for digital TV transmission can be used for communicating other kinds of data, and this sets the stage for many potential new applications.

Well, I read the three tabs that are in English. I didn't read the tab in that is in Finnish though.

Easy advice to follow, now that Buckyballs have been banned...
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:00:38
I stand corrected. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:35:34
I don't sell magnets and have no connection with the industry except as a customer who has bought Zen magnets, Buckyballs, and several brands of cheap Chinese magnets. I mostly use them in engineering projects, but I also have a bunch on my desk that I fiddle with while on the phone.
I have about the same amount of concern that a small child or pet could eventually hurt themselves with my magnets as I do with the bucket I own, my drain cleaner and bleach, my flatscreen TV, my pack of latex gloves, and especially my car. All of those are *far* more of a danger to children than Zen Magnets. and I am careful and take every precaution to avoid killing kids with any of them.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:02:01


Oddly enough, that is the *exact same solution* I use with my bottle of bleach and my container of (brightly colored so that it resembles gatorade!) anti-freeze. I would rather eat a bunch of magnets and go through surgery than drink either of those, and yet somehow we all get along without the government banning them.

A reminder to all involved: The proper response to a comment that you disagree with is a logical counterargument, not an attempt to stop people from seeing the comment by downvoting it. Let's not let this sub become another M'Kay?

I prefer high-quality old material -- especially material that most people did not see the first time -- to shiny new crap. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:06:12
Oddly enough, I just ran a load of laundry using a tide pod. Very convenient. I would like to see anyone eat one of those, either whole or by biting down on it. Detergent is really yucky without the immediate damage of bleach or drain cleaner, so I doubt that there is even one injury per year associated with tide pods.
Then again the total lack of any injuries associated wit Zen Magnets hasn't stopped them from trying to ban them...
**EDIT:** Looks like I was wrong. Thanks to for the correction (see the posts below this one).

You could, you know, read the article. I'm just saying.

Yes. This article is a parody.

The only benefit I get is access to the private subreddit for those of us with over 100,000 Karma points. Which, by the way, is a huge benefit; I get to hang with other serious redditors and avoid the trolls and newbies.
BTW, your count is way off. It wasn't hundreds of links in the last few hours. It was 33. You don't get over 100,000 comment Karma if you don't submit interesting links.

As Cory Doctorow (Science Fiction writer who allows all of his books to be downloaded and copied freely) once said, piracy isn't what limits his income. People who have never heard of  Cory Doctorow are what limits his income. Likewise, people using Bitcoin as a coatrack for something else doesn't limit the acceptance of Bitcoin. People who have never heard of Bitcoin are what limits the acceptance of Bitcoin.

Too Late! The act of reading  already tagged you for surveillance.

I don't manufacture automobiles, yet I refer to my Subaru wagon as "my car". I am not Michael Dell, but I refer to my Dell computer as "my computer". I have even been known to refer to "my city" and "my country" even though I don't actually own either. As I said, I don't sell magnets and have no connection with the industry except as a paying customer.
I can be specific about magnets because I am an electronics engineer with a proper education in physics in general and specifically in electromagnetic theory and a I have a lot of experience using magnets in the products that I design. Please note my user name and take a look at my comments in other areas.
Care to make any other thinly-veiled accusations, shill/troll?
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:10:32
...and suddenly the shill disappears. What a shock. One would think that the CPSC would have learned to do a better job of hiring shills to influence Reddit by now.

Bullshit. Physical sales of music CDs in 2013 were $7.73 billion dollars. And they are claiming that the market for kiddie porn is 25% as large as the market for music CDs?  Does anyone reading this not own at least four music CDs?
@_date: 2014-07-13 22:50:56
Certainly. The only problem is that their has to be a receiver on the other end that is prepared to accept data. This is not true of most FM radios.

Clearly, large portions of the Internet were created without brains. for example. :)

Key quote: **"When drug dealers lose their helicopters, Swiss watches, and Cigarette speed boats, the U.S. Marshals sell them for money. However the Marshals don’t sell confiscated drugs because drugs are illegal and are destroyed. If Bitcoins were illegal they, too, would have been destroyed, not sold. Hence Bitcoins are not illegal."**

Actual injuries to children from Zen Magnets: Zero.
Actual injuries to children from misuse of similar magnetic spheres:
*"Specifically, CPSC received one incident report in 2009, seven in 2010 and 14 through October 2011. These 22 incidents have involved children ranging in age from 18 months to 15 years old. Of the reported incidents, 17 involved magnet ingestion and 11 required surgical removal of the magnets."* Source: 


As many here have pointed out, Zen Magnets have much tighter dimensional tolerances (vital for building things) and far longer-lasting plating.

Serious answer: Imagine a subreddit where we posted articles about anything in the news that involves dollars. Would it not also be largely about shady characters?
@_date: 2014-08-29 17:45:51
The creators of the US dollar would swear that dollars are not for drugs, except they are all dead and the whole idea of drug prohibition came much later.
