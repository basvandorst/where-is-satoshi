Bitcoin can be seen as a big ponzi, but so can be any fiat money. This was not my point. BST is a ponzi. 7% per week... payed in bitcoin... Do your math and tell me who many days until all 21 million possible bitcoins will be payed out as "dividends". Assume ther are currently 150000 BTC in BST and 50% "reinvest" all their dividends in BST.
As I have written shutting down bitcoin is not an easy task, but not impossible with the increase of censoring and filtering. But, if people associate bitcoin with scam and ponzis, bitcoin will have a very hard time. This will hurt people trying to use bitcoin with good intensions.

There is a lot of money in BST. Maybe not as much as it was in [OSGold (USD $250 million)]( but still a lot. 
In a not to distant future this ponzi will collapse. It will be very challenging for bitcoin to survive and recoverve from this event. 
If enough money is involved the FBI and other instiutions will take an even closer look at bitcoind and may be try to shudown bitcoin alltogether, ... because of all this scam. 
Shutting down bitcoin is not an easy task, because it's p2p. But there will be a lot of bad press for bitcoin. Expect people running away from it and all your coins becoming nearly worthless.
With every satoshi moved into ponzi pirates pockets (BST) the situation gets more serious.

This does not work. I (and others) have Euros in the exchange. To "convert" it to bitcoins I have to find someone who accepts my euros for it. But now this one is sitting on the euros and he can not get the euros out of the exchange, because the bank accounts are frozen. Simon could try to convert the euros to bitcoins at mtgox, but thats of course not possible because he can not transfer the euros to mtgox -&gt; bank account are frozen...
