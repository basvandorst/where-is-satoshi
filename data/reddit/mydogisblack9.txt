@_date: 2019-07-31 21:19:04

@_date: 2019-07-31 21:17:53
nah its the one from the guy on the phone i sent all my money to earlier today, my man was looking at 100x as long as i gave him a few thousand.
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:53:33
i think crypto money is the future, not bitcoin or any other on the market though. my opinion is that governments should have the task to make a safe and anonymous currency.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:46:33
“afford to lose” its completely fine if you can afford to lose it.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:35:43
the price going up and down? the price is “slippery” ?
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:11:48
its pandemonium
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:11:07
saving becomes less attractive because of less interest, wich makes people turn to stocks for a better interest or returns. and so people will also start looking at BTC for a long term investment.
this is what i learned at school im no expert.

next up: satellite crypto, instantly send currency through sattelite. we equip satellites with high speed miners and let other companies launch mining satellites too, sun powered.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:10:57

i bought at 12,4k fuck my life
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:09:48
lets hope you’re right, everyone seems to have a diffferent theory for the future
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:54:09
prophecy? is this it?
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:58:48
probably china’s president saying blockchain is good
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:42:06

@_date: 2019-10-01 15:48:38

@_date: 2019-10-09 20:59:04
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:54:28
“its used for shady stuff and the government will make it illegal”
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:58:24

@_date: 2019-10-25 17:44:00

@_date: 2019-10-24 07:55:59
finally got where
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:35:00
everytime a year before the halving there’s a bullrun
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:20:42
bout 5
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:02:41
what conclusion do you draw from this graph
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:56:31
not an expert but maybe the big investors what they were talking about are now buying?
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:25:03
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:24:15
18000-17000 : 17000 x100 = 5,9% 
1000 x 1,059 = (this one’s for you)
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:15:46
is this good or bad
@_date: 2019-10-24 08:28:57

@_date: 2019-06-25 16:44:24
replying so i can be in the screenshot in 5 years
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:47:06
translation: left side “my money is gone” on the right: “please be generous” 
at the bottom: “the high price of bitcoin”
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:17:09
the classic back in time pullback
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:06:13
people are turning into pussies nowadays, they even turn their dicks into pussies
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:43:51
then why are thousands of people selling and buying every day, the reason btc came this far is because 90% of people want to make a profit from this.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:48:22
but it does follow what adam smith told us in 1776, supply and demand
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:45:22
its recovering guys hodl on
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:35:02
i can hear the lambo’s
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:58:45
great explanation +1
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:40:36
yea but remember to take some profit
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:39:47
im scared should i buy more
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:34:51
or the first miners in 2010, they’re loaded
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:51:04
its satoshi himself
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:57:53
it doesn’t matter, people who are new to crypto don’t know that the only real advantage this gives us is more people entering the market
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:42:54
fuck i was stupid, guess ill have to ride this one out intil we’re green again.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:57:56
that still not a good observation, the better thing to observe is what percentage of a currency is used for illegal use.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:57:43
can’t wait to order some shitten wings and a ponzi-plate full of shilled beef, and to wash it down with an investor backed shitshake
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:39:18
its just a dip
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:15:25
it usually stops things moving
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:20:25
exchanges can freeze your coins meaning you can’t move them, also hackers are frequent in exchanges so keep them in a safe place
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:35:41
man i hope you’re wrong
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:12:06
