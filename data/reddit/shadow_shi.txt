Cool, Open Bazaar is a really cool project.  Decentralized marketplaces will be a real tool for freedom in the future.  I hope that OB will work harder on privacy and anonymity.  There is some competition from the ShadowProject, who are building a similar decentralized market right within their GUI wallet, but it also uses ShadowCash (SDC), which uses ring signatures like XMR, and works through Tor and I2P, and it uses a much simpler Mutually Assured Destruction mechanism for escrow instead of OB's escrow moderators:

No its not, just because you say something does not make it true.  The technical community is ruled by beauracracy now, that's why views are skewed.  People who support BU or other ideas are ostracized and censored.  People with economics background also disagree with the technocratic Core community.

Well I think segwit as a softfork seems more dangerous, I don't like soft forks much.  I think both sides should come to a compromise and have a one time increase to 8MB or 2MB or whatever + segwit in a hardfork.  That would be safer than segwit and BU on their own.

Well I think it might be possible to upgrade the encryption on signing transactions in the future to be safer from quantum computing.  Like adding Lamport signatures or something like that. Or I have heard something along those lines.

I disagree, soft forks have a lot more dangers than hard forks as outlined in this article:

Its interesting how the communists do things.  I thought it was so funny how Bobby Lee's best idea was to switch to millibits so that the PBoC would not worry so much about a high bitcoin price.

It is not in miners interest to mess up the network.  Miners are incentivized to protect the network or they lose money as the price tanks. Its not in their interest.  They are incentivized to protect the network from 1MB blocksize blockades as well.

The forest for the trees thing is a really good description.  Gavin and Satoshi were more generalists, while the Core devs are more specialists.  They don't see the big picture.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:05:23
By limiting the blocksize you are putting 16 billion at risk.  Not to mention the huge amount of potential that is being squashed by lack of blocksize increase.  We could be at 100 billion if Bitcoin were allowed to grow.

Yours is the strawman argument.  Nobody claimed Satoshi had perfect prescient vision.  All we are claiming is that Bitcoin had a design and vision that everybody invested their hard earned money in. A social contract if you will. Now blockstream wants to change that design and vision, and break the social contract.  Most real bitcoiners don't agree with that, and the sidechain scaling stuff is for the birds honestly.

Double spending can be a bit complicated for some newer people.  So using the transaction accelerator could be easier, and helpful.  But neither can solve the underlying problem of transaction capacity being full.  Hope we can get an 8MB + segwit hardfork soon.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:38:08
Yeah sure segwit could be a good idea, but its also very complicated and risky.  Maybe some day when its tested further and if there is a real need.  Lets do the simple thing and raise blocksize now.  The network is running on full tilt.

Its fine to think of possible vulnerabilities in the network.  But its very important to understand something that you are clearly missing.  BITCOIN IS NOT PERFECT AND NEVER WILL BE.  If Satoshi listened to every single critic who said Bitcoin couldn't work because of its imperfections, then he could have just given up and never invented Bitcoin.  Bitcoin works despite its imperfections, and that is something Satoshi understood, and as his right-hand man Gavin understands the same thing.  What you call "hand waving" and dismissal of arguments is a gross mischaracterization.  Gavin is aware of these vulnerabilities and I am sure appreciates the thought, but he just sees the bigger picture.  He is not bogged down on the details like Peter Todd, he sees the full picture instead.  Gavin is more of a generalist, same as Satoshi, while Maxwell and Todd are specialists.  We need both kinds of people, but now maybe you can understand why they clash in their understandings and politics.

ShadowMarket also looks promising too and they plan a mobile application too.  The escrow is not as complex as OpenBazaar because they don't plan to use transaction moderators at first.  They use a simple Mutually Assured Destruction smart Escrow system instead, which I think is a lot simpler and user friendly: 
Also since the marketplace will be right inside the wallet for the ShadowCash digital currency, its a good way to get users as well.

Well obviously Satoshi was a generalist, he put many pieces together to create Bitcoin.  You can't be an expert in everything.  This is why people like Maxwell thought Bitcoin could never work in the beginning, he is a specialist not a generalist Satoshi.  Adam Back didn't buy in until the price was well over $150.  These people didn't understand the vision.  Here is a [good piece on the subject](

Satoshi was actually a genius very similar to Einstein if you studied Einstein's work and life closely.  In college my Special Relativity teacher always harped on how Einstein's ideas were so simple, and even child-like.  Einstein was a generalist, he had a different way of looking at things.  He saw things in a much different way, same as Satoshi.  Satoshi does not see things as most coders and mathematicians do.  He is not focused in on tiny details, he sees the big picture, same as Einstein.

Ok, so I just get my friend to sell some bitcoin or send money to my bank, then you would give me a home loan?  Then I can send the money immediately back to my friend and take the loan and run?  You would not be a very successful lender with your brand of logic.
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:02:30
You should have been more of a baller, and had $1 million in Bitcoin and paid straight cash for the house instead of entering their home loan scam system.  Its perfectly reasonable for them to expect you to keep the money for at least 2 months in a bank.  Or you could just be borrowing the funds from a friend in order to get the loan, and pay the money back to the friend shortly after.  Two months is even pretty risky for any lender.
