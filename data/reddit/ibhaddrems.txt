It is most likely that fiat will never die, but bitcoin will be the store of value exempt from inflation.  Look at Venezuela.  They store their money in bitcoin and convert to Bolivars when they need to, but they also pay eachother for goods and services with btc.  If they didn’t have btc tgey would be a lot worse off as the Bolivar continues to devalue by the day.

Also, pretty sure if they found 10mil real picassos their value would be just as high if not higher because they would be the product of a super-human capable of pumping out ~352 paintings a day.

Sure, every country has the right to operate on any political system they wish.  But when you tie your economy to ONE commodity and subsidize everything using the profit from that commodity, what happens when no one wants your oil?  
You seem pinned to “capitalism is racist”.  Venezuelans have a lot of oil, yes.  But they can’t sell it for a price that supports their massive socialist liabilities from “free stuff”.  
If a shop owner only stocked one item and that item became less valuable for whatever reason, it is no one’s responsibility to pay him a higher than market price because he has “the right to operate using any system he wishes”.  It is his fault for not diversifying the source of income.
The same goes for any country that decides to subsidize socialist programs with ONE source of income. 
It has absolutely nothing to do with “brown people”.  If anyone is a bigot here, it is you for suggesting that white people don’t want any other race to succeed.  That’s a disgusting notion and holding that viewpoint will only make you hate white people and their multitude of cultures.
Don’t bother to respond, I can tell you’re cemented in your position of victimhood.  You should read the Gulag Archipelagos.  The best way to take dictatorial control of a country is to convince the general population they are victims and there are oppressors that must be revolted against.
In reality, the only real oppressor is the consequence of each persons decisions and random chance.

Capitalism may have its faults and they may be massive, but the fact is capitalism has brought 70% of the world out of abject poverty in the last 60 years.  
If you want to talk about killing the poor lets talk about Russia. First the socialist government shipped the poor into the frozen north, when that didn’t help the economy they started shipping them off to the gulag archipelagos in secret to be slave labor and die of starvation.  When that didn’t help the economy they told the poor the rich land owners who employ people are the enemy and so they murdered the rich and the government took their property. Read the book my friend. 
You wanna talk about class systems? Socialism is only 2 classes, the ruling class and the working class. 110 million people have been murdered by communist/socialist regimes from 1900-1987.  How many do you think were part of the ruling class??

The trees being massive debt accrued by the American peoples decisions and the forest being what? Bitcoin being the savior of the world for every disparity of outcomes? 
Corruption seeps into every system. Bitcoin is no different. It has it’s utility and will be a great tool for the future of mankind, but the old problems will still exist.  The ones with the most money will call the shots and disparity and injustice will abound in places where the common man has become complacent.
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:21:58
Schilling socialism as a perfectly good means of governance as long as you “diversify your source of income”.  Not an intellectually sound argument.
Everyone always says socialism can work! No one has got it right yet! Have to fiddle with the numbers more until you hit the sweet spot! Instead of just accepting the reality that it has been tried 100 times and has failed miserably every single time. 
Is the theory of socialism sound? Sure. But not in a world with corrupt and evil people.  Corruption seeps into socialism far faster and much easier than in any other political or economic system and usually ends with the rich being murdered to take their wealth and the poor being murdered to remove the burden of taking care of them.  
All you’re left with is the working class with the boot of the ruling class on their throats.

You’re using a lot of word-garbage yourself.  
What the hell are you talking about? 
Greenspan is talking about entitlements being a burden on economic growth and you’re talking about central banks being the cause of economic collapse?? 
It can never be a simple explanation for you tin-hat people. It’s never the individual voters fault for voting for entitlement touting politicians and ignoring the costs.  It has to be a conspiracy organized by nefarious characters.
Bitcoin will never solve the problem of unfunded liabilities and central banks will always exist.

Why the hell would the DOJ become party to a criminal act?
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:16:40
You’ll have to explain how that is going to work.  
210 Trillion in unfunded liabilities and you think bitcoin will swoop in and save the day? 
Let’s say this implodes and we start from scratch with “sound money”.  You think all the entitlements aren’t going to resurface?  
Bitcoin or fiat, governments will start programs that are fully funded in the present but will eventually become fiscally insolvent because they always grow and they never get reformed.  The great unwashed will always vote for entitlements and the government will always be right there to offer them up.  It’s human nature. 
As for unfunded liabilities failing faster, I don’t buy it.  You can still borrow “sound money” from China to keep the programs running and they will be glad to lend it whether its fiat or otherwise.
The only difference I see is that inflation would be stemmed and that would slow the growth of current debt, but other than that, money is money, debt is debt.

What bitcoin’s role will be in that era, I do not know, but you can be assured that the government will attempt to stockpile it.  Everyone buy a hardware wallet.

The DOJ wouldn’t have anything to do with breaking the law by releasing this classified info. Many other organizations working with WikiLeaks pled with assange to redact and in response he asked for 700k to pay for redacting the files. He didn’t get any money and sloppily redacted the dumps.  Also we can do more than assume that he is not a mentally stable person as another commentator pointed out that his own organization revolted against him and he was abusive to the Ecuadorian Embassy Staff.  He also found it important to dress his cat in a suit and tie for press meetings and fled his bail for sexual abuse charges in Sweden.
The guy is not normal. 
Did he bring things to light that should be stopped? Ya.
Will they stop? No
Did he break the law? Ya.

That tin hat of yours must be getting heavy and compressing some nerves in your neck.  
If I understand you correctly, you posit that the US decreased it’s dependency on foreign oil not because of it’s innovation in oil drilling technology, or national security, or to decrease the cost of energy in a recession economy, but to undercut socialist governments so it can take their oil??
This makes no sense.  Why would you increase your own domestic supply, make energy cheaper, just so you can go back to buying it from foreign countries?
You do realize until recently the EPA was extremely restrictive on domestic oil drilling and that had a massive effect on global oil prices.  Also when those restrictions were loosened that also had a massive effect on global oil prices.
On another note, it is not the US’s responsibility to prop up socialist governments who tie their economy to one commodity.

But I know you’re busy making profound strides in the world of coding so I’ll do it for you.
“The USA has always had the “new technology” you claim they innovated and they just implement it when oil-based socialist governments are on the verge of collapse to push them over the edge!! Imperialism bruh! Just follow the money!”
“That recession was all part of the Jews plan to make more money using the central banks!! Zionism bruh!! Look it up!”
“The EPA is just another tool of the Zionist Jews used to stifle oil production so they can prop up oil-based socialist countries just long enough to let them accrue enough money and then they got DJT elected to crash the oil economy and plunder said socialist countries! Get on 4chan bruh!”
“The USA is the richest country in the world of course it is their responsibility to prop up socialist dictatorships! Sanctions bruh! Look at them SaNcTiOnS!”
That about right?

I can take a guess why society os going down hill. Leftists such as yourself proclaim anyone who disagrees with your logic as mentally inferior, which is typical.
Leftist ideology cannot be limited to ethics.  Ethics of a society are upheld or degraded by the levers of power. You cannot have a socialist society without a socialist government either forcing it into existence or a socialist society forcing a socialist government into existence.
Currently, we are seeing then governments of the western world force a socialist society on their peoples. Some will welcome the yoke others will cry tyranny. I fall within the latter.
Have a nice day.

Morals are not subjective. They are absolute. The problem is when you try to make them subjective.  
Moral relativism is not rational, it is a rationalization of past action to cope with guilt, greed &amp; selfishness. Relativism is the repudiation of the principle that passions must be evaluated by reason and controlled by the will. 
In other words, absolute morality can be summed up to mean “self-control”,  which modern philosophy and society deem to be an oppressive virtue.  Only, unchecked passions governing the will is the true oppression.  When the will governs passions a person is truly free to do as he WILLS and not as he is compelled by his animal nature.
Good day.

Bread isn’t the sole metric for measuring inflation.  Just because you see a particular item increase does not mean everything is increasing in price at the same rate.  Supply and demand can make things more expensive and also cheaper. Maybe people are buying less bread. But buying more tortillas.
