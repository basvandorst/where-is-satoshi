who gives a shit about slide to unlock anymore? And patents have limited effect in any case, so patents are putting the thing in public domain and letting anybody have a chance after the first guy has his shot, and it gives him a way to either make it work himself in spite of well entrenched competition that would otherwise squish him, or to sell it off to someone who cares more- which is why patents exist in the first place.
Patents may be annoying, but they do an important job, so we can't get rid of them without replacing them. But there's a lot of bullshit around them that shouldn't be too.

I'm going to get shit for saying this, but I think the guy's somewhat incompetent and deserves another chance, solely because I don't think the mtgox fiasco was out of malice.  He's trying to move on with his life and rebuild, and he's staying the fuck away from the thing that burned him- so I say let him.

Not terribly relevant, but can we abbreviate "Scam" + "Tumblr" to "Scumblr"? it seems to get more ideas across than the sum of its parts.

I may be a typical case here. I tried and failed to find a bank that would let me transfer to/from the various online coin exchanges. I understand why, but it's frustrating.
So I have rejected most banks that were in my area and that people here would have heard of, based on the inaccessibility of **BASIC FUCKING SERVICES** like being able to manage foreign exchange stuff, which is what Bitcoin properly falls under, since it is not a US-denomination currency.

This actually looks like a better understanding of blockchain than I normally see on Twitter.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:15:43
look, you're fixating on the less important detail.  By definition, security bypassing techniques must account for what you think of; so by definition, you must assume from the outset that, no matter the specifics, somebody's going to try **something** that works.
But as for your question, the most obvious way to bypass what you've done is to pre-empt the transaction from Bob to Carol, in a way that gives me &lt;Alice&gt; a small- shall we say, 'forgiveable'- amount of money from both parties, and the same amount.  Such a small amount, for a transaction that otherwise succeeds, is an amount that they would blame on the system- rather than suspecting it was me in the middle.
But as for the 'duck duck goose', this is the backup. In the event I'm detected, I skip along to the next node in the ring and make them look like they tried to do something acceptable- like squeezing in a last-second transaction- and then I can skip along until I can prevent one node from responding before I do, for them- *as* them, remember!- to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:26:30
Yes and no. what you are describing is a terrible implementation of a completely rational idea- storing everybody's data together for convenience.  So there are tradeoffs that go with this, like everything else.  Because money, by itself, is inherently a dangerous commodity- if it is stolen, it is immediately liquid, and has historically been mostly untraceable- there is a **huge** incentive to attack any system like this that is storing money this way.  
But if it is other data, that takes more specialized professions more work to get less value from.
So what you describe is not for banks, but it is for facebook, or twitter, or whatever.  You might not want people to have the data there, but it's not going to cost anybody their ability to survive if something happens.

there's a reference that's relevant here that i looked for but didn't rediscover.  It's a video I saw a few years ago (2012-13) of a presentation by some hacker who'd been banned from touching computers by the FBI for a few years, about how to 1) snoop around and intercept packets from a target (in this case, facebook), 2) use predictive analytics to narrow down the field of potential encryption keys necessary to spoof that connection, and 3) use that to steal your account on facebook to get your girlfriends phone number.  It might have been a ted talk or something; I looked for those too but didn't find what I'd originally seen. It may help inform you about how my thing would work, though.

It depends on the scale, and the application.  For most, I'd say it's probably worse.  Part of the security of a blockchain is the fact that everybody can read it, so it's harder to tamper with it, in the sense that if you change historical entries, everybody can just tell.  A meatspace equivalent would be trying to turn the sky green without people noticing.
Also, databases are very specifically optimized for CRUD operations- creating, reading, updating, and deleting- of different 'fields' in 'tables' defining different 'objects'.
So there are some specific applications where a blockchain is your best bet.  But it's huge, it's unalterable without becoming pointless, it's a big pain in the ass, and there are lots of great databases out there. 
I recommend Po$tGr3sQ1.

I'm not bluffing anything. I *literally* said "I'm not clever" about this stuff, and I stopped talking.  But if you want to be clever, by all means, go ahead. Maybe you can make it work; but if you can, I don't see how, so I can't help you.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:56:21
What's the smallest transaction you guys can process without taking a loss?
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:57:46
LOL, this is naieve.
well, logically, every entity would be most concerned with its own money, and less concerned with others' money.  So the way I'd attack such a system would be to make myself look like one of the other entities- to every entity- and slowly siphon money off that way. Kind of a cross between 'man in the middle' and 'duck-duck goose'.
Because for money to meaningfully exist, it must be exchangeable for goods and services; these can either be your end goal (getting the stuff or service you want), or it can be a more-liquid asset that you can exchange for other money- cash, gold, whatever.
The thing is, you won't know something like this has happened until after the damage is done. and if the attacker is clever- and make no mistake, I'm *not* clever, and I can still explain a hypothetical risk scenario like this- you may never even know, which means the attacks could continue until better tools reveal it.
Which is *more* of a problem with something like a database than with a blockchain, because a database has little pieces that should rationally be expected to go missing or be unavailable occasionally, especially for high volume. Whereas a blockchain is literally just text, and anybody can add to it, but none of it ever goes missing.
@_date: 2016-02-28 20:02:28
Sorry dude, I've done the same thing a time or two, never lost much- fortunately!- but it stings for a while.  Learn from it and don't do it again.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:08:14
well, that is a **terrible** idea, because that puts 100 eggs in one basket, and the first jostle will crush all the shells, and there's no upside for them.
This is why a blockchain works the way it does: since it exists as public domain but with anonymous members, all of them can find out when anybody's been fucked, and nobody has a greater opportunity to fuck than anybody else.  But a blockchain is VERY different than a database; a database is a very 'modular' thing, like having legos, while a blockchain is rigidly sequential and increasingly securely encrypted, and unalterable because the most common backup is the right one- so by definition, any attack on a blockchain has to modify the blockchain in *at least* 51% of the network using it before it's noticed to even have a *chance* at working.

Yes, but it's not going to be stupidly large keyspaces saved as text.

Look, I've told you why your idea is terrible, and I'm at the limits of what I can really comment on. Maybe you know something I don't, but from your questions here, I don't have any reason to think so.

Flattr does this, but not with bitcoins.  I've got something that can do this that I'm working on that can use BC (and other currencies), but you'll have to do some grokking to get it to work the way you want.

A lack of awareness, and I think a lot of people are looking at it like it's going to die or like it will just stay the way it is and not mean anything (ever).  And part of it is that, for now at least, the people who are really interested in it by and large aren't writers, they're the social-science and computer geeks who have orgasms about things like social paradigm shifts that are enabled by technology.
Also, I really suspect somebody downvoted me based on the communist bit, which (according to everything I've heard and seen) is accurate- Linus Torvald was a hard-core communist, although I'm not aware of the distinct variety (and don't really care, since all of the varieties seem to be trying to split pubic hairs when they explain the differences.  Nearly as bad as some of the fundamentalist christian denominations).
@_date: 2011-12-01 14:53:48
I said this based on what I'd heard in person: I'll try to find some info to back it up.  If what I said was wrong, I'll apologize, but I want to find some references on my info first.
@_date: 2011-12-01 01:38:19
I worry that he has gotten too much wrong (and too obviously so) for people to take seriously.  I know I stopped reading when I saw something to the effect of 'the brilliance of Linus Torvald', who, if you're unaware of the story, stole the work of two other people and released it publicly to be an asset to communism.
@_date: 2011-10-30 19:59:59
I made 10 cents!
@_date: 2011-12-03 07:26:36
I'll stop it, because I can't find anything either.  To clarify, however, the claim I made ("Linus stole someone else's work and released it to the public because of a communist ideology") is about Linus himself (the person), not about the software (which is very good) and certainly not about about open source software (which I support and try to contribute to).  The claim that I heard made was that there were two computer scientists- a husband and wife team- who had developed a significant portion of what linux was eventually based on, and that, by whatever means, Linus was able to get ahold of their source code, which he then legitimately did some work on, before releasing it (all) as his own.  So, that's the claim I heard, I'm not saying it's true, but it seemed plausible before I looked into it.
