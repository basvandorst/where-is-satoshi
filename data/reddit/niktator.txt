If it is possible, people will make use of it. Maybe add a delay of a few seconds, so your server has some seconds time to spread the transaction throughout the network.

It is simple logic, though. Windows computers are much more likely to get infected, partly because of it's architecture and because of it's market share. Even tech savvy users can, and mostly will, get infected at least once in their lifetime on Windows. And as soon as the system is breached, the bitcoins are pretty much lost.
Source: I consider myself tech savvy and I made the switch from Windows to Linux eight months ago when my system got infected. Haven't lost any Bitcoins, though, because I noticed it early enough.

They don't seem to appear in Bitcoin-Central's [order book]( so it's most likely just a glitch on BitcoinCharts' side.

No, it can't be hacked by its creator.
It's open source, you can check for yourself. :)

The thing with computers with internet access is this: You can keep them very safe, but there's always the possibility of previously unknown exploits to attack you via infected websites and the like. Better safe than sorry.
The Bitcoin addresses are your public keys. ;)

Definitely one of the bigger issues Bitcoin has to deal with before wider adoption. Obvious solution would be cheap and secure hardware wallets, but I wonder if there's a simpler and more elegant way.

It's all open source, you could setup a clone in less than 10 minutes.

True, but those issues are easily mitigated with a good backup strategy, which should be a standard procedure for every bitcoin user anyways. Malware is a not to be underestimated additional threat.
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:07:34
It's absolutely possible. There are many viruses which spread to offline machines via USB sticks, Stuxnet is one example. I don't think there's already a virus like that which targets offline bitcoin wallets, but it's only a matter of time with bitcoins becoming more valuable.
I would also like to know a way to eliminate that risk. I think using different OSs for the online and offline machines might offer a little additional security, but no absolute protection.

"Cum Depth" - teehee.
When the price goes up, more sell orders will be placed. It will need a lot more than $10.3M to get to $1000. And nobody is stupid enough to buy up to $1000 at once, they'd only lose money.

Alright then, I didn't know this was meant to be a supplement to Bitpay and other POS and I didn't know Bitpay lacks that feature. Seems kinda important to me. Good job for providing that function!
@_date: 2013-04-29 01:26:21
In theory there exist valid private keys to that adress, it's just very unlikely (next to impossible) that anyone will ever find one.
Creating these adresses is kinda easy. You can just make up a public key (the "BitcoinEaterAddressDontSend" part) and then calculate it's checksum (the "f59kuE" part).
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:04:48
This would centralize Bitcoin and give the devs the ability to carry out a 51% attack. Not a good idea.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:11:10
Note to the widow: Better not trust strangers from the internet with this case. As soon as they find out your husband's passwords ("private keys") they can steal the bitcoins without leaving any traces.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:07:09
But once in a while you have to enter the passphrase to decrypt the wallet when using it -&gt; keylogger -&gt; Bitcoins gone.
The solution would be to only decrypt the wallet on a computer with no internet access.

But did OKPAY receive the money at all?
When they received the transaction in the 0.8-chain, it received more than 6 confirmations and was thus considered valid. Okpay then performed whatever it performs when receiving a bitcoin deposit, which might have been an unreversable service.
Consider this scenario:
Someone deposits BTC at an Cryptocurrency-exchange on the forked 0.8-chain. The exchange waits for 6 confirmations, then credits the BTC in the depositor's account. The depositor now buys another unreversable Cryptocurrency, for example Namecoin, with his BTC and cashes them out. Meanwhile, the depositor also sends the same BTC to one of his other own addresses on the forked 0.7-chain, which later becomes consent. The Exchange is now out of the sent NMC without holding the deposited BTC, because the 0.8-chain got orphaned  and the transaction got (kind of) "reversed".
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:31:40


This is a great idea! It's indeed a good thing Bitcoin experienced this while still being kinda small, so merchants/devs can now better prepare for similar scenarios in the future.
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:42:44
Well, yes, if you look around this subreddit and the Bitcointalk forums, there are indeed certain bullish news around Bitcoins that might indicate a further price surge. For example Bloomberg recently aired a short but positive piece on Bitcoin and big online broker Etoro might accept Bitcoins in the future.
However, as I said, If these were fail-safe signals they would already be considered in the current price by the market. Also, I don't want to be responsible for giving you potentially bad investment advices. There's always a chance of Bitcoins losing in value or even going to zero.
Welcome to the community! :)

Is client-side currency conversion such a good idea, though? Every merchant that wants to accept bitcoins has to calculate the bitcoin price on the server side anyways, otherwise the user can just provide false data when submitting the order.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:28:55
Namecoin serves a purpose. The others only provide marginal differences to bitcoin and are treated by most of their users as a get-rich-quick scheme. They ought to fail sooner or later.

You didn't see it because it isn't there, it never was. As I said, bitcoincharts often reports false data for BC, maybe they handle the api calls wrong. There's no conspiracy here, just a little bug.

Because nobody has invented a decentrally controlled proof of work system that also serves a useful real life purpose yet. It's hard, maybe even impossible.
@_date: 2013-03-12 18:47:32
This seems bad. I know it's the merchants responsibility to check for transaction validity, but this transaction had more than 6 confirmations before it was "reversed". Pretty bad for a non-reversable e-currency.

This doesn't really offer any additional security over unhashed passwords.
If you run a wordlist on brainwallets or whatever, you can also check the hashes of the words.

@_date: 2013-03-18 02:40:09
It is possible if the attackers control more than 50% of the hashing power of the network. But the network is already incredibly big and fast, so an attacker would have to spend much more than he would earn. So it's really unlikely to happen and becomes even more impropable the more the network grows. See [this article](
Edit: I've got something wrong here. Even with more than 50% of the networks hashing power they wouldn't be able to change the rules, since that would only cause a forked blockchain that only they accept, while the rest of the network rejects it for being not compatible with the original rules. More than 50% would only allow double spends to happen.

First off: be careful! You just published on the internet that you have a single file that's worth more than one million dollars on your hard drive. Hackers will try hard to breach into your computer, for example by sending you malicious links and tools. From now on, think twice before clicking on anything someone sends you on Reddit. Once somebody manages to get ahold of your wallet file, the bitcoins are gone.
How technically savvy are you? Do you know what cold wallets are?

Cover a small part of the scanned document with a sheet of paper that says "Scan for MtGox". This way it's much more difficult to use it for identity theft, although not entirely impossible.

Still, as soon as your system is breached, trojans can and will steal your bitcoins, getting the passwords via keylogging.

Bitcoin is not supposed to be a get-rich-quick scheme.
Also if it was safe to say, for example, that Bitcoins will be worth $100 in future, then people would already be willing to pay up to $100. Unfortunately there is no way to accurately estimate a future price.
So, to answer your question: Between $0 and ten kilos of gold.
