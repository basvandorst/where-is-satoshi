The key to PayPal's success was adoption of use in useful situations. Micro Merchants were really not a thing before PayPal enabled them. Card services and card issuers tried to bury them. The users made that hard to do. 
Dinners Card, Discover and Amex all charge merchants premiums because they have the top line users. 
Using BTC, making it happen at your local pizzeria, at joes coffee house is the key to solving the puzzle. You want transaction at a level that make the cost of transacting make sense for those involved. Joes wants to accept it because it may get him an incremental increase in business he might have missed.

Pretty true. My friend launched a store and I have an APP. He takes Bitcoin I take cash. He has increased his margins by holding his coin. I deposited my money and it did not increase in value.

If you made money you report it. You won't have any issues.
If you were a miner your cost of equipment, utilities etc might be deductible.
But if you bought a few thousand in coins and now have a million dollar gain you will be required to report it even if it comes over in $300 increments. You essentially have capital gain and those are rich people problems so go hire an accountant who can help you keep it on the up and up.
Edit: Profit is only realized when you sell. So as an example your stock in Facebook is up 1 million dollars from where you bought it. You only have to report it when you sell it and "realize" those gains. Look up Capital Gains Tax.
