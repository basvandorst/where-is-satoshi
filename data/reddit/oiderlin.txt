Initially I always seem to like the idea of BC products like this, but it's an irrelevant archaism being imposed on an innovation in an effort to make change more palpable. It appeals to my strong sense of nostalgia, but a digital currency is digital. It can never really exist beyond electrons. I can appreciate the activism aspect of such ventures, but I really don't see the business. You're making a sort of token, which is really the origin of the current monetary system that we're trying to undermine.

it's only symptomatic of value, so yeah.

I don't think you're seeing the big picture. And you're a catamite.

This was just the 21 co news. Something real needs to happen, that was just the spectre. Imagine what an actual tool will do. If anything real happens the price will easily move to $10k, but if you really believe you will wait, or just contribute to the successive crashes. People need to think of this as like being able to invest in the first bank. This reminds me of the "internet fad" in the 90's except in a tragic, bleak post-911 way.

Of course. It only means value. When it ceases to have value it will die. So where is the value? Is it in the architecture? The ethos? The mining energy? Hot sluts around your pool in 5-10 years? I'd say the harder it is to answer this question the better.

There's not much explanation required. If you believe in BTC and you want it to grow, the most important part of this is value. Think how much conventional currency is transfered through illicit business every day. Right now we're still in it's infancy, and so you want to see fundamentals. First is value, then adoption, on the most basic level.

I know fuck off
