Yes exactly, altcoins are here to exist and will never hurt BTC, but just complement it. All altcoins will never replace Bitcoin, wiull just offer another way of escape. Yes there are many shitcoins out there but there is space for everything.  
**Let's be clear, without banksters failing with their fiat and many crisis, Bitcoin will never exist. Without Bitcoin NONE of those many altcoins will never exist!**

I use shapeshift regularly from their page and also from Jaxx wallet. Never have to contact support, all smooth.  
Maybe your exchange is due to these fucking mempools?

Get the fuck out from Coinbase! There are tons of other ways to buy BTC out there.  
You have been warned.

You have to put it with the same name wallet.dat not mybtcwallet.dat. That means to overwrite the existing one (empty). Keep a copy just in case.

Try to see Bitcoin **out** of Coinbase...

Don't buy. Work for bitcoins or just use bitwage or cashila to receive your wage and get it converted in BTC. This is the best and easy way to have BTC.

cashila.com (works from Mycelium wallet plugin), bitwala.io (they have own app) - you send BTC and destination receive fiat.

Work for bitcoins. There are many places where to find jobs paying in BTC.  
Also you can use bitwage.com or cashila.com to receive your actual wage from fiat to BTC. No more complications to buy BTC. They are coming directly to you.
