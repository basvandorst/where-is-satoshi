What are you basing 10-15% on?  Merchants are unlucky if they are paying 3% on transactions and I doubt many experience a chargeback rate of 10%.

1% discount is more viable and a lot less enticing for customers.  Give away all your rights for a 1% saving...

The guy makes a very good point.  For all bitcoins merits for money transfer, it requires an easy way to buy in and cash out that doesn't exist in many places.
His problem is less bitcoin, more that bitcoin allows new competitors into the market who can use bitcoin to have lower costs than using current banking systems.

p2pool means no single entity is in charge of 51% of mining that would allow them to do a 51% attack, Whereas just now, the guys running ghash are basically in a position of trust (also it would be completely illogical behaviour as it would stand to cost them far more than they would gain)
It doesn't protect the people using it more than any other miners.

It's rare for people to do face to face transactions on localbitcoins, it's more normal to just send money to a private bank account of a seller and when they receive it, localbitcoins releases the bitcoins from escrow to you.
I had a seller say they didn't receive the money one time and provided evidence I sent it to localbitcoins and they released the coins in escrow to me.

This is my point, for years the crypto markets have been manipulated in ways that are more illegal than anything that the banks did with finex.
I've asked this question on here and bitcointalk before and no one has any interest in answering it.  How is this group of people going to be better than the people guilty of it at banks? 
"BUT NO BANKS DUUUUUUURP" isn't a valid answer, especially when the finance industry has millions invested in the bitcoin ecosystem already.  Still, why bother to consider the hard questions when you can just spam the usual tropes and downvote.

As someone that reads both subreddits, I don't think it's really about bitcoins value as an investment.  
Bitcoiners are annoying, uninformed and arrogant on , in my experience.  I've seen numerous threads derailed with nonsense about crypto, generally just confusing jumbles of buzzwords posing as answers to questions not asked.  
Personally I wouldn't ban it, I'm not that into banning speech on forums, but I understand why they have done it and think they have the right to do it.

An educated consumer wouldn't use bitcoin.  It only offers benefits to merchants.  Only ideologues really use it to buy stuff.

It doesn't sound quite as bad pronounced but it reads horribly.

I agree with the sentiment that this and the vast majority of these exchange "hacks" are normally down to insiders using their knowledge of the systems to steal the money.

So true, what a ridiculous idea.
