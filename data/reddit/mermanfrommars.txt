I'm not lying and I'm still here. Read the fucking federal code, there's zero inconsistency.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:37:26
There's no inconsistency here. If you were intelligent enough to actually read the code(yes, yes, we know you aren't) you'd plainly see the only tax exception for currency is specifically for currency issued by foreign nations. Which obviously Bitcoin is not.
When there's no exception in the code for something it's just treated like any other asset tax-wise. They call it "property" because that's how they always communicate some asset is treated like everything else. Bitcoin **IS** property that people own, is it not?
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:39:00
I'm about to blow your mind. Money and property are **NOT** mutually exclusive concepts, you dipshit moron. Money **IS** a form of property. There is absolutely zero contradiction in your retarded comment
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:31:36
Actually they're legal and were put into place by representatives who were voted into office. Dipshit.

If your widgets are acting as a way to transfer moneytary value, then yes, you would literally need a license. There's a reason companies like Blizzard have a mountain of legal language prohibiting the selling of in game currency for real money, it's so they don't have to register.
There's no contradiction here, you're just stupid

No, you told me nonsense. Let me guess, most your "research" is watching YouTube videos and reading conspiracy blogs.

Humanity did literally stop using gold as a basis for currency in part due to volatility.
I'm not sure why you're citing a comparison to gold as proof of something being a good currency when gold itself is a failed one.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:50:34
Writing 'bullshit" and then a bunch of tinfoil nonsense really isn't a compelling argument.
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:59:12
The same incentive that created the Federal Reserve and like agencies across the globe. It's a tool to manage an economy. 
Again, if Bitcoin goes mainstream the majority of people using it aren't going to be libertarian hoarders.

Thanks for confirming that I was correct about where your "research" is from.

People working industrial jobs.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:20:42
You’re forgetting the part where minting also includes marking the coinage/bills to indicate it is an official currency of the society’s authority. 
Also, gold was never required for humans to use. Humanity always had the option to choose other things for a basis, in fact historically they mostly did choose to use things other than gold for monetary basis.
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:29:10
The industrial class benefited, because it was the industrial sector that exploded.

Gold didn’t “easily destroy” other monies, it lasted barely over a century before it was dropped.
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:00:38
It was dropped because it wasn't working.

@_date: 2019-06-02 14:40:57
I’m not sure why you’re focused on gold, in the 10,000+ years of money humans have largely used things other than gold. And you’re missing my point that what we used was always our choice, we could pick anything and we always picked things that grew in quantity

@_date: 2019-06-02 13:24:42
Ever since there's been minting authorities(aka thousands of years) it's always been possible for people to decide to implement a fixed currency and have their mint stop making more than replacement coinage/bills.
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:08:11


They literally did have this ability. Remember they weren't using literal gold for day to day exchanges, but convertible bills/coinage. They could easily subdivide those bills and coinage with new issuances and in fact did in many cases. 


Growth didn't stop then, world productivity was exploding due to continual industrialization.

You don't need everyone, just the majority, they'll drag the rest.
Remember if Bitcoin goes mainstream the users aren't going to be converted techie goldbugs but the very same general population that built built all the QE apparatuses this group hates. You really want to bet against them not doing it all again?
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:52:33
The short lived gold standard was largely adopted because at the time it was a growing commodity for the powers that implemented it. 
The UK for instance, which kicked it off, experienced a silver shortage around the same time their trade exponentially grew at the end of the 18th century. The result was that while they were struggling to mint enough money with silver to accommodate their exploding economy their ships were returning from the East and West with ever growing amounts of gold. Switching to Gold gave them a growing monetary basis again, fixing their problem.
The same was largely true of the other major powers that adopted gold. They didn’t adopt the standard and then just sit around just using the reserves they had on hand, they adopted it and then plundered the undeveloped world to make sure their monetary basis was continually growing. But of course this couldn’t be done forever, hence the wheels eventually falling off.

Not really futuristic, we’ve always had the option, society has always opted for a currency that could grow.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:26:40
Those are not arguments, that’s literally what happened. When supply stopped growing European economies started collapsing.
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:18:30
Bitcoin can be grown. It's only limited if people choose to keep it limited, but if a majority decide otherwise it'll grow. Code can be changed.

OP, you have a poor understanding of where the wealthy actually have their wealth.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:38:55
What are you talking about? The practice of minting has been around for millennia and at any point in time Society could have decided to halt inflationary minting locking the monetary supply to a fixed amount. It's always been a choice to make more money
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:17:26
2nd sentence of your source, 2000 BC. 
Humans have had lending economies and functional banks for millennia. They might have once functioned out of temples and used grain, but they were still performing the lending functions that banks continue to critically perform today. 
People aren't going to stop being entrepreneurs or needing high value assets like a home because of bitcoin. Professional lending and investment are not financial tools that rely on any one medium of exchange and they aren't going away.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:06:05


Well the system exists in the first place. They are not all paid off. 


You don't seem very well informed
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:53:45
We've seen the lending economy survive every crisis humanity has faced for over 4,000 years. I wouldn't get your hopes up.
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:36:19


How does this math work? Do you expect the thousands of man hours that go into designing, building and prepping the materials for a house to just magically become free?
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:36:37


You miss the point that that's by design. 
Convenience and Security are diametrically opposed traits. Super secure systems are also ones that aren't convenient. 
Banks don't want that. They don't want customers getting frustrated with overbearing security measures. They don't want to put friction between a person and using their card. They want spending to be as painless and easy as possible, they want people to spend, spend, spend with their cards. 
The trade off of lax security is increased usage rates, which greatly offsets those losses. If credit cards implemented security requirements to the degree of measures bitcoiners proclaim(cold wallets etc) they likely would have never became mainstream

Existing houses largely aren't paid off and existing houses still fall into disrepair needing substantial work or replacement.

I would be the first to tell people that debit cards are not optimal to use compared to credit cards.


Because a debit card usually initiates an immediate pull of funds from a checking account whereas a credit card does not. The delay in processing for credit cards is itself a security feature. That larger window of time where it's trivial for the bank to unilaterally halt funds mitigates a great deal of risk. Additionally Credit Cards transactions collectively generate more money through interest, so that's even more incentive to accept higher risk to encourage use 
As I said above, security is measured against convenience. Because debit card transactions are harder to reverse and generate less money the equation leans a bit more toward security which is why they get pins and CCs don't.

@_date: 2019-05-08 23:00:04
A.) It literally says "Debit", "Credit", or "Prepaid" on each.
B.) How would I be unaware of nature of the accounts I have open? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:04:23
A normal person would just say "you use this card to pay for things. There's security features but even if it gets compromised it's not a big deal because the bank will just cancel any bad charges and give you another one"
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:12:04


To a degree. Individual assessment is still regularly done and even on the automated side banks employ thousands of different assessment philosophies. Any large scale lending almost always involves personal scrutiny. Risk assessment is not governed by natural universal laws like kinematics. There is no one set of equations to plug into to "solve" it in a way that would satisfy the entirety of the market where people/companies won't shop around for different rates from different lenders with different judgement items.


No, it isn't like that. Your analogies are not accurate. Bitcoin is a ledger, not a risk assessor. The bank function it replaces is transactions, banks do much more than just transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:56:14
I do actually. You are literally so dumb that you thought credit and debit cards were indiscernible hahaha
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:00:39


It mostly consists of people hoping for a get rich quick scheme. Few people are actually using coins in day to day purchases and most are still just letting exchanges hold their coins, suggesting they really don't care about the whole "be your own bank" nonsense.

It's not really similar because in that case German notes also lost nearly all of their value against goods and services as well(which are the things that actually matter for a currency). The USD has not been dramatically losing value as far as goods and services go.
Is being purposely obtuse a requirement for writing bitcoin articles here?
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:38:34
I'm not sorry, but you're not going to replace the assessment market with a single assessor. Do you know anything about actuarial science or lending markets? Lol

Banking has been around for over 4,000 years through hundreds of mediums of exchange. I'm not sure why you think Bitcoin would make it go away, it's unlikely people will suddenly no longer need loans.
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:12:58
So I take it your answer to my questions was "No"
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:41:49
Bitcoin is a ledger. The only thing it truly does is record when value is moved from one wallet to another. 
The Bitcoin algorithm does not perform risk assessment, which is the most critical component of lending.
