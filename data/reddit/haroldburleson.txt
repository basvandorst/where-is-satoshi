How much will Segwit reduce fees?

Depositing Bitcoin onto exchanges is the exact same as depositing Gold into a bank. If the bank gets robbed, it doesn't mean the Gold was never yours to begin with. THAT is reality.
And guess what? In the "Wild, Wild West", just as many banks got robbed as Bitcoin exchanges. It doesn't make the above untrue.

Sats are the most logical choice to get the masses on board.

Absolutely incredible. Who would have guessed when the price was 10 cents that we would be here?
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:05:14


You have no clue what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:37:28
When you deposit Bitcoin on exchanges, it is still yours legally. Hence why there are lawsuits against Mt. Gox and Cryptsy. They are not legally entitled to your BTC. Just because it has a high chance to get stolen, doesn't mean it isn't yours. Same for banks. They have no legal right to withhold your money without a reason. If they do, there are legal consequences. Them going bankrupt is your risk, keeping your money safe.

^ This guy trying to prove 50% is wrong, cites just 5 currencies out of hundreds. xD
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:18:49
Exactly. In the "Wild, Wild West", banks were like crypto exchanges.

Because I have been on welfare for 2 years. My account never went above $1,000 and suddenly gets $10,000 worth of deposits from across the country in 48 hours. :p

 is time we use Satoshis. :)

I'm talking about an official altcoin wallet (downloaded off their site). Can the dev see my total amount?
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:56:47
If anything, I would make a paper wallet(s) :P

Google invested $40,000,000 in Blockchain.info a couple months ago. Where were you?

How much will Lightning Network reduce fees?

Your preference does not change the law. Legally speaking, they are your Bitcoins. Period. Stop saying otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:27:14
You are applying USD to Bitcoin for some reason... there are hundreds of currencies.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:09:58
Currently, just 30,000 Satoshis = $1 US.
There are multiple physical currencies with lower parity than this.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:51:17
This seems quite reasonable. A hassle, but might work.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:57:59
You copied a popular saying, but just because something is popular doesn't make it right. What you are trying to say is if you don't control your private key, your BTC is at a great risk.

[If you are not sure, why are you typing?](


Only they don't.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:29:23
Stop saying this.
It is the same as saying if you deposit money into a bank it is no longer yours as you don't own keys to their safe. This is simply untrue.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:38:06


This is not true. You technically own them, only they are at more risk of being stolen/lost.

This guy just stole $100 from me and has the audacity to try to act like the good guy? There is nothing against the rules selling Bitcointalk accounts. It is allowed on that forum.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:04:20
Why do people use this instead of paper wallets? You need to protect your phrases anyways, might as well just use paper wallets and not worry about a physical device in the first place.

I am not arguing, it is called debate. If you want to argue then I am out of here. Peace.

Wow dude what amazing insights you just solved everything - good job!

Most of what you describe is [Blockchain.info](

Why did my comment above suddenly get downvoted from 16 karma to zero in 45 minutes after it was  for over two hours?
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:18:54
I said this a couple weeks ago in the main thread.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:49:29
My comment currently has 16 upvotes, therefore it is clear most people agree. However, I am sure theymos and his shills will come around shortly and either downvote or delete it.
 WAS RIGHT. (SEE ABOVE)
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:00:52
Doesn't change the fact I said it before this guy and sure many others have.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:23:59
Fun fact, when you search Atheism you will note it is not more popular now than back in 2004. Only in Western countries has it seen a small rise (probably broke through some critical mass where they feel empowered to spout their nonsense now), but in reality they are nothing compared to religions (add Islam, Christianity, etc. to see how low and weak Atheism is).
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:14:30
He is not wrong. Bitcoin was founded on crime, and is run by fraudsters.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:36:50


YOU have no clue how it all works.
Literally everything he describes is what blockchain.info does.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:38:51
This proves nothing. What really matters is when the price drops next. If it crashes before ~$4700, it means we are in a long-term crash.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:18:54
The biggest fraudster is theymos.
 "Click here for undeniable proof that theymos is a fraud") This was the  comment with 16 upvotes less than one hour ago. theymos had to bring in all of his shills to take it down, as expected.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:39:49
And by the way, according to that logic - it means *your* opinion is useless. Or are you saying the 16 upvotes are useless? Because then it means your karma is also useless. xD *nice try*
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:15:44
blockchain.info is the best 3rd party Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:34:16
The fact that you even think 35,000 karma is a lot proves my point entirely.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:42:23
Not really. Even if Bitcoin rises to $1 million, it is only $144 billion. Not that much considering USA annual GDP is over $12 trillion.
