Ah, gotcha. So if I was to transfer my coins to say the desktop app, "Bitcoin Wallet", then it [the desktop wallet] would show up?

A nice small sum of 0.14777854 BTC (£73.54 at the time if posting)

Unfortunately, a lot of Brits are noobs when it comes to bitcoin. My Dad and I, however, are not so much noobs but rather still in the learning stages.

You say that the UK is small, and yet we are the 5th biggest economy in the world. Not an opinion, FACT!

Halving = Less Bitcoins contained in each block mined and occurs every 4 years. Most people speculate that this causes a spike in price. The recent increase however is correlated with China and bitcoin security getting better. For some reason, whenever an economy collapses, Bitcoin Price rises. This is because a lot of people are "jumping the ship" so to speak from their local currency to bitcoin.

I have 0.25BTC that I bought in May... can I still be part of the millionaire club when I retire? Pretty please!

Does it affect me? I live in the UK and our government do not currently have any form of regulation for bitcoin. Apparently it's exempt from all forms of VAT and capital gains tax. However, they do say there is a case-by-case basis to prevent people from selling £££s of bitcoin.
Extra note: I buy from coinbase and then transfer straight away to my breadwallet

The clock is ticking... 24 days and counting

I use breadwallet but instead of a string of characters, I have 12 words - does this mean my wallet is only recoverable on breadwallet alone?
I feel like I should create a wallet on my desktop that actually has a "traditional" form for the private keys and then import that into breadwallet.

Sure... but I doubt bitcoin mining is at the top of their priority list as of now.
P.S. Mining is generally better on GPUs rather than CPUs and even then they should ideally be ASIC cards

Buy from coinbase or gdax and then immediately transfer into breadwallet or another wallet that YOU own (i.e. have the private keys for)
Extra: I am from UK btw if that helps

...jk, I agree

Bitcoin is absolutely an exciting topic. It has risen in value so much these past couple of years and this time it's legit. Last time it reached this high, it because of an exchange artificially driving it up. This time it has been widely adopted by third world countries and others who do not have easy access to traditional methods of payment. What frustrates me most is the financial media still being skeptical and constantly bashing bitcoin (financial times wrote a very entertaining article) for little reason other than it disrupting their "profit machine".
Let us all take this time to thank Satoshi Nakamoto for creating such a global influencing currency and congratulate him on his success... whoever he is.

How possible is it to solve by hand? Could we solve at difficulty=1? And how far up the difficulty chain could we realistically do?
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:08:54
Even things like VAT are pre-determined so it is pretty much impossible to avoid tax. There is one tax you can avoid in the UK and that is the fact that bitcoin is treated as a personal possession and is therefore not subject to capital gains tax. However, it is on a case-by-case basis which is, I assume, to prevent people from trading millions of pounds a day and upsetting the economy or sparking money laundering police.
Note: The UK Government have acknowledged bitcoin but there is currently zero regulation on it. I expect that to change in 2017.

That doesn't really answer my question, sorry.
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:10:35
It's very frustrating and I'm not even buying - I'm balancing the books.

A quick conversation would place the sandwich in the £4-4.50 region which is still very expensive. Unless he went to subway or something

Invested £50 back in May 2016 plus another £100 just before the new year.
Today my profit sits at a little over £1000
Here's to the hodlers :)
