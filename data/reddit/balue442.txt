Is there a decent video someone could recommend on how to read these?  I kinda get it, but not really.

I mean... isnt 17 sat/byte great? we've been seeing 300+ for weeks

Lol - my copay wallet is still suggesting 218 sat/btye for an "Economy" transaction and 387 sat/byte for a "Normal" transaction.

I struggle with this, but these were a little helpful if you hadn't found this.

I've used E-gifter specifically to buy amazon gift cards with bitcoin.  This service is apparently going away from E-gifter (and all other similar online gift card malls).

This summer I used usd at a dairy bar in pei... we asked if they took usd.  They said yes.  Meal was $15.  Gave them a $20usd bill, they handed me back a $5 cad bill.  Never did that again.  Rate was around 1.35 then too.  Got robbed.  Would have Ben happy with a 2-5% rate extra.  Instead it was nearly 35%.
