Yeah, PGP is fine. I would never trust Facebook's implementation of any standard. Is this real life? You want to trust the guy who said, "I can't believe they trust me." That guy.
    Zuckerberg: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard
    Zuckerberg: Just ask.
    Zuckerberg: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS
    [Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?
    Zuckerberg: People just submitted it.
    Zuckerberg: I don't know why.
    Zuckerberg: They "trust me"
    Zuckerberg: Dumb f*cks.

I would never trust encryption implemented by Facebook. Never ever ever ever. Sure turn it on, then send stuff I encrypted personally through it.

True, but I think it is also important to remember that many people will be unwilling or unable to really understand it. Unfortunately the general populace really likes things that "just work".

So they treat it like game tokens or monopoly money? I want to treat bitcoin like real money that I can use to purchase items and I think everybody else who has put time and effort into cryptocurrencies would like the same. That's how we actually make it viable, right?
Am I wrong? Maybe I should just sell all my bitcoins now if they are only funny money?
E: Do you suggest with every tip to your waiter that he should only use the money to tip other waiters?
