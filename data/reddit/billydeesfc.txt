The article isn't claiming that *all* of a bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from its production cost, just that it is an important factor, sine qua none. Indeed its other sources of value (its durability, its divisibility, its combinability, its homogeneity, its scarcity) are remarkably similar to the things that give gold its intrinsic value as well.

The only thing you need to "resurrect" your wallet is the private key. Assuming you have that backed up, you are good to go.

AFAIK Coinbase doesn't let you backup your private key.  Blockchain.info does, so you could transfer your money there and then backup from Blockchain (under Backup &gt; Download).

"An intrinsic theory of value (also called theory of objective value) is any theory of value in economics which holds that the value of an object, good or service, is intrinsic or contained in the item itself. Most such theories look to the process of producing an item, and the costs involved in that process, as a measure of the item's intrinsic value."

I stand corrected. Not sure I'd recommend entering your private key into some 3rd party site, though. But it looks like there are other options as well:

Looks familiar.

I don't think so. Datacoin is a fork of [Primecoin]( which uses a scientific-computing proof-of-work system. It [uses the same POW system](

Dollar bills can be lost forever too, via physical destruction (fire, etc.).
