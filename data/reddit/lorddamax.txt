What I want to know - say they audit you and take all your money. If all your money is tied up in BTC - without banks - how the fuck do they "find" and "take" it if it's in a cold storage wallet? Use paper sniffing dogs and search your house for it, then make you remember the password to decrypt it to prove there is money in it? No, I agree, fuck you.

So I have to ask. Why does this project take so much money? An extra $50k for an open source html5 wallet doesn't compute. I have first hand knowledge of a crypto related startup that's being done for cost of hardware and the developers time. Extras like hosting and services are less than $1k a month. This doesn't even need hosting. 
Why SO much money?

It was moved to the FAQ. 
All first time purchases MUST be mailed and they require a copy of your ID or utility bill. 
OR... I just buy at gyft or egifter.

So if there is one sending address and 3 receiving addresses, it's very likely that there were two recipients, and one change address, as there'd never actually be two change addresses?
If I were sending 1 BTC to 2 different addresses in the same transaction, and my 1 BTC came from 2 of my own addresses that totaled together 1.2 BTC (each had .6 in it) I'm assuming there'd be one single .2 BTC 'change' and not two different .1's correct?

Deposit to an exchange or betting site then withdraw. Btc wallets on huge traffic sites rarely have time to coin control and your withdrawal will be from someone else's deposits. It's not foolproof, but it's quick, easy and nearly free. 
Wanna do it even more foolproof? Deposit to exchange A, buy doge or ltc, move altcoin to Exchange B, sell it for BTC, withdraw. You'll lose a little in trade fees but those coins buy/sell prices are rarely off by too much. Chances of the withdrawal wallet being even remotely tied to the deposit address are absurdly small.

So - through a long night then morning of playing forensic detective I got the BTC back.
Pulled the drive, and found some code to run photorec.
That pulled back a ton of bizarrely sized dat files. pywallet wanted nothing to do with them so I searched some more. Came across the link JorgePasada posted, actually found it AFTER I had found keyhunter elsewhere.
Keyhunter was broken though. I used it on my actual wallet.dat file and it found 2 keys. Well, I know I had over 100 in there. Poked around, learned a lot, and realized that compressed private keys are different than uncompressed. Keyhunter only found uncompressed keys. Many hours of research, converting a wallet.dat into hex and combing it, found the magic for the compressed keys. But it was outputting one. What?
Bug in the code - x+=position+1 - that took the current search position, and jumped it forward by a number equal to the position of the found key, thus skipping tons of data. Changed that to x=position+1 and my finding 1 key changed into about 150 of them.
Ran keyhunter on the dat files, and found tons of keys. But now what? Import them all and hope? 
Found some other software that would take a private key and give you the address pretty quick and easy. Ran that on my private key pile, outputted the addresses, grep'ed for the public address - bingo. Imported the key, restart and rescan, .37 and change BTC restored.
Dear god. Lesson learned. But after I found the BTC it was kinda cool doing that forensic work. Dont wanna do it again tho
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:05:26
Wow. Just, wow. I havent read a single response to your post, but I have to say that you are without a doubt the biggest douchebag I have seen online in a long time.
And let me clarify: I likED you. I subscribed to your blog. You and I are a lot a like. Hot headed, passionate, don't care if you piss people off in your quest for what you think is right. I liked that you went balls to the wall and called people out and told others to STFU, and were rude about it. It's my style too. I GET you.
What I DONT do? Bullshit. I don't make up shit to prove my "point". I dont make baseless threats that not only have I no intention of following through with - but also could never follow through with anyway because the "facts" behind them are completely fabricated.
I respected you and liked your style. You ruffled feathers and didn't care and I respected that. It takes balls nowadays to go against the grain and face social scorn over your passions and views. And anyone who does that nowadays gets my vote and respect.
You're just as sleazy and disgusting as that Leah cunt who fucked up that old man's peaceful life. You're worse actually. She, I think, believed in her media whore ways she was doing the "right" thing.
You, on the other hand, blatantly LIED. And there's not a one of us out here that actually believes you have this "dirt" that you chose not to release. Thats a lie also. You tried to use fear to manipulate others, and I dont fucking care WHAT you justify it with, that is morally reprehensible.
Real facts that can ruin them and you give them the chance to step down gracefully before you set the dogs loose? Thats kinda shitty but sometimes thats whatcha gotta do when assholes gain power.
Fabricating lies to use fear to manipulate? You're disgusting.
And I'm pretty sure I speak for most of us when I say any shred of respect anyone had for you is gone now.

Not being insensitive but I have to ask - why in gods name did you trust ANYONE with your $600,000? Again - cold storage wallet. 
Why the hell do people leave large sums of bitcoin on exchanges?!
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:04:26
If they claim a hot wallet can leak cold storage funds, they are full of shit. Or their definition of cold storage wallet is really fucked up. My coins in cold storage? They can't leak. They exist in a laptop with no wireless, and in a paper backup in a safe deposit box. That doesn't leak. Assholes.

But who the heck would bother with that sign? Setting up to accept bitcoin is less work than putting up a "maybe" sign and soliciting opinion. There's no downside to it. Unless you have a massive infrastructure change, there's not much reason not to.

Oh. My. God. That is amazing. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:03:05
That I understand. It just sounds like an absurdly large amount of money. $50k in btc donations is relatively tax free - meaning that's like an 80k salary for a year. Which is more than enough for a small family to live in moderate comfort. 
I was thinking more this was "we are hiring people to code at $200/hour" which sounded absurd. 
Still seems like a long time though. Just wondering, not criticizing.

Not at all. Now, under what you propose, it's identical to LB, but I need to tell it how much I want to sell today. 
I think you are viewing LB like eBay when it's not really that at all. Sure, some people have .75 BTC they want to sell so they list it. In my experience, it's more of a vehicle for traders to advertise. 
I want to place a listing, say I have it for sale, and let the contacts roll in. Matching, and more management is the last thing I need. 
Maybe for small people looking to buy $200 worth. But, then again, those people already have LB.

Seriously? They bear responsibility for your (sic) stupid decision? Have some personal responsibility. Should exchanges that have it for trade pay up too? How about bitcointalk for not censoring posts about it? should pay up too. 
That's asinine. They sold advertising. They have a right to. You also have the right (responsibility?) to not be a dumbass and waste money because you saw an ad.

As much as we all KNOW its a bullshit scam, "we all knowing" is not evidence. It's not CCNs responsibility to play mommy and put a diaper on everyone who reads their site. They sell advertising. Anyone who's not illegal, scammy, etc can pay to place an ad. Just because SOME of the community consensus is it's a scam is NOT reason for them to decline the ad or remove them. 
It's quite obvious that it is NOT overwhelming majority consensus that GAW is a scam. If it WERE we won't be having this debate. It's because either you bought in, or you feel like it's your duty to make sure SOMEONE ELSE protects others from GAW, that proves that there ARE plenty who DO believe it is NOT a scam. 
Just because you know everything and have others agree with you does not constitute proof it's a scam. 
Why the hell is it so hard for anyone to accept personal responsibility nowadays? Why is it always someone else's fault you were too goddamned stupid to watch out for yourself? Why are you not responsible for your shitty financial decisions?
They sell ad space. You don't get to decide who they sell it to.

How, praytell, DO they vet them? How do you suggest they find out Garzas true intentions? Mind reading? Break into GAW HQ?
Or just follow what SOME of the community says is true?
I say lets go with what YOU want. They use what SOME of the community believes. 
SOME of it believes GAW is legit. Done. Vetted. 
I'm dead serious: how do you, in your infinite armchair quarterback ability, suggest they vet a company no one else is able to?
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:23:05

Get 10 GH/s for only .5 BTC! All you need to sign up is an email, a password, and your payout address! Then just send .5 BTC to that address to get started!
I'm stunned that anyone would fall for that crap.
EDIT: Apparently if you hit cancel on the payment page, you get to a "my account" page where there's a chat box. I think maybe it IS real - but there are a few "intelligent" people in there who have figured out they will NEVER get their BTC back...
If you check it out, the chat user "fuasshole" is me ;)

GPU mining litecoin alternatives, converting to BTC. The return isnt bad. Plus - it's learning.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:30:31
I own about 4.5 BTC and I'm praying the market crashes. So I can buy more. BTC is not a business that will fold and vaporize if the value drops. It'll still be there. And once ebay, amazon, google etc start accepting it, that will further "legitimize" it, and it will skyrocket once again.
Pissed I didnt buy a month ago. Oh well. Live and learn.

I'm making a killing mining it right now in a multipool. It may be a "joke" but in the last 24 hours it's earned me just under .1BTC - at the current exchange rate thats what? $65? And thats multipool mining it. I've been mining other litecoins - but it's so highly valued the pool keeps going back to it.

I was considering buying an ASIC miner. So I wrote a little spreadsheet that took difficulty increases into account. If I got a BFL Monarch (or whatever the 600ghs unit was) in 6 months (hahahhaha. Hhahaha. hahahahahhahahahahah) and if the difficulty increased 10% every 10 days, and BTC stayed at $1000 (thats where it was when I did this exercise) I'd break even in like 5 months I think?
If the difficulty went to 15% every 10 days I'd break even... in 14 months? Something like that. It was a long time.
Then the difficulty jumped from 707mil to 908mil. TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT.
Screw that shit. I just bought more bitcoin when I dumped back into the 500s.
