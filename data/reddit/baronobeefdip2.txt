I also live in the united states, I want to exchange for USD, I don't have a bank account to dump everything into, I would prefer to order a money pak (send me cash through the mail).

Yes, that's what's happening right now.

BTC-E does paypal, Plus I have been exploring it and I am liking it.

Xapo is going to have it's card go out into the world in the middle of july, The site claims that the card is free and there is no conversion fee for fiat money. So as you spend it you will have the coins automatically converted to the money that your country accepts.

They don't have a phone number, just an email address which I read doesn't get checked often. Can you recommend an exchange that doesn't require all kinds of verification. I'm not planning to send it toa bank account just making it out to cash.

I mostly come on reddit for tech support, memes and just random topics that I like to leave comments on. Which isn't very often. But just like what the other guy that commented on here, there are people that say some other things like this with the intent on scamming people and collecting their hard earned money for things other than what they promised. But yeah, I thought of it because of outreach, USA isn't necessarily a collectivist society so there are a lot of greedy pricks that live here (especially Texas). Thanks for the comment.

I guess I don't blame you, Some people like to get creative with this stuff. I would think that there are some outrageous ones that I think are either trolls or they are genuinely not very good at it, But I'm talking IRS email scams from back in the day. Well I was just wondering.

I am having trouble with the coinmkt.com site, I sent some coin to the account and the balance still shows 0. What I liked about it was that it accepted LTC, Doge and feather as currency. Plus it had an option for trading my BTC for LTC (not that anymore would want to do that but I was curous). Have you had any experience with this site, and which site on that list would you reccomend. And which one sends $ in cash. I prefer that rather than getting myself another Debit/Credit card to carry around.
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:50:54
I have my eyes set on Xapo. They have a release date and the cards are only $15. No other fees will apply.

I finally have given up on the coinmkt, they seem relatively new and their interface is kinda buggy. you know of one where I can get a money order without using anything but the address that I want the money sent to (coinmkt was requesting my ID and utility bill which I don't have because I don't own a house or pay rent, and I shouldn't need to provide something like my state ID because all I want is to provide an address for mailing the money to). It came to the point where I could no longer withdraw from the account and I decided to stop fighting with it. I just lost $20 in bitcoin on there. Which one do you prefer, I want something that will not require lots of personal information just to start exchanging for currencies, I also want one that will exchange my litecoins for bitcoins. I also want to find an exchange that doesn't give fees just for holding the money. At some point I'll just use it for conversions and keep the coins on my phone. And the personal information is a must.

This looks like a business type thing, I am just wanting to fund research in robotics and image processing. I was looking for something where I can post a project or cause, describe it, and have people donate money to the project where I have the option to either or not put in perks like indiegogo does (I don't want to include perks). But is this site any good for the kind of project that I am trying to fund.

I just found that I can do it indirectly with virwox, you need to buy second life currency then you can exchange for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:11:44
Do you have an estimate as to when.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:20:25
Yeah. the last bitcoin thing that said it was going to be up and going within a month or so ended up not being up and running at all. It's been a year and now I don't really care for it anymore and have moved on to other things. Do you know of any more crowd funding sites.
Some of the ones I have looked at
* [Coinfunder](
* [BTC-Funding](
* [StartCoin](

well crap, then I'm out of ideas. I think there was an exchange somewhere where you can exchange papal currency with virtual reality currency from places like second life etc, then exchange it into bitcoin. It took a lot of money away from you because you needed to exchange it twice but it's worth a try if you allocate funds to do whatever it is you want to do with your bitcoin.

That's the thing, PayPal didn't want anything to do with bitcoin and understandably so since it's value is volatile (It went up recently because of economic uncertainty such as the Brexit vote, The American election of Donald Trump, and whatever madness is happening in china that made it surge this past month). However, I think there might be traders somewhere out there if you google it hard enough. Also I think [btc-e.com](btc-e.com) has a way to pay for it via paypal. But I am just wondering. Why not do a job or trade online for bitcoin? Or fill out some surveys and gamble for more bitcoin?

Isn't the newer generation not showing up for Mass becoming a problem for organized religion that they are seeking other ways of generating income?

I don't want to use a third party though, I want to be able to see what it takes to make the site itself react to a bitcoin transaction without those third part apps.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:57:50
I did find a few ways to convert it via JSON, but I don't want to use a payment processor because I don't want to register as a merchant. There should be a way for the website to react to payment transactions and for the wallet to be directly stored on the server.

Strange that Trump doesn't have Bitcoin address, I thought be was an opportunist.

Where can I find the code to do things automatically? I want the website to display either a QR code, or just give the person an address to send to and then detect the transaction and send them to another page while also writing to a database. I am wondering where I can find the PHP code for this since the bitcoin website (where bitcoin core and bitcoind sources can be found) doesn't offer more than just general information, there isn't much code to go through over there. Where can I find the code, I tried google searching but nothing comes up, maybe google doesn't want me doing business in bitcoin?
UPDATE: [Found some information]( But I don't know what the username and passwords are in reference to in the php section, I don't know what these credentials will be from. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:50:21
How do I get started with all of that?
