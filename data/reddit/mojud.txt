Yes, this is true, but at least they will have a nice dog to look at every time they open their wallets.

The app didn't have any in-app option to be purchase. The problem is in Apple transparency, or better, lack of it. What is happening with Bitcoin isn't new, there are LOTS of other apps that were removed from the app store without any warning or with poor justification.
AppGratis pulled from the App Store: 
VLC app removed from App Store: 
Apple removes over 5000 apps from iPhone app store:

I'm a member of the Dogecoin community and just signed the petition. The Bitcoin regulation will have a directly impact on all cryptocurrencies, not only Bitcoin.

If you check the dogecoin community in the last 24h there were two threads about petitions that started in one asking for signatures in the Open Letter about the Bitcoin Regulation in the US and another one asking for signatures in the Petition for Apple to allow Bitcoin apps in the App Store. I think it's happening faster than we think.

I don't the market share, but the jailbreak community is very active, just like the Bitcoin one.

Fellow Shibe, we have much to learn from bitcoin, spread the love! When you get angry again, remember this moment:

We all loose when we start to fight against each other. Today Russia almost banned Bitcoin, yesterday Apple banned Bitcoin, last week the US decided to start a Bitcoin regulation. These are our enemies.

There is a discussion going on in the Dogecoin subreddit about this, you could add a lot to the it.
I know that some Bitcoiners and some Shibes don't get along very well, but this is important and can impact ALL coins.
The link for the thread there:

The current iOS is still jailbreakable, but Apple will patch it in the next iOS release (iOS 7.1). You just have to make an iTunes backup (in case something goes wrong) and  jailbreak using the PC application that you can download here:

You can distributed it via Cydia, the app store for jailbroken devices. The creator and owner of Cydia is on reddit, you can check his work over @_date: 2014-02-04 13:00:40
As far as I can see, this whole Bitcoin vs Dogecoin issue will not take us anywhere. Cryptocurrencies are very fragile and once the financial system starts to see it as a threat we are dead. Bitcoin is the proof of concept, it is here to show that the technology works; Dogecoin is aimed at the mob, it is here to show that cryptocurrencies have a place in the real world. Both benefits from the existence of the other. It will be much more difficult for any government to prohibit cryptocurrency when many people use it in a large scale.

Yes, 30% of all in-app purchases goes to Apple. That's why they want to keep their market share by removing any app that may circumvent that.
