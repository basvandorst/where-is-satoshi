I talked with a financial advisor from Morgan Stanley today and he wanted to me to move all my assets under his control. I asked him what his experience is with crypto currencies and he said Morgan Stanley doesn't touch crypto because there is no regulation around it there is no way to manage risk. I thanked him for his time and told him I wasn't interested.

get rid of that cloudflare garbage. i can't use your shitty exchange over tor.
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:53:58
not very dark if you're using cloudflare you nuckleheads.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:54:11
sidechain is garbage.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:19:45
it doesn't matter because you would not be storing your coins on any exchange.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:54:24
not when it cost $394 to send $1000.
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:02:42
if you have 5 rocks and they are worth $100 and then one day they are worth $500. You still only have 5 rocks until you sell them for dollars.
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:17:13
you lost me buckaroo.
@_date: 2018-10-05 05:16:48
I'm poor. Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2018-10-04 07:09:21
I hope it crashes and burns since I don't have any BTC. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 04:47:17
the problem is people like you can use it too.
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:55:05
not a lot. it is like after the mtgox crash. took a year and a half to recover. I expect it to do the same in the next 6 months.
@_date: 2018-10-20 04:00:23
In all honesty the internet is a cesspool of shit.
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:49:18
this is stupid you can't even do smart contracts in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:15:50
he is bitcoin jesus. fuck.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:47:14
settle down kiddo.
@_date: 2018-10-20 04:46:53
i can dig it.
@_date: 2018-10-27 01:00:38
you would have to exchange it for USD to realize a gain, same as anything else.
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:49:22
Bitcoin will be back, it always does. I've been a hodler since $4.
@_date: 2018-11-09 03:20:11
Nope. you go around spewing filth don't expect corporate america to have your back.
@_date: 2018-11-09 03:48:20
That is true, but they put Banking and PayPal at risk with their behavior. They were leaking classified documents. I would cut them off too if it were my company.
@_date: 2018-11-09 02:44:18
PayPal isn't a right.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:23:41
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:57:43
bitcoin is crashing.
@_date: 2018-11-04 06:35:35
so what if he is or isn't.

My 73 year old mother still sends me articles about Steve Jobs because I use a mac. I'm not even that big a fan of apple, i think they are a terrible company and their hardware sucks now. It was good about 5 years ago.
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:32:40
600k+ USD
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:08:29
good for you. i'm using an anonymous account, you think I give a shit about karma? lol
@_date: 2018-11-02 05:19:37
you should install metamask. it told me it was a phishing site.
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:00:58
somebody stole all my BTC when it was worth 600k, so I'll just watch on the sidelines to see how the experiment goes.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:46:51
i started buying at $32 and bought all the way up to $1200. I didn't spend the 4k all at once.
coinbase isn't new. lol
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:59:09
the number one rule of crypto is don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:10:34
i only paid 4k for it. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 06:55:43
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:06:46
i may buy back in at $1500.
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:25:58
no particular reason. But then again if it hits $1500 it'll go all the way to $50.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:51:39
will buy back in at $1500.
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:04:19
lets hope so. i'm ready to retire.
@_date: 2018-11-02 04:50:58
[musk.gift]( is a phishing site. Do not go there.
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:51:17
if you want to hold or accept any crpto use [coinpayments.net]( otherwise try something more mainstream like [coinbase.com]( or bitpay..
Typically you just add a button to bitpay or coinbase and that creates a transaction on their servers, then you get redirected back to /thank-you.html or something like that.
@_date: 2018-11-18 05:05:19
yes. a little over half a mil.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:51:16
so you were worth over a billion in january?
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:03:53
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:54:35
good luck getting a blockchain developer to work onsite.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:01:24
I've held for 8 years. Never paid a dime in taxes.
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:17:11
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:40:57
who the hell pays taxes in crypto? if you do you're missing the fucking point.
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:05:38
only thing they would pay me in.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:20:23
the trader who bought at the top just crapped his shorts.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:13:16
i probably invested 25k over the course of 8 years.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:43:50
compared to what?
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:22:02
it will hit 500
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:19:29
i took ETH as my salary for 6 months. My $30k paychecks are now worth about $3k. fml.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:17:15
they won't get much all my btc was stolen from me this year.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:31:17
