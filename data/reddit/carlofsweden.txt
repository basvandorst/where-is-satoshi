if carl had a thousand bitcoins carl would sell them all for 5000 just to crash the market and financially hurt the people who spam crappy memes.
hodl was funny maybe the first 5 times it was said in that thread ages ago. after that its been unfunny, and getting more and more unfunny every day.
carl is happy carl sold off the btc on 17k, carl would also be a little bit happy if it never recovers just to know the "hodl" spammers are doing poorly.

yes it does because the average is across all ages, its not an average for 18 year olds, its not an average for 30 year olds, its not an average for 60 year olds, its the average of all american workers.
please learn to understand averages.

so? rich people making 1 mil a year is also included. do you even understand what an average is?

average american works less than 50 years though.
and even if the average american worked 50 years, the average income in USA is 31,099, and you will earn less than this (the average american that is) during your first years in the work force.
so yes, 1.8m is more than most will earn in a lifetime. (especially when we start taking taxes into account, then that 31k drops)

it is if you want to use it as a currency, as no one would buy something if they could buy more things for the same amount a while later.

who the fuck works 78.74 years of their life?
assume someone works from 18 to 67, thats 36 734 per year (1.8mil over 49 years) average median income in usa is $31,099 a year, meaning your 1.8mil is more than majority of americans earn in their entire life.
(18 being age of entering the adult life, many starts working later, 67 being the age of retirement in USA. worth noting is that we're assuming you're making the average income every year of your working life, where as its more likely you'd start below that)
remember, even if many redditors have a degree in STEM fields etc, that does not mean the average person do.

carl isnt trying to say bitcoin is shit, carl is just trying to understand how it could ever transition from a store of value to a commonly used currency
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:49:22
1.8m is far more than most will make in a lifetime.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:06:17
and the average salary is 31k making it roughly a third more, which is a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:36:36
no shit

have there been any discussion about missing bitcoins in the community?
assume a rich guy dies, he has 100,000 bitcoin in his wallet, no one can find it however, so thats 100k bitcoin lost forever.
these things will continue happening, people losing their wallets, and bitcoin cant be printed infinitely like how the rich (banks) treat normal money, just add a zero to your own account and BAM they got what they needed.
anyway, bitcoin will eventually start becoming ultra slow to mine, is the community just relying on prices going up constantly to compensate for the missing btc and everyone will split it into smaller and smaller portions?
how can a currency that will need constant increase in value ever be considered a good currency for shopping, since next week it will be worth more?
we're talking a post-bitcoin rush era, assume bitcoin has been largely adapted by people around the world, say 6 years from now, whatever.
how will the bitcoin ever find a stable valuation when it should, if carl understand it correctly, constantly increase in valuation in order to remain stable due to the amount of btc in circulation constantly going down

carl wussied out on that last spike. cant keep holding when the profit becomes so big you'd go full emo if it crashed.
carl sold most of it off to very good profit, most were selfmined many, many years ago. felt irresponsible to hodl.

its not an investment, its speculation. its not a matter of agreeing or not.
you're speculating in bitcoin, you are not investing in bitcoin.
if you honestly dont even know the difference between the two, maybe you shouldnt put money into things until you learn the very basics.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:30:46


its speculating, not investing.

why doesnt just the real satoshi use his key to publish a statement he isnt craig wright?
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:54:35
youre making the mistake of thinking that guy knows anything about markets.
all he knows is that he owns bitcoins and he wants them to go up.
thats all he knows. other than that is just him saying whatever makes himself feel good.
