@_date: 2018-01-06 00:09:40
Not doing enough studying research or gambling lessons.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:02:06
Nah, just sharing my personal accomplishment with everyone. Didn't realizs that was a crime...
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:05:44
Haha my thoughts exactly and their is such things as paper wallets hardware wallets
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:04:38
To be fair we all know btc has its issues and those are the issues 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:46
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:05:00
Haha basically, ill probably keep trading alt coins, gives a certain rush, but within limit 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:56:00
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:33:09
Yup. This is scary 4k in 24 hours is uhhh fast to say the least

@_date: 2017-12-30 00:45:06

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:15
Yea I dont believe ill ever join the 21 m club, not anymore.. �� it isnt feasible with my income 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:02
Praying for a correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:42:23
.25 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:26:01
It was under 1k for like 30 seconds, unfortunatly i didnt jump the gun. Its a waiting game now
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:27:39
Not random, they are a huge company that nets millions of dollars. 
I did I showed support everything, but I dont think they are gonna bother funding me...
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:13:13
Thats what I'm saying
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:24:17
The site OPSkins, basically sent 100$ worth of coin for 100$. Never received my balance and lost 100$ in coin. Support was no help saying I should have received an email from G2A which is not how their bitcoin system works since you scan a QR. Now they aren't funding the account even with my proof of me sending it to their wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:06:27
Don't sell, then you'll have to buy again at 5500
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:23:30
I feel the same, but when btc is 15k each 9k will be a bargain. Look forward 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:03:07
Oh trust I know, but you never know ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:12:24
I don't know it seems after 2x got canceled/postponed we might wanna expect a dip. Doubt well push 8k 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:58:05
Just wondering if they shoukd be trusted, was planning on selling them to some friends but no longer will
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:57:38
Oh they should all be empty
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:56:24
Very true, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:04
Makes sense ill try to be more strategic with my buying, I just but every Friday regardless of price
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:47:36
Yea private key on the back, idk my brother bought them
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:18:01
Just the seller amd my brother 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:56:03
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:58
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:32:45
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:56:37

@_date: 2017-11-16 21:00:53
Lol not every time I try to make as much $ as possible, but I'm not afraid to buy at ATHs
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:56:15
Its on the card , the other side
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:49:48
In what ways should I not trust them
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:58:53
Do I jump in with this ATH, or pray for a dip? What if this is a dip...
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:37:17
The smart ones are saying that, buy no matter what
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:04:50
That's what I'm saying. At least some ya know 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:00:45
I'm not in a situation where I pay rent, just minor food costs and I chip in towards oil/electricity. I am only 18 and live with my brother in my grandparents old house. So most of my $ is $ I theoretically can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:55:31
To the moon tho /s 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:46:25
Demand goes down price goes down, demand will rise again as new markets arise. We all know this. Celebrate 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:42:16
Woohoo! Price of a coin is bout to drop once LE gets done selling all their new coins!
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:55:00
Just speculation
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:09:32
Is it worth it?
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:00:09
Coinbase is super easy, providing you are legal.
