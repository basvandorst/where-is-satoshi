He is voicing his own opinion. Selling.

Payed on low 180 sat/b
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:34:14
yeah samourai literally says low fee:  180 sat / b. It uses fucking segwit. Its a shame. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:34:56
Well, yeah no argument against that.
Probably a whole bunch of people who let that one slip right?

Most languages have index starting at 0. Because those are references to the place the item is stored at.
Starting at 1 is nonlogical, but some languages did so to make the language easier to understand. Most languages did not follow suit.
Just a stupid mistake, it happens. Just find it weird so many people call him a shit programmer. Most programmers have read over a mistake they made. We all do it.
Thats why people use a rubber ducky to explain code to themselves so that you find bugs and stupid mistakes

I am new and i just paid 180 sat/b to transfer 0,0001 bitcoin do you know how much i lost? ��, well its a time to learn aint it :)

Still this is about fee estimation. It estimated 180 sat / b for me which i payed. was 3 euros which is a lot.

Na, not a freshman. Most freshman get involved with the basics of C++/C/java and such and this definitely requires mlre experience with coding and bitcoin.
