I'm quite sure there are many casinos that support poker and accept cryptocurrencies. But, they're all off-chain, of course. Haven't seen an on-chain solution around. Those are pretty hard to come by for any game, not just poker.

Some things to note:
a) This post is on the front page of after 14 minutes, and has 24 upvotes. This is probably a post which has paid for upvotes.
b) The channel on which this video has posted has posted no other videos, only this one. It has no reputation and is not established at all.
c) The person speaking sounds like a paid Fiverr voiceover.
d) Nobody in their right mind would figure out an exploit to make a free $3,700 and then *share* it with everyone *instead of making free unlimited money*.
e) This method to "easily win 1 BTC" requires you to first deposit your own money before you are able to win.
This leads me to believe that this website is a scam, and you should stay away from it.

Looks like it, yes. Plus, crypto casinos are usually provably fair, which is why I prefer them over most other places. They often tend to have low house edges too! This one was a tad high though, about 3%, iirc.
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:34:39
That's not true; all provably fair casinos have a house edge. You can look up the details, and if you don't understand them, I'll be happy to answer any questions you have, because I am quite well-versed with it :)
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:09:44
Thank you so much! This really means a lot. &lt;3
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:23:09
You're right, I should have done that! I waited some time, then someone on the group reminded me of the withdrawal, so I went back to the site and re-pasted the invoice. The payment went through to my wallet instantly!
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:36:39
It's certainly annoying. The DeBitpay tool online helps a lot, though.
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:10:37
My stance is actually very clearly that bitcoin is NOT a Ponzi scheme... wow, you guys ignorant to the max.
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:25:20
You're right. It can't be said for everything, though, that if new money stops coming in, the price would collapse. Bitcoin has a constant daily supply pressure whereas many asset classes like shares don't necessarily have that
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:17:57
Correct. Not all miners sell, but many do to cover costs. Not all market entrants are new, but many are. Doesn't mean it's not a pyr.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:45:47
Oxymoron. For the price to remain constant, the daily new demand must balance out the daily new supply of mined coins, which requires new people to constantly buy.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:21:12
Not gonna lie, he has us in the first half

Stopped reading after this. But there's some good info in there.
@_date: 2019-08-04 07:14:32


Bitcoin goes up when new money enters bitcoin. Understood? Good.
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:02:15
It's what I learnt in economics. I understand that inflationary systems collapse due to mismanagement and hyperinflation, but that's usually not a flaw with inflation, just a flaw in monetary policy.
I understand that you might be completely right, but I hope you see that what you're saying goes against every major economist and economic principle that we learn today.
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:48:04
Do you know the effects of a deflationary currency on the general economy? I suggest you look it up; it's catastrophic
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:08:26
Is it really worth the effort? I feel like unless CoinJoins are involved or tumbling through a third-party service for a fee, chain analysis companies wouldn't really care if the privacy is terrible or bad, they'd figure it out anyway. Feels like more trouble than it's worth. Plus, 75+% of the end-users don't really know or care about their transactions being traceable, since they're not active criminals or tax evaders.
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:29:32
My argument is based off what I know in class, and sure there may be no examples but that doesn't mean it's not true.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:22:02
Still way more than enough. If you're right 55% of the time you can make millions. Casinos only need a 1% house edge to generate their wealth... 5% edge is insane
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:41:05
Ponzi no, but it's akin to a pyramid scheme. Future gains are only possible if new investors come in. If new investors stop coming in the whole thing collapses.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:10:25
This is nothing new... We all know that BTC is the only truly secure PoW coin. The rest are just vulnerable, and buying them is like gambling on the fact that some guy won't take over it on a whim.

An economy built on deflationary currencies end up with low spending and low investment, and eventually people just stop buying anything but necessities

If bitcoin replaces the legacy financial system it would save us billions, but I don't think the devolvement of the global economy into a deflationary spiral would be worth it.

Ever heard of arbitrage bots? -_-
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:47:11
Difference in rarity. Rare coins aren't minted daily so there's no need for a constant influx of new people to keep price levels stable

I've thought about this long and hard... what cryptocurrency to buy? And well, I guess the answer to that depends on what you mean by cryptocurrency, and what you mean by buy. It's not obvious to me that anything other than bitcoin has any form of long term potential... Life is suffering man... Involve oneself with altcoins, and one becomes bitter and resentful... we need to rise above and introduce true meaning into our life, and the only way we can begin to bear the suffering that life throws our way is to know that we have bitcoin backing us up...

You'd have to ask my boss about the specifics. As far as I know, we have a Curacao gaming license and a UK trademark on the name, but that's about it. Also, the terms of use specify that you should only play on the bot if gambling is legal in your jurisdiction and if you're of age, but as far as I know, the bot currently does not enforce that in any way.
@_date: 2019-09-06 08:46:33
Imagine sending to the wrong address or making a typo switching the fee and the sent amount or something.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:00:19
Sounds fun, but the site you linked (unicorn.com) doesn't appear to be a gambling site
@_date: 2019-09-03 05:18:27
I have no idea what that is or why you think that, but alright man, have a good day
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:55:15
Don't want to sound like a shill, but since you asked...
I'm on the team for flashflip, which is a bitcoin gambling bot built into Discord. It currently has coinflip, rock-paper-scissors, and bank. I think it's pretty fricking cool.
Moreover, we accept 0-conf transactions in most cases, so you can play instantly! "In a flash", as we say :)
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:54:31
Wanna know the sad part?
They don't take a long-winded connection and turn it into something that seems shady. They actively *seek* such connections without doing any research into the person themself, simply to troll and find any excuse to badmouth talented individuals.
Case in point:
"Can someone post the details of the relationships between Joi Ito / MIT Media Lab / Jeffrey Epstein / Blockstream?"
- A post by Roger Ver a few days ago.
Check his history (u/MemoryDealers), won't link the post here because r/btc will accuse us of brigading the post or some shit. But yeah. These are the underhanded tactics they use. Not surprising, coming from the same person who renamed Bcash to "Bitcoin" on their site and scammed new bitcoiners out of possibly thousands.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:55:29
Bitcoin is not a Ponzi, it's a pyramid (where people currently invested can only make money if new money continues to flow in, or else everything collapses).
(Keep in mind, gold is also a similar pyramid scheme. Pyramids can work for a long time if there is a widespread decentralized belief in the underlying good.)
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:30:10
Easy... publish a blog post, return it, and hope the owner contacts me to send me a few coins as a thank you :D

To be fair, he took a risky bet and it didn't pay off. Props to him for at least putting his money where his mouth is.
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:26:13
Lol, so wrong. You can live in a house. That's intrinsic value. Shelter. Food has intrinsic value, as does a human being. Gold? Just a shiny metal. Bitcoin? Just code. The value prescribed to it is by society, not just by its existence.
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:19:02
Well, the main USP about flashflip is that it's provably fair (you can mathematically verify the odds and ensure that the bet amount doesn't affect your rolls). Also, it's instant. All bets are resolved within 1 second. eSports doesn't do that, so I don't think I'll be adding that any time soon. As for signup rewards, none at the moment, but if you hop in the Discord server and say you're from reddit, I'll send some bits your way! We also have a faucet that dispenses free bits every 12 hours (up to 50,000 satoshis, with the average payout being 100 satoshis).
@_date: 2019-09-06 09:29:44
Can probably be done via ETH (messily) but not BTC. Would be better to have a trusted third party like u/theymos or someone public to handle the funds.
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:36:12
You just said that shelter and food have no intrinsic value, which means you're trying to play word games instead of seeing my point. No point arguing if we don't agree on the definitions. Alright man, think whatever you want.
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:58:03
r/Bitcoin tends to be heavily censored during altcoin season, and r/btc is more free.
On the other hand, r/btc adopted the fork of Bitcoin known as Bitcoin Cash, and actively scam people by presenting "Bitcoin Cash" as "the real Bitcoin", even though it's an altcoin. It's run by Roger Ver, someone who at one point actively scammed thousands by renaming "Bitcoin Cash" to "Bitcoin" on his popular website "bitcoin.com".
Both subs have their pros and cons, but as it stands, r/btc is getting extremely toxic, and the people there are pretty blind to the truth. I've noticed that censorship in r/bitcoin isn't as serious, and I hope it continues.
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:53:04
Holy fucking fuck
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:17:57
Wrong. Real estate and stocks have intrinsic value. Fiat is more a scam than a pyramid scheme. Bitcoin and gold have no real value except what we see in it as a society.
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:02:24
I'm not ruling out that there may be another altcoin season in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:11:45
Every early technology is used for criminal purposes. Hell, the dark net still thrives, and USD (cash) is the most popular currency for terrorist funding.
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:02:02
No worries. To be fair, they don't advertise Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin on the site anymore, that just happens in the subreddit. Although they do refer to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core, which is sort of annoying since Bitcoin Core is a piece of software and not the coin itself.

The wallet does not check if the address is unique or not. The wallet simply generates the address and stores the private key in its key set. If the address already contains funds, you will see those funds appear in your wallet balance, although this is so unlikely that it's not even worth considering.

I don't think so. I think he started off lying for attention and to have a little fun, but he had no idea how far he would go, and now he can't bear to admit he was lying all along, so he just goes with it. You can see in his 2012-ish BBC interview where he claimed he was Satoshi, he was hesitant and you could see cracks in his demeanour, but now, he's gotten so used to lying, he's started to confidently believe his own bullshit. Sunk cost fallacy. What a piece of shit scammer.

You can put in the wrong address, sure, but the sending of money to a bitcoin address can only be done deliberately.
