Bitcoin is not the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:23:50




Not talking about futures.
@_date: 2018-05-08 07:46:25


That's what the market is. If you don't have a sell/buy order at an exchange, you aren't on the market.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:16:08
You don't understand what he's saying. Google "greater fool".

Bitcoin is more like flipping a coin than anything else if you plan on day trading.
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:44:20


It's the way that a great many people in finance determine whether or not something is investment or speculation.

I want a pony.
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:57:17
He could buy every bitcoin on the market.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:12:17
He understands bitcoin (as in the thing you can buy with fiat) well enough. He doesn't understand the blockchain, but bitcoin is not the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-11 04:01:39
Post hoc ergo propter hoc.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:54:17


Nope. You don't have standing.
You could maybe submit an amicus brief.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:14:41
Post proofs on the third.

When the price of milk doesn't jump around in bitcoin over the course of a single day, then this will be viable.
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:51:53
The issue is not whether a thing *has* value, it's whether it can, over time, *produce* value. Bitcoin does not. Blockchain technology can be incorporated into value producing things, though.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:52:17
Yes, they can.
That's why this conspiracy theory doesn't really make any sense.
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:37:54
Lending services aren't going anywhere and neither are governments wanting to control their monetary policy.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:13:56
Dead cat on a trampoline.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:57:38
Yep, 2000% is clearly not a bubble.
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:56:17
Do you honestly think that they're just leaving their savings in fiat?
@_date: 2018-05-08 05:02:46
Stocks have value because dividends. Gold is much more comparable.
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:15:29
I short whenever it gets above 9200.
@_date: 2018-05-07 10:16:07
Who are you replying to?
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:17:34
If you think that this would change his mind on whether bitcoin is an investment rather than speculation, you are dead wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-02 02:31:55
Because you can't pay your taxes in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:39:45
Why are you saving in cash?
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:40:28
Nope. Any coin which is intrinsicly deflationary is going to be more useful as speculation material than as a currency.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:58:32


Are you still hodling beanie babies?
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:42:23
You run an exchange and make money off other people speculating?
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:39:02
Everything is a gamble. Speculation is distinct from investing in that investing can yield some sort of cash flow.
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:54:14


Have you spent any time at all trading outside of crypto?
Nobody in the real world is going to talk about shorting futures without specifying that they're referring to futures.
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:34:20
They haven't banned crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:58:16
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:55:09
And here's yet another reason why bitcoin hasn't reached mass adoption yet.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:51:53
Brokerage is a percentage of the transaction, it costs the same regardless of how high it's valued.

@_date: 2018-05-11 01:23:47
Right, shares can produces something.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:35:09
Okay, now bitcoin are 50 billion a pop.
Is bitcoin usable as a currency at that price?
@_date: 2018-05-08 07:43:14
He couldn't do it with cash, but if you think that Gates can't amass an astonishing amount of capital very quickly, you are wrong.

Shorting works by selling a unit that you don't own with a contract to buy it back later.
Shorting on the scale that billionaires could short would 100% crash the price.
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:09:38


You are straight up incorrect, my son.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:15:49
I like profit tho.
@_date: 2018-05-08 07:48:43


Margin lending is a thing.
@_date: 2018-05-08 07:48:01
And he could keep buying.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:43:14
Buffet likes buying into companies which produce value at reasonable prices.
Bitcoin produces nothing.
Why would he buy into bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:58:49
Dead cat.
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:50:51
No, I like profit.
@_date: 2018-05-08 07:41:36


Stocks which will never pay dividends and aren't voting stock have no inherent value. The only reason to buy them is because you think someone else will pay more for them in the future. Same with gold. Same with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:44:16
Blockchain technology != Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-03 08:28:37


He considers it speculation because the only way to acquire income through it is to sell it at a higher price than you bought at.

Ownership of an organisation which (presumably) makes things for sale, ie: which produces value.

Dead cat bounce. Next stop 7k.

Thank fuck all of crypto is tied to a sinking ship.

@_date: 2018-05-03 17:40:25


If they'll never pay dividends and aren't voting shares? Yes.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:44:46
You were saying?
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:11:14
Hahaha yeah what could two of the richest men on the planet possibly know about finance
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:27:53
Bitcoin is not the blockchain.

His father also died more than half a century ago. This is horseshit, if that's all that OP has.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:44:46
Bitcoin has reached its ceiling.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:19:06
Do you buy shit?
Then you're still feeding Buffet. He doesn't give a fuck what you buy shit with.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:56:33
Bitcoin is not the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:00:35
Because if the market drops significantly and you're already fully invested, you can't buy in further.

This sub spends 90% of its energy talking about bitcoin cash.
Food for thought.

Down to 8k we goooooo
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:21:13
Nice ability to read a chart.
@_date: 2018-04-30 10:22:15
Below 9200, first step on the path to 8k!
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:01:01
This is what an unregulated market looks like, sorry.
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:07:01
Why are you looking at a chart if you plan on never selling?
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:29:19
Easy way to evade taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:39:54
So you sold at the ATH, yes?
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:44:12
You were a forex trader for a decade and you think markets are logical? Okay.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:36:21
Not if you never sell.
