Heres how much the dark net uses and effects Bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:49:34
Oh and we almost to 8k now. From what 9400 at 240 pm eastern today?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:06:03
And I'm not saying it won't go back up. I'm sure some mutil hundred millionaire will come scoop it all up at once to drive the price back up and hold it then sell it all at once for double. 
As for now I bet money it will go to 7000$.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:32:46
Well here's you a reference point. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:58:56
Tell me have you ever visited dark web sites and seen the sheer amount if drugs and their prices for sale? Even just one market? Let's say empire with tens of thousands of listings minimum 100$ each Bitcoin. You think that has zero impact on Bitcoin price ? Just that one markets demand when there's tons of markets?
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:54:56
Then you haven't visited. Hundreds of markets with thousands of listings each? Each product a minimum 100$ and most in the high 3 to low 4 figures. Where do you even think Bitcoin value and demand comes from in the first place? People arent regularly buying groceries with it you know.
@_date: 2019-09-24 04:51:30
Drug dealers and buyers might argue against that.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:48:51
That's how much people spend. You have no clue how much these people are holding.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:57:24
Hey look it's went down to 8700 from 9400 just a minute ago. What do you know.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:22:55
Actually I don't do drugs. That's retarded. Funny though. Ha ha. Killer. Funny as the people claiming to know all about bitcoin and don't even know what the fuck it's all about. Go spend some time on the dark web. Go do a little browsing and see what crypto is all about.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:33:27
Here. Since you don't believe me maybe you'll believe the premier financial publication.

Ya, if you want half of everything in fees. Cash app is free Bitcoin purchases and withdrawals. I have used coinbase many times. Cash app will charge you a little to transfer the cash after sales to your bank if you do a fast deposit but nothing in the way of coinbase on large sales.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:59:03
They can't always do that so they keep it in a hard wallet. Plus a lot is in escrow and released each day to them as their product arrives and the funds are released. Also someone just gobbled up a bunch of Bitcoin and held it 8200$. It went from 8200$ to 8400$ instantly and held. So maybe price stay there or go back up a bit.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:08:05
Also 1000$ for coke? You have any idea how much frigging drugs move thru the dark web? Your people's naiveness amazes me.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:37:48
What's that? How's your investment holding out?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:15:51
Also go download Tor browser and visit dark.fail for some links. Find out what Bitcoin is all about. You seem pretty blind.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:03:34
You think drug dealers use banks? You think they suddenly put all their Bitcoin into the bank? You really don't get how any of this works do you. Bitcoin is worth money because people use it to buy drugs. That's it. Monero is popular why? It's privacy coin and you can use it to BUY DRIGS.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:06:08
You really think they deal in that miniscule amounts. Go pay a visit sometime . These sites deal in millions a day dude. 
Also I lost 500$ on my stop loss order..made it back and improved my position to .50 Bitcoin from .40 with the same money all in the span of an hour. I'm happy.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:59:43
Bitcoin has went up and down thousands of dollars in a months time. Expect people to not want to bet on price fluctuations when it's that volatile. Give it a month. Not only is a Bitcoin halving coming that will potentially drive up price dark net markets are reviving after their recent breakups and exit scams. 
Also they traded close to 100 bitcoins. Don't seem like much but that's a bit of money. Once some asshole makes a few million every asshole is gonna try and do the same.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:53:47
You obviously never used the dark web markets then. Do you have any idea of the volume of Bitcoin that goes thru them a day? Do you really believe Bitcoin has any fucking value outside of drug dealing? If you do youre mental. 
If the dark web was stopped right now Bitcoin demand would plummet. 
Also just sit back and watch. All these dark web dealers with tens of thousands of dollars in escrow for goods they already shipped aren't gonna wait around and see what Bitcoin does when they finally get their funds. They aren't gonna hold it with it bottoming out either.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:45:12
Except that 1 billion a year is what is driving the price movements. That is the demand. Otherwise it's a bunch of people buying and selling for profit. The DEMAND. is to use it to buy drugs. The people investing are betting on that demand.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:13:32
No. But you do realize these drug dealers hold shit loads of Bitcoin right? You ever seen a 300$ product with thousands of feedback on the dark web? Just one product out of thousands. That's not an insignificant volume these people are holding. The investors are buying and selling dips. The dealers are fucking bailing to get their cash to buy more drugs.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:21:56
Small amount. Phhhhppptt. Please tell me you people aren't this stupid. Claims to know all about Bitcoin. Never visited dark web. 
Please tell me what it is people do with Bitcoin besides buy drugs and try and profit off price flucations of people buying drugs?
@_date: 2019-09-24 04:06:08
For I hope so. I bought 4k at 7012. I could use a nice used car.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:46:48
These people hold massive amounts of coin and they aren't investors. They are drug dealing because they want money.  Bitcoin is a means to an end. Meaning they aren't investing meaning when the price drops they are gonna sell the living shit out of it to prevent losses.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:10:47
Gold is in demand because it has always held value thru history of man. Also at any time I can turn that gold into money as people always want gold. 
Bitcoin isn't the same thing. The only demand for Bitcoin is buying drugs . The investors are simply betting on the price going up and down based on what happens on the dark web. Sure the investors drive price but in the end if the dark web dried up today there would be no more Bitcoin and guess what? Gold would ad still would hold value 2000 years from now
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:26:52
Again I don't use drugs . I don't sell drugs. I didn't say drug dealers manipulate prices. I said they sell a shit load of Bitcoin when the price is dropping exasperating the drop. Which just happened until someone bought a shit load of Bitcoin at 8200 and held it. 
Again. If you haven't visited dark web markets go make a trip. Bitcoin has zero value outside the drug trade. If there was no drug trade then Bitcoin would have zero use and zero people buying it to use it thus it would drop.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:15:00
Don't worry crypto is about to educate you.
@_date: 2019-09-16 23:55:06
Ya. I dunno limits, I did other day with 150$ no issues.
