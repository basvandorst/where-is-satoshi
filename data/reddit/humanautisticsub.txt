To the moon baby. Don't forget to tell your friends, neighbors, co workers about this awesome opportunity to buy bitcoin at a great discount. 
Buy and HODLLLLLLLLLLLL
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:13:36
There is only one reason :
Big guys want to buy. Wall street is entering.
Yup. It is obvious that institutional money wants to shake out weak hands. Too bad hodlers are smarter than Wall Street. Facts are on our side, bitcoin is the future.

But why do you need to personally hodl and risk savings for you to benefit from the technology and use it? You didn't need to personally own stocks for [pets.com]( for people to benefit and use the internet.
Hodlers want to profit. That's it. People who buy bitcoin and actually use it as a currency, people who bought pizzas and drugs with it instead of hodling for years did more for the adoption of the technology than hodlers.

So you would be another whale manipulating the price up? One billionaire hoarding tokens != adoption of technology

People 1000x more likely to have access to a smartphone than a crypto atm in those countries. Also you're underestimating how widespread smartphones are even in developing countries

Just bought the dip. I feel sorry for weak hands and low IQ normies missing out on DISCOUNT bitcoin of the future. I am just sitting here laughing at the shakedowns and people who don't understand the power of blockchain. Only the bravest and the smartest innovators will get to the moon, not late adopters. We're visionaries my friends, don't forget.

Exactly. The moon is inevitable, it's only a matter of time. If you don't understand this, you don't understand the revolutionary power of the blockchain.
HODL my brothers. No coiners will beg us for handouts

Yes its not sentiment about how great people think the tech is 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:11:17
When price drops its not because people think bitcoin is technologically terrible. Market sentiment is market sentiment, based on the price of the coin not about how brilliant they think the technology is. It can be and it was at 19k driven up by whales, manipulators and dumb casuals who didnt even understand what bitcoin can do just that they thought the price would go higher. 
Based on the sudden spike up, this appears to be yet another bart incoming but its nice to see the hopes that this is the bull run people are clamoring for
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:50:44
That's a terrible explanation for today's price action. How has the technology changed in the past 24 hours that people are finally realizing now and not a week ago?
The spike that broke 7k isn't organic at all.
