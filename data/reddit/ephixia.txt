Hell yeah, you guys are awesome!  It's been about 3 years since I purchased my rig.  I bought the parts though Newegg but I will definitely be getting the upgrades though Tiger.

There are tutorials on YouTube as well as a written explanation of the different order types on GDAX's website. If you've got discord I'd also be happy to walk you through the basics of using it.

Coinbase is fine for starting out but the fees suck. I would highly recommend GDAX. It's an exchange owned by the same company and your coinbase account is automatically linked with it. You can log-in with the same password and instantly move your coins over to the exchange. 
**Coinbase Fees**
Credit Card - 4%
Bank Transfer - 1.5%
Selling - 1.5%
**GDAX Fees**
Depost &amp; Withdrawl - Free
Buy/Sell Market Orders - .025% for BTC &amp; .03% for ETH/LTC
Buy/Sell Limit Orders - Free
There short youtube tutorials online that will explain the different order types to you and how to use them. GDAX also has a written explanation of that same information on their website. GDAX is also FDIC insured for up to $250,000 if you live in the U.S. so I personally consider it a safer place to hold my coins than a random wallet.

Can't you send the bitcoins you have on MtGox elsewhere like coinbase or bitstamp and then cash out there?
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:59:52
Wow... oh man that hurts.  I'm cringing just looking at those numbers and doing the math.  Did you mine all of that or purchase it?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:56:27
oh ok, interesting.  Do you know why the price varies so much?  There is over a $100 buy price difference depending on where you look.  Mtgox is at $1,080 while bitstamp is at $962 and BTC-e is at $906.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:49:01
Ah ok, thank you very much!

What is coinbase using to set its buy price?  It updates frequently but doesn't seem to follow the market.  I have been using  :  : and  to track the real-time price of bitcoin but coinbase seems to have a huge amount of lag.  Am I looking at incorrect charts or is coinbase getting its information elsewhere.

As someone who is new and doesn't mind buying fractions of a bitcoin they are the same thing right?  As in I don't need to convert my bitcoins to mBTC right now if I think mBTC will be adopted long term instead of BTC?  They are interchangeable right?  It's not like Bitcoin vs Litecoin where they are different crypto-currencies.  The are the same thing, mBTC just displays the amount in a way that allows for two extra zeros?

True, but then again someone went and tipped 2 grand over in earlier today.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:19:44
Ok, thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:07:37
I'm sure you are right, but I'm curious how did you get that number?  What equation do you use for martingale?
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:21:35
I created a thread about this question [here]( and was told coinbase uses bitstamp with a premium added to the price... although nobody has confirmed this is the case yet.
