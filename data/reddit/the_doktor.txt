How will fiat that is most likely still sitting in Gox's Polish bank account and has never reached the exchange (never showed up on the users gox account) for its intended purpose classified?

You're very welcome! The transaction was almost foiled by my data connection dropping, thankfully the free wifi from a shop across the road saved the day!
Here's the [photo]( my girlfriend took of the wondrous moment.
Great to meet you buddy and best of luck in the future.

click the downward arrow in top right of the received email and select "Show Original"

Indeed call the bank. I just did. Unfortunately mine was sent "urgently" so cancelling it was not an option. If you sent it less than 3-5 days ago you could possibly cancel it with no problems. If the money has already left your account then you may not be able to cancel as it only leaves your account on successfully reaching its destination.

Still not clear on whether the commerzbank account is also blocked. Could you confirm this please?

I too would like my SEPA deposit returned that you received yesterday under the username thedoktor. I sent you an email yesterday asking the same to help Please understand that this is not because I don't trust btc24. I have confidence in your ability and the credibility of the site. I would just like my money back in my control. Best of luck getting the site back up and running dude!
EDIT: It was to the commerzbank account.

This this and this! 
Also post in German if it makes communicating with us easier. Plenty of German users on hand to do a solid translation for the btc24 community on your behalf.
