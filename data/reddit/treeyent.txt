You say that, but gold and silver have held value for millennia, and will outlive Bitcoin I can guarantee you that. The safest investment you can make is gold tbh, but it's not necessarily a good money earner.

Property is the best investment anyone can make.

Your proof is just another Reddit post that admits they were wrong. Lol.
You are fake.

How is it a joke? people don't take a risk for no reward.... they charge interest. 
Maybe in your fantasy world where everything is roses and bitcoins people don't charge interest but in reality they do and will.

But in the end they are all just fighting to get the most attention from big daddy USD.

Your reality is unlike 99 percent of America. 5000 for land? LMAO I live in a low cost of living state and that isn't even remotely close to what land costs here.

Nvidia is up over 1000% over the last year and a half. Which is ironically because of crypto but other stocks like apple are way more than 30% returns anyway. These stocks don't have the ups and downs that crypto do.
A bunch of nerds with no investment knowledge this is the problem with crypto.

He didn't say he was smart about his wealth. Just that he uses it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:55:16
Does that really mean much when your the only one that has it and no one wants to buy it?

Not hard to take a calculator and multiply circulating supply by current price and use your brain to figure out that's how they get market cap.
Don't turn off brain yet!
Then you realize that not all coins in circulation have been bought at current market price, because that would be retarded to think that....

I hope you don't think most people that truly invest in natural resources have that shit stored under their bed or something do you?

Litterally everyone in the world will be millionaires! This will save humanity. I can't wait.

They are making far less money from oil. Their oil production is less than half of what is was even 5 years ago. Renewable energy, new exportors of oil (USA), and players in the game(Saudi Arabia) that can afford to artificially lower oil costs to make countries like Venezuela and Russia unable to compete destroyed them. Not to mention it costs Venezuela more resources per barrel to produce oil than Saudi Arabia as well.
It doesn't matter what currency the country uses if it's propped up on a single export and it's not even the best source for that, it's going to fail.

Oh duh I forgot everyone will be rich in the future and with so much wealth they can just open their businesses and pay off everything immediately.

This article doesn't quote any sources on how much energy mining consumes it compares the total power use during winter in USA to a third world country for the entire year. Lets also forget the fact that winter consumes more energy especially in cold areas of the USA. What a shit article.

Yeah it will be great when no one can afford property.

Are you a dumb cheeseburger? Bitcoin does not pay dividends. Bitcoin is not a stock.
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:10:33
Yeah it will be great when my property value plummets.

95% of potential customers
Customer 1: hey I'm hungry where you wanna eat?
Customer 2: oh how about this Italian place?
Customer 1: ah nope, they don't take cards I don't have cash on me.

Why do people think Bitcoin will go back up? What would cause the masses to buy back into Bitcoin and adopt it en-masse? 
Unlike a publicly traded company that will put out good quarterly earnings, a new product, an acquisition, dividends, etc. These things entice investors to buy in and quickly to take advantage of these things.
 Bitcoin doesn't have that, it's just a commodity that has shown it's volatile. There is no "news" that will cause the masses to buy in. Bitcoin has already achieved common recognition then squandered it.
