Wrong. Your magic cards are more like cash. They're reproducible, physical, and I can't send one to the other end of the earth instantaneously. 
@_date: 2019-07-30 16:09:40
Get out.

You forgot step 0: Be incredibly lucky.

This is good for Bitcoin.

Don't use coinbase.

Let the man repost. I got dibs on next ��
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:10:19
Yours is more accurate. Least in my case
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:32:50
Next level.
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:30:05
You're absolutely right. People are so short sighted that they fail to realize what's happening right under their noses! Bitcoin has gone global. It's already being utilized as as means to exchange value (among the other uses for the technology) and already has a community of users that actively support it... That being said, I don't think Bitcoin will replace Fiat currency. That shouldn't be a criteria for success imo. My guess is that we'll use some combination of the two systems, adding a whole new level of complexity to our markets.

I think what he means to say is that getting serviced (Going to the doctor, getting educated, etc) is free, but you'd pay for the subscription to the service (Taxes).
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:25:38
Yeah, buying is still really tough. Especially for newcomers and especially if you'd like to stay anonymous.
@_date: 2019-06-11 01:58:07
Awesome. Didn't know that, thanks for sharing.

"taking advantage of Bitcoin as a payment system"
My point exactly. I really don't care what they do with the btc. The important bit to me is that they see the advantage of using btc in e-commerce. A great example of its disruptive potential.
And as for the price in dollars, I prefer this stays the same. The reason being, as the other commenter pointed out, is that people tend to convert to dollars anyways because that's what they're familiar with.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:14:07
Well, it is legal in my state ��
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:05:55
Over clock?
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:00:00
It's sick with Fiat. Needs to puke it out of its system ��
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:43:14
I was thinking the same. I'd really like some cool looking Bitcoin art to hang in my place.
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:31:39
I don't think FB "Libra" will affect BTC at all. Just add another shitcoin to the list!
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:05:19
Bitcoin is meant to be an incorruptable, secure store of value. Its value doesn't come from profits or assets... It comes from the community (which is growing exponentially)
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:59:50
You tell em, Ricky Bobby!
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:08:28
Yea... Not sure if we'll ever see 5k again. If we do, I'm taking out a second mortgage on my house :D
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:30:46
It's really just making the distinction between the service and the subscription. Yes, you pay for your Netflix subscription, but you can watch their content an unlimited number of times. If you were to purchase each movie/show individually, it would cost you money every time you made the purchase. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:49:37
Wow! You've got 3 whole BTC's? Nice! You should be very proud. Some people (me) don't even have half of one :(
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:19:06
No, I think he means to quote Samuel L. Jackson in saying "Hold on to your butts"
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:05:25
Muchas gracias
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:49:51
Most interesting and most **risky** imo.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:10:28
Sure hope so... I wanna retire already:)
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:38:34
Oh yeah, for a while now.

Uh-oh, he broke out the caps lock. We got a badass over here.

The price of Bitcoin in March of every year starting from 2010 on to 2018.

Crypto was designed with the intention of circumventing bans from any government or authority. That's the point of decentralization. So... I wish them the best, but they ain't banning shit.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:37:00
Supposedly, that's when the new btc gold fork is  gonna happen. HOWEVER, it seems trading has  already begun on some exchanges so it's probably safe to assume that the fork has already happened... If you ask me, all these forks are just ways for folks to make a quick buck off an alternate chain. It seems detrimemtal to Bitcoin as a whole and these ppl should be ashamed.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:34:50
Right there with you brother. Stay strong and HODL!!!
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:44:56
By all means, be as harsh as you like. I'd rather have a harsh truth than a sweet lie... That being said, "young" is really a matter of perspective. With the rate that technology progresses in the current age, a few years can be the equivalent of a lifetime in terms of a product's development/adoption cycle.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:09:50
I also beg to differ, Bitcoin always does really well in times of crisis (Memba Greece?). It's value has always responded positively to news of crisis. Especially when that news involves the collapse of a Government issued currency or banking system.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:28:49
Yes, it will.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:09:11
I wish they did this for the last fork... Would've made a nice profit.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:01:14
Transaction time is like less than a minute for instant buy, quite negligible compared to their alternative "You'll get your coins sometime next week" xD

Uhhh, Monero. Duh.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:29:52
They are. You already have banks like HSBC and Royal Bank of Canada scrambling to build their own blockchains. The issue is that they're still banks! Regardless of how they account for your cash, they're still in control of it. The whole point of crypto is that YOU are in control of your money... meaning your funds can never be "Frozen", "lost", or denied to you for any reason. It's beautiful

The market needs to chill. I haven't bought in yet, dammit!!!

Yeah, it's pretty chill... and boring. LOL

Historically, Bitcoin has done very well during global financial instabilty. Memba Greece's financial collapse?
Edit: Fixed the terminology.

Everybody praises Bitcoin when the price is high, but condemns it when it low.

Wayy wayyy waaayyyyyy up you butt.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:08:11
Uhh, what exactly do you mean by "rigged?" Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure Bitcoin has built in mechanisms via high level cryptography and a global computing infrastructure to prevent any sort of malicious manipulation. The price can be manipulated, but that's a consequence of the free market and it applies to everything. Unlike dollars (which can be printed infinitely and are controlled by a central non-government entity, the federal reserve) Bitcoin has a fixed supply which caps at 21 million, protected by a distributed, global, de-centralized network of miners/coders who, as a community, support it. Tell me again how Bitcoin is just like "Any currency."
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:17:02
I'm curious about this. What effect did the elections have on the price?
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:18:57
What's written on the wall?
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:56:12
You're right, no currency is immune from price manipulation. That we can both agree on :)

Not only is it an acceptable form of payment, it's also one of the PREFERRED forms. If you hover your mouse over the little "i" icon next to the payment type, it says "Paying with Bitcoin receives a small discount over paying with credit card" like so:
