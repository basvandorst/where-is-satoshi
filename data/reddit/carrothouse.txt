How would Brexit happening affect BTC prices? Or a European bank failing, for that matter. I bought a few coins a long time ago to hold onto and the relationship between real world economic events and the value of BTC has gotten far more complex.

I'm kind of worried about greater exposure. For Bitcoin, it's great, darknet markets, not so much. Most people who came of age with the Internet are at least vaguely aware of the darknet and the ability to buy drugs there, but no idea how to use it and no intention of finding out. If this movie done the way I assume it will be and is successful, it could be seen as a romantic, rebellious gesture to do it. Might end up in a bunch of dumbass teenagers with no idea about OPSEC or drug harm reduction bandwagoning.
It works to the extent that it does now because it's a relatively niche community of users who know what they're doing. There are plenty of people right now who are shit at OPSEC and just download Tor and move BTC from wallet to wallet, but if it becomes a fad then you'll see a lot more disreputable vendors sending out bunk shit or dangerous shit, and a lot more dogs and random inspections at post offices. 
That being said, I think the general public being presented with the moral and philosophical implications of this story is more important than the community itself. I feel like Ulbricht and whoever else was involved behind the scenes of SR (and didn't get arrested) would rather there be a mainstream national discussion on the point they were making than they would be in keeping out irresponsible users.
