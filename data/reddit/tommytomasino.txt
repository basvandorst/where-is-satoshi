buy BCH until the transactions clear up, then re-buy btc at the bottom

I also got mine last week and wore it Saturday. Love it.

Just bought one. Thought about stealing it and printing it myself, but that would be bad juju.  Can't wait to get it.

Reading this entire thread has TERRIFIED THE FUCK OUT OF ME.  I just withdrew all crypto to my ledger nano.  I'm going to go rock back and forth in the fetal position now..
Dude... benbenthree, I'm so fucking sorry man. I feel so bad for you.  I can't imagine losing that much money.  I really hope you have the means to replace it within a decent amount of time.  Please don't do anything rash.  If you need to talk about it, PM me.  &lt;3 &lt;3    :(

Not only that, but I think if there's an attack with an EMP, it's going to affect so much shit that most likely the entire network will be in shambles anyways.  Not sure how you would initiate transfers.

Raping kids is also bad

Me, but I check XRP first ;p

Still a huge improvement. Why can't I download this

I did a wire transfer into gdax ($25 outgoing fee from my bank, $10 incoming fee from gdax), took 2 hours, did a limit order to buy bitcoin (zero fee), withdrew the bitcoin to bitfinex (zero fee), bought XRP with bitcoin in a limit order (zero fee again, I think), then withdrew to my ledger nano S (.02 XRP... LOL).
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:07:36
What exchange are you using? Gdax doesn't charge for withdrawals

If anyone can modify the code and execute it on the network, how is it not completely effed up and what's stopping someone from crashing it or corrupting it entirely? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:06:26
why multiple wallets if they're stored in the same place?
what makes you paranoid about a hardware wallet?
I'm 100% not being a dick. I'm *fairly* new to this and they're legitimate questions.

I get the backdoor thing, but with the nano, you can always recover on a new device with your passphrase, albeit - should be stored somewhere safe... LIKE A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX  :)

That's the way I understood it as well, however I've read of horror stories in the past and this is my first experience with a fork like this.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:44:08
Where are they stored? Just do it there

So having btc in my ledger nano s before the split is good and just wait for the results and instructions on how to obtain my 2x coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:41:49
Went all in around 4600ish, bailed at some point and put it all in Ripple XRP.  *waiting*
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:33:39
If I wait for the split and sell everything, do you think I'll have less than the day before the split or more? (do you think btc will drop in value more than the forked coin is worth)?
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:03:38
Who's going to buy my worthless 2x then? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:53:54
Cheaper yes, quicker, absolutely not. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:14:11
I'm in the same boat. I'm tempted to bail before the fork and buy back in when btc is 2/3 today's value rather than worry about selling a shit coin and worry about losing all my btc from "replay". 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:46:38
This makes me want to scour Craigslist and make one

My electricity rate is almost double the average which puts me completely out of it even with a high end mining rig :(

Seems like a lot of work and a lot of monthly fees for a few thousand.  In less than a year she'll have already paid double the price of a Nano S.  Right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:10:19
Convert to XRP, transfer within minutes, then convert back to btc
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:33:13
LOL, guilty. I get frustrated with myself when I'm refreshing 4 or 5 times before there's any new data to present to me!
