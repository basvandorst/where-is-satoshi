Yes these groups exist but is it really discord grouping pumping btc?
Discord groups pump smaller coins like verge
Bitcoin takes some serious bux to pump. millions of usa dollars. Discord groups cant pull that off.

There has to be a reward for early adoption otherwise  othing would ever be invented or created
Early adopters risked real money to buy bitcoin. Even if you put in just 100 usd in 2011 - you were risking real money. And there was real risk. 
My employees work for me because i started my company. I can fire them or pay them more/less. I am the boss. They just work at my company. I was there in the beginning putting my time and money into building something. The world has to reward that or everyone would sleep at home all day.

Because no double spends have happened
Also they would be screwing themselves because they would be damaging bitcoin and they are the ones with millions in mining equipment
Also the miners can opt out if any pool they think may be malicious or “exploitative”, the pools are made up of thousands of individuals

Not in western countries, no
We are still a long way away from the masses understanding fiat inflation. Our inflation in the western world is now so pervasive and thought of as “normal” that a little bit of inflation wont scare americans. 
Nice post tho
Bitcoin, at least for now, can help billions of people most of whom live in africa, asia and south america. Those people live where government/fiat is unstable. The rates of inflation are much higher than 1-4% per year. In venezuela i think they are going for over a millionX inflation just in 2019. That makes holding almost anything better than holding bolivars. Iphones. Ipads. Washing machines. Anything holds value. Bitcoin is gaining traction in those countries and as the world becomes are of bitcoin everyone will be better off. Countries with weak central banks who make poor decisions with their fiat now have to worry about bitcoin as competition. Hopefully the central banks will be kept “honest” because if competition like bitcoin.

Because of gov/tax stuff out of bitcoiners control businesses are not going to want to hold btc. There is no upside for them. There are tons of businesses that accept all kinds of forma of payment that they then instantly turn into whatever currency they do their accounting in. As a small business owner i dont think you understand how little upside there is for a business to hold btc. A wallet would have to be secured. Your employees could rob you unless you learn/train your employees on multisig. Possibly find  new accountant because most would laugh. 
We are bridging the micro transaction gap. Bitcoin is becoming more price stable. Price volitlity is cleary going down over time. Technology will push forward and the price of btc will become more stable over time. 
Btc price seems to keep going up and up -- the volitility is more of a "good problem" than a "real problem" in my opinion

You are right and wrong in my uneducated opinion. There is still some value to having some “cash” saved (under the bed, in a savings account). Americans have really low savings rates and we would be better off if we saved a little more. Obviously saving “every” penny would be bad for the economy
Bitcoin genuinely has motivated me to save more to buy bitcoin. I bought so much bitcoin (relative to my small bankroll/life) that i actually had to start buying US stocks. I couldnt like my investment portfolio be more than fifty percent bitcoin

You write holders dump like that is a real thing. Holders dump everyday. Early adopters have now had 7-9 years to dump their bitcoins.  Very few people are now long term holders from back in the one dollar days. All those people have been taking profit along the way. No super intelligent person has 100 million in bitcoin and 10 grand in fiat and isnt motivated to find a way to improve those ratios/diversify.

Minor or major country transitions to bitcoin and goves up on its own currency. Only possible if layer two solutions like lightning improve. Ecuador gave up on their currency and uses the us dollar. If a country’s population becomes tired of the constant swings/devaluations/mismanagement of their currenxy then maybe they will do what ecuador did but instead of the dollar they pick bitcoin. Just a thought

Long term yes but i can see it screwing some countries over who dont have control of their monetary policy. Long term if a country was making it work- having the value of their currency be controlled by the free market as opposed to manipulated behind closed doors would be a long term good. That currency would seem more safe than others.

Hola amigo
Soy benji de texas
Yo creo k los venezolanos estan mostrando al mundo que bitcoin es un “store of value” importante para la gente normal
Aqui en texas en las noticias siempre dicen que en tu pais no hay comida. Que hagan la gente en tu fam cuando ellos quien una hamberguesa o algo barato. Si es facil encontrar una hamberguesa? Como por ejemplo compras algo que vale 3 dolares. Usas una tarjeta? O como es?

200 years ago was it bad that gold had a lot of value? Was it a black hole damaging the world?
Bitcoin can suck in value that would have otherwise been elsewhere but that doesnt mean that humanity wont end up with more value overall.

You want to accrue your own bitcoin, not accrue it while letting a third party hold it
No reason to let a third party be involved. That is one of the best parts if bitcoin. You are your own swiss bank. :)
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:34:14
Politicians are old, uninquisitive and ignorant
They just dont know anything about btc
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:47:17
If you use your own wallet you can set your own fee
Higher fees move more quickly because they are much more likely to go into the upcoming blocks
Supply and demand
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:13:16
Instead of buying online you could meet someone in person
Over time maybe they give you real good deals once you build trust
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:08:45
I would just give them a paper envelope with a paper wallet and tell them it is a little bitcoin amd to keep it safe. If that amount ever does become a lot of fiat money then you pet them know to create a safety plan/backups.

All the altcoin bagholders including bcash and sv are scared to death that lightning will put them out of business
It will be harder for newbies to be distracted by alts if the bitcoin network is fast and reliable. Last bull market the base layer was being intentionally spammed and lightning didnt exist. One of these upcoming bull markets will genuinely be able to handle all the demand for bitcoin. When people see how amazing the lightning network is a lot of the use cases for alt projects will vanish

Bitcoin doesnt change my life because i am in america
But for the people in countries without safe/sound money bitcoin will become incredibly useful as a store of value

I didnt know all my crypto was gone until months later
I tried to log into crypty but the whole website was gone
I was ignoring crypto for a while and had lost like 40 bitcoins gambling on seals with clubs poker website. One of my biggest life regrets was losing those bitcoins, buying more, losing them the same way, leaving the rest of my leftover alts and btc on cryptsy and ignoring the crypto sphere. Maybe if i would have been paying attention i could have saved my alt coins.i have no idea what my left over crypto would have been worth now but imagine i would be set for life. Cryptsy guy took all that from me :(
So you say people are idiots for keeping their money on exchanges (“scams”) and yes true but back in 2013 a lot of these shitcoins didnt even have functioning wallets that were easy to download. It was a diferent time. Live and learn
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:49:18
It sounds hard to keep your bank full of money if you have to use your credit card constantly and prices are increasing. Do you live in a big city or a small city? Do you have super cheap electricity to do crypto minimg?
I have been to bogota and medellin but never venezuela

This is sad but very true for a large majority of those involved
Speculators are still the majority of bitcoiners. And the worst kind of speculators. Short term speculators

The way you have it worded - there is no chance bitcoin goes to zero

I listen to this guy but sometimes he seems like such an old hack.

Bro you have to be 100x more patient. Dont hold for months or worry about 50% drops.
Hold for years and ignore the drops. Come back in 2020 after the halving and i bet you are in the profit
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:56:09

Buy 100 dollars in btc and learn to move it/store it. Become a trezor expert. If the trezor intimidates you then dont put big money into bitcoinS 
Begin cost dollar averaging 10k/day or even better 10k/week or something like that
Put all your coins on the trezor and write down your seed. Keep seed in sep location and trezor at your home. Forget about the bitcoin for a few years. Profit hopefully, 
As for buying the bitcoin i dont know who/how to reccommend for buying that quantity
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:06:57

In a lot of ways your age in 2011-2013 played a huge role. If you were 17 it was hard to even have 100 to spend on crypto 
I was maybe 26 but still too broke and irresponsible to keep my btc. I gambled away many btc when they were 40-50 bucks each or so
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:23:56
Make your own home pc wallet and send the btc to yourself

If you buy btc and hold long term you will gain. No reason to do it with other people. Avoid other people being involved in your bitcoin. 
If you try to mine you will be throwing your money away.

If you go at 11, 1 or 3 they'll tell you
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:56:36
You should either learn to do it yourself or burn your money because you'll lose it all doing stuff like this
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:01:06
My rule is like 200-300 usd worth. Exchange cant hold long term more than that. Short term 1week is much more

After watching the price go from 32 bux to like 2 bux this really doesnt seem like much at all. Give it a few years and the “swings” wont phase you. Bitcoin is a game of years and not months

Bitcoin wallets will become more simple in the future and banks will offer bitcoin related services to alleviate the fears of luddites.

I did some dca avg on bitcoin for like 8 months. It has been a while since i did it. Best decision ever. I used coinbase auto buy weekly. I was putting in small amounts but it took all the stress out if buying
And when the bitcoin price drops you have a silver lining. Your next buy will yield more coin

@_date: 2019-09-26 23:33:58
You open wasabi wallet on your comp and make a free wallet
Give your receive address to poker site
Then you have the bitcoin on your comp once they send it
Now you can sell your bitcoin at localbitcoins or coinbase . Where you sell depends on quantity and country
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:48:21
Your plan is fine if that is what you prefer
Totally reasonable
You may want to pick a percentage of your portfolio that you wsmt stocks to be and keep rebalancing. For example, 85% stocks, 15% bitcoin. And every timenthe bitcoin hits those numbers you mentioned like 49k- you rebalance

It is fascinating that volume really does move price 
This is how a free market currency should operate- and it is... these are all good signs imo. 
It means bitcoin isnt being manipulative and isnt purely speculative. Demand drives price and not the other way around.

Interesting question but i dont see how our current system addresses this issue any better
I support basic anti trust laws in business. Anti trust laws dont prevent someone from amassing too much money.

Trying to time the market by constantly buying/selling is almost impossible. This is true of btc, other cryptos, stocks and many other things. If your plan is to try to time the market just ask yourself where your news comes from. Everything the avg person reads/hears is being produced by a journalist and/or just an opinion. There are a ton of people out there that actually know about bitcoin. If you are one then good luck. If you are just a casual user who doesnt have a history with cryptos and some skill in math/coding then you are going to consistantly be hours or days behind in terms of knowledge. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:50:35

Now that those people have quit doing it the mempool clears up much more quickly. I don't know that those people were necessarily direclty afficilated with bcash but they could have been.

Ok in this example coinbase is the seller. The choose what rate they sell at based off of what happens on their platform and other exchanges. Supply and demand. If coinbase has to go to otc or other means to buy more btc to supply the 10000 btc then the price would def be going up. As the supply of bitcoin up for sale is reduced then the peolle buying the btc will be paying more
In reality of course 10k bitcoin is a huge amount of money and this example makes way more sense with a smaller number. 
Anyone buying 10k btc better be doing it “otc” over the counter or they will end up screwing themselves

@_date: 2019-05-22 02:40:19
This is all true
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:43:22
Currently yes a satoshi cant be divided. but if the network agrees as many zeroes as cna be added as needed. 
And why would anyone have a problem with that?
With bitcoin even minor things can be contentious and then no agreement is possible. But not with this issue. So losing all bitcoin ever cant really happen.

Look at the log scale and think long term
Focus on 10 year timelines
We have had many drops that are 70-85%. The buyers got rich and the sellers got nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:59:02
In less than 10 years the dollar has lost over 99% of its value when compared to btc
But somehow because btc has fluctuations it is a trash currency. Ill keep investing in btc and these dumbos can enjoy their fiat
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:34:36

The two do not always go hand in hand
Occasionally governments/leaders/countries live within their means and are prepared when war comes or perhaps they are the aggressors. 
When spain was stealing boatloads of gold from the americas they didnt have to debase their currency to pay for their armadas. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:00:15
When you see the price online you are prob seeing an average of the lrice of bitcoin across multiple exchanges

@_date: 2017-06-03 12:39:48
Long term no one has any idea about where btc will be. 
My opinion- I think it could reach 4-10k in the next 6-18 months. 
My opinion- Overall the market cap for all of these coins is in the tens of billions now, almost 100b if you include ripple and a bunch of other shitcoins. I see the overall market cap continuing to go up to 200b by the end of this year.

He is on the world crypto network all the time. You can find them on google. They have simple podcast style talk shows about UI, austrian economics and monetary policies

Expect to buy the next dip because it will take a while to get an acc set up with that type of purchasing power that wont get flagged. It would be much smarter to start small even if you are only doing it to not get your account flagged by whatever exchange you end up using. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:46:12
Ya u would be a millionaire if that happened but that is just a pipe dream bro. Quit trollin

This number is unknown and debated
I have seen ppl say as little as 6 million in circulation
It is  futile convo anyway because what really is an out of circulation coin? At any time a 3-5+ year holder can spend their btc with ease. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:45:31
Why would a flood of new people mean a drop in price
Your argument is purely emotional
Why do new people need to get punished or feel pain? 
Are you a catholic? 
If people are flooding in as you say and bitcoins are scarce then the price will go up.

It sucks but if you are buying 100 usd per month you may have to send them to yourself for dafe keeping every 3-4 purchases
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:20:41
It is infinitely divisible
This is not a problem
One satoshi can be split into a quadrillion if we so choose/agree
Value holders lose nothing if more zeroes are added to their currency so it wont be contentious

Yea but is she sending you 14 bux or sending you a screenshot of some account

He just falsified everyones account to shownthey were making tons of money
But that money didnt exist
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:22:14
Could be
Just my guess
The UI for bitcoin/crypto in general is terrible
But we improve every year

Sounds sketchy but if you have no other options break the 20 btc into groups. 2,6,12=20
Sell two
Then sell six to the same guy if it all works out
Them sel 12 to the same guy if it all works out

Just put your own personal wallet on your comp or phone and semd your btc to yourself. This is less safe than cold storage but much more safe than having the exchanges hold your btc.

I agree
Sure if you life in nyc your life wont change if you turn 200 bucks into 20000 but in a lot of other places that is a lifechanging amount and people are taking a real risk
