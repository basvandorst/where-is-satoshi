This is what I get when I long press, looks like a broken window? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:47:39
It's all good! As long as you're aware =)

The app looks great so far. My only question is how do I put my old holdings I've bought and sold? For example, I'm trying to put in some ltc I bought a while back and sold later. It doesn't let me edit the sold price.

Interesting analysis on Verge - During the sell off period the volume has been about a third of what it usually is. Right now we're inching back to that magic $1 billion volume count. Just a few more hours til it's 3pm in Asia and that's when I anticipate a small rally up based on what you said.
Too bad my bitstamp verification is taking a while to process and I can't sign up for Bittrex. What site/client are you using which gives you all the indicators below the chart? I feel so blind not having a client like Thinkorswim with its indicators for these ecoins.

As far as I understand, Japan made it a legal currency and that started the upward trend as more and more countries did too and interest went up.

I'd love to join in the bitcoin community. I remember downloading the client about 5-6 years ago, but didn't configure it right, so I never got to mine any. I look back on that day with much regret today =p

After watching this happen everytime before the futures expiration, I finally bought the dip. FeelsGoodMan
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:22:24
Yep because the price has basically doubled. In a way, you can just think of bitcoin as a stock if it makes it easier to understand. If you buy .5 bitcoin at $10k and it goes up to $11k and you want to sell, overall your investment went up 10%. So your .5 bitcoin worth $5000 would be worth $5500. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:57:47
Yeah not really funny in the grand scheme of things, but I'm trying to spend less time regretting not buying over the past few months thinking *it can't go any higher than this* and instead embracing the fact that I have some bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:54:28
I saw $9995 and knew it was coming. I saw the coinbase alert for $10k and I jumped out of my seat. Congratulations everyone. We made it.

You can buy any amount, even .0001. The most user friendly platform out there is coinbase.com. There you can use your credit, debit, or bank account and buy and sell bitcoins and other ecoins like ethereum and litecoin for a small transaction fee.
Most of us here use it since it allows us to get coins safely and it's a reputable company. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:15:44
No man it's not a stupid question :) Afraid of a bubble? Yeah for sure, but that just means another opportunity for us to buy the dip. Now that the big banks are in this too, they'll use this unregulated market to make huge gains - The banks have more than enough money to spike the price up or down whichever way they choose. Also as more and more companies accept bitcoin as a legitimate currency and people find out about it, the price will go up too since there's a limited amount of bitcoin to go around.
No one knows what happens next. It could rally to $12k; it could drop to $5k. All I know is that history was made tonight and I'm happy to be a part of it, even if I hesitated for months and just recently bought in.

I wish I had just bit the $1xx fees and instantly bough enough to finally have 1 entire bitcoin. Instead I waited a week for the money to transfer into gdax and in that time the price went up $3k haha.

Email from August 3rd :
Dear Coinbase customer, 
We wanted to give our customers an update on the recent Bitcoin hard fork. You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here:
Forks enable innovation and improvements to digital currency and we believe that we will see an increasing number of forks in the future. We expect this to be a vibrant and innovative community.
When a digital currency forks, it creates a new digital asset. Adding new digital assets to Coinbase must be approached with caution. Not every asset is immediately safe to add to Coinbase from a technical stability, security, or compliance point of view. 
Our top priority is the safety of customer funds and we spend extensive time designing, building, testing and auditing our systems to ensure that the digital asset we support remains safe and secure. We may not always be first in adding an asset, but if we do, you can be sure that we’ve invested significant time and care into supporting it securely. We believe this is the best approach for us to maintain customer trust.
In the case of bitcoin cash, we made clear to our customers that we did not feel we could safely support it on the day it was launched. For customers who wanted immediate access to their bitcoin cash, we advised them to withdraw their bitcoin from the Coinbase platform. However, there are several points we want to make clear for our customers:
Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash remain safely stored on Coinbase.
Customers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase.
We operate by the general principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events.
Over the last several days, we’ve examined all of the relevant issues and have decided to work on adding support for bitcoin cash for Coinbase customers. We made this decision based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes, and regulatory considerations.
We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.
Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We'll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support. In the meantime, customer bitcoin cash will remain safely stored on Coinbase.
Thank you,
Coinbase Team

Doing alright man, how about you? Regretted not mining back in the day, and regretted not buying 2 btc back when it was below $3k. The max coin base let me buy while waiting for my bank was $500 worth which I did around $4500. Sure I'm down a bit, but I'm not worried. I'll hop in at some point and buy 1 btc at a nice discount =)

Right now I just have a very small amount on coinbase and these hardware wallets are a bit pricey until I commit to bitcoin. Are there any downsides to storing it on my local computer(other than the data loss)?
So do people just use these exchange sites like coinbase to buy the btc and then instantly transfer it out of there to a personal wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:53:40
Oh right I understand, just like the last fork/split and when coin base said they'll give you both coins except that they didn't. So should I transfer my btc to my local wallet on my pc? Where do you recommend I keep it? And thank you for the answers. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:51:30
How would I get an equal value of bch based on my btc if it's in a private wallet? How does that system work? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:00:16
That's what I'm trying to figure out too. If I find out I'll let you know. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:21:27
I've got a ton of doge coin that I've kept safe for years so far (though not worth much lol). I don't trade often so you're right, I should transfer to a private wallet.
If it's in a private wallet, how would I stand to take advantage of the split? And thank you for the answers! 
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:27:37
Noob here with a bit invested in coin base. What do they have to do with this news? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:10:16
When hardware wallets are 10-20% of your current investment, you want to make sure whether a pc based wallet is adequate. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:59:20
They initially did have plans to support it. Then the closer the date got, the more things fell apart if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:23:08
The reviews are pretty bad for Android in the play store... I'm a hit worried to use them now. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:58:34
I use electrum. I'll transfer my coins to there then, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:32:51
Okay gotcha. So if I do make a big purchase of btc, it's best to transfer it out otherwise keep small amounts on the online exchange. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:31:29
Hmm I'll check it out, thanks =)
