If you had 1 Bitcoin, you have 1.00000000 Bitcoin, which is also 100,000,000 "satoshis" (0.00000001 is a satoshi).
If BTC is at $11k and you wanted to pay someone $10 worth, you'd send them 10/11000 or ~0.0009 BTC, which is the same as 90,000 satoshis.

Necessarily it would be an attempt to raise awareness and get the price to go up, since even Trump knows if he says one thing, the media is going to point out all the reasons why he's wrong, and everyone who dislikes him is going to start saying, "Trump is a moron Bitcoin is really good."

How the real world works, is you go to work and make $100 today. Then, the bank prints $6 to use on whatever it wants, usually giving ~$4 of those dollars to your neighbor who just took out a loan to buy his house.
Every time you make $1000, the banks print $60. So on and so forth, making your money worth less and less over time.
Over time, your money becomes devalued, and banks and people taking out loans profited on your hard work.
How does it feel being absolutely useful?

A few ways, one being just sitting in the middle of the traffic, like an ISP. Either by compromising the ISP to monitor traffic, or paying off one of their techs to pass you information. Or, if I can gain access into the network of the target, I can monitor traffic and determine which watchtower(s) they are talking to.
Or, I could go the organized crime route and run a watchtower business, from multiple locations, where I surround this business (so to speak) with watchtowers so they only deal with me. So 100% of their channels are watched by my towers. Then I have control over if I want to broadcast the justice state or not. In other words, you could be a corrupt watchtower.


We'd know that by watching internet traffic, or by owning all the watchtowers. After all if I own all 50 watchtowers in the area, you're probably being watched by one of mine (since, I run each watchtower from a different location to make it seem distributed, when it's not) and then I can compromise transactions by colluding with either party.

That's a good read.
I think you do a disservice by not pointing out that many of the bubbles you discuss are largely caused by the failed monetary policy created by banks and central banks. You're presenting the bubbles like they just 'randomly happen' where in fact they are heavily supported by the failed monetary policy of central banks. When the banks lose control is when the bubble becomes a bubble and pops.
Bubbles also hinge on the assets becoming worthless or relatively worthless soon after the 'pop'. I don't see this as an outcome for Bitcoin. It's not like a dot-com company which is actually relatively worthless only having value in that its name includes "dot-com". Bitcoin has never had a bubble. A bubble would be some altcoin that rose to $30 and then dropped to $0.0003 afterwards. A bubble would be a house sold for $1 million ending up being only worth $100k the next year. The volatility almost proves the lack of there being a bubble.

I think the biggest impediment is the wallet. People are very used to having a bank control their funds. With Bitcoin you don't need a bank but you do need to secure your wallet, and a lot of people don't want to go through that hassle. So they will use custodial wallets, basically making a bunch of banks. Not much change in how people operate.
People just want to get paid, put their money in their bank, and then be able to spend it. When you put the responsibility on them to be their own bank, to get paid in Bitcoin directly to their wallet, and then be able to spend it directly, the bank isn't in the picture but they're not used to that. They're not used to being responsible. They don't want to handle security. They don't want to have to worry about theft and loss.
That is a big issue I see needing to be overcome for greater adoption.

A side note for anyone who likes to think about things: all companies were at one point just an idea and some initial money someone used to start their first product/service with that company. I think if we could find out what the initial investment Jeff Bezos put into Amazon to get it delivering its first order, we'd have a similar astronomical growth figure.
The cool part about Bitcoin is we could see the value growth since inception, unlike Amazon which we only got to see the value growth since IPO.

You're saying the value of the world based on Bitcoin alone at that point will be worth $10,500,000,000,000,000 or Ten-Thousand-Trillion dollars in human work value in 2030? This doesn't include direct trade or barter.
If today there is ~$210 trillion in human work value in the world economy, we need 50x more people to achieve that work effort value of 10000-trillion, and everyone to also accept Bitcoin in 10 years.
So you're basically saying we will have 400 billion people on Earth in 10 years.
No. However, Bitcoin COULD be worth ~$500 million per coin when there are ~400 billion people on Earth. This is estimated to take around 400-500 years at a population growth rate of 1% compounding. So, extend your chart out a little bit and then let's see where it will be in our timeframe.

You're basically doing what all the central banks have capitalized on this whole time. You're saying, "Surely the banks won't just print money out of thin air! That's ludicrous!"
Feels bad to see it here.
Indeed, if I'm Tether, and I have deposits, I can loan against those deposits, can I not?
Here we go with that central banking!
I have money, and someone says, "I want $50 million Tether on loan."
Sure! Here's your Tether on loan!
That someone goes and buys $50 million worth of BTC, driving up the price.
This is where you are, saying, "Obviously the creation of $50 million new Tether is going to drive BTC price up, it's natural."
What did that transaction take?
Simply for 'someone' to take a loan out against Tether. Did Tether reserves go up? Sure. They are owed $50 million, right? You don't see their bank accounts (and we'll get to why that doesn't even matter in a moment) so they can just tack on debt as reserves. They are after all owed the $50 million. The promise of repayment created the reserves, and the resulting tokens.
So the reserves still match the amount of Tether out there. The con is working. The 'someone' now has $50 million worth of BTC, and they "owe" Tether some money.
This someone can just be a central bank themselves. They just create $50 million fiat and hand it over to Tether should Tether need to collect on the loan.
Now, this is unlikely (the part where the central bank actually pays back the loan) because that's not the point. The point is to laden Tether which so much debt-as-money so that when it fails, anyone holding Tether is left in the dust, and the fiat money supply is not impacted. If or when Tether fails, people will be running to Tether to cash out their Tether to USD. Except Tether is shut down and not accepting any transactions at this point. You have millions of people trying to cash in their tokens against a system that was designed to destroy them.
This is much more beneficial than a central bank printing money to disrupt Bitcoin, because if a central bank prints money, eventually the people come running to the bank to collect. In this way, Tether being some Hong Kong based bank, people will be running to this "crypto-bank" for their money. And when it fails, there's no net impact on the value of the fiat money. No inflation occurred, no bank's reputation was hurt, because it was internal to the Tether "bank". It is the creation of a bank with the intentional to make it fail, with no one on the line except crypto-users.
This is how fractional reserve banking works. Sure, if you sold some Bitcoin, you could exchange it into Tether, and withdraw your funds even. You'd see no issue with Tether, it's working normally for you. The banks figured out a long time ago that you only need ~10% reserves to account for all the normal fluctuation that goes on when people finally want to withdraw. Most people leave their money in the bank. So to any normal person, the system works. It is only when there are enough people holding and trusting in Tether that they will bring it down, wiping out everyone who thought their Tether could actually be redeemed for $1 USD. And again - the motive for this, is so that people don't come running to the bank demanding payment. The run-on-the-bank is a run on some Hong Kong company called Tether that no one knows about. Just some crypto-startup. You should have known better, right? Net inflation, zero. Net effect on the rest of the economy, zero. Crypto-investors? Destroyed.
Now, you can continue to hold your position, "Surely they would not do such a thing, no one would just print money out of thin air." That's up to you, to trust that Tether is 100% making sure they are holding actual reserves in actual ratios to USD.
Which, finally, does not even matter. Because central banks can influence this exact system from the outside. They can create money out of thin air to deposit into Tether in a true ratio-fashion. Tether thinks they're operating 1:1. Eventually when the central banks want to pull the plug, they just declare that Tether is an illegitimate business and must be shut down and anyone dealing with them is a criminal. The same result: no one gets their Tether holdings. Local fiat is not impacted at all. The run-on-the-bank as everyone demands Tether pay them yields no actual money, because Tether can't give them money. Tether is frozen from sending any money, and the entire thing disappears along with all the 'deposits' it held its digital bank accounts. Wiped clean, company shut down, and all the people holding Tether, those crypto-investors, destroyed.
Trust. That's what you get with trust.
"Surely, Tether wouldn't do such a thing?" They have no choice.
That's why any exchange using Tether is compromised. Any token that can be created out of thin air is compromised.

The more you learn about Bitcoin the better that feeling becomes.
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:40:10
Ouch man.
Say you have 100% of the tokens.
You have 100 tokens, and hold 100%. Say someone is willing to pay you $10 for 1 token. So you sell 10 tokens to that person for $100. The next person comes along and says they'll buy 10 for $9, because it looks like you're just selling made-up tokens. Ok you sell, because well, you have a lot of tokens and you want that sweet fiat cash.
The last batch of 10 tokens you sell for $1 each, because the last guy sees you just made ($100 + $90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 50 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = $550) $550 for nothing.
Ah ha, you made the market go down to $1! Hell. Yes. Now you can buy back all your tokens since the price is so low - only $1 per token, you can get all the tokens back for cheap!
You go to the first guy and try to buy back your $1 tokens. Except... he just paid $1 - the buyer is holding because he thinks he can sell it to the guy who paid $2 per. If he's an idiot, he would sell them to you at $1 or less. But he wants 10% back, so he says he'll sell them back to you for a little more, say $1.10 each. You think "OK well I'll make that up on the next guy," so you pay the $11 to this guy for his 10 tokens.
You go to the next tier and so on, and each time the person holding just saw you pay 10% more to the guy before him, and so they want their 10% too.
You end up paying ( 11 + 22 + 33 + 44 + 55 + 66 + 77 + 88 + 99 + 110 = $605) $605 to get all your tokens back. Tokens YOU created! You now have 100% of the tokens, 100 tokens, and they're worth $605 now! Your market cap is 10% bigger! Wow! Except you just lost $55 to all the people who you just bought from and you're holding a bag of nothing.
Now, at scale, this is what happens to every "whale" out there unless there's more dumb people willing to a) pay more for the tokens and b) sell less for the tokens. So Bitcoin has a lot of people who don't know what they're worth coming in and buying and selling, so the whale is making a good profit, constantly selling 100 tokens, watching a bunch of scared people sell right after him, and then he is buying up tokens and coming out ahead of the above scenario.
The lesson is if you do not HOLD the thing you buy, you're feeding the whale. When you buy something, you're buying because you expect the value to rise, not fall, by definition. You wouldn't buy an ounce of gold today, if you were certain tomorrow it would be worth 50% less. You'd wait until the next day to buy. You'll buy when you think it's going to be worth more the next day.
So the only way whales do anything is because people sell with them. Each time, the people selling with the whales do not buy back faster than the whales, and the person who sold with the whale is the person owning the opportunity cost lost with the whale movement. They're stuck holding onto this fiat cash.
This is a natural system though, so don't worry about it too much. If you pay attention, sometimes you will see a whale get scooped up by another whale - they're competing with each other, keep that in mind. Those are good times. You can see it in the market. Someone tries to dump and the other whale knows something is up and scoops it all up and the price goes up. There are whale hunters out there.
In the end the market works. Over time, eventually the whale makes a sell dump and gets swallowed by someone bigger. It's just a matter of time, and they can take their profits, and maybe buy back in at the higher level, but the end result is the same - the distribution of Bitcoin is now in the hands of more people. That's the game, and one whales and traders are necessary to accomplish. So enjoy it. Strap in and learn as much as you can about it, if you think it's worth learning about.
Back to the 100 tokens thing: Say you don't buy back. You got $550 for nothing, for creating tokens, right? I mean, you did. You sold them all and you got 10 people to hand you money. You're up! You did it!
Except now those 10 people are trading amongst themselves. They get more people involved, who begin to value the tokens more too. Now a token is selling for $8 each, and then $10 each, and now $20 each. The hell! If you saved your tokens from the beginning, you would have $2000! But in reality, you needed to lose your tokens to spread out the distribution and allow the price to rise in the first place. You had to take your profit. The guy who bought for $1 waited until the price was $20, and now he sold for a $190 profit. He's happy with his profit. So on and so forth this continues.
Only a very small amount of the buyers ever do the smart thing. The guy who bought at $2? He's the smart guy. He's holding on to those tokens because he sees no one can ever make more of them, or forge them, or print them, or compromise his holding of the tokens. He sees the long term value is more than $20. He thinks the value will reach $20,000 before he really feels like selling his 10 tokens. So he waits, 10 whole years, until he can sell his 10 tokens for $200,000 and lives his life, taking his profit. At this point, whales have died, traders have come and busted out, and he got to live his life and take his profit. Profit which, when he looks back 10 years after he sold and he sees the price is now $50,000 per token, he thinks... "Maybe I should have hodled?"

Someone can hack your PayPal if they know your password (or guess it) and if you don't have two-factor authentication on (which would text your phone with a pin or require an authentication pin to allow access).
So without TFA, your password is the only thing between you and your funds.
Assuming you have a 10 character password using only lowercase letters (and the person brute forcing your password knew it), it would take, at most: 183579396 guesses to crack it.
If you use uppercase and lowercase, numbers 1 through 0, and allow 10 'symbols' in your passwords, it would take: 42420747482776576 guesses at most to crack your password.
If you use Bitcoin, it would take more guesses than atoms in the universe to crack your private key. But cracking a password which secures your Bitcoin (like in a password protected file) would be just as difficult as the above passwords.

Necessarily in order to promote more social programs, government needs more power, not less. As such, Bitcoin stripping government of power is "anti-liberal" and anti-socialist and anti-communist in nature. It's also anti-republican and anti-big government of any form.
The government needs more power to take money away from the people in order to facilitate taking more money from the people by force in order to facilitate providing more social programs. Bitcoin is digital gold, and conservatives love gold, because it removes government power. Conservatives also don't like change, so they're a hard sell, but if sold, can become very strong proponents. They could also dislike Bitcoin for the same reasons, because other institutions like the military and police necessarily lose power too.
Both sides want the government to have more power for their own ends. Bitcoin denies both liberal and conservative sides the ability to steal that power - instead they will have to earn it. This is good for society.

That's what fungible means. The reason it's even a word is to decide if something is basically the same thing in terms of trade. If you place an order for 100 bushels of yellow corn, you can't then tell the guy who shows up with 100 bushels of yellow corn that you won't buy his product because he didn't get you 100 bushels of corn *from Wisconsin*. In other words, you can't just cancel your order based on how you feel about where it came from. 100 bushels of yellow corn, is 100 bushels of yellow corn. It's fungible so the world can continue to operate without people who made bad deals adding artificial requirements when the order comes due. It's more a legal term than anything else, and some people mistakenly think it is an inherent property of something, which it is not. There could be massive, individually-considered differences between two bushels of corn, but for the sake of trade and economy and legal dealings, they're the exact same thing, and if you placed an order, you pay when someone delivers it.

How much digital debt exists, though?
Inflation is likely upwards of 6%, maybe more, considering the multi-facted hit on money - going with a pure money supply inflation model does not take into effect that such inflation percentage is in addition to huge gains in efficiency and cost reductions performed by every single market. In other words, even though a business might have become 100% more efficient in production, there's still a positive inflation value in terms of what your dollar can buy. This means the reported inflation value of 'money supply' is likely just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to inflation. There's also the factor of subsidies, cheap undervalued labor and other cost-cutting measures taken, and yet the inflation value still rises.
Fuel cost is a good indicator because the volume is so high it's really hard to lie. In 20 years we've seen roughly a 3x cost increase (higher than that in many markets) - and this is in spite of heavy subsidies, war, forced trade deals, increased taxation and all sorts of attempts at manipulating the cost to keep it as low as possible.

Your chart shows a rise in 'negative yielding debt' so who is holding this debt? Banks?
So they then have to charge you the regular customer to hold your money. No longer do you get a 0.1% interest rate on your checking account. Maybe you still get that, but they're forced to charge more 'annual fees' to cover their expenses.
Basically who is paying who - it seems like banks are just going to smoke-and-mirror the average Joe who uses the bank, and the banks have to pay the Fed more money, I'm assuming, for making loans. But again, still not getting it just yet. Will look it up thanks.

Coinbase Pro is super simple to use, they don't accept Tether, they're not doing the "bet on Bitcoin's price" game, and from what I can tell they hold all Bitcoin in relation to transaction amounts and generate keys for all your accounts giving you a lot of peace-of-mind security. 
 is trash
Binance supports and even promotes Tether, which is a huge vulnerability for an exchange to accept a 'stablecoin' or any asset that can be printed from nothing from a third party company.

I'm not sure the details on how often there is communication or if there is any. If there was any communication it can be intercepted.

You never bought $40 of BTC. You never owned a thing. You bet on price.
You can do the exact same things on an exchange and actually send your BTC somewhere.
I cannot run an exchange. I do not have the funds, the servers, the datacenters, the internet connections to run it. I do not have the people to run it. I do not have the code base to handle transactions. I do not have incoming and outgoing accounts established which generate dynamic BTC addresses. I do not have the ability to send and receive wire transfers to thousands of people.
But I can at any moment let you give me money and I say, "Ok you now have Bitcoin."
I can do that with an excel spreadsheet. I can program that in a day into an app. I can easily receive money from people.
"You own 0.10483390 Bitcoin."
That's all I have to do to get your money.
If I get 100 people to do this, since only 10% of people ever really withdraw their money, if the price rises, I just pay off those who sell with the money others put in. But Bitcoin incentivizes you to not sell, so most people will sit there and wait.
It requires nothing from me to do this. I don't need any infrastructure and can do this without touching a single Bitcoin, without accessing Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin or helping Bitcoin. I'm just letting you give me money and I simply say, "Yeah, you have that worth of Bitcoin with me on my accounts."
The great part is the people who buy high are kind of stuck leaving their money with me, or they sell low and I simply make profit. If they send me $13k, and the price drops to $12k - I had no stake in Bitcoin, so nothing was lost on my end - which means I just send them $12k of their initial $13k when they sell low. I literally make $1000 from sitting there doing nothing when people cut their losses. No investment into Bitcoin. No requirement for Bitcoin to succeed or fail to maintain my business. No need to deal with private keys or nodes or anything, just an entry in a database.
"No fees though!" Yeah because you never own anything, never buy anything, and the people "selling their bet at a loss" more than makes up for the difficulty it takes to write an entry into my database.
If anyone wants to bet on BTC price I will happily take those bets, same as Robinhood. Everyone would be happy to take those bets. As an LLC, if you ever don't have the funds to pay off a bunch of people who are selling - also known as a run on the bank - just close business. Not really a big deal if you've made enough profit off of people in the meantime. And if there's a big price fluctuation and people try to sell right away, rushing to sell, "We have some service delays." A few minutes of "delaying" someone in selling might save me thousands of dollars. And I can program this in to the database where if there's high sell activity, just "delay" for a bit. Again, every minute I delay saves me money.
It's complete garbage, but "so easy" that it is a good way to con people into it without them thinking twice. People are ripe for being conned, as you were, and you even think it was a good thing you got scammed.
I'll let you rent my rental car, but you can't drive it, ok? When you bring it back and "return it" (even though it just sits in my lot), I'll give you your money back minus depreciation.
You can buy this food, just not eat it. Sell it when you don't need it anymore, I'll buy it back, even though you never owned it, at its depreciated value.
Here, you can buy my $1000 cash. No, you don't get to have the cash, you just send me $1000 cash and I say, "You have $1000 cash." Now, if cash rises in price, you can sell your $1000 cash back to me, but if my internal controlled system says that cash is now worth $900, well then I'll just give you $900 when you want it back.
Just complete garbage.

Just do it. The main issue with mining is power consumption. Keep in mind the miners need to be running 24/7 to really be worth it. You'll need to connect to a mining pool. Set up your own wallet. And know what you're doing with computers to get it all running. If you're new to this, it might take you a few weeks just to get started. The reason you can buy those antminers is because they're not as profitable as they once were. The difficulty could rise to the point where your payout is so small it's not worth the electricity cost (running 24/7 mind you - solar doesn't work at night).
That's why a lot of people sell them - at a hashrate-to-electric-cost calculation they stop being worth it for a lot of people. If you can swing it or just want to get started, know that you'd 'make more money' just spending your money buying into Bitcoin. This is proven like 100x over.
The only good parts about mining is a) it is a nice hobby b) you strengthen the Bitcoin network c) you get a lot of working knowledge about how Bitcoin works and d) you can build it into an actual business if you wanted.
Some people mine to basically own their own job. If you can invest $5k and some time and effort and earn $200/day on mining, it's a good 'job'. You have to work to keep your miners going and will have to pay for electricity and so on and if the price of Bitcoin tanks you will be taking a huge loss during that time. And if difficulty goes up and you don't scale your network with more hash power, then your daily rate drops from $200/day to $100/day to $10/day. And then you're out of business.
So if you run it like a hobby (meaning you don't expect any real returns, it'd be nice, but you know you probably won't earn much at all), or as a business, you're good. Anywhere in between is not worth it and you're better off just buying Bitcoin with that money instead.

Which is why Libra will not be able to be banned/stopped. They'd have to ban all gift cards or introduce huge regulation to them. Facebook, unlike gift cards, is backing the gift card with the money you spend on the gift card instead of just a promise of future service. It's better than a gift card in that sense, not just backed by the company but by assets in holding. This is all if you trust them. As much as everyone dislikes Facebook, myself included, I'm more willing to use Libra than USD when it comes down to it. This strips huge power from the government's ability to steal from people, weakening the government, but strengthening FB and its investors. We're in for some amazing times ahead.

The lower the interest rate, the easier it is to get a loan, the more money floods the economy, the more your saved money loses value.
So everyone will be looking for a place to store their value if/when rates are cut. This is stocks, bonds, gold, and now Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-07-31 22:26:02
Copied from another comment I made:
If the Fed cuts rates, it means you can take out a loan to buy a house much easier. This means, on aggregate, more people will be taking out loans, because it's just cheap. Since loans are basically 'money printed out of thin air' using the Federal Reserve fractional reserve lending, this means each time a neighbor takes out a loan from the bank to buy a house, that neighbor is devaluing your money by causing more dollars to exist in the market.
You rarely notice it - you have to zoom out - but most adults know what used to cost $1 is now costing $3. This means in 20~ years prices have gone up tremendously even though technology and automation should have made everything cheaper. Inflation is not just the amount of money pushed into the system, it's also the amount stolen from innovation, efficiency and so on. Remember every company sending their workers overseas to manufacture products in other countries? Why didn't products get cheaper if they're saving on manufacturing?
Yes, the rate cut will mean more cheap dollars flooding the market, which means your dollar is worth less annually, which means people will look to buy things that hold value more. It means your money will lose value faster over time, not slower. As we're getting into interesting areas like negative rates and so on, this cannot last, and some war/crisis/failing of banks/some event will have to occur to con the people into accepting more of their assets taken away "for the good of the country" and so on.
The rate affects pretty much every loan, because if you can get it cheap from bank A, then bank B has to compete even if they were allowed to operate without using the Federal Reserve, which they're not. So all loans end up competing on the price and end up being lower as a whole, since if your rate is 0.5% higher no one will take out a loan from you.

You deleted your comment while I was writing, so here's my reply:


I completely agree! That's why we can get it as such a huge discount today from what it will be in the future.


Gold has worked for thousands of years as a reason to invade and kill, to conquer and to destroy. It is worn as jewelry on people's bodies to show their financial superiority over others. It is idolized by religious people who have been told not to idolize. And yes, it has been a way to store value until someone conquers you.
Bitcoin exists in a mathematical formula that would take multiple ages of the universe (this isn't a guess, it's thermodynamically impossible) to find just one location where anyone has stored their Bitcoin. It is easier to blow up the entire Earth than to find 1 Bitcoin 
 private key in terms of expending energy. And that key could have 0.001 Bitcoin in it. Bitcoin cannot be confiscated without you handing over the keys - the information as to where the Bitcoin is stashed.
If you believe electricity will never cease to exist (as I do) and if you realize information is the one thing that cannot be conquered or confiscated or 'stolen' (merely copied at best), and if you consider the future currency must be information based in order to succeed with robots and AI and space and so on, then Bitcoin is the only choice for storing value. It's not going away and must survive and will survive attacks by all manner of bad actors.
It's not because Bitcoin was first, but because Bitcoin literally checks off every checkbox that the best designed currency in the world should have.

If a government stops being able to control the money the people use, the government loses a lot of power. Nearly all of it. Governments of today since the implementation of central banks work by stealing value from the masses to concentrate that power to what the government wants to do. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - stealing from all the people who live relatively useless lives and using that value to push global dominance just makes sense. The USA did this the best (and first as a whole global banking system) and conquered the world. Almost every nation on Earth now has a central bank installed, which reports to a world central bank, thanks to the living conditions in the USA allowing banks to steal from so many people and yet the people are content just living their lives.
Bitcoin erodes this whole plan, and takes away the entire 100+ year old dynasty of central banking. You no longer need a bank with Bitcoin, and your value is not able to be artificially inflated. This lack of inflation means they cannot steal your labor from you to further their goals. They cannot conquer nations (none left, though), and they cannot funnel money into whatever projects they desire as well. This is why the rate cut is occurring, to spur more people to borrow more money, to lock more people into the debt-as-money system, to steal more to make up for the people who are saving and paying off their debt and so on.
The printing of the money steals from the people and the future people of the nation to accomplish goals - goals set forth by the leaders of the central banks and sometimes, maybe, the heads of government - goals they want accomplished. This could mean a desire to build a massive underground bunker that can keep the government operating in the case of war. Or to funnel funds and resources and labor into producing nuclear weapons. Or to invade another country. Or to do anything the 'top' of the government (bankers) want to do. So you know they're making some cut outs for themselves - huge estates in every part of the world, secured legacy for themselves and their families for the rest of time, and so on. All at everyone else's expense.
If this goes away, eventually - in the long term - they lose a lot of power and no longer can control the outcome. They'll have to operate legitimately. Lots of power lost, returned to the people, who will now compete with these legacy families and squash them out in the duration of time. This scares them; eventually their legacy dies (in 100-200 years) and they become normal families again.
Anyway, enough of that, but ya, those in control see there is a huge challenge with Bitcoin because there's no stopping it.

The blockchain is a chain of transactions - so you can't just insert those transactions that occurred in the past into the current chain.
For example, let's say right before the Big Disconnect, both sideA and sideB heard of a transaction and both sides added it into their next block (but were isolated). If the transaction from sideA was ever added to sideB there would be a double-spend event in that case. The Bitcoin network is designed to throw out the blockchain that has the least work behind it to maintain a ledger everyone can agree upon. Yes all the transactions on the 'smaller' (big, but still smaller) chain would be lost. There might be some record in files, but as far as the ledger is concerned, lost and invalid.
Nodes verify and relay all transactions, miners mine the transactions into a block through proof of work into the blockchain.

The reason this doesn't matter too much is due to the nature of money; if not enough people use it, then it won't go anywhere. So volume is a big factor. It signifies acceptance.
So an unlimited amount of competitors can be made, but as Bitcoin roots more and more into the world economy, none of the 'fakes' will be able to uproot it. In the lead up to worldwide adoption, plenty of altcoins can come in and muck up the field, for sure. It doesn't change the scarcity of Bitcoin, it just changes the acceptance curve. Eventually people stop messing around with the fakes and stick with the one everyone else is using, because it's easier.
For example, you can make your own coin, but you won't be able to buy food with it or pay your rent. No one accepts it. So you will be forced to use the available currency in the market to facilitate your transactions, leading to every other currency that is not accepted to fizzle out.

Kind of :) But I've done enough research into Bitcoin to know, without a single shred of doubt, that it - the idea of an information based currency that cannot be printed - is the future. I have zero doubts about this and as such, I don't worry about the price moving outside of a long term perspective where if a new feature of currency is required it could eventually overtake Bitcoin but that is not possible in the near term, only possible in centuries I think.

Banks have spent a lot of time convincing people to move away from backed currency. They don't want to go back to an uncontrollable, limited currency. They want to keep the ability to print unlimited money.
Any central bank that buys Bitcoin literally signs its own death warrant. Banks as well. Why aren't banks buying Bitcoin? Why only investment firms?
Why aren't banks buying Bitcoin? It's obviously getting returns on investment, so why not?
Because it would be signing their own death warrant. It would be suicide. The banks get their power from being able to print uncontrollable amounts of money. The more money that flows into Bitcoin the weaker the banks become, because, in effect, less people are buying what they're selling. Banks sell you printed money at retail prices, and expect you to keep buying their retail loans, because you have no choice. With Bitcoin, people have a choice. If the banks buy any Bitcoin, they're dead. They're dead anyway, but they're dead much faster when they drive the price of Bitcoin higher by buying it, forcing higher prices, and forcing adoption much sooner than would otherwise happen.
Probably the best question to ask is why no bank is buying Bitcoin, not even a little bit?
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:48:54
Well, there would be no inflation and it is already beating inflation which is why everyone is talking about it now - it's finally eroding the fiat economy.
With no inflation, it means the value would be extremely stable, and no one would be trading it out for fiat dollars anymore. The value would increase at the rate of population increase. More people, more workers, less cost for products and services as a whole.
As a kid I 'saved' money. I didn't know banks could just print more money any time they wanted. I didn't know that when a neighbor goes out and takes out a loan, the money comes out of thin air and devalues all my savings. It sucks to have been conned into saving. Fiat is not worth saving money in. Save in Bitcoin, or anything else that appreciates in value over time, but not fiat dollars.

BTC is fungible, yes. Any attempt to describe otherwise puts modifiers on it. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. Anyone claiming otherwise is just attempting to manipulate the transaction in their favor and they probably don't understand what the word means or why it matters in the first place. Even stolen money can be marked as stolen but it doesn't mean two people on the street won't still consider it valid money. But if someone comes to you and says, "Hey this is stolen money," that might change your opinion of it, purely based on emotions.

Wallets do have to download some of the blockchain to know if you have funds and display it, so that's probably why. If you set up a new wallet, and get a receiving address and send to it (if you use Bitcoin Core for example), you have to download the entire blockchain to see your transaction (since your transaction is so recent).
Some wallets only grab part of the blockchain, so you don't have to download the whole thing, but it can take a while especially if they don't know roughly when your transaction took place. So they have to scour the blockchain trying to find your transaction and that can take a long time depending on internet connection and processing speed of your device.
Download Bitcoin Core. It's basic. It works. Make a new address. Secure your wallet. Send Bitcoin there. That's my recommendation. Do the blockchain stuff yourself.

How does this have anything to do with a Bitcoin transaction? You send funds from your address to someone else's address. Why do you need a confirmation from somewhere else except the blockchain? Whomever gave you the receiving address to send your transaction to is in possession of the payment, so they're the ones to talk to. If that website is a payment processor for Overstock then well... you dealt with a payment processor and not Overstock.
So whomever you paid, if you did not get the product you ordered, if they do not issue a refund or provide the product, your option is to cut the loss or sue. Or contact consumer protection in your location and see what can be done.

Maybe you mean the exchange, Coinbase Pro?
If you bought $1000 worth of Bitcoin on the website, your account will be credited with that much Bitcoin when it shows up on your account. The amount of Bitcoin you obtained was at the market price when you made the purchase. Coinbase holds funds for a bit to prevent fraud.
Once the hold is released Coinbase will be holding your Bitcoin for you, this is called a 'custodial wallet' because they're literally holding your money (kind of like a bank). If you plan to sell in the near future, you can leave the Bitcoin there, but if you plan to hold Bitcoin for longer than a few weeks, you should get a secure wallet and have Coinbase send your Bitcoin to your wallet address. That way you have possession of your Bitcoin and no one is holding your wallet except yourself.
If you have more questions ask away.

You're acting like at a 2% buying-power-increase-per-year, that 10 BTC is not the same as 9 BTC after 10 years, in a fixed economy.
2030, 10 BTC, is = to 2040, 9 BTC.
Got it? They're the same thing. You still have 10 BTC though. No one is losing anything, it's just cheaper to buy things now, and people are not willing to pay you as much at the same time. The only thing that changed is the are now more people in the world to perform the labor. That's it.
What is money except the representation of human work effort? That's all it is. The "2% deflation" is not a magical number - it's at most exactly equal to the population increase. Why do you think the central banks love wars?


Sure they can. They might not be able to make as huge a profit but here's AT&amp;T data showing their profit margin is much more than 2%:
If any company provides value they will do fine in a system where there's 2% "deflation". I actually don't think it will be 2%, it will be under 1%, because of automation and other factors involved. It's actually very low in a fixed economy, almost not worth discussing, I think 1% is a high number in this regard.


As you said, the value is the same, but the price is easier for other people to buy. So what? Nothing wrong with that at all. They do it all the time when they split stocks and so on. The market has no issue with this. Facebook went from zero to almost a trillion in no time. Good ideas will do just fine. Bad ideas will be riskier and less common - this is good for people.

It really depends. You can make a paper wallet here: 
You can then print it off, and send Bitcoin into the address, and then if someone accepts Bitcoin, you can hand them your 0.001 BTC paper wallet for example (~$10), if they accept it and know how to import the key and want to deal with it. If you were dealing with a vendor who knew what they were doing they could send you the Bitcoin 'change' value as a transaction back to some other address that you have and have written down/printed out to scan.
There are ways, but the demand for such a thing isn't too big. There's another company called polymerbit that is making plastic dollar-note-style private keys: 
But like cash, if anyone steals or destroys any of these things, it's lost. So computer access is best. You could always pre-pay for stuff if the vendor allows. So drop 0.01 Bitcoin at your coffee shop and get 20 drinks pre-paid. Again, if they allow it.

To chime in here; let's say the government comes to take your gold. You buried it super secret. Then the government locks you up for 5 years just because. You get released and that land is gone. Someone paved over it and excavated your gold a long time ago.
With Bitcoin, your money is secured by your mind. So assuming you've got a brain, you can hold all your value in Bitcoin and no one can take it, and might not even know what you have. The government can come for you coins, and maybe you give them a wallet with a small amount in it. They can never be sure they got it all. Or you just don't give any; either way. They lock you up for 5 years. You get out. You still have all your Bitcoin, period. Access to your store of value is the information in your mind. And the currency itself is simply pure information. Bitcoin is the most secure place for your value, period. As long as you have some way to communicate, you have your money. That means even if you lost all your limbs, voice, hearing, sight, sense of smell and taste, and could only move your head back and forth and side to side, blind and deaf, you could still access your money.

It's kind of weird. When I first ran into this kind of virus, I had to think about it. It's perfect. It encrypts your files with a key and demands payment. There's no real way to get your files back unless you pay. Someone is holding your information hostage with their own information. This stuff is a movie waiting to happen.
I'm not going to lie, besides having a backup, I have no good solution to this. I've cured this kind of case by still being able to copy files off the computer, but that could have just been a bad virus. I vaguely can recall maybe cleaning a computer of this kind of thing but again, hard to say.
Turn off your computer and get some tech help. They can at least make a clone (exact copy) of your hard drive and maybe find some way to get the files. Either way you are going to be paying something for downloading and running files from dark porn sites.

I mean, if you didn't like the Fed and were in the public eye, wouldn't you say things like, "Just print enough money to pay off the national debt."?
Seriously, every person without any knowledge of the subject would agree - why not just pay off the debt! Print money to do it! Easy fix!
But then they get to studying why this cannot happen and become aware of what the Fed is.
I think if you look at the things Trump says for face value you will often think he is a hypocrite and not understand the method behind the madness.
Anyone saying, "Just print more money," either wants to disrupt the Fed by making it shoot itself in its own foot, or is ignorant of what that means. If you're considering that a billionaire businessman for over 50 years doesn't know what that means, then well I don't know what to tell you.
He's mentioned currency manipulation as a competition method against foreign countries who also manipulate their currency and he also said the Fed is a problem in just a few days. If you can suspend your disbelief for one moment and consider that the best way to deal with the Fed, if you consider it a problem (as I do), is to reveal the flaws in the system, which only reveal themselves when the Fed either prints too much money or too little and allows the economy's control to slip out of their hands. Encouraging the Fed to spend more, or less, or to do anything except maintain a stranglehold upon the nation, is an attempt to undermine the Fed.
In real life, if two people ask you the same question you might give two different answers. It depends on what you're trying to get out of the question. If you look at your life, your friends, people you know, you will see many cases of contradicting responses. You do it yourself. It's just human nature depending on what you're trying to achieve. So think about it: what are these comments by Trump trying to achieve? What kind of reach does he have, and who is reading his tweets (everyone)? Why is he not like the last two Presidents who barely mentioned the Fed at all?
If your answer is that he's an idiot and doesn't know what he's doing, then we're unlikely to find neutral ground to converse upon.

This is the part I'm talking about. I'm wondering if this would allow a grocery store to know it serves 5000 of the 15000 locals. Let's say there's 3 stores. All grocery stores combined find they serve 45000 accounts (everyone shops at all 3) to varying levels of activity, but you can say that you indeed service 5000 per month on average, giving you more indication of your viability. Store 2 might get 50% of the activity, meaning your store is  in pecking order, and the last performing store is serving 17% of customers. 
Right now your grocery store knows how many transactions per day, and can get a bunch of assumptions, but not hard data. Some transactions at the store would be created from newly formed channels - these are out of towners and so on - but the regular channels that remain open long term become sort of the bedrock that changes the business from having the assumption of "of course the grocery store is going to make money" to "we know exactly how well we serve the community".
Anyway seems like a really good way to define metrics for all sorts of things. For example if your grocery store serves 75% of the population and they can claim 48% of those people have accounts longer than 10 years, this also relates to housing prices, showing the area is very desirable to live in and fewer people are moving compared to other areas. And this can be anonymous data, in aggregate, not personal information. And with this, you didn't need anyone to give over any personal information.

Since I, and anyone, can do this - by misusing the word fungible - then even Monero is not fungible according to this misuse of the word.
When we get back to why the word is even a thing - to facilitate trade where obviously if I tell someone they need to pay me 5 gold coins by Friday, it doesn't mean some specific, exact 5 gold coins that are scattered across the nation, but rather the equivalent of such units.
Anyone claiming a currency isn't fungible is misusing the word and why it is even a thing.

A lot of people are going to gloss this chart over.
So here's the rundown:
In 1967 you got paid 200 gold coins per year to do work. A house cost you 650 gold coins, so if you saved up for a few years you could buy one. A new car cost you 77 gold coins - you could afford one car for each member of your family. If you didn't own a house, rent was 3 gold coins per month (you earn 16/month). You could buy a week's worth of food for your whole family for 1 gold coin.
Today you get paid the equivalent of 50 gold coins per year. A house costs 270 gold coins, so while houses have become cheaper due to improving building techniques, it takes you much longer to save up to buy one. A new car is 30 gold coins, about 50% more of your yearly income than what it used to be, again even though the automotive industry has become more efficient. Average rent is 1 gold coin, but you only earn 4 gold coins per month, so it's much more of a chunk of your income. You can buy a week's worth of food for your whole family for 1/3rd a gold coin, representing 9% of your income versus the 6% it used to be.
Basically, your income has been cut by 1/4th and costs have gone up 50%.
With Bitcoin, your income would be cut by 1% AND costs would go down by 1%, netting a near-zero change in buying power, so saving would become valuable, and no banker would be skimming off the top of your labor. Everyone who owns Bitcoin is already enjoying this benefit.
If you saved in GOLD back in 1967 you'd be quite wealthy today, seeing your actual costs in gold becoming much lower over time.

This is where you somehow think the government is more powerful than the people. You completely ignore due process and having to build a case against 'everyone involved'. If they're not breaking any laws today, no, the government cannot just arrest everyone involved tomorrow. That would be the kind of thing met with resistance.


I mean... lol... what! Make it illegal to run software on my own personal computer and send data to the internet? I guess they can catch all the hackers and scam artists and bad actors all over the internet tomorrow then too! Everyone who has anything illegal on their computer is going to be thrown in jail tomorrow. Wow, we're finally going to see an end to spam because they can just make it illegal to send spam! This is an absurd statement.


That's not true at all. Even in China they just had massive protests over the mere consideration of a new law.


They do this because they control the money. With less power to control the people, they have less power to erode civil liberties. I'd say we're doing something about it.


 
Election cycle planned resistance is not a good example for people rising up due to being stepped on by the government. The whole idea was the people thought they were being stepped on by rich people. Rich people are good. Fed is bad.


Did anyone get run over by a tank? Because in Venezuela people got run over by a tank. I think you're injecting some bias here where pepper spray and an order to move from a location is a brutal injustice.
Anyway, back to the first paragraph: 


No, they can't shut down wallets. Bitcoin IS a payment system, and they can shut that down as easily as they can shut down bittorrent and arrest everyone who ever pirated music on Napster. Not happening. Exchanges can be shut down individually; it would be hard to justify shutting down all of them, and often times even when the 'government' bans something, certain states enact laws to allow it (see marijuana and online poker and casinos).
The last time the government said, "We know what is best for you, stop drinking alcohol," it didn't work out. As such there's a lot of history where the wild cases you are considering are known to not be possible. Possible in attempt, sure, but in effect, no.

Short answer: No.
Long answer: Yes.
It just matters how you store it. If you store it as an open wallet file then no, it's not secure. If you do interesting things to store it, sure why not. I've told people to send an email to their Mom with their encrypted wallet file hidden and renamed as a picture attachment. Storing your keys in the open isn't too bad if you're the only one who knows those are keys. I really like the link I posted showing you can put your private keys in an image file (in actuality, you generate a private key from the picture). It's very relateable for people and you can send your favorite picture to everyone knowing it's secured by your very secure passcode that you'll never forget.

Without watchtowers, if I have a channel open with someone and I know their channel is from a mobile phone, if I steal their phone and shut it off, I can broadcast a favorable state of the channel and 'steal' the Bitcoin.
With watchtowers, depending on how it is implemented, I can find the watchtower (assuming 1 as is implied in documentation) which is keeping an eye on my target's channel. I can either pay this watchtower not to broadcast the justice state, or compromise the watchtower by taking it offline while I have also stolen the person's cell phone. So I shut down the phone (node) and the watchtower (node) and my favorable state gets through.
The last option I read is having multiple watchtowers all watching all transactions, which is good, but this leaves no incentive to run a watchtower, because well, it would be very hard to make a theft and as such, why run a watchtower when there's been zero theft attempts this past year? Meaning it disincentivizes itself. Not too bad, but if the watchtower network becomes too weak, then I can come in and set up large volumes of watchtowers, and kick out all the other watchtowers, and now I can control the state of any channel I wish, since I own all the watchtowers. If I find a channel that has enough money on it, I can collude with one party to not broadcast the justice state, and the person who got stolen from would wonder why all the 50 watchtowers watching all transactions didn't do anything about it, and since they're all set up as individual companies across the world, everyone would just shrug, but since it was set up organized-crime style, no one would know except those pulling it off.

Download Bitcoin Core and install it. This creates a wallet for you (located in the Bitcoin folder called wallet.dat). These are your private keys. Congrats, you got a wallet. Now encrypt your new wallet file using the software and save that file in a bunch of different places. Throw it in a password protected zip file and rename it so no one knows what it is, and then put that file in a bunch of different locations, USB drives etc.
That wallet gives you a receiving address. So just send your Bitcoin to that address and now you own Bitcoin. You're protected.
When you get your hardware wallet, fire up that Bitcoin Core software again and load your wallet. You'll need to update the blockchain (big 230GB file), but eventually it will show you have your BTC at your address. You can then send it off to your hardware wallet's receive address, which is basically the same process.
It's not really worth the hassle for 1 week wait period though. When you get your hardware wallet, you'll back up and remember and write down and make copies of the seed words you use - same 'security' method as making copies of your Bitcoin Core wallet. The main benefit of a hardware wallet over a software wallet is your computer doesn't ever have your keys when you sign a message to send Bitcoin, so there's no real way to intercept the keys by reading memory (if you had a virus etc).

As such any idea that governments will be able to come in and shut this down misrepresents their power to control the people and technology.

I see the value in being able to secure value without the need of banks, governments or anyone else. What is this worth? Literally everything. So I see it as a speculator who sees the future.
It is as sure a thing just as the internet was a sure thing. It's not a company, or a product. It is an idea. No one is behind it. There's no quarterly report. It just exists.
All the companies that are trying to build off Bitcoin are like the .com companies of the 2000-era - don't trust them, don't buy them. Imagine if you could have purchased 1/21,000,000th of the internet back in 1995. That's Bitcoin.
BTC's price is currently ~$9600. But the **value** of Bitcoin long term in the future (10 years) is probably worth $1-10 million USD per Bitcoin in today's prices. If the US prints way too much money and inflates the economy a lot, that number is much higher. This is because unlike a product or service, Bitcoin is a currency. It's a money. The first money we've ever had in our lives other than fiat printed dollars. As a currency, the value of a currency is *directly proportional to all value that can be weighed against.*
This means in a perfect world, with no fiat currency and only Bitcoin, Bitcoin would be worth ((all the value of everything) - (minus 10% for barter and direct trade)) / 21,000,000 Bitcoins.
This kind of valuation was never possible with any previous currency ever created. Gold could never reach that possibility because it could not divide up small enough to represent all transactions if *everything* was valued in gold. That's why they had to print paper money in the first place, because gold couldn't be divided enough.
Even if only 10% of everything is valued in Bitcoin terms, the fiat paper money price is extremely high. But since Bitcoin is a currency, and the best one we have created as humans to date, it will eventually take over everything.
In 10 years we might not even call it Bitcoin. It might have new technology layers that just make it easy to use. We'll have plenty of ups and downs and Bitcoin will be tested - and it will pass those tests.
My speculation is that Bitcoin is very cheap right now.

I agree. I also agree Tor does a good job for what it's used for. I just wouldn't make the leap of faith of, "I used Tor, there's no way they can find me." And since we're discussing incentive levels people would definitely kill for, if there was a way, someone would find it. Keep in mind, in all this, we're dealing with two people who opened a channel, so necessarily for us to compromise the channel, we need to know one of the parties who wants to perform the theft, and they know the target, so staying hidden behind Tor is not even a factor, since one of the parties knows the target we're going after.
Two simple examples:
1. You're a shady drug-dealing business. Someone comes in and opens a 167 mBTC channel with you. You know they have ~$2000 on that channel. You give them $50 worth of drugs. They send you $50 worth of Bitcoin. Now what? You're going to let them walk out and have even the possibility of stealing from you? No. You hold them up and force them to send over the entire amount of the channel. As such, if smart, the buyer would only open a channel for the exact amount needed to perform the transaction when dealing with this kind of shady situation. The incentive to close the channel and obtain the full amount is on the business when there's a large amount left over. So the user should not open large channels, to counter the incentive.
2. You're a customer who bought $50 drugs from a business and you leave the 167 mBTC channel open. Over time, you keep buying, and you're close to using up all your funds. You're broke for whatever reason, and you know if you can close that channel with an old state, you get your money back. If you don't even try, you get nothing. So you're incentivized to try even if it fails, and if you knew how the vendor handled their watchtower situation, it would give you more information on how to pull off your theft.
Both parties should keep small enough channels to where the incentive is not that big a deal on either end, that's the main point I guess, and the fact that with an open channel, the buyer knows the seller has at least as much BTC as is in that channel.

No, your wallet doesn't remember anything. Everything is done cryptographically. If your wallet is not online, someone can send you Bitcoin. How that works is the ledger is updated and the transaction is mined into the blockchain. All your wallet does is give you the keys to access transactions that were sent to you.

Only because of inflation. That entire idea is only because of inflation.
An example: If you go into a forest and cut down a tree and turn it into lumber every day, do you need to make more money year over year?
You need enough money to survive, to pay for your food and shelter and bills and equipment. So you sell your lumber at some profit for your labor. But do you need a 2% compounding return year over year to just live your life? No.
You don't need this compounding 2% year over year if you just want to live your life. You only need it in an inflation system that is stealing from you where you have to keep raising your prices to keep inflation from sucking you dry.
What happens when you have a son, and he helps you cut down trees and produce lumber every day? Your work effort is cut in half as you teach him this skill, and yet you're still making the same amount of money per day in this fixed economy. Your son requires food and some stuff but overall it isn't that much. You do not have to struggle to keep a child in a fixed economy. You're not racing against an inflation clock.
Because your son is doing half the work, you might even sell your lumber for a little less, too, as it takes less of your effort to produce the product. Or, you might produce twice as much product, and have more to sell, so you can sell it at a lower price.
You can exist without raising your prices if you want. People will value your work for what it is worth. And you only work half the time since your son is doing half the work. The cost to you is extra food to feed the kid, easy to price into a year's worth of lumber, right? You're not having to struggle to find buyers, and all your costs to do business are not rising forcing you to charge more for your work.

It's based on Bitcoin price. So while it shows $8 now, could you afford if Bitcoin price drops down to $200 and miners only earn 20 cents per day?
Usually a bunch of people jump into mining when the price gets high - they see $$$$ and jump on it. It's a good hobby but it's never 'worth it' unless you're mining as a job/business.

**"**Gold!? Gold compared to my lightweight dollar? Gold shall never replace the tried and true dollar. When someone stole my dollar, the bank just reprinted my dollar and gave it back to me!
When someone has to move gold, or to actually spend it, do they mint it into coin? Do we go back to cutting coins into pieces of eight? To which nation do we trust their gold coin has not been debased? And should someone steal that gold? It's GONE! No loving bank to reprint your gold for you, it is simply gone! An elderly woman trying to move her life savings in gold? She can barely lift it! A person who tosses a coin and the coin lands in the deep river, it is forever gone! Entrusting your gold to the brand new bank with questionable security?
This is why you need the fiat money and the fiat bank! To manage your own gold would be troublesome! But that is what people mean when they say we should use gold as a currency again! You have to maintain your own vault, haul the heavy gold, and weigh down your person with coins so as to simply purchase food? To make it easier, you will just leave your gold in a convenient bank, but then it is in control of the bank - not your gold in hand, not your gold! If you store your gold in your home, it could melt away in a fire! A burglar could study your vault for years until he was certain you had enough to make it worth stealing from!
This is why people will never accept gold. The only way they will enjoy gold is if I bank it for them and maintain the economy with gold. There's just too much at risk putting all your wealth into a single yellow piece of metal. Remember, my bank printed off a new dollar for me when someone stole it - this is not possible with gold!
Say they track down the person who steals your gold, but he spent 50% of it. You're not getting the rest back! And I know you might claim "Don't get stolen from" but this is illogical because it will happen! If someone breaks into your vault and steals your gold, you could lose everything compared to the fiat dollar where the bank will simply print you more of them for you!**"**
I decided to stop there.
There has never, ever, in the history of time, ever been a problem with money. People used sea shells. The one, and only problem ever to exist in money, are the banks. People can and will accept losses of cash - it happens every day when they drop a $20 on the ground paying for their latte. The reliance on the bank to reprint your fiat dollar is sad. The bank lulled you into thinking the system was more favorable to you than one where you are fully responsible for your funds. You even wrote paragraphs about how important it is that the bank be able to reprint your stolen dollar and hand it back to you. You fail to acknowledge the theft of the future persons that happens when the bank does this for you! When the bank prints your replaced dollar, they are stealing from someone else in the future through inflation to pay back you who have been stolen from. You are in effect no better than the thief himself! Except you feel good about this transaction, that your irresponsible behavior that led to your account details being compromised, can be washed away, that your personal actions were wiped clean in the eyes of the Lord Bank.
It is through education, if we can, that we can explain these facts to people and hopefully they change their mind to not value the system you value - one which steals from the future to pay back the theft of your funds today - but instead to value the truth, which is everyone must be responsible for themselves and take responsibility when their methods have been compromised.
The FIAT backup plan you adore is simply the theft of future generations' labor today. That is what you value so highly that you feel we the people cannot get away from, that 'regular people' cannot veer away from. You might be right, but it is the wrong ideal to champion. But know it for what it is, thief.

This makes me wonder, if you're a miner you get to add your own transaction into the block you successfully mine.
If you are sending money to another miner, for example, you could give them the transaction (not through nodes) and if they solve a block, they could mine your transaction into their block.
They receive 0.1 BTC.
You "lost" 0.1 BTC due to fees - your 'spending' was a business expense.
If I have 0.1 BTC from 2009 I have capital gains of ~100% current value. If I sell for $1000, I pay ~20% tax or 200. If instead I send that BTC to a miner and add that 0.1 BTC as a fee, I'm not buying anything, I'm spending $1000 on a fee, or an expense. The miner gets 0.1 BTC and then sends me $1000 as a gift. I get a $1000 deduction on business expense and the gift from the generous miner.
Anyway seems like there's a laundering (illegal/governments won't like it) thing possibly going on there. But it would be hard for anyone to prove any of this happened. And if you don't bring up the 'expense' situation you simply got a $1000 gift from someone (and saved $200 on taxes).

It will stabilize but the value will be very high where the fluctuation won't affect buying power at the local level. That is when you can buy food and pay bills in Bitcoin and it's no big deal - there will be volatility at the top but only between those who are dealing in bigger value comparisons.
Bitcoin has a finite supply, so necessarily the value will rise, forever, against any inflationary dollar like USD and really everything else. Eventually Bitcoin's value becomes linked with the value of human work effort. The end result is Bitcoin becomes a true indicator of human labor, give or take some variation on the quality of said labor.
So then what? Then, the amount of labor in the market determines the price, right? As such, with more humans, Bitcoin gains more buying power over time. 1 Bitcoin today will buy an entire solar system in year 3019. As more humans enter the market, the increase in labor makes everything cost less - more people to perform work, means less cost to produce something. If you run a farm by yourself, have a few kids, and soon after you have lots of helpful labor, and you can pay them less, because they're going to work for food, clothes and shelter at first, etc.
This drives down the cost of labor as well and all prices slowly creep downward. I do mean slow - the rate of population increase is the limiting factor. If population rises 1% per year, then buying power increases 1% per year (in a perfect system). As such, you can buy more with your holdings over time with the same amount of Bitcoin, but no one will *pay you* more for the same amount of labor over time, because someone else will enter the marketplace and do it for less.
It is a perfect system. Bitcoin never stops increasing in value (it is in relation to all human value) unless the population vastly decreases and human value goes down. For example, if half the world population gets wiped out, you'd all of a sudden be willing to pay more Bitcoin to get what you want (same as any natural disaster and local economic impact).

 kinda have scientific proof.
Land lines are, arguably, more interconnected than the internet. At least on a local level. The technology for me to connect to your computer is very easy with a simple 56k modem. For me to process DSL signals and above, it's quite hard with more specialized equipment.
As such, a 56k modem could maintain 1MB block transfers in a worst-case scenario. We'd get blocks transmitted at a rate where nodes would get updated before the next block is mined onto the blockchain. In an end-of-the-world scenario, we need to be able to maintain the network and be able to transmit 1 block per 10 minutes, or 1MB per 10 minutes.
A 56k modem can be connected to any other computer modem with two wires.
This means if we had to, we could string wires all over the place and maintain some kind of connection. But, there's so much wiring with phone lines, it wouldn't be hard to get switchboards up and running and so on. The point is, we could, if we had to, revert to computer-to-computer direct-wire connection and still update nodes on the completion of mined blocks. I know some people will comment on the slowness, impractical nature, and so on of this - that's not the point. The point is if shit hit the fan, and we're the last city on Earth with no outside connection, we can just string wires together and get our "internet" up and running.
A nominal modem connection might transmit 1MB in 1-2 minutes, so we have enough of room for noise (slower connection), disconnections, and some buffer for overhead if we need to transmit a block to someone and also receive a block from someone else at the same time (peer-to-peer). If we had bigger blocks, this becomes much less doable on a 56k modem. We're likely to bump up against the 10 minute block creation timer.
To end before I write too much, let's say this "shit hit the fan" scenario did happen. One interesting fact is that difficulty would remain high, while your local hash rate would be so small, you'll likely never complete a block in the weeks it will take to update difficulty. So it buys us time to restructure the network and maintain the ledger.
So, sorta-scientifically, 1MB is a good number. It could be a little more, a little less. But we like round numbers, us humans, and 1MB sounds good. It fits well within the 56k modem space that any two computers can connect over with ease, and the technology - two simple wires strung between two computers - is very basic and has been around for ~150 years. If we processed blocks "too fast" like Litecoin, we rely too much on modern technology and couldn't maintain that network in a worst-case scenario. There's a nice, comfortable spot at 56k modem and 1MB where even if we had to use slower modems, we'd likely still be able to maintain a network for transactions.

Especially since putting out a trade tells the entire trading market what you're doing, so people will destroy you by pushing the market just for the laughs. Exchanges for example have every opportunity to allow the best-paying traders inside information on who to bust and how. It might not be legal, and it might not be occurring often, but it is happening; putting your long term trade out in the open is not smart in my opinion. You're just giving everyone else information, the price of your own greed.
So, I kinda enjoy see it in that regard. Everyone playing their bets in the short term getting destroyed. Means more people can buy more. Damn deposit wait times, price is so low!

The answer is: NO. You should not sell your Bitcoin for a couple hundred dollars. You probably spent more on eating out at restaurants in the past two months than what you have in Bitcoin. Just hold it, learn more about Bitcoin and do yourself a favor and don't look at the price for a few years while you learn. If you learn about why Bitcoin even exists you will be able to ride out the market fluctuations with ease, and again, you're not risking that much.
In the near future if you think Bitcoin is a good idea, start buying more into it, slowly over time. If you are done with Bitcoin and think it is a terrible idea then sell and get out. Trust your own judgement.

First, you need to determine if this thing is a good idea. Because even though the best option for everyone right now is to literally dump everything they have into Bitcoin, people also need to eat and plan ahead and live life and actually function as normal people.
Here's some easy to digest info on Bitcoin:
Then if you want to learn a little bit about money, someone posted this recently and I think it does a good job explaining some things:
Then if after you've consumed some information you too realize even if you put everything you make into Bitcoin in the next 5 years and it crashes into the dirt, you're young and will recover from it, so why not take some risk, set up a Coinbase account, send some funds over, hop over to Coinbase Pro, and place an order for what you can afford to lose.
And then do the hard part. Wait. As the thoughts of nice things pop into your mind, be like a monk, and realize only 10% of Bitcoin owners hodl, and that number includes 'lost' Bitcoins. So very few people have the willpower to wait. Force yourself... to wait.
That's some rough advice. For details, the side bar has some info. Go on Coinbase, buy some Bitcoin, send that Bitcoin to your wallet (hardware wallet, or software wallet from Bitcoin Core is fine too, just learn to secure it and back it up and never forget how to access it). That's it. That, and hold. Hold and hold. Don't get greedy short term. Get greedy long term. Hold and hold and buy more and hold.
If you have some more specific questions let me know, or read my longer posts in my post history for some detailed information on a bunch of stuff. I tend to write long posts.

Damn I wrote up a nice reply too. Wish there was some way I could find his username.
Edit: Just in case the guy comes back, my reply:
Go look up Amazon stock. You know Amazon right?
They entered the market with an IPO of $1.50 per share. Now Amazon is worth over $2000 per share. A month ago it was $1900.
Anyone who believed in Amazon from the start made a lot of money. If you bought 1000 Amazon shares at $5/share you invested $5000 and you now hold $2 million in value for your investment - a massive gain in value.
Bitcoin is buying a future currency at a discount. For example, gold used to be 'cheap' compared to today's prices. If you put all your money into gold 20 years ago, you'd be happy with your returns today.


The best currency is one not backed by anything. Money is a representation of human work effort, or human labor. As such, the idea of money is just that, an idea, not a physical property.


This is incorrect. Check out these videos. Bitcoin is just a number in a mathematical formula, where there are more answers to the formula than there are atoms in the entire universe 10 times over. As such, you randomly pick one of these random numbers to store your Bitcoin. Anyone trying to guess to find it has to guess through 10-universes worth of atoms worth of answers to try and find just where your Bitcoin is. In other words, it's not possible even if you had all the time in the universe. The math shows that even if you the most powerful computer ever possible and had until the heat death of the universe, you could not guess where my Bitcoin is stored. That is how big the sea of numbers is. And, we can always increase this number if we felt like it.


This is always possible, but if you keep your Bitcoin address, it doesn't affect how much Bitcoin you have. So although an exchange could be shut down, because where your Bitcoin is stored is only known by you - the means to unlock the address where your Bitcoin is at is known as a process you know how to perform and no one else does - your mind becomes the key to your money. Your mind becomes a bank. No one can steal it from you.


The central banks print billions of dollars per year, inflating the currency and stealing from the people indirectly. That is the only fraud. Bitcoin is whatever value you want it to be. Most people are finding the features of Bitcoin very valuable.
Please take some time to research it a bit more. These two relatively short videos will give you a huge information boost as to why Bitcoin is even a thing:
Please watch them both - they are neutral videos, they don't say "Bitcoin is the best thing ever!" They just talk about how it works. Spend just a few minutes and watch them.

Let's do some math yeah?
7 billion people. 10% are "rich".
700 million rich people.
6.3 billion regular people.
Which one of those groups produces the food and does the hard labor?
If the people adopt the currency, the "rich people" have no choice but to adopt it as well. If the "rich" fail to adopt it, they become poor as everyone else no longer values the old currency.
You are right, they have no incentive to adopt it early. Slow and steady is good for the people, too. Eventually it will shift, but rich people have no reason to put everything into Bitcoin right now, of course not. But when they see returns better than stocks...?
Bitcoin has never endured any major western world nation's economic disruption. It will occur, eventually. There will be a housing bubble, or another bank "too big to fail". That's when we'll have a test for what Bitcoin is worth.

I don't know about that website but yes if it is only usable with that website you are on the hook if that company is no longer able to provide the same service to you.
Since you are hodling you can use very low transaction fees since waiting a few days isn't an issue for you.
You should always be mindful, secure and confident that you have control of your keys no matter what happens in life. As such if you have any distrust in something, it's time to move to something you trust, period. Your intuition isn't lying to you.
You could set up a software wallet using Bitcoin Core and just transfer your Bitcoin to your own (backed up, encrypted and secure) software wallet on your computer (or deleted off your computer, you just need the wallet file and the receiving address actually). It's free and you're in full control, 100%, with no company in the middle, with the knowledge that you are also 100% responsible if something should happen (stolen wallet, forget password, all your backups get lost, etc).
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:10:25


I can prove that it is.
Imagine you and I agree to do work for each other and exchange tokens to represent our work. We'll call this money "ace" after your username. For every ace I have, I can get you to do some work for me, and for every ace you have, you can get me to do some work for you.
Assume we need each other for survival, that you're not going to spend all your time farming corn, and I'm not going to spend all my time farming pigs, which is what you do. You farm pigs, and I farm corn.
We trade these aces sometimes, because I don't need pigs all the time, and you don't need corn all the time, so when I come to buy pigs, because you don't need corn in that moment, I give you some aces to represent that I will do work for you in terms of corn value in relation to the number of aces you have.
Now imagine you realize you can just print more aces. Not enough where I notice, but enough where you get me to constantly do work for you and you get to do less and less work. This is called inflation. You're printing money and stealing my labor without me knowing about it, because you can print more aces whenever you want.
Now imagine someone else comes along who can perform some work - say they farm cows. They see this money system and they like the idea of aces and they join into agreement with us. Now you have 2 people who you can steal from, slowly over time. You're never left wanting, because you can always print more aces to pay us.
Now, let's say the cow farmer and I decide we found a better money, because we thought there were only 100 aces in the system, but we compared notes and realize there's 200 aces between both the cow farming and me, the corn farmer. Something is up. Someone has been printing aces.
So instead, the cow farmer and I decide to deal with a new currency called Bitcoin. One we are absolutely sure no one can print more of it. As we continue to use this system, you run out of aces. At first we accepted your aces, you paid us like 50 aces one day for food. Eventually we decide we don't want anything to do with your aces anymore.
You're now stuck, either having to join into this new currency called Bitcoin, one which you cannot print, or starve and die as you don't get any corn or beef and starve and die. So you will destroy your printing press which printed those aces, abandon your paper money, and join us with Bitcoin.
The timeframe involved here is long - maybe 20-30 years from now? It depends. But when people have the option to start dealing in this unprintable currency it will slowly grow over time and eventually no one will value any printed dollar anyone comes up with.
So, buying Bitcoin destroys the banks, necessarily, because each time Bitcoin is purchased it reinforces the value of Bitcoin and lowers the value of the printed money.
We will see the collapse of paper money in our lifetime. It's happened a couple times in the past 100 years and we'll see it again. People have a choice now.

If all your Bitcoin is in 'custodial wallets' such as exchanges, then if those exchanges get hacked, or simply decide they shut down tomorrow, you lose everything. So store any Bitcoin you own on a hardware wallet or software wallet of your choosing. Just be secure about it. Then you actually own Bitcoin and the keys you hold in your mind (how to access your Bitcoin) become extremely valuable because you are in full control. It's quite an experience to have that kind of responsibility.

Yeah, you'd have to compete with lower prices, while paying your workers relatively the same value of currency, which is 'less' and people have a hard time making sense of that.
I agree, with a 2% growth for example, if the bankers only injected 2% fiat, it would be fine. Except that's never the case, we cannot trust people to maintain accurate ledgers, and it always leads to cheating and stealing and favoritism. So instead, if we want sound money, we will have to accept this weird thing of "my labor is not worth as much next year as it is worth this year, because there's more people around able to do this work". How it works now is, "My labor is not worth as much right now since that guy just took out a $500k loan for his new house."
And keep in mind - this is for your average worker. Specialized work will always obtain a higher pay, even year after year, if they bring value to their company.

I never claimed it being easy, just that with enough incentive it becomes a viable option.


Haha... ok well then, I guess we can't fool you! I'll just you know... own the VPN service that knows both your IP and every destination IP you are trying to reach and is literally the middle-man I'd need to monitor all your traffic to see what you're up to.
But you know... you have a VPN so you're good. I can see why my idea seems odd to you - you're already outsourcing trust to a third party.
Regardless of that, it's still not the point. We have to assume all communication can be intercepted - since, by definition, we're communicating, and the person intercepting the communication is supposed to be the recipient. My thoughts, unless you're a mind reader, are not communication. The information in my brain is not communication. This is where Bitcoin is stored - in a non-communication space (we'll keep brain-scanning sci-fi out of it for now).
If someone has a channel open, they have "open" BTC out there, up for someone to get - hopefully and usually without force. But it could be someone who steals your phone, who processes payments to themselves from your phone. Or it can be a bunch of other methods of physically interacting with this open BTC.


Put aside the idea of me intercepting communication by being a third party. Assume I am the watchtowers. Assume I'm all of them (there's no incentive for everyone to run them). I then intercept communication because I am the intended recipient.

If you check your accounts once per day or every other day, and all of a sudden you see a transfer you didn't make, you'd be happy they put a wait period on transfers like this so you can cancel it and no one ran off with your Bitcoin.
It's anti-fraud. If someone steals your real-life wallet and phone, it can take you a while to regain control, and in that time depending on circumstances, the thief could impersonate you enough to make a transaction from your account.

Libra is skimming interest off people who own Libra to pay the people who invest $10M to become 'nodes'. As such, nodes will make a lot of money while owners of Libra won't make a dime. Not a bad scheme for the nodes.
For 'normal people' the reason you will use Libra is due to ease of use outside of normal fiat. Money that your brain doesn't think is real money so you spend a bunch of it because it's easy. I would have no problem using Libra if it were easier, for example, to buy something online and not have extra fees attached. People selling within that network can afford to charge lower prices - because they're not having to pay payment processors like PayPal per-transaction and so on. So it has a use, and a profit motive for those who maintain that network.
Bitcoin exists in a different fashion. You get the interest on your own Bitcoin, so to speak. No one is skimming your money for pennies; they can't. Just like most people don't own gold, most people won't own Bitcoin. Only those who are smart enough to know not to waste their money, and those who want a good investment, will find it. For everyone else, there's Libra.

Did you read?
If you bought Amazon stock 22 years ago when it had its IPO are you involved in a pyramid scheme? Why do you think everyone investing in the stock market is part of a pyramid scheme? Don't they too get enthusiastic about it because of the potential to gain money from it? Isn't that why they bought the stock in the first place? Don't they need to recruit some naive people and pump up the price some more so they can sell it in the future for profit?
Anyone who bought 1000 shares of Amazon for *cheap* at the IPO now holds $2 million in value for doing zero work at all, just for buying "because of the potential to gain money from it."
Seems like your reality is not the same as everyone else's. Maybe you are mad about something? You should learn about Bitcoin a bit more - learning about it now would be like learning about Amazon when it sold for $60 a share. Get it early.

Let's say 50% of the miners drop out due to economic reasons. Difficulty will decrease (after some time) to maintain one block mined every 10 minutes.
Depending on how drastic the change is, like if there was a major worldwide power outage and it took a long time for everyone to get back online, the first person back online would be dealing with the current difficulty and it might take them a long, long time to mine that very next block, creating a massive swell of backlogged transactions.
During this period, whomever comes online the fastest with the most hashing power would write the most 'trusted' blockchain for a while until more people got back online - not a bad deal considering you're the first to bring back online significant hash power to get the system operational again.
If all Bitcoin stopped and you were the only node then yes you could run it, eventually, on your computer.
Or you can do that now - just download the Bitcoin open source code and run it. BOOM you have your own Bitcoin blockchain congrats. You'll be mining thousands of coins in no time.

No don't mine. It's good as a hobby where you'll lose money just running the thing but 'fun' while you learn it, or as a business where you buy a lot of those machines and run them in bulk and 'own your own job'.
Mining is not for making money, basically, regardless of what those calculators say.
What you should do is find a way to buy Bitcoin - if miners just bought Bitcoin they'd almost always have made more in returns than just mining. Coinbase is good for buying in my opinion. Just buy some, learn how the technology works, and sink in $100 every now and then.
Bitcoin rises in value against the dollar. Very few things do this - the best performing stocks, gold (sometimes), and certain other things outperform USD. But USD is devalued over time as central banks print more money out of thin air. So that $5000 you work for a year? They print $5000 per second. Bitcoin hedges against that inflation. So even if you put even just a little bit into Bitcoin, the value increase over time beats that inflation. And as more people learn about Bitcoin, the 'price' will grow.
I would recommend you spend some time learning more about Bitcoin - there's posts on the side bar. Learn a lot about it while it's still a new technology, and buy some as an investment for the future. Remember - the future, not tomorrow. Don't sell because your $100 worth of Bitcoin is now $150. Wait. Wait a long time, like 10 years, it seems like forever. But just wait it out, and buy more over time, and learn more about it.
Don't mine unless you want to burn your money as a hobby, or if you turn it into a huge business with 100's or 1000's of miners running 24/7 and you run a datacenter basically.
I have a lot of long posts explaining 'why' Bitcoin. Take a look. Research. Learn as much as you can.

That is true if you believe I can start printing paper money in my basement and issuing out my own paper money and demanding my city use my money instead of some other money.
Meaning, no, Tether has no chance to replace fiat and can only be manipulated by those who control fiat.


No, there's a huge difference between something that is scarce and something that is created out of thin air - an idea in your mind.
If I get you to accept my new currency "Tokenz" for payment for you doing work in the real world - lifting rocks, clearing forests, farming the land - I then have the ability to create as much Tokenz as I want to continue to pay you to slave away doing the work. As long as you do not see that I am creating these Tokenz out of thin air, you think you're being treated fairly, that is, you think they have value.
With something scarce, two things happen. For example, if I have 1000 gold coins, I cannot ever lend you more gold coins than I have, right? If I owe you 1100 gold coins, you could easily see that I do not have enough to pay you. So you stop dealing with me since I defrauded you. So the first thing that happens is accountability. I cannot create more gold coins out of thin air, so I have to deal with what I have or else no one will trust me.
Which gets to the next thing that happens. You can still "borrow" my gold. I have 1000, and you want to borrow 500. OK! But now if someone else comes along and wants to borrow 1000, I can't, because I only have 500 left. Instead I can try to scam you and give you a certificate for 1000, even though I only have 500. If you use that certificate somewhere, there's a good chance you get what you want, and if that person ever comes to collect to me, we have "a run on the bank". That is, I don't have enough money to cover withdrawals. Since someone accepted this certificate, I go out of business, my reputation is ruined and so on.
Now, if you don't accept certificates, and hold people to facts about how much money they have because you're dealing with an unchanging public ledger like Bitcoin, no one can lend more than they actually have, and no one can borrow and be scammed because no one can borrow more than the other person has either.
If you can read a bit into the situation I mentioned above, about issuing certificates, what Tether is doing is issuing certificates on top of fiat. They're printing certificates of certificates. Since accountability and reputation are the things lost when a bank fails (and everyone who had any funds in the bank), a central bank can set up Tether as certificates-of-certificates and crash Tether-Bank, and crash Tether currency, without having to disrupt the exterior financial system. It's bad enough if you trust that paper money has limited production, but then to issue certificates on top of paper money is ... well... just a risk, easily compromised by central banks. You too can make your own token representing $1 USD can you not? Just say so! You don't even need cryptography. Just tell people 1 "mytv coin" is worth $1 and promise it. Now you're Tether, congrats.

I'm not trying to defeat the LN. I'm saying there's a vulnerability in that anyone I open a channel with, I must trust, and that it's not worth it to outsource the trust to a watchtower, because that just offsets the level of trust to another party and makes the users feel safe without actually making them safe.
I hope you understand that if you own Bitcoin, no one can get it if you have secured your keys. Not even possible. A lightning channel exposes the transaction where now someone can get it. And the means to do so isn't 'hard'. If you and I meet and you say, "Hey I have this cool thing want to buy it?" I say, "Sure," and I open a lightning channel for $100 to you. Just like cash, my Bitcoin is vulnerable in that moment - and all moments going forward where that channel is open.
That's the main threat. The fact that we leave the channel open. Imagine a fiat cash transaction. We meet up. You think I have the cash on me but can't be 100% certain. Then I pull out the cash to pay for the item. You now know I have cash on me, 100% certain. You choose to honor the transaction, handing me the item and I hand you the cash. The payment channel is closed. Or is it? Since I now know you have cash, I know exactly what I'm getting if I steal that cash from you in that moment. I get the product and I get my cash.
Lightning seems like a great way to facilitate this with Bitcoin. It serves all the same functions and does it better than cash, except unlike cash, we keep the channel open all the time. I always know you have my cash that I paid to you, until the channel closes. So I can steal from you, or try to, until the channel is closed.
Now keep in mind, this is way better than fiat cash. But we're going from 100%, you cannot touch my money Bitcoin, to fiat-cash-like transfer of money. We're dividing by zero. We're creating a big black hole in terms of the scale of the disparity between Bitcoin's trust model of not needing trust, and the lightning trust model of needing trust somewhere. It's fine, because it's again way better than fiat cash, but it's still something to consider.
In the end, I'm saying the more we move the trust away from individuals to watchtowers, we will weaken this situation more. Because if we rely on a watchtower and become complacent, then we can be taken advantage of, whereas with an individual channel that we set up between two parties, we only open that channel with the amount of funds we're willing to risk. We tolerate more risk if we think a third party is watching out for us, when they can be compromised with the same ease (in terms of physical force) as we could. It would be like that in-person transfer of cash, where instead of me handing you the cash, I use a third party, hand it to them, and they hand it to you (I'm not saying this is how LN works, I'm saying pay attention to the trust here). I'm more willing to trust this third party, because they said they won't scam me, but the level of trust that actually exists is the same. The third party can scam me just the same as the direct party.

I have to look at it more to see if the merchant can close the channel with an end-state saying that the customer paid everything, or if that is purely controlled by the customer. In other words, can only the customer send an old state, or can the merchant close the channel with a state that says all funds were transferred from the customer to the merchant.
If you open a 0.1 BTC channel now, that might be worth $100k some day. As such, it could be forgotten about, and you're spending on it like it's worth what it's worth, so you keep it open, happy the value is increasing. Each payment you make is fewer and fewer satoshis because the value is going up. It seems there is an incentive at some point for one party to attempt theft of the funds if they can get away with it, and getting away with it is maybe possible with physical force. Anyway, thanks for responding, I'm gonna stop going off about the topic.

Bitcoin is money. We're not talking about how much Bitcoin Bitcoin is/was/could be worth. That makes no sense.
What is the value of gold? It's entirely subjective. Worth is comparative. How much gold can I get for X.
The value of Bitcoin is whatever you want it to be. It's market value is what people are exchanging it for. It's worth is what the market value should be.
A shirt signed by your favorite celebrity is valued to you at priceless. It's market value at auction is for example $10,000 USD. It's worth might be $20,000 because the celebrity is now dead. The person buying it at market value received a discount and could probably resell for additional market value because it is worth more.
Edit: To bring it back to Bitcoin:
The value of Bitcoin to you is 10M. The market value of Bitcoin is ~$11500. The worth of Bitcoin is higher if demand is high and lower if demand is low.
I too value Bitcoin very high, but it's not worth that just yet, so we'll have to wait until the market value supports our personal valuations.

As I see it, they are screwed either way they look at this thing, that is the only reason they could be shaking. There's no answer to it which leads to them maintaining central banking dominance. If they buy lots of Bitcoin, price goes up dramatically. If they try and pump and dump, same thing and more people get hyped about it.

I just realized; you bought into Monero!
They sold you on the false idea of fungibility and you bought it! $200/each maybe? lol...
Well that's altcoins for you.
By definition, cryptocurrencies are creating code that lets one transaction be identified as different from another transaction. Attempting to hide that history does not make something more or less fungible. I was trying to consider you trying to make a point that you can melt gold down and that somehow deletes its history as if that has any bearing on something being fungible. It didn't strike me at first that you must own Monero and weren't just advocating for it, where Monero is promising you that you won't/don't have transaction history, and you tried to apply that idea of hiding history to gold.
It's completely incorrect unfortunately. It doesn't work. The abstract idea of fungibility is not to hide history, it's all about being able to define something as a currency or not. In fact, if you melt a gold coin down, it is probably no longer fungible with other gold coins! A raw gold dealer however might accept it for its weight value no matter if it were a coin or a melted blob. If I let you borrow a book, and then ask for the book back, if you give me a different book back, then the book is not fungible because I won't accept any random book back. If I let you borrow any book, and then ask for any book back, then the 'any book' you return to me is fungible in that isolated agreement between you and I. It's about applying properties to objects to see if they behave as a currency.
A currency has the property of being fungible, in that you can request something in return, but the actual thing you get in return is not the exact thing you are requesting, merely the abstract value is being returned. If I let you borrow $10, I am not demanding that you give me the exact same $10 bill when you return it, just the equal value, which could be 10x $1 bills. With any cryptocurrency, if I let you borrow 10 Bitcoin or 10 Monero, I'm not requesting the exact same 10 Bitcoin or 10 Monero back, just the abstract value, even if you send me 100 transactions to total 10 Bitcoin, or 1000 transactions to total 10 Monero. The abstract value is the same. That is what the word is about, and it's just an idea anyway.
All currency has this property, which is why the word exists; as a way to determine if something is a currency or behaves similarly to a currency. It's a simple true/false statement. If it has this property, it is a currency. If it does not have this property, it is not a currency. It is a way of transacting that means we can all operate on these shared social norms of what something is - and this is mainly for the court system, for when someone got paid with something and they claim, "Yeah but they didn't pay me *in gold!"* As if that somehow invalidates the contract.
All the other attempts at adding modifiers like the ability to hide history are irrelevant. That someone might claim a certain crypto-address is tainted does not affect the unit itself, only the human perception of that unit *if you know and believe that someone else's claim that it is tainted is legitimate.* If you do not believe the other person, there is no 'tainting' and there is no reduction in value and no difference between that unit and any other, not that a difference itself has anything to do with it. It is just a simple question: if I ask for something back, do I expect the exact same object/thing, or do I expect a representation of that thing?
Because crytography involves you signing a message, and since Monero has private keys like anything else, it is possible - sure, maybe harder, but not impossible - to put restrictions on the purchase, transfer and sale of Monero to and from addresses like anything else. This does not have anything to do with being fungible. History has nothing to do with being fungible. This is just your level of anonymity in transacting, which is not overall a good thing when it comes to transactions. It might suit some purposes, but is not a property of currency that aligns with being the best currency. It can be good, but again, not ever the best. Monero can claim to be much harder to censor and much harder for someone to gain knowledge of who you are and what transactions you are making, but anonymity is not the same as fungibility.

It's not safe. No one will give you money back if your seller does not send you Bitcoin. All cash transactions are about trust. So if you trust the person it is as safe as you're willing to risk.
So even though it's not safe, it's not too bad in the sense that you can establish trust. Why not try with an amount you can afford to lose, and if it works out, repeat the process up to your intended limit? Start with small transactions and work up from there if necessary. If someone is willing to sell you $1000 in Bitcoin, they will have no issue selling $100 worth, or $10 worth. And you can always ask for the public address of their account to verify they have the BTC available, and when they send it to you, you can confirm it came from that address, so you'll know who you're dealing with actually owns that address and that BTC going forward.

I disagree in that the same way internet has no competition. How to access the internet is competitive, but the internet is just an idea that we can use forever. Bitcoin falls into the same category. It's an idea we can use forever. There are competing companies on how to access your Bitcoin, but the idea has no such competition.
It's like a mouse trap. One day someone unlocked the idea of building a mouse trap. Since then, many companies have tried to build a better mouse trap, but the idea of a mouse trap has no competition.

It is definitely good for Bitcoin, and if done heavily enough, could force Fed policy to become unstable revealing flaws in the system (of which there are many, but can be smoothed out over time where no one notices). A big spend or any discussion of monetary policy or our massive debt would throw a wrench in the eternal plans of central banks to print money constantly and safely so as to not upset the balance.
It is my opinion that the central banks are positioning to try to get into a war - this happens when people need a distraction from the real problems at home to keep them in line - and well, if we print a lot more money we make the problem at home big enough to notice.

Right. Thanks for the info. Like I said the idea was vague, but wouldn't be a 'credit rating' system, it would be a ... PR system. A marketing scheme (so yeah, like a scam).
Because you need to open channels with someone to make a payment (or be connected to someone who through connections has a channel to this person), if I wanted to send a payment to someone in China, if I knew the local grocery store had strong 'roots', I would know connecting to them would likely give me a route to send the payment to this person in China.

THAT JUST LINKS TO PRODUCTHUNT!
Come on now. This makes it even **worse** if a company is willing to redirect from their website to a promotional website! This screams of illegitimacy!
Then in the "wayback machine" there's no contact information, no locality information, no idea where this company is from or what government they operate under. There's no information - it's just fully promotional which kind of seems funny because it's so bland that they decided to **link their entire website to a promotional page** to another domain about their app. It's that kind of bad.
Go to cash.app website and scroll down and you see a bunch of information that is pretty much standard these days. I can find the controlling company and a lot more about people who are responsible for that app.
Anyway, I'm done with it. I don't doubt it's an app that people can download or use but crypto is a world of trust and this doesn't show anything I can trust so I'm going to call it out so other people can be skeptical before they dive in. I wouldn't say a word if the basics were taken care of like other apps promoting themselves that I've seen here.

They do this in case of fraud. Bitcoin is not 'refundable' when it is sent.

If they don't and you kill them, you gain nothing (with Bitcoin directly). But with an open channel, maybe all their Bitcoin is tied up into the channel, who knows, but you know you can at *least* get what is in the channel, and preventing them from messing with that is more valuable that trying to interrogate someone for something you don't know if they have it or not.

Yeah but that's not Bitcoin's fault. That's the weak fiat's fault. People will find a place to store their value no matter what. Bitcoin just happens to be the place for that. But the downfall is on them and their monetary policy, not Bitcoin. Bitcoin kind of... accelerates things, but also makes it impossible for governments to regain control by issuing new fiat money. They'll have to back dollars with gold to actually get people back from a failed fiat dollar. The people have crypto now and if they're forced to use it they will.

Fun stuff to check out.
Here's one I found interesting:
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:51:23
In a natural disaster, USD/fiat cash becomes worthless too. Not really worth discussing. I'm not giving someone an MRE for $100 in an emergency if they're not critical to my survival and there's an unknown amount of time the emergency may last. Only if we know we're going to get out of said emergency would anyone make such a deal (their priceless food for paper fiat) and that's only if the paper fiat would still have value after the emergency.
The great thing about Bitcoin is any BTC you hold is recorded on potentially millions of computers around the world - so even if things fork and the world goes sideways, your value is still there, out there somewhere. If anyone is running a full node, it's there. So unless the entire world came to a grinding halt, you'd spend the time migrating to wherever you heard there was still Bitcoin being transacted with somewhere on the planet, and you'd have value there - what it is worth at that point is unknown, though.
Most kids can put together an electromagnet and concoct an electric generator - so we're never going to 'forget' electricity. Likewise, wires are not going to be forgotten either, so we can connect electronics. It might be hard to get new computers - but likely many will survive even the worst case scenarios as they're more durable than humans, to a degree. So you can be 100% certain that in the total worst case scenario, paper fiat will be completely worthless, but Bitcoin will still be out there operating somewhere as a technology - where nations have fallen and no one trusts the dollar that can be printed off by anyone with a printer, and where gold is too heavy and too risky to lug around and trade with - if we still have technology we'll likely still have Bitcoin more reliably than most other forms of currency simply by it being distributed. This becomes more likely the more Bitcoin is adopted, whereas centralized gold in heavy gold bars will likely be lost, forgotten and worthless in these drastic scenarios. Food, water, shelter, safety, and a currency that cannot be faked would be more likely to survive, even if that currency requires tech to run it.
Of course, all that is kind of fantasy right now, but I couldn't even say such a thing 5 years ago and have any amount of faith in saying it. It's like 1% now, which is enough for me - and again, the more adoption, the more likely Bitcoin is to survive where other options do not in worst-case scenarios.

acered24 is unaware and doesn't know it regarding PayPal. PayPal is not instant. All payment processing takes a lot of time. It just seems instant to the user, because PayPal is paid lots of fees to hide the time it takes to make the transfer from you. So you don't see how long the payment takes to actually confirm. You just get to spend your money.
Bitcoin reveals that yes, indeed there is a delay in sending money and you're so close to the technology that you see all the fees and delays and everything yourself. So it's a little hard to go from the world where everything is hidden from you, to the world of Bitcoin where nothing is hidden from you.
Technology is coming to help allow users of Bitcoin to transact faster, like Lightning which is the representation of a digital-cash transaction. So over time as new technology gets added on, it will get easier. There used to be a time, for example, when in order to pay with a credit card, the business had to make a physical imprint of your credit card to 'take payment'. No joke look it up. So they hide all that from you to make money 'easier to spend' and Bitcoin will gain those features over time.

Your claim is that Monero is fungible, and I can defeat that argument by saying your wallet containing Monero is worth less than someone else's wallet which contains the exact same amount of Monero, thus by association, making them "distinguishable" according to your logic on the matter. I could dig in and research it, but your definition, that something is fungible if it cannot be distinguished from another somehow, is not the correct use of the word. I'm sure I can open up a file which references 1 Monero, and it will have a different bit signature than another file which references 1 Monero, and as such, I can indeed distinguish them as being different. I could say any Monero which has this kind of bit-sequence is bad, and the others are good.
All that, of course, using your flawed perception of what the word means.
Monero is fungible just like every currency, as by definition, that's a property of currency, otherwise we're dealing in barter.

And yet we have access to practically infinite power from the sun. But don't let that infinite source of energy get in anyone's way of talking bad about Bitcoin power consumption!
Most mining machines have very little plastic in them, and as such can be produced with almost entirely renewable energy if it was desired or demanded.
Mining companies are tapping into solar, geothermal and other sources of renewable power because of the low cost. They will push the renewable-power market more than most anything we've seen. There will finally be a demand for 'clean power' not because it's clean but because it is cheap in comparison for their needs compared to the wall outlet.

Tether is a trojan horse for crypto. Any exchange accepting Tether is compromised. Anyone who trusts it, is trusting in a corporate-central-bank, with no government fiat behind it to take the hit when Tether fails. Just the corporation will die, and the nations funding it didn't have to inflate their own economy (disrupting their own economy) to do it.
They only inflate the Tether economy, only putting crypto users at risk, and only hurting crypto users when they eventually collapse Tether (on purpose).
Overall, we have to survive this (and we will) to have a long term future. So bring it on.

It might not be a straight comparison, true, but seeing these numbers together does give some interesting insights. Like the fact that Walt Disney is a huge worldwide megacorporation, and is *only* a few billion higher in market cap than Bitcoin's YATH. Seeing as Bitcoin has been around for 10 years and Disney has been around for ~95 years, it's an interesting view of things. Market cap doesn't mean shit, we know, but that's not the point here.
In addition, people look at Bitcoin's market cap and scoff because it's "so small" compared to everything else - but that's because everyone is comparing it to currencies and other figures like gold, not companies. So Bitcoin looks really small overall when you think about what it is - a currency. But in terms of valuation it's running alongside the best companies of the past 100 years right out of the gate. As such, you'd have to wonder - is this going to drop - less adoption is likely, or more adoption is likely? How many of those companies on that list did you not know of, or only know a tiny bit about what they 'do' as a business as a whole? That's after decades of business growth and market changes and so on, where Bitcoin has only thing to do to grow; adoption: convince people it's worthwhile to own. This seems like it will be getting easier over time, not harder.

You're saying the use case of Bitcoin is to replace gold, and I'm saying it's bigger than that, that's all. It will surpass gold. Wars were fought over trying to get other peoples' gold. People killed for gold. Necessarily Bitcoin means you cannot kill the person or else you'll never get the money. So there is a paradigm shift in currency where no longer can it be stolen, so the value becomes greater than gold, which is still risky in that someone can conquer your nation to obtain it.

That's kind of the point. The more users trust it, the harder it will hit when it is compromised. As I explained in my case against Tether post, there's no way they can prevent it from happening even if they wanted to be legitimate.
A central bank could print (unlimited money) - we'll go with $5 billion since Tether just flashed their hand to everyone to see how the public would react.
Again - we're assuming Tether is trying to be legit here - why are governments hating on Libra but not Tether when they're the same thing?:
Anyway, assuming Tether is legit:
Central bank prints (types into computer) $5 billion. Central bank buys $5 billion worth of Tether. Tether holds an extra $5 billion in reserves, due to the deposit. Central bank buys a bunch of Bitcoin using Tether. Central bank has governments shut down Tether. Tether is not allowed to pay out the funds due to government force.
Since the money the central banks made (entering numbers into their computer) came from nowhere, no bank actually lost anything. Since Tether holds the funds "in reserve" there was no release of money into the local economy, so there was no inflation (which is the only thing stopping central banks from printing tons of money). Since Tether collapses and not a bank, everyone just blames the crypto space for the problems and reputation is damaged.

That's not a wallet, that's an exchange where people buy/sell on the open market.
I was kind of referring to this part:


But I'm not sure of a mobile wallet to recommend. I made a poor point. The point I am trying to make is if the app/service requires info just find another. I know, not helpful.
You either can have a completely anonymous wallet that no one knows is linked to you, and put a password on it: by downloading Bitcoin Core and encrypting that wallet with a password and saving that wallet file in many backup locations.
Download an app onto your mobile phone which is about as anti-anonymous as you can get, and set up a wallet on an app and hope all your information isn't sent to every corner of the internet.
Someone else might be able to recommend a good mobile wallet but if you get a receiving address and backup a wallet file from the Bitcoin Core software you can delete the program and the wallet from your computer (you have backups, remember) and you can send Bitcoin to that address without it even being 'online' (it's all done with math, not your wallet actually being accessible). If you plan to spend often, then... you're not anonymous. So priorities are in order here.

Your nation's wealth is the labor of your people. This is represented in your national currency, and the value of the hard assets like gold that you might have.
Your gold can be stolen, and your currency can be stolen, and you can steal the labor of another nation's population by imposing a new currency they must use.
Bitcoin eliminates that. You cannot steal it from the nation that uses it. You cannot steal it from the people. You cannot force them to transact in your paper dollars when they have the option of Bitcoin. Everyone would seem to be working for free somehow and not utilizing the paper dollars. You'd have to rule by fear alone and that hasn't worked for a long time and is a fleeting goal.
The only threat is like others mentioned. With sound currency like gold, your nation becomes ripe for invasion if the invading government can install their own central bank and force your people to use it. If the people use Bitcoin, however, you might be invaded (very likely), but the people can't be forced into using the newly installed central bank currency. So there is no incentive anymore to invade and conquer. This is a new era of humanity.

It's been shown there's maybe 12% of the people who are long term hodlers and that includes "lost" Bitcoin. There's another 30% or so who do hold long term but still active.


This is what dumb people say, thankfully. The past performance of the internet guarantees results. We knew when we had DSL internet speeds that Gigabit speeds were possible, we just needed to get there. Bitcoin is the same way. We know the future, we just have to get there. Same with anything really. Bitcoin isn't a company, it's a technology, like the internet. It's a human-achievement-unlocked, not a business that has room to fail if they mishandle their PR.


You're right. That's why it's best to buy this future currency at the current discount. This is how every single stock or thing of value works in the history of all time. Amazon was $1.50 at IPO and is now $2000 per stock. As such, if you bought in when Amazon was $5, you are profiting from the person who buys your stock at $2000 today, and they will likely never have the success you had.
Take a step back and look around a bit more.

I mean, this is provably false just with a simple history lesson.
When Spain sent Christopher Columbus to discover India, sending 3 very expensive ships to the edge of the world was not intended to generate a return. In fact, everyone who participated in that venture died long before the realization of the value of what was actually found. People make crazy investments no matter what. Remember, they were on the gold coin standard back then. There was no printing of money back then. Investments still happen without inflation! Nearly all of history occurred without central banks, without artificial inflation. No investments happened during those thousands of years? Come on.


This is not correct either. Seriously, where are you learning this stuff from? Investing is done with the hopes that it generates a return, but if you're held to only wanting to invest in something because you think it will generate a return, rather than investing in something simply because you need to put your money somewhere else besides a checking account, you will take the time to qualify your investments. Some investments pay off, but many do not. Not all investments yield a return and no one who invests thinks 100% of their investments will yield a return and no investor has a 100% success ratio.
The increased difficulty in getting a return on your investment is directly proportional to how little you need to invest to survive because the economy uses a fixed supply currency. With people qualifying their investments, good ideas become stronger, and weak ideas don't even get funded. You are not as required to invest in a deflationary economy, whereas with an inflationary economy, you must invest or else you will struggle forever. Take your pick.


This... has no bearing on anything. What do those "billions" pay for?
Think about it for a minute.
Why does it cost billions?
Because you have to pay people for their labor! So they can live and eat and have a life!


Noooooo lol damn the banks have their hooks into you. In a fixed money supply economy, people will still value things that are valuable, and will still flock to purchase your good products.
What makes you think that if the government inflates the currency supply, that doing so somehow makes it possible for a medical-advance company to make a return on their investment? How does printing more money make an idea profitable, where it would not have been profitable if we didn't just print a bunch of money? The only answer to that is if the government picks and chooses who to support, and who to let fail. Who to give the printed money to, and who to not give it to.
Inflation has one benefit - stealing from otherwise 'useless' people. But in doing so you also steal from everyone and force them into virtual slaves. It's not worth it. Much more success will come in the future with people trading on a fixed amount of currency without manipulation. We have almost no period in history to compare this to.
The growth and success of the modern age was indeed fueled by inflation and the theft of future labor. And with it, all the great wars and tragedies and mass-murder came along for the ride. They go hand in hand. You cannot say the path we took was the best path without agreeing to all the wars and deaths that the central banking system has required to achieve global dominance.

Can I also hold watchtowers at gunpoint or take over their node, knowing they are handling the sending of the justice transaction for the person I am trying to steal from? Everything I'm seeing points to "yes".
I.E. Can we physically compromise this system. I'm not seeing answers saying this isn't possible.
The only hope is a fully distributed model where all watchtowers check all transactions, which seems like the right direction at least.

I've come to a recent conclusion. This is not a weakness. It is a feature of all currency. If I can obtain over 51% of the power in a nation, I can control it's money. In other words, the 51% 'weakness' is a natural law of currency. If 10 people all decide to use Token1 for transactions, if 6 of those people later decide to use Token2 for transactions and think Token1 is trash, then Token1 becomes obsolete. Bitcoin is the first mathematical proof of this system as inherent to currency. It's a feature, not a bug. The quote, "Give me the power to print a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws," is testament to this - the power to print a nation's money requires over 51% of the power to print the money. Necessarily if you could only print 10% of the nation's money, you would not have control, and the 9 other currencies which made the remaining 90% could always conspire to shut you out until there was only one which held all the power. After all, once you have 51%, you have nearly 100%.

Also Peter is a little on edge about the seed words. If you use 24 seed words and secure your seed words with a complex but easy to remember passphrase and leave your seed words in the open, you increase your chances of someone guessing your key by a trillion trillion trillion times, but it's still secure due to your unknown passphrase where guessing your 25th word is as hard as cracking your email password (well... easier because someone can do it offline, so use a long passphrase).
My point being it's not that critical - it's more critical that you have copies than it is to have engravings. If you feel your seed words have been compromised, just... make a new wallet! And send your funds to the new wallet. With a good enough, never-written-down passphrase you could hand out your seed to everyone walking down the streets of New York and be secure in your funds. So if you ever feel it is compromised then make a new wallet, new seed words, new passphrase, and continue on. It's not that big a deal honestly as long as your passphrase isn't 'p

Gold had a few hundred, maybe thousand years of volatility. Not sure your point. Is your argument that being volatile is bad?


This is no different than gold. I would not give you a single satoshi for any amount of gold. You think gold has value, I do not. Value is completely subjective, and if people thought gold was any good today, its market cap would be much higher considering its history.


The best, most useful currency, has nothing backing it, and no other use. Even gold has utility. The dollar can be burned for warmth. Bitcoin only exists as a value between two parties. It is currency in pure-information form.
When you use fiat, keep in mind that the term is not the same. The word fiat means "by decree" not "has no backing". These are completely different. Gold has no backing, people value it just because. Fiat is money a government said you must accept under threat of force. That is, it only has value because someone else said you have to value it, *or else you'll go to jail.* As such, fiat money is backed with threat of violence. I think that's the best way to discuss it.
Gold, and Bitcoin, are not backed by a damn thing. Gold is a rare element, created by the universe. Bitcoin is a rare math problem, created by humans. Both have value, but which one is gaining value, and which one is losing value? We'll see. Like you said, Bitcoin has only been around for 10 years and is worth $11k today, where gold has been around for 5000+ years and is only worth $1400 per 'coin' today and dropping. Even at its worst in the past few years, Bitcoin has been better than gold in terms of representing value where two people can exchange a currency .

Since they told you to create a wallet or that they give you a wallet it's a scam.

No it's like saying: "Remember when the internet was only worth the same as a bunch of companies that have been around for 100 years? And now it's worth so much we can't even consider its value where it's basically priceless."
The internet is not a currency, but Bitcoin is, so we have the unique position to comment on it as both a technology and a currency. And with no products to sell, no inventory to keep and no wires needing to be run across the ocean floors, Bitcoin has a lot going for it as a technology.
If 30% of coins are not accessible, Bitcoin price will be higher over time, countering your idea of the market cap being less somehow. Market cap is just a "huh that's interesting" metric, not something to get technical about.

Same as Bitcoin; except its use is a store of value AND a useful currency.
Gold for example had this exact same situation. It was worth a lot, and as populations grew, people spent less and less gold to get what they want. Gold coins were literally cut into 8 pieces to handle smaller denominations - there wasn't enough gold for everyone. It was both a currency and a store of value, and it grew so valuable that it killed itself off because it could not be divided into 1/100ths for example. Bitcoin does not have this problem. It is a currency and a store of value that can be used at any denomination.

Costs will change - how? The answer is more people will come to do the work. This actually drives down prices and makes everything cheaper-per-unit-of-account. So over time things drop in price at the rate of population growth.
The only inflation in a Bitcoin economy is the increase in labor due to more humans being around to do that labor. It's a pure system. Again, this increase in labor, this inflation in labor, doesn't devalue labor, it only produces more labor, adding value to the economy, driving down prices due to more people to perform the labor and more efficiency leading directly to price reductions.

Definitely some trust involved no matter what you do. The difference being you can with a software wallet perform everything offline on a sterile computer and encrypt and back up your wallet and save it wherever you want, so even if someone compromised the software, they'd still never know your keys, due to no communication method to reveal them, which you could argue they could have used programmatically created addresses, but that's bypassed with passphrases and so on. At the end of the day if there is no communication you are safer in that regard. I feel software is stronger long term because with no communication, it's up to pure guessing (which is why the idea of paper wallet is there - no communication with any tech). You do either have to trust the code or learn the code - I don't think the code is that hard to understand and you can verify results quite easily to eliminate internal manipulation.
I really like the photo-as-keys option to be honest. It's kind of funny that it is, in a way, less secure than randomly selecting the words, but some of the security/trust with private keys is knowing you will never forget them either.

Wallets are just files. You can split all your holdings into 50 different wallets with 50 different encryption passwords, store them all together on 50 different hard drives in 50 different locations. Your only concern at that point is if someone can break encryption or guess your password. Breaking encryption is... unlikely obviously. Guessing your password is more likely, but still unlikely if you do it right.
You could leave those wallets out in the open, too.
The wallet is a key to your Bitcoin, but your mind is the key to your wallet. It is the most important thing to safeguard.

Yeah transaction capacity is a concern but it's scaling at the right rate for the rate of adoption. I think new technology is going to solve that problem, where "newer" currencies often give up one feature of Bitcoin to obtain 'speed' thereby making it an inferior currency.
Think of the internet. We have dial-up. Is the answer to string more wires between houses, or to develop better technology to facilitate higher speeds?
If we did the "altcoin" way, we'd have strung 100 wires between every house, because it's the caveman approach to a problem. "Well if we get 56kbps with one line, if we have 10 lines, just imagine the speed!"
There simply needs to be one wire by which we communicate and all we need to do is get better at how to send communications over that wire. As such we went to cable internet and fiber. The addition of 'more' is never a fix for traffic. For example, adding more lanes to a highway is always a temporary solution - population continues to increase and then you need more lanes again. It's better to put the time and energy into developing other forms of technology, but people want that fix now and make the caveman decision to build more lanes.
Lightning as well handles the necessary faster transactions. I was not too mindful of lightning for a long time. But after some discussion I realize it is the digital equivalent of a cash transaction. It's really good and the kind of technology that will come with adoption. Apple was formed as a company in 1976 and their first iPhone came out 31 years later in 2007. And 12 years later today it is a quality device doing amazing things like other smartphones. In other words, technology will improve and we have to trust in that fact of humans - that we will improve technology. Bitcoin is 10 years old, and is a new technology like the internet (which was invented in the 60's?). So we've got time, lots of time, to solve problems.
So, the transaction capacity I would say is not a flaw, it's a hurdle to overcome if we need it. A flaw would be something that cannot be changed or improved and that something else does better by some other means. As I see it, the function as digital gold makes the transaction volume per-block reasonable. And considering payment processors only settle transactions once per day, they hide a lot of the time it actually takes behind the scenes of the customer so the customer thinks things are fast when in reality, a business accepting Visa doesn't see the money in their bank account until 24-48 hours later, where Bitcoin is 10-60 minutes.

Personally I buy and sell to a friend 100000000 times per second for 0.00000001 off the market value (so when Bitcoin market value is $10,000.00 we trade back and forth 10000000000 times per second for 10,000.00000001 or less). When you divide the value from any transaction to the price you 'purchased it at' at any moment we neither gained nor lost any value, yet the value still matches the market value. It's quite genius learn this trick yourself and save yourself a headache of paying taxes.
Friend buys Bitcoin at 10,000.
Buy from your friend at 10,000.00000001
Immediately sell back to him at 10,000.00000002
Then you do the calculamations he now gained value but it's only 10,000 on the books still.
If you do this fast enough like a trillion times per second matching the market value then you never profit when you sell.
For example say the market goes to 10,001. Now you buy a sell to each other up to match that price doing 100 million trades between you two and each one on the books is a net-zero gain in value so it's cool.

You definitely have been using too much marijuana.
To answer your question; the halving date is not set it stone, it's an estimate, but around that time. It's mathematically predetermined to happen around that time, due to the way Bitcoin was designed. If there's a huge spike in mining power and blocks complete faster, we get an earlier date. If miners drop out of the system and blocks complete a little slower, we get a later date.
It should be within a few days though unless something weird happens.
If it happens sooner that is good news for Bitcoin. Later is not as good news.

You trust the company. That's the main downside. If they put in some backdoor, it would be difficult for the average user to know until their next transfer 'accidentally' sends Bitcoin to the 'wrong address'.
A low threat, but 'possible'. You still have to go through the same backup procedure writing down your seed words and saving them in multiple locations and safeguarding those seed words - the same as saving a software wallet file - the benefit for hardware wallets is your keys aren't visible directly to your computer when sending/signing a transaction.
The hardware wallet makes it much easier to send Bitcoin, not receive it. It makes it so you know even if your computer has a bunch of viruses, they're not going to have access to your private keys, because those keys are stored on your hardware wallet device, and messages are signed by being sent to the device, signed, and then back to the software for transmission to the network.
It is easier to pay with a mobile wallet and that kind of thing yes. If you plan to hold long term, but want the option to spend and not worry about the security of your system, a hardware wallet is good. If you plan to hold long term forever, a software wallet that you make backups of in many locations is just fine (knowing you will create a secure environment when you finally do send them to a spending address etc). You can have many of each, too. So you can store bulk amounts on your hardware wallet address, and send spending amounts from there to your mobile wallet as needed. Or you can create a software wallet like this and email it to your mom:

It's more a long term thing. Where once you get 51% you begin receiving 51% of the mined Bitcoins. So with leverage you can continue buying more mining and outscale anyone else, slowly growing, 55%, 60%, 75% and so on. So at the end of the day you are the sole receiver of the value of the transaction network.
This is the same as any money supply; if you can print just 51% you can print it all. If people trust your money 51% you can buy out everyone who disagrees.
It's an interesting thing to consider. It is to me natural to currency in general, as I stated in the basic example of 10 people who agree on 10 tokens and 6 of them going elsewhere. Naturally the 6 will reproduce and have a larger population in the long run, and will be able to invade and kill off the 4. At scale this is pretty close to reality.
I don't think Bitcoin can ever hit 51% existing to one entity. I think the natural world, there is natural balance to this. Gold once was amazing for this but gold failed because it could not be divided into 100ths and 1000ths and 10000ths and so on. Bitcoin can just as effectively transmit 1 BTC as it can 1 satoshi.
And like you said, the 51% doesn't do much in the long run, especially if they try to rewrite the chain and everyone decides not to deal with that miner anymore. The great part about Bitcoin is unlike an entrenched government, we can 'kick out' anyone who becomes 51%. It is not a vulnerability, it is a feature.

$1 mil in BTC could turn into $300k too.
I'd take BTC, because no matter the fiat comparative value, I have something that no one can take away from me, not even through inflation.
If you had $1 mil in a bank account, it can be seized. If you have stocks, it can be seized. If you have any fiat anywhere, it can be taken from you. If you put your faith in fiat, the government could inflate the money supply and you lose all the value.

I am trying to get you to give up this idea. Inflation is someone printing more money, period. That's it. DO YOU TRUST ME, TO PRINT MONEY FOR YOU? We humans cannot trust ANYONE to print money for us. This is the reason why inflation adjusted crypto cannot exist (and work). Someone will always abuse this system! Bitcoin puts mathematical constraints on humans to prevent us from printing more. It forces us into discipline. We cannot cheat the system at all, even if we wanted to. That's the power of it.
An inflation adjusted crypto sounds nice. We can tie it to human lives. 1 human born, we add 50,000 tokens into the world. 1 human dies, we remove 50,000 tokens into the world. Except again, we cannot trust that at some point, someone won't "fake" 100 humans were born and send themselves 5M tokens.
Even if we could trust it for 10 years, 20 years, at some point, someone will be greedy and create more.
Bitcoin puts handcuffs on us and makes us incapable of that theft.


Investing is human nature. Investing is only incentivized more in an inflationary currency because *someone is stealing from you and you can't do anything about it* so your only option is to try and steal from someone else too.
Again, I think you're using "deflation" wrong. Bitcoin doesn't deflate. It stays constant. All that goes up is value - more people - more human labor. Gold, land and homes appreciate in value with a fixed currency. They do not lose value. They might lose nominal value - meaning the number-of-tokens-to-buy-1-unit-of-gold-is-now-less but that is only at the rate of population increase. Normal price fluctuations due to supply and demand are still in effect. We can still have wild swings. A new iPhone can still grab a lot of the market and have everyone rushing to buy it.


You seemed to calculate a scenario that is reasonable with both methods; "affordable" is a subjective term. The good part about a fixed currency economy is it is much easier to *save up* enough money for a bigger down payment. 30 year mortgages *won't be necessary* because it's so much easier to save money. We cannot assume that financial instruments will stay the same. It will be very easy to save up over time and buy a house. That part is the affordable part. Each BTC you store away for your home grows in value over time until you can buy. There is no downside to this.
Let's say you are wanting to buy that 20 BTC house. You save up 5 BTC in 5 years. Now the house costs 18.078 BTC. Do your loan calculations on that with a 5 BTC down payment and let me know.

I laugh every time someone says something like, as it only reveals how ignorant that person is in not understanding how easy it is to set up a new account on Reddit, and they think a little tag on an account invalidates an opinion.
Tether compromises exchanges, as Tether can 'mint' as much Tether as it wants at any time and manipulate the exchange. The only thing stopping that is 'trust'. I've posted more 'advice' about how bad Tether is for exchanges and crypto - if you want a link I can find it for you or you can search my post history for it.
Any stablecoin that is not an exchange-based coin (for their own internal transactions, and even then) is a risk to crypto. It would allow a government to buy up vast amounts of digital assets without compromising their own fiat money. If Tether crashes, it would not affect the national economy of any nation; it would only wipe out the crypto users who used it, and harm the other crypto-assets in terms of trust. Tether is set up as a trojan horse to damage the crypto space, and the "ACCIDENTAL MINTING" of $5 billion shows this is possible.

Usually a government gets away with hyperinflation. The people suffer but the government continues printing until people succumb - because they never had a choice. Slashing zeroes off the amount of money.
With Bitcoin, governments are going to have a much harder time regaining control, because any "new printed money" with a few zeros cut off is still hyperinflated when the people have another option - Bitcoin. So unlike before when you could just continue printing until the people just gave up, it's much harder. Maybe it will just take a few different cycles of printing, or maybe it won't work at all and the continual hyperinflation no matter what is printed will cause some never before seen result.

It could apply with any exchange is the idea, so if you want price to go up, don't let any exchange think you will never withdraw your Bitcoin - always withdraw and keep transactions moving so if they are corrupt, they fail sooner than later, and you won't be affected as much since most all your coins will be off their exchange.

Exactly my friend. You're getting it now. My point is since the word is subjective you have to inject meaning into what the person means when they use the word.
Bitcoin was undervalued at 18k.
This could mean a million different things. Here's 3 examples:
1. "Bitcoin was undervalued at 18k *because I bought at 18k and sold shortly after at 19k and made a profit.*"
2. "Bitcoin was undervalued at 18k *because I believe in a few years it will be worth twice that.*"
3. "Bitcoin was undervalued at 18k *because a time traveler told me so.*"
When you add in additional qualifiers you refine the idea down to more definitive terms:


Then, "Bitcoin at 18k was overvalued when comparing it to what the market did shortly after," is accurate with that qualifier in hindsight after a duration. But still, just subjective.
Your best argument against this claim is, "No, Bitcoin was exactly valued at 18k when it was at 18k." Time being the component to all this. That's why you have to inject your own perception of time into the default statement: "Bitcoin was undervalued at 18k."

You run this node in your house perhaps? So again, we can just find out where your node channel is, and where your watchtower is, and cut off internet connection to achieve my favorable state.
This doesn't 'fix' the problem, it just kicks the can down the road on the problem.


Sure there is - beyond blocking my transaction from reaching the wider node network, there is no incentive for someone to intercept my transaction. They can get nothing from it.
However, intercepting transactions, or broadcasts of states, from lightning has an incentive to at least one of the parties in a channel. If they use a watchtower, we can compromise the watchtower, or isolate it if they run their own.


That's what I meant, channels. In other words, every watchtower watches all channel states. It's a self-defeating system that lends to organized crime in the long run. Since no theft will occur, the incentive to run a watchtower becomes low, and then someone moves in and becomes the one organization running all the watchtowers, and then can collude with any party who wishes to be a thief to shut out any channel they want.

Iran's best move - and worst move - would be to fully adopt Bitcoin as a national currency.
It would be the best move because no one in their country would use other currency internally after some time and they'd be a crypto-powerhouse in the financial world in the near future. An entire population existing on sound digital currency supported by a worldwide infrastructure.
It would be the worst move because they would be invaded as soon as central banks could come up with some scheme to 'convince' everyone to invade Iran. Iran's leadership would lose everything including their lives and a new government would be installed.
In the end if the people adopted crypto fast enough, there would be no way to tax these people, no way to capitalize on the invasion, especially if the regime told their people that they are giving up fiat power and restoring it to the people, and that they should never trust a central bank again. When the invasion is 'done' and the new central bank is installed... no one uses it even when threatened by death.
It's a long shot either way. I feel some government will make the call at some point and get out of the power-grab game once and for all.

You need to learn how money is made. If you have a willingness to learn I can point you towards some resources to wrap your head around this.
We can easily think of it like this: when you take out a loan, where does the money come from?
The bank gives you $100,000 for your new house... but how?
Well, they ask the central bank for $100,000 is how. They don't keep it in their vault. And you don't get 'cash' you just get a bigger number in your account - if even that - because often you just get the money through ecrow and closing agents and so on and just 'get your house' and now you owe the bank $100k plus interest.
The bank gets the money for all that from the central bank. The central bank just types in a number and sends it over to the bank to then give to you.
That's it.
There's no other moving parts to consider. There's no money the central bank is risking by giving money to the bank, and the bank itself holds a fractional reserve of ~10% or less of the actual loan. Money is created out of thin air by your promise to pay it back with interest.
Of course, it doesn't look to you like 6% is being printed every time you earn $1000 but that's reality. Earn not spend. Over the past 100 years the USD has lost 98% of its value, and more than that considering we've become more efficient at production over time. The 6% comes in big chunks when someone takes a loan out for a house, or for their new business, or whatever they take a loan out from. They inject cheap money into the market. Everyone has a bunch more money now where it did not used to exist.
And the banks determine who gets this, so if you're a hard working guy near the bottom you don't benefit from this at all.
The central banks print for themselves $2 or so from every $100 you make. They don't spend it right away, but they take it and put it into their accounts to pay themselves for the honor of printing your money.
Now you're right, my analogy of every time you make $100, $6 is printed for the banks, is a bit of a stretch. Obviously it's not that immediate and doesn't occur on each transaction. But it does occur in that kind of fashion through loans and so on as aggregate over time. Over time, they steal the value, by printing more and more. When I say "make" I mean, for every $100 of value you create in the economy, they print $6. I wrote the original statement because it's a shocker and no one can believe it. The reality is much more boring. If you create value, they take a cut.
Bitcoin is the first thing in history that cannot have more made of it. Now... if you have an open mind... can you think of anything that there's not going to be more of? Gold? Mine it from the ground, or an asteroid - lots of gold in the universe. Paper dollars? Lots of those printed. Marbles? Nah easy to copy and make lots of marbles. I doubt you could think of one thing that is truly finite in number. Nothing like it exists because it's only a digital possibility. A limit only exists in math. And that's what Bitcoin is - a math-limited finite money. We've never had it before as humans. It boggles your mind when you think how can math hold value and so on. I encourage you to research more and think about it with an open mind and see if it really is a 'thing' or if you consider it 'hogwash' after you learn more. Watch these two videos - they're neutral and unbiased and just present some information. If it sounds like a good idea, go further from there.

@_date: 2019-07-08 00:06:18
Here's a better explanation: 
Another example: If I order 100 barrels of crude oil at $100/barrel, and a day later my vendor comes to me and says, "Here you go, 100 barrels of oil."
I look at the price/barrel of oil and it's $50/barrel now. Oh shit, I'm losing out buying today! I can't just tell the person, "That's 100 barrels of oil, but that's not 100 barrels of oil *from Texas* - that oil is from Mexico! No deal!" He could sue me, and I'd stand in front of the judge and say, "But it wasn't *oil from Texas,*" and without the idea of things being fungible, the judge might rule in my favor, making this vendor lose out on his end of the deal.
To facilitate trade, fungibility is when we consider something is the same because of what it is, and we don't allow for people to cancel deals because it wasn't the *right type* of this exact same thing I ordered. Currency and most commodities have this property.
Again, mainly a legal thing. For example, is a fresh, crisp, brand new $100 bill worth more to you than a dirty, ripped, 1997 $100 bill? Sure. But legally, you have to take both as if they are equal. As such, they are fungible - the currency is fungible. You can't not accept the dirty dollar as worth less than the crisp new one "just because" in a trade deal.
If we had a system where you could inspect a dollar bill and assign your own valuation to it based on characteristics you preferred, it would cease to become fungible. Instead, the idea is that in order to make the economy not grind to a halt while everyone inspects every dollar for its pristine value, we decide it is fungible, and $1 = $1.

I find if I can convey information clearly I better my own understanding as to why I value Bitcoin. I'm always analyzing my comments to see if I possess any doubt or notice anything out of place that might change my position. To date, nothing has made me waiver, and has only made me strengthen my understanding. But I'm not going to be blind to reality and dismiss someone's concerns without giving it a thorough once over, so I'll respond with big blocks of text to people who trigger my desire to review information. It is... selfish.
I'm going to remain open to new ideas and I admit there might possibly be a better currency in the future - that same possibility so far is about as possible as me guessing your private key though. So um, "there's a chance."
There's two other things; one is the person could actually benefit. If they benefit, I benefit, because currencies getting adopted is good. Next, there's the new person scrolling through and sees a serious doubt from someone, and then reads my response and gets to make up their own mind - this is the majority case. You almost never speak to the person you're typing to, it's always the 100 other people coming by who actually get value from the information. So if they benefit, I benefit.
As such the more negative comments I can defeat is another dollar in my pocket, so to speak. Again, quite selfish.

You can run the mining software from your CPU, but it's much less effective than specialized hardware, so no one does it anymore. But it's possible. Just look up the Bitcoin Core software. There's some command-line options for running this, and I'm fairly certain you can still attempt CPU mining in those commands. So a user would have to run that software with the right commands and point to a pool and use your pool address as the receiver for the work. Again, not sure exactly what is possible here, just giving you an idea.
You'd join a pool, set up an account and receiving address, and add on your supporters as workers under your account. You'd get credit for their work.
Keep in mind, you'd need a ton of supporters to make this more worthwhile than just buying a $300 13TH/S (computers are in GHz right? so 13,000,000,000,000 focused cycles per second, versus a 3,000,000,000 calculations per second computer, you need ~4000 supporters running 24/7 to achieve a cost-value comparable to an ASIC miner which generates like $2 of BTC per day.

If you do the logical thinking, there's no reason to inflate the money supply if the money you're using is divisible enough. If you could be certain that gold, for example, would never inflate beyond what was mined out of the ground, we'd probably still be on gold, if we could divide each ounce up into 7 billion parts. We cannot do that with gold, and gold inflates indirectly; gold needs banks to secure it, because gold is easily stolen, and then banks decided to abuse that and make loans with gold they didn't have, and so on and so forth until we have the paper fiat dollar we have today.
Humans are always screwing up 'sound currency'.
In other words, we never, ever, in all history, had a currency that did not inflate (by purpose or design). Until now. So now we have the option and we will choose the currency which stores our value the best, which happens to be Bitcoin.
There is no reason for an inflationary currency except for those who print that money to steal from the future workers. We've never had the option for a non-inflationary currency until Bitcoin.

Value your labor in finding it. No one else found it. You did. Value is subjective, so knowing what other gold nuggets sell for you might value it similarly. This is not to say the effort you exerted was worth the full price of the gold nugget; the value is the representation of the effort it takes in an economy to bring many of those gold nuggets to market. As such, even though your individual labor was low, the value is still high, because on average the effort to bring a gold nugget to market is much higher.
Think about it; since you found it easily, you're more willing to part with it for a lower price, are you not? If you worked your ass off to get that nugget out of the ground, you'll be a hard-sell for the best price you can get.

Get an adult to do transacting for you. Give them cash, they get Bitcoin, they send Bitcoin to your wallet address that you and only you have the information for how to get it.
Outside that, there are some sites like localbitcoins and some other means (asking around, posting on local forums, and so on) to get local people to deal with you and buy/sell direct. There's also some Bitcoin ATMs depending on your location.
You could also become an emancipated minor, and legally become an adult, and then just send all these companies your paperwork showing them you're an adult and have to treat you as one; quite the process though.

I explained elsewhere, this isn't possible with Bitcoin. My transaction could be prevented from being sent, but in no way can someone steal from me without gaining access to my keys, which killing me completely prevents them from ever getting my keys and thus my Bitcoin, while with an open channel, killing me is the best way to ensure they do get my Bitcoin. At the very least, if the channel was open from my phone, they could steal my phone and force transactions. Which is of course possible with a mobile wallet with Bitcoin, however that small amount is not what I'm interested in discussing. It's the fact that large channels can remain open for years and at any given time one party is incentivized to close the channel in their own favor.


Again not true. You can stop my transaction from being sent out, but you're not incentivized to do so, and intercepting it doesn't get you anything. If after a few hours I see no confirmations I know something went wrong and I can try again, etc. This does of course lead to a situation where if you're watching this person that you've isolated, you can observe when they have full access to their keys and are signing a message to transmit, and ambush at that moment, but if in that moment their keys are no longer accessible, nothing is gained. Still, a slight physical threat any time you are accessing your keys. But for example if you used a hardware wallet and immediately closed it, unless the person also observed your pin, there's no threat to your life, and if they observed your pin, there's no real incentive to kill you since they immediately own all your Bitcoin anyway.
There is incentive to stop a person from communicating if you are trying to close a lightning channel in your own favor against someone else. Your best option for securing their funds is to prevent the other person from communicating, up to and including killing the other person. With Bitcoin, if you got my keys, you have the funds, and you are not incentivized to go further than that, to prevent me from communicating (outside of the natural prevention of the crime being reported which exists in all cases).
It's kind of like the bank robber who enters a bank. They are heavily incentivized to not let anyone push a panic button. The best way to do this is to prevent a person from pressing the panic button, or cutting off the panic button's communication with the outside world. Bitcoin is like the bank manager - if he dies you're not going to get into the vault, whereas lightning is the teller - the bank robber's best option at preventing communication to the outside world (outside of controlling the alarm company) is shooting the teller at the very start to make sure no communication is made.
If the bank robber first owns the alarm company, they care not what buttons are pressed.
Anyway, I've had enough of the thought experiment, thanks for indulging. I think lightning is fine, I just see watchtowers devolving into organized crime in the long run based on these thoughts. Simply because there is a way to do it by just owning all the watchtowers (just like if you owned all the alarm companies servicing all the banks, you could just not respond to an alarm).
I think the best option for lightning is honestly just to not have watchtowers. Just trust the channel. This will force you to keep small channels and the trust is not with any third party ever. If someone closes a channel on you, you're responsible for sending the justice transaction if they were trying to steal from you, and you never deal with that person again. If channels are opened and closed more frequently, and are worth much less in value compared to everything else (i.e. you don't have a 1 BTC channel sitting there for 10 years gaining value massively), then the incentive is personal management and channels opened and closed infrequently but regularly to maintain trust.

That's because you're above the slave line. People who have no idea how money works, who work regular jobs and make a regular income and pay off their house in 30 years are the slaves. These are the people who will live their life and die with not much to show for it. The people above this level, who are investing and so on, are no longer slaves. They're beating out inflation.
It's not really a bad thing, it's just a reality thing, how inflation works.


Because they won't have to invest as much. That's the takeaway. You're assuming investment at the same rate is required.


Well, that's not the point. I don't think rich people are bad, not at all. But the system the central bankers - the ultra-rich - have created is definitely bad. There's a big difference. The richest person in the world is poor compared to the central bankers.
Most of what I am talking about is from a logical point of view, not emotional. It is factual that inflation steals from the future labor pool - I am not saying that as an emotional topic. It's just fact.
Ok to your Opportunities!
Why do you think you "earn 43.36 BTC over 100 years"?
If you do not spend that 100 BTC, you will still have 100 BTC. Your buying power is as if you had 143.36 BTC, but you still only have 100 BTC after 100 years.
Maybe you mean keep your initial 100 BTC and work a job every year making 1 BTC per year. Yeah after 100 years you would have 143.36 I think I understand. If you invest, much higher!
If you have a 100 tenant complex, and they're paying 0.25 BTC per year to live there, and you lower prices 2% per year, you earn 25 BTC the first year. I think you messed up the calculation? 25% of 1 BTC is 0.25. 100 tenants = 0.25 * 100 = 25 BTC first year.
- Year 1: 25 BTC
- Year 2: 24.8 BTC
- Year 3: 24.01 BTC
- Year 4: 23.53 BTC
- Year 5: 23.06 BTC
You are already making a profit after 5 years with your assumptions.
Assume it cost 800 BTC (8 BTC / unit) for this investment ($8.8 million complex for 100 people is more like it) and assume operating costs are 20 BTC per year ($200,000). Your rent to tenants is 25% of average pay, so say 0.1 BTC per month if people make 4 BTC ($45k) per year. 100 tenants at 1.2 BTC ($12k) per year is 120 BTC per year. Pay 20 per year for operating costs. Your return happens after ~10 years.
Investment is not disincentivized. There's no real difference between a fixed currency economy and an inflation one in terms of what is a good investment. The only difference is people don't have to struggle. If someone saves up 10 BTC they can pay rent for years and years considering prices keep going lower.
Most apartment complexes today have a return on investment of 10 years. Meaning, someone who invests in an apartment complex today expects their investment to start generating revenue in 10 years. It's a very good business to be in. Anyone who buys a home to rent it out as a rental unit also tries to get a return on their investment in 10 years. This is very common. If you buy a house for $100,000 today, you try to rent it out for like $900/mo. 900 * 12 months = 10800/year minus taxes and so on ~10 years and then you're making mostly profit.
This doesn't change just because the banks stop printing money.

You're right. If I were talking technicals I would mention that it's a bit faster, but the idea that it is relatively constant is the point. Even if the entire network doubled in power tomorrow, it's only 1 block per 5 minutes until difficulty is changed - so small changes are within the margin of error for a reddit post. The "a lot" is definitely relative and I would add, quite small, at 9.6m per block only a 4% "more" over a day than the target 10m. I wouldn't call that a lot more mined, and that rate over time again is pretty constant.

Yeah, this is good but people don't care as much about their wallet as much as their money. The term wallet is misused for Bitcoin for example. It's confusing to people. They think of a wallet as a thing they put in their back pocket. If you explain to someone "this is like your wallet" it doesn't convey much information. If you take the next step and explain how a lightning transaction is exactly like a real life cash transaction, people will 'get it'.


Thus, there is no limit. There's a difference between "a limit" and "no limit" and when you say "there's a limit except people can bypass that limit if they want" then... there is no limit. No limit == "can willingly create channels beyond that limit of both agree". The how, or why, or situation, is context for that. If I want to send $5000 worth of Bitcoin over lightning to my friend a few thousand miles away to buy his car, great, deal gets done, awesome. I can exceed the "limit" so there's no limit, it's just a ceiling. My concern has been acknowledging that if either me or my friend leave that channel open for a few years now that channel is worth $50,000, or $100,000, and now there's an added incentive to commit crime to steal the amount, that came only from time passing and nothing else. The limit/ceiling is irrelevant; Bitcoin will grow in value indefinitely and it adds an incentive for crime, over time, that was small at the start. Over time, the incentive to commit crime on an open channel grows regardless of what the users do, and if you're paying close attention to Lightning you should accept this and consider it when discussing LN. Saying, "No one would be so dumb as to let their channel sit as the value grows," or, "Surely no one would even try because of the low chance," is not forward thinking, and you won't consider ways to reduce that real threat.
Regarding "limits": what you should be saying is "there is an artificial 167 mBTC ceiling imposed for normal channel creation that can be bypassed if both users agree upon it." Big differences in conveying information.


I agree, because - a Lightning transaction is the digital representation of a cash transaction.
You'll get perfect responses from people when you explain a lightning transaction as I have described. If you know anyone who is not fully on board yet give it a shot.

5% per year is too wild a figure to really make sense with. 1% is more likely.
Deflation is the reduction in prices, or the reduction in money supply (or both), right? We know Bitcoin can't really have a reduction in money supply, so we can only do a reduction in prices, right?
Where last year, a month of someone's labor cost 0.15 BTC but now it only costs 0.1485 BTC per month the next year. The 0.1485, in the same timeframe, gained 1% buying power too, did it not?
So what changed? Prices went down, right? So 0.1485 is the same as 0.15 the year before. It buys the exact same amount of stuff. Can it not buy the exact same amount of stuff as 0.15 the year before?
Your home value doesn't go down over time, it either stays flat or increases, because there is more demand for your house. After 15 years of 1% purchasing power increases, your 5 BTC home is now - if there was no increase in demand at all, meaning no one else wanted to live where you live - worth 4.3 BTC.
What changed?
In both scenarios, the only thing that changes is the amount of people in the world. There are now more people in the world this year than last year. The relative cost to do anything is basically the same, except there is more human labor in the market to get those things done. It's easier to get things done, this is why things trend towards costing less over time, because you have more people capable of doing the work. Real estate would increase in value as always, because it is a scarce resource, and would always be a good investment.
Again, your 5% is way too far off to make sense.
Imagine a town with 1000 people, and those 1000 people agree to only use 10,000 tokens inside their economy for trade. They never allow any more tokens to be created, and each token can be broken down to any fraction. If that town is self-sustaining, meaning they don't need to buy/sell from the outside world, the amount of tokens in that town remains static. Someone makes a good product, and gets a lot of tokens. They still spend their fortune on buying food and other things to the rest of the town. The people might trade in smaller fractions, but everything still gets done that needs doing.
Now those 1000 town members have 1000 children, and there's 2000 people in the world. Now what happens? There's still only 10,000 tokens out there, but 2000 people. Before, one month of 'pay' was worth 1 token. But now your children are helping, and there twice as many people helping to keep the town running. Do we need more currency for this, or can we just use smaller fractions of the existing tokens? Now, a month's pay might be 0.5 tokens, because we have a lot more people to do the work, but the relative value of that is 1 month's pay, and can still facilitate the economy without any problem.
The only reason gold broke down as a payment system is that unlike Bitcoin, you could not break it down into smaller decimal values. The gold coin got chopped up into 8 pieces and then got debased and then got taken completely out of money because it was not possible to divide it into smaller parts. Bitcoin can be divided into smaller parts - as many as we need.
Inflation does only one thing - it steals from the future workers and gives it to the people of today. For that, it is very powerful. Stealing from the future labor pool is a big deal. It's worth a lot. It makes rich people rich and poor people poor, without having to lift a finger. That theft of the future labor market - for example if you add an additional 10,000 tokens to that town of 1000 people to make 20,000 total tokens, means the person who took out the loan for those new 10,000 tokens has massive buying power today over all his other townspeople. He can buy whatever he wants, as if he were producing as much labor as the entire town combined. After the massive inflation this causes, and after the population increases, now there are 20,000 tokens and 2000 people, meaning the value of a person's labor has returned to 'normal'. Except nothing really changed. Just the theft of the future value occurred, and the banker who made that loan profited immensely.
People have never, ever had the ability to have a currency that does not inflate, or deflate, for that matter. No one can hoard all the gold, so to speak. It can always be transacted in smaller fractional amounts with the same ease as full amounts. We won't ever have someone show up with a pile of new currency with Bitcoin, inflating the price artificially. And we won't have anyone able to hoard Bitcoin to the point no one can spend any. Again, this is the first time in history we've had an option like this. There is no flaw in it. The only issue is people have been educated to think we need inflation, and to think 'deflation' isn't a problem that inflation caused in the first place. With a fixed currency supply we avoid both of those scenarios.

They're standing literally right in front of you, waiting for payment. I'm... not talking about online transactions (though they would often have the same concept of knowing who you're sending a payment to); I didn't make that clear by saying "walk out" I suppose.


1.67 mBTC ~$16 for the chance to get $1600, and x10 that in a few years as Bitcoin's price rises. Pretty big incentive to try even if you're not broke. If you're dealing with someone *in person* and you're pretty sure their node is their phone and their watchtower is their PC sitting on their desk, the incentive is there, after buying products from a person for a while, to attempt to close the channel in your own favor. It's the same as cash, but exploring the risk, going from Bitcoin's general lack of risk, to even a minor risk cash-like transaction with Bitcoin, is a big leap. 0 to 1, as I've said elsewhere. So it's worth digesting the possible ways the technology can be compromised.


Definitely not - and yet, do you honestly think everyone a) knows everything everyone else knows and b) all problems have all already been solved for all problems to ever exist? and c) no one can discuss issues they see in an open forum?
And yeah, actually, no one explains Lightning as the direct digital representation of a cash transaction. In reading about it, no one made the comparison to a cash transaction, where when you pull cash fiat out of your pocket, you open a 'channel' with the person you are transacting with in that moment. I think that insight was worth debating all the issues.

A few years ago, people would exchange 30 paper fiat dollars for 1 Bitcoin.
Now, people are willing to throw ~10,000 paper fiat dollars down for 1 single Bitcoin. Gold has remained somewhat flat (relatively) in that timeframe, if I recall.
It means more people are trusting Bitcoin as a store of value over those other assets and they're willing to pay more for some of this future currency.

They will just invent the "Stabler" a new token that is tied directly to the reserves they hold in a 1:1 ratio of USD! For every Stabler issued, there will be at least $1 USD in reserve! This is way different than Tether, because it's called Stabler!
Every time I consider the implications of Tether just being a central bank backed attempt to sabotage Bitcoin I don't see how it can hurt Bitcoin to have this manipulation occur. The only time it causes a problem is if Tether just continues to buy endlessly by creating tokens that the exchanges then accept. They could drive price up continuously and either destroy any held coins or hold on to them forever. If they later sell and just dump the market, nothing really happens. They 'take' some cash from investors but never enough to cripple the market or interest or the idea behind the technology.
Each time they do this it will drive Bitcoin price higher, driving interest, more mining, more people adopting Bitcoin... I think there is a lot of manipulation but I cannot find a way it is bad. It's as if someone printed money to buy all the gold and then hold it - so what? Each person's remaining gold goes way up in price. Or they try and raise the price buying and then dump selling their gold - so what, they'll never outsell demand when people think the price is high.
There is some flaw when it comes to exchanges in that they are custodians of Bitcoin and might not have a single Bitcoin in their holdings. Any time someone requests a withdraw of Bitcoin they can just put a buy order in and send it on the way. Who cares. So if an exchange can 'print Bitcoin' by constantly offering it for sale, they can artificially drive price downward forever.
Not sure. It feels like we need more open and transparent exchanges.

Ok, let's see. I'm going to round up your 28k days to 30k days per human lifespan, and 7 billion people. Because I already did the math :)
So 210 trillion days, which means 210 trillion satoshi over the lifespan of 7 billion people. There are 2100 trillion satoshi total (100 million times 21 million). So yes, there are **10x the number of satoshi** as days to breathe at 1 satoshi per day assuming no cycling of the currency and a pure spend-and-forget consumption.

Yes. Although keep in mind, never in history has there not been a "1%" class. The people who work hard always rise to the top. If you have issues with a "1% of the people holding 90% of the wealth and power" well, you've got some mental problems to overcome first :)
It would be like complaining that the top 1% of kids in school got the best grades.
Or saying the top sellers in a commission-based environment make most of the money.
The hard workers, or the people who bring the best services to market, will always rise to the top.
Jeff Bezos of Amazon was not a wealthy person 20 years ago. Now he's one of the richest people in the world.
Your concern should not be what other people do with their money, or how much money they have. If you want more money, just know you can work for it and obtain it. That's the function of money. Bitcoin comes along and preserves the value of that money over time, where there is no artificial inflation decreasing your buying power like what happens with printed fiat dollars.
If you had 10,000 Bitcoin, would you want someone telling you how you could spend them, how you could sell them? Would you want someone telling you that you're not allowed to do whatever you want with your own Bitcoin? If you have 0.01 Bitcoin, would you want anyone telling you what to do? No. It doesn't matter how much you have you will still not want people telling you what to do with your own money, period. Becoming wealthy does not somehow remove from you the ability (or right) to do whatever you want with your own money.
Keep in mind there were 'whales' back when Bitcoin was selling at $1000/each. Kids who bought 1000 Bitcoin from the early days and then sold their 1000 coins for $1 million in cash! Wow! They did. They bought lambos too. This spread out Bitcoin to everyone else when they did this, and the hype grew and a lot of people started paying attention to Bitcoin. Now what? They have a lambo and whatever remains of their $1 million. If they held for a bit longer until today, that 1000 Bitcoin is worth $11 million, right? So they lost $10 million by selling "too early". To them it was a good deal at the time though, and that kind of movement is necessary and natural to the adoption of any new currency. So it doesn't matter what whales do today, as long as you get as much Bitcoin as you can today as well.
Eventually it all smooths out (10-20 years) and most people will only hold Satoshis and most people will be fine trading in Satoshis. The relative fiat price will be an ancient indicator of labor value at that point. At that point, one Bitcoin might be worth $100k or $1 million. So any whale selling today is losing out, right?
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:57:17
Not Bitcoin but any currency which does not inflate achieves this. The problem is every currency is manipulated by banks and humans. Bitcoin, by not allowing anyone to 'print more' of it, helps solve the problem.
UBI is different. The Fed prints a lot of money, stealing labor from the future people. In doing so, they make loans to businesses and people who need homes and so on. That's how the money is "made". This inflates the economy by adding new money into the economy. UBI is the idea that we can just not make as many business loans, and instead literally give that stolen future labor money to the people, and they will spend it however they want and will drive the economy from the bottom up.
I think it's a terrible idea. Anything involving the stealing of future labor is a terrible idea (long term). It's a good idea in terms of maintaining national power though, which I've talked about.
So how does Bitcoin solve "people don't have to slave away at a job they don't like just to pay the bills and can instead focus on the things they really want to do"? 
Currently the economy is built on slave labor. People are whipped to work by the ever present bills looming over their head. Why do they have 'ever present bills'? Because of inflation. Because prices keep rising. If you try to save money over time while working, you lose, because that money isn't worth as much today as before. You constantly have to beat out inflation on top of maintaining your life. Without inflation, a person needs to only maintain their life if they want. They can push harder if they want, or they can save up (and not be punished for it) if they want. They can more easily save up for years and then invest into their own business or some investment they prefer. Saving up for a house would be much easier, knowing the value you would need to reach and being able to target that knowing your saved money is growing in value over time, not losing it.
Imagine you and I were the only people in the world. You perform half of all necessary labor and I perform half of all necessary labor. Let's say we agree to use 100 tokens to represent our labor. If you need a break, you pay me some tokens and I do your half of the work. If I need a break, I pay you some tokens. Where do we need extra money tokens from? Now imagine one day I copy these tokens and I just keep handing them to you. I don't do any work, I take a permanent break, and I just keep handing you these tokens that I'm printing and you keep doing all the work, forever.
This is in effect the inflation system. The people printing the money are taking tokens of work and giving them to people so they keep working. The person making the tokens is rich, and can do whatever they want with their life, while the person receiving the tokens is a virtual slave.
In a fixed currency supply economy, this doesn't work. For example, in the initial system of 100 tokens, if I had 50 tokens, I can only give you 50 tokens before I run out and I'm forced to do all your work for a while to regain some tokens (we're assuming I can't just leave the social agreement). There's never more than 100 tokens, and each day of work I do for you, I get a token, and the system is stable.
"Deflation" occurs when you add more people into this fixed currency economy. Deflation is the wrong word but it's good enough - I just think you view that word for what it is not. If we allow 2 more people into our world, we now have 4 people and the same 100 tokens. The 2 new people have zero tokens - they're new. So you and I have a lot of power, able to pay them tokens to do our work. Since they're new, we might only pay them half a token for their work, too. Eventually we get low on tokens and you and I have to do work for them. Since we're now doing work for them, they only pay us half a token back for our days work - but when you and I were doing it, we got a full token back! So what happened? Prices went down is what happened. We used to be rich, and now we have to put in the same work as everyone else.
Deflation is the wrong word - deflation is caused by inflation. In a fixed currency system, all that is happening is we're adding more people into the workforce. There will be over 8 billion people on Earth in the next 10 years. These extra people will all do more labor for less pay because they are new. In an inflation system, we steal from the future people, and never let them come back and only pay us half a token for our own work. We always steal from them where if we ever have to do work, they always pay us 1 token, but because we're stealing from them generation after generation, we never have to do work in the first place. In an inflation system, every time someone new enters the workforce, for example, where there were 4 of us, 4 more people come in, instead of using the same 100 currency tokens, you and I secretly print 100 more tokens. The 4 new people don't know any different. So we pay them the same amount as the 2 first new people, and everyone is happy because they don't realize we've just artificially increased the supply just by printing off new tokens. Eventually these 6 people will realize there's a lot of tokens in the economy, and they will begin charging more to take over someone's work for a day - this is inflation. Until they realize that, we're extremely powerful, able to direct their labor however we want while we do nothing. And if those 6 realize what we 2 have done, we can just let them in on the game. We'll get 4 new people, and the 6 can take a loan from us of extra tokens, and they can pay the 4 new people to steal from them the same way we did.
This is a very simplified version of what has actually happened in the world.
And again, we have never had a fixed supply currency. There is no downside to it. There's no such thing as deflation in a fixed currency supply, only the true value of human labor. The currency supply is never restricted when we can divide our tokens into 100 million parts. We can always pay a fraction of a fraction if necessary. Inflation/deflation is "bad" because the banks created it. They created inflation, which causes a deflationary problem when the currency supply is no longer printed at the same amount and people realize something is wrong. Those words cease to exist in a fixed currency supply system.

Everyone won't. It's a slow process, but within 10-20 years it will be complete. Much faster than any other time, because we have such good technology and fast communication today.


Ah, well it's not like I mean check out like stop doing anything. I mean check out like stop valuing the dollar bill, the paper printed money.
If everyone uses Bitcoin, everyone's labor is valued perfectly, and no one can steal from you, or anyone else (in terms of inflation) without their consent at least.
If you think about what money is you will get to the answer. Money is just - and I do mean just - an imaginary, agreed upon representation of human work effort, or labor. So what money is, physically, doesn't matter. It's an imaginary idea.
For example, if you farm pigs, and I farm corn, we could always trade; my corn, for your pigs. But what happens when you don't need corn, and I don't need pigs, or there's some other party involved? Humans decided we can agree on tokens which will represent the value of farming corn, and the value of farming pigs, so that we can buy the corn, or buy the pigs, only when we need them. You might not need corn - you have a lot. So instead of giving you corn next time we trade, I give you tokens in exchange for your pigs that say, "I will do work for you comparable to this amount of tokens."
If you can wrap your head around that part, that money is just an idea, an imaginary system of tokens representing human work effort, you will go far.
So when today, a central bank prints more tokens, what they are doing is stealing from everyone. They steal the future value of the tokens - remember, these tokens (money) are just representation of human labor. So if they print money, they are powerful in the moment, because everyone thinks they have a lot of money (human labor).
Imagine you and I are farmers again. We both agree on paper tokens, you have 50, I have 50. We can exchange 1 token for each others' labor. What happens if I can just go print unlimited tokens? I can then have you do my labor - farm pigs for me, build my house, do whatever I want you to do - as long as you don't realize I'm printing the tokens. As soon as you find out I'm printing the tokens and I'm not doing any work, you want out of the system. You want to check out.
Indeed in the best society, you and I could use a fixed amount of tokens that neither of us could print more of. If I ran out of tokens, I would have to do some work of value for you to get some tokens back, otherwise I would starve.
It is the inflation of paper money that has simultaneously helped and damaged the world at the same time. Stealing labor from people is pretty powerful - they might have wasted it doing nothing otherwise. So the power to print money means you get to leverage your nation's labor, even from people who don't want to help, into flexing your power on the world stage. This is how the USA has been so successful - they are the nation which steals the most from their citizens and the citizens don't mind as long as they get food, shelter and sex. So the stealing of labor has led to some good things, but overall the negative is well, the stealing of labor. We don't know what we can accomplish just by letting those who don't want to be stolen from live their life and come up with interesting ideas on their own with no hamster wheel to run upon. Most of the great boons of history were during times of sound money.
The dollar will fail - it has a few times in the past 100 years alone. Each time, the people had no option but to just go along with what the government said to do. Now we have an option and I don't see us moving away from it.

You don't need to explain why Bitcoin is good. Just explain to them how money is made (out of thin air by the central banks). Focus on that - because that affects them and they've felt it in their life and it makes sense. Then when they ask, "Well so what it's not like we can do anything about it," that's when you bring up Bitcoin.
If your kids ever come to you and say, "Wow look at this cool thing called a computer it's going to let us all connect and talk to the entire world in a few years," best bet is to listen. But no one likes being wrong so the natural reaction is to reject the unknown because being wrong is easier than being right.

This is so wrong. It feels bad seeing the banks have a grip into someone's mind so deep.
Say there's 100 tokens in society, and I have 1 token, and someone steals my 1 token. Protect me bank!
What does the bank do? It prints you another token.
Now there's 101 tokens. I just stole from everyone in the economy because someone stole from me and I didn't want to own up to my own responsibility. I didn't seek help from friends or family or a church or a social network or a charity.
I decided to steal from everyone in order to not feel bad about my lack of responsibility or my bad luck.
This lack of responsibility breeds fraud and hacking, because everyone becomes complacent, and each time you're a victim and claim your money from the bank, they just print you a few more numbers and you end up stealing from everyone else.
Keep in mind - all this is still doable with Bitcoin. Institutions can do this exact same thing, with insurance companies behind them, with all manner of ways to hunt down that Bitcoin transaction that was stolen, with actual risk and having to put forward actual work to stop crime. The only difference is today, you're a thief every time you want your money back in printed form, and you give credit to the bank who at least stole on your behalf, not considering your money is now devalued as well. As long as you get yours.

**Edit: Ok looks like their BTC markup on their website is ~8% fee with no other factors so you're buying directly at that price with no other upcharge and can disregard the following. Seems reasonable!**
All this is then nonsense:
If you do the math using their website locator it ends up being an **18% fee** or so unless their "8% fee" is their total per-BTC markup, which I cannot find information about. I will assume it is their BTC markup plus 8%.
Currently BTC is trading at ~$11200 and they're listing buys at $12200 on their website. So a $1000 markup per BTC. If you buy 0.01 BTC for $122 (rather than $112 on an exchange) they then add 8% on top so ~$132 for $112 worth of Bitcoin.
You pay **$20 extra** to secure 0.01 BTC due to not using an exchange.
Coinbase would charge you 1.5% from the main site ($1.68) and 0.15% from Coinbase Pro ($0.17).
$112 times 1.18 (18%) = ~$132 so there is an 18% fee for the convenience of buying from the ATM.
I don't think it's that bad, being ~16% higher than Coinbase as a way in, but it's not trustworthy to say you only charge an 8% fee and then charge a large market price per BTC. Fee-based fiat ATMs will charge up upwards of $3 to take out $40, which isn't as high, but Bitcoin does fluctuate price a lot.
This dishonesty in fees is not something I am happy about, but I doubt it will affect the customers who will use such a thing anyway. Hopefully they have a plan to lower their 18% price in the future.
It is as if I told you I will sell you 1 Amazon stock ($1939) for $2039 *and* I will charge an 8% fee on top of that making your total $2202. For the privilege of being able to pay me cash (and they still KYC you) versus just depositing cash into your bank account at a bank ATM and buying directly from any exchange.

The small mind would ignore the 20+ years it took for the internet to develop to make Uber even possible. Anyone who thinks it only took 3 years is only capable of seeing the top layer of what goes on in the world, and is unable to comprehend the vast amount of infrastructure that had to be created before Uber could even exist. In addition, Taxi's still exist, they just have competition now.
Banks, devoid of competition for over 100 years and rooted into the most important facet of life - money - and yet Bitcoin is making grounds against it. A system made to not have competition, now has competition they cannot control.
Like Uber, Bitcoin is the competition. How did it work out for Uber?

In all history, those who brag about their wealth in public nearly always don't have that wealth, but end up scamming some other fool who thinks they do have that wealth. Note how a Ponzi scheme works for example. A bunch of people trusting the bragger - not a bunch of people trying to target the bragger to scam them from money.
No doubt, you could be a good scammer - we all could actually. We'd clean up. But we don't want to spend our days scamming people regardless of potential profit. The people who do end up scamming spend their days seeing fellow humans as targets. It's not worth it to most people, but to some people who flip that switch in their mind, it becomes an option.
Just keep in mind the person revealing their wealth is just as much a scammer as the person messaging them later about it. No rules are necessary. Let the free market take care of itself. Some people will crash and burn and others will hit the moon.

People with 1000 Bitcoin back when Bitcoin was $30 each - they held $30k for something that cost them $3 to buy! They're so happy. They sell.
Today that 1000 Bitcoin is worth $11 million. Selling is the worst thing you can do.
You don't take profits when you buy fiat. You're literally buying fiat paper dollars with Bitcoin, not selling Bitcoin for paper dollars.
You're saying you value the inflationary paper dollars over Bitcoin. In the short term that might look like a good idea but over the long term it's not that smart until the market is saturated and Bitcoin's value becomes known.

Your node doesn't store anything. It's like a beacon in the night. A red light upon a tall radio tower. A buoy in the ocean. It is a relay like a phone switchboard, or a cellphone tower, or a gossipy neighbor.
As such, it's just listening for information (blocks to verify and relay) and sending information (yup block is valid here you go, peer, take it).
This is all just data, information 1's and 0's. So to shut down a node is to shut down any internet connection. After all, if you shut down a node, we can just encrypt the traffic further (like Tor) or many other wild manners of encryption. The arms-race of encryption never ends well for the person trying to stop encryption.
So don't worry too much about it. Running a node is good for making your own transactions hit sooner, more safely, without going through other parties first, and helps secure the network if you leave it running. It's a good citizen thing to do. It's like putting up a neighborhood watch sign in your neighborhood. You're just saying, "I'm out here looking in case someone sends an invalid block." Nothing worth getting worried about being raided over.

Where it leads to I understand isn't the issue, but it is an open channel with a time component. You are a person, but a business - assuming brick-and-mortar which isn't moving much - would stick around. So it's not the location, but that you're dealing with an aged channel, I guess. I suppose roots confuses the thought of roots in the local physical space, but I'm more thinking the economic space. A new teenager getting their first channel set up, for example, would have no roots and it would be noticeable in comparison to everyone else.


Yes but even as a new store, the roots are still aged are they not? Someone would know they're dealing with someone who at least has been around a minute, has some history. It's not someone who is a thief opening new channels all the time, for example (as I just read the latest BitMEX article in /new).


Exactly; however having history has value, so this is possible (which is good) but unlikely.
Thanks again. It lends more to a trust model over time I guess, versus an economic indicator for the local market, though I can kind of see where that still applies, since your local area would have fewer channels opening and closing depending on how rooted the community was.

Bitcoin exists. It's information and math, nothing else. Even if all the miners went extinct your Bitcoin would still be at your address, uninflated, still valuable. The people finally have a choice when it comes to money and we choose a non-inflating currency. They can't stop it. You should research more about Bitcoin and you will find this out.
Remember the government doesn't talk about something until it's a big deal. The government never said a thing about MySpace. They only stepped up when it was too late and Facebook was already a dominant player in the global economy. That didn't do anything; Facebook is still going to do whatever it wants to do.

I think you're discussing the potential of two traders working with each other to bounce the price upwards. Sure - but if they're doing it on an exchange they always run into issues where someone else makes the 'buy' or 'sell' to fill their order. So it's not something you'd really see on an exchange. And since most people track exchange prices, even if two traders do this on an exchange, it just makes it less likely anyone would sell for less than the new $10,100 price, and so on. So unless they both managed to somehow not pay any fees - or maybe they're the exchange itself doing self-trades and so on -- if they are operating anywhere outside of full manipulation they are at risk of being busted by a quick buyer or seller when they're trying to trade with each other. If you watch how fast orders are posted, moved and removed and reposted, you'll notice the scenario you present isn't doable to a reliable degree on exchanges, again, unless it's the actual exchange doing the extreme manipulation. In which case, you have to trust someone - there's no trustless exchange, and the only nearly-trustless thing we have in human history happens to be Bitcoin itself. So hodl your Bitcoin in your own wallet and trust yourself.

If you understand fiat money production and the reason Bitcoin is where it is at today as a hedge against the inflation the printing of money causes, you might be able to see how the Fed needs a stable economy in order to manipulate it. If it swings too big in one direction or the other, people start asking questions as to why the monetary policy is so screwed up. Then they question the Fed and when that happens, the Fed has to come up with a new way to silence the masses.
Imagine if a large bank starts defaulting on its debt and instead of receiving a bailout, it's allowed to fail. That would be massive. I could see Trump denying a bailout, for example, whereas the past two Presidents knew that in order to keep everyone comatose to the problem of fiat paper money they had to bail out the banks.
Basically, any indication by a President that they won't continue playing the safe and calm game of 'business as usual' is a slight against the central banks and has the potential to reveal flaws in the fiat system in general. Every US citizen thinks, "It can't happen here," but if one scare happens and they stop thinking that, it's over for the current form of monetary policy. So by not playing by their game it has potential big consequences in the near future. You could try to answer, reasonably: why would he even send out that tweet? I think that's where CrusadePrime was trying to begin a conversation.

Data storage is very cheap, and full Bitcoin nodes store the entire blockchain, so the full ledger is distributed around the world.
Makes me wonder; there's a lot of talk about hashrate and power consumption but not much about total storage consumed.
235GB blockchain, let's say 500,000 full nodes, is 117,500 TB worth of data used. A drop in the bucket but still nothing to sneeze at. It's unlikely there are that many nodes today as well, unsure if there's a way to determine that number.

Sure. 100 satoshi for a loaf of bread.
Estimating 9 million loaves of bread per day for 325 million people. Each person is worth .028 loaves of bread. A person then needs to produce ~36 loaves of bread to be worth one human per day. Assume selling 36 loaves of bread per day at 100sat/each we get 3600 satoshis per day paid to the business for this person's labor. The business pays 50% of its income as labor, 40% to overhead, and keeps a 10% profit. The person then receives 1800 satoshis per day. Assuming an 8 hour work day, we get 225 satoshis per hour and 3.75 satoshis per minute and 0.0625 satoshis per second.
This might be low, because we're not using automation which drives current bread prices low. At the above rate, we're making expensive artisan bread only doing 36 per day and we're trying to find a relative valuation for cheap bread. Assume a 100x increase to the production value due to automation, that one baker produces 3600 loaves by maintaining a factory setting, earns 360,000 satoshi per day for the company. Rates of business cost are about the same (most businesses pay upwards of 50% or higher of their revenue towards payroll). So 180,000 sats per day for this baker, and 6.25 sats per second earned.
Considering a USD salary of say $30k for this baker, at 40 hours worked per week, we get 2080 hours worked, and a $14.42 per hour pay rate. $14.42 times 8 hours is $115.36 daily pay rate. Considering the worker gets 180,000 sats per day, $115.36 = 180,000 sats and the $ per second is $0.004 just for fun.
So if $115.36 is equal to 180,000 sats and bread is 100 sats per loaf of bread, we get 1560.33 satoshis per dollar. With 100,000,000 satoshis per Bitcoin, divide that by satoshis-per-dollar to result at the valuation price of $64,089 dollars per Bitcoin.
For reference: 
11,500 per hour is a rate I heard, for 8 hours, means 92000 produced in 8 hours, which at 3600/baker supports ~26 workers, which seems reasonable for a large factory.
I'm just writing a bunch of nonsense if I made a mistake go for it.

You should mortgage your house, sell your car, and empty all your bank accounts and buy into Bitcoin as soon as humanly possible. Oh and you should max out all your credit cards and take out massive loans from banks and destroy your credit rating, dumping every last bit of money you can possibly suck out of the system into Bitcoin.
I'm not gonna lie, that is what you should do, however most people don't have that kind of risk tolerance, so instead, just buy what you can afford to lose. As soon as you learn about Bitcoin is the best time to get into it. A young 14 year old never knew about Bitcoin before they realized what money was. Now they know, so that's the best time to get in.
I've compared this to any fiat money. When you grew up, you had things paid for you by your parents. You got stuff. At some point you made the mental connection - if I give someone this thing called money, I get what I want. We decided at some point that we want more of this thing called money, because with more of it, we get more of what we want. We want more of this money so much, we're willing to go work for someone else for 8 hours per day to get more of this money. We'll even defer getting paid for 2 weeks until payroll hits as long as we still get our money. We'll do a lot for it.
Bitcoin is just a future currency, so if you buy it now, you're buying a future currency at a discount, that's all. Eventually you'll have to work for it, and the amount you'll work for will be counted in satoshis.

Tor is not as secure as you think it is. The obfuscation of your internet traffic does not stop a dedicated entity from finding you if they wanted. It just makes it not worth it (see incentive) to care much about the random traffic since you have to do a lot of extra work to see where that traffic is coming from.
Tor doesn't help anyone survive, it just lets them be public in their dealings without having those dealings easily attributed back to them. It's a luxury. In addition, every major law-breaking Tor service has been hunted down, so ... trust in Tor is not a viable answer. It just makes it less worth it to go after someone who is using it. If the incentive is great enough then it will be done.

If you buy $250 and the BTC price is $11500 you get 250/11500 or 0.02173913 Bitcoin.
If the price of Bitcoin rises to $15k then your 0.02173913 Bitcoin is worth (0.02173913 * 15000) or $326.09 fiat dollars.
Due to inflation, those $326.09 fiat dollars lose value year over year, so each dollar is worth less year after year. A dollar today will be worth $0.75 in 10 years or less. Your 0.02173913 Bitcoin will always be worth that much Bitcoin (and will likely gain buying power over time instead of lose it).
I know you didn't ask but imagine you're working back in 1980 when minimum wage was $3.10. You work 40 hours a week, earning $124 per week, $496 per month. This got you by. You paid for your rent and took care of yourself. You managed to put away $100 per month, representing 20% of your total monthly income and ~32 hours per month of labor. Over 10 years you save up $12,000.
Now is $12,000 worth 20% of your labor for 10 years? Today, hell no. Why? Inflation screwed everyone over. Prices are sky high. $12,000 might cover your rent in a city for a year nothing else. So the person who worked hard and saved was punished because the central banks printed a ton of money and made that $12,000 worth so much less in a short period of time. Now, it's been a bit longer than 10 years but I think you can get the point.
Now consider instead today, you put $100 a month into Bitcoin. You always stack sats (0.00000001 of a Bitcoin is a 'Satoshi'). Those sats are never devalued because there is a fixed (increasing slightly due to mining but a predictable expansion of circulating money supply) amount of Bitcoin. No one can print more. If you save up 0.1 BTC per year, in 10 years you will have 1 BTC, and it will always be worth 1 BTC. The fiat value at that time might be much higher, versus the fiat money version where you lost buying power over time. With Bitcoin your 1 BTC will always buy 1 BTC worth of 'stuff' whatever the market value is at the time. Sitting on your $12k fiat cash means you lose over time as that money can do less and less as the government prints more money. Back in 1980, $12k would get you a nice new car. Today, $12k can't really buy you any nice new car period. Sitting on your 1 BTC means your Bitcoin gains value over time as more people will do more labor and perform more services for you to obtain some of your Bitcoin.
$100 of your labor today might be 10 hours work versus the 32 hours work back in 1980. This means your labor from 1980 to today lost ~66% of its labor value. This means if you hold on to your fiat money, it will lose value over time. If instead you store that value into Bitcoin, your 10 hours of labor buys you some Bitcoin that over time, someone else might pay you more for your labor. They might pay you $200 in value for the 10 hours labor you performed today.
Eventually we can reach a point where trading in Bitcoin is the standard. In which case, your labor will be a certain value that maintains and increases worth over time, instead of losing it.
I write about this because holding fiat is more scary to me than seeing Bitcoin drop in fiat-value due to being 'volatile'.

No idea. I'd treat it the same. When you buy stocks you get voting rights and a bunch of other stuff. So if Robinhood isn't giving you any of that, you're just betting on stock prices too - you don't even have ownership in the company. Now if they do actually manage stocks correctly, then you have some protection in case they fail... maybe.
The difference with Bitcoin is it is digital cash - there's no refunding it. There's no government who can just send you back your Bitcoin. That's why it's much more important to hold Bitcoin. If an exchange, or app, or anything 'holds' Bitcoin for you and then goes out of business, you lose everything. No insurance (unless you're a trader with business insurance i.e. you bought private insurance). Just gone.

I agree that exchanges, and really, any business which holds an account for you, is at risk. There is incentive however for exchanges to operate with the best interest of their customers in mind, to continue to remain in business. Sure, an exchange could engage in the exact same actions - and any exchange that accepts Tether, I would not put it past them. The motive behind it is much different though, and a well established exchange is at least incentivized to maintain legitimate dealings because, well, that's how they make money. In addition, a large exchange is providing a lot of services, whereas Tether is just "a few people created more tokens". The large exchange is more likely to have whistleblowers should they begin to operate in bad faith.
But yes, all have a risk. You could have a spending account at a Nordstrom department store for $1000. You even put in $1000. And then one day you go to buy something and they say you have no money in your account. This is completely possible with any company which holds an account.
Tether is a third-party source which is not a company with a history. They do not have holdings or assets that are at risk. There's nothing behind it except a "reserve" number they tell you that no one can audit and as I explained, wouldn't matter anyway. There's no incentive for them to continue operating, even if the people in charge were not compromised, they could be indirectly compromised by external banks, and if they go out of business, they still made their money. It's only the "bag holders" that lose.
Why this is different from central banks just printing money and buying Bitcoin is because that would cause inflation and cause disruption to the sensitive central banking system. So if they create a sub-bank, Tether, and print unlimited fractional-reserve bank notes in Tether, they achieve the same result, but when Tether fails, it doesn't impact the rest of the economy at all. It only impacts the economy which accepted Tether. The crypto-economy. No one else.

We get into technicals there. Can we rely on the idea that if there is communication, it can be intercepted? There is an idea that quantum computers might be able to transmit messages incapable of being intercepted but we don't have that yet. And anyway, we'd still know someone was sending a communication, which is about as good of information we'll ever have in an encrypted space, right?
If I'm watching one target, and I isolate a watchtower, and I see that the target repeatedly tries to send the same message, I'm going to be fairly sure I've isolated the right watchtower.

The same thing all money is compared against for value: human work effort, also known as human labor.
The dollar is not worth dollars.
The dollar is worth how much you need to get someone else to do something for you. Because they themselves know with those dollars they can get someone to do something else for them. Bitcoin is the most pure currency in this resolve, since no one can print more.

Yes, there is! In order to do that, the whole system crumbles as people find their money is not valuable. A decrease in inflation would send a shockwave through the economy and cause a great depression. The bankers, wanting to not be poor fools, will print more money to make sure they're taken care of, and all of sudden we have inflation again. Fiat money must pop at some point in order to work. Sometimes these can be managed - like 2008. If a big enough bust can be absorbed and we can take money from the people to make up for it, meaning the people don't get too mad about it, they can continue printing away.
Bitcoin removes that option now. You can't just take people's Bitcoin the same way you can take their tax money from the government and so on.
Bitcoin pushes them into constantly inflating. If there is economic trouble, Bitcoin will rise in price, as everyone sees everything else losing value but Bitcoin goes up. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way. They either go out with deflation, or go out with inflation. And printing more money at least gets the bankers more money in the short term.

Correct. The best currency you could ever create would not have intrinsic value.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:45:52
I share the concern. What you are describing is digital-organized-crime. Where with fiat cash, organized crime exists - the mafia can offer 'protection' to an area. In the digital space, you are describing the digital mafia (which was one of my main points when discussing watchtowers; with reliance on a third party we have organized crime). Your channels can be held hostage and extorted against.
Again, I see this as a feature, proving Bitcoin as a currency (to anyone who doubts it) because these risks are inherent to currency and nothing else. The presence of the digital mafia will occur - it's guaranteed. And it will eventually find that operating legitimate business is more profitable anyway - and disappear. In the beginning there will be a profit motive that will die over time. We've seen it throughout history and we'll see it again here.
So sharing the concern, I acknowledge it will be solved, and solved much quicker than the physical mafia, since we can move on technology much faster. And keep in mind, the theoretical hack would only affect the funds people willingly put into cash-like lightning channels, meaning if precaution is done to keep most of your funds on-chain, the impact will be individually limited - this is where the shop owner being extorted for money says, "I don't have much this week."
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:08:41
I mean, it is possible, if the incentive was high enough. Your ISP and Reddit, they're run by people who have varying tolerances for being bribed. Or if the amount was high enough, buy out those companies. Or raid them. That's kind of how incentive works - if the value is higher than the risk. Now if the value were low, it doesn't really work. As such I've come to the conclusion that watchtowers are bad for lightning, and people should only use channels they themselves trust, necessarily keeping the transaction amounts overall low based on their level of trust tolerance, and if they get scammed by someone they rely on their own nodes to broadcast justice states, and if they truly get stolen from they just don't deal with that person ever again. But the possibility of fraud always being there and trust being on your shoulders and not outsourcing it to a watchtower will make people only open small amounts in their channels.
There's also no hacking required... maybe you're thinking of something else. I'm discussing the idea that I can physically prevent these things from happening. So easy a caveman could do it kind of thing.
If for example, without watch towers, if I open up a $1000-value channel with someone, if I buy $900 worth of stuff and then broadcast the initial state showing no transactions, if I can cut that other party off and prevent their communication, my theft is successful.
This can be done physically, that's all I'm getting at.
Usually there's no incentive to do this - *especially* with Bitcoin. Bitcoin protects your life to a degree (and threatens it to another as I recently envisioned, off topic). If someone kills you the Bitcoin is lost (which... could be a motivation for taking you out if you own a lot of Bitcoin, so that you or your organization loses all its power, and the overall value increases faster! Winklevoss's need to stay safe. This is super interesting, it's basically world superpowers attacking each other at that stage.).

Lots of transactions. 60/byte would get you in in 1-2 blocks. It'll be a little wait.
You'll need to wait like 10-20 blocks with no new transactions before miners pick you up. That's 100-200 minutes with no one getting ahead of you with new higher fee transactions. Eventually the wave of transactions calms and you'll go through.

Until you can buy a brand new car with it, or a new house, or pay off all your debt, or whatever it is that changes your life. Then even after the price goes up and you look back, you won't be too sour about it.
The goal for hodling is to indeed hold until Bitcoin hits its true market value and becomes very stable. Market cap will be over that of gold when that happens. In about 10 years.

It is a law I would refuse to obey, personally. Knowing the solution to a math problem which someone values is not ever going to fly as being a crime. Anything is possible; governments can try as hard as they want to try and control money. The reality is governments never have control over money. The people control the money, and this has always been the case. This is why FDR had to take the USA off the gold standard, and this is why Nixon removed gold from backing the dollar, because the people kept producing so much labor those gold-backed items couldn't keep up with demand. They had to resort to imaginary debt-based money just to keep up.
This too will fail.
Money is the representation of human work effort. The people will always gravitate towards the best money available - the best way to represent their labor. Bitcoin is the best money available. It has features never offered to humanity before.
Governments are always less powerful than the people, they just don't like you knowing that. For every 1 government official, there are tens of thousands of people. The power is just an illusion of control, and often the people break loose when there is too much pressure and overthrow the government. Banning the valuing of the answer to a math problem would... not be good.
My view is Bitcoin is unstoppable. It's an idea humans have unlocked. We can never go back to the old ways, just like no one went back to seashells after they found gold. Governments will print more money in an attempt to keep their economies moving, and then they will print too much, and nearly every one will collapse as the people see the benefit in owning Bitcoin over their failing fiat.
I know this sounds weird but I'm quite confident that within 10 or 20 years we will see the collapse of fiat. Bitcoin's idea unlocked an achievement of humanity - to be able to store value into digital space by using math. It's not ever going to be forgotten that this is possible, and everyone who begins to see the value spreads the idea like a virus and eventually gets to the point where they teach their children and so on. Like what the internet did to household phones and physical letters, the currency of today will be a vague shadow in the near future.
The car, invented ~1886. The airplane ~1906. First airline 1914. Those were transformative times if you were born in the 1880's. New technology changed the world in such a short time. 1971 - USA removes the gold standard from paper money. How long was this going to last? 50 years, yeah it did. It's about to end, because there's finally a choice. All due to technology invented in such a short time frame that no one could control it.
5 years ago, I could not have said the same thing with certainty. What has changed? Secret information I guess.

It is important to note that the loss of your money in the fiat system is only 'insured' to make you feel better when the banks eventually screw up and print too much money. Your deposits are insured! Wow feels much better now, guess I can ignore the fact that they are printing billions of new dollars every day!
I think Bitcoin makes you - and your mind - a bank. As such you really are supposed to look after things as if you were a bank. Securing your vault and insuring your business practices. Instead of making fake policy to protect your citizen's fiat money from being 'lost' should the government screw up, you really, really have to pay for it if you screw up and lose your wallet on Bitcoin.
I think services will come on line in the future to do this. I can already imagine a Bitcoin bank - not custodial like exchanges, but actual banks where you store your wallets and can only access your wallets with a password you agree upon with your bank. Then you have the ability to access your bank account and interact with your funds without having to secure the wallet files yourself. And the bank will need to maintain security and implement functions to secure your funds. I envision a system like this can work easily - simply the bank could run it's own internal intranet of the Bitcoin blockchain, assigning users their wallets into the blockchain and mining their own blocks just for security purposes. As long as they keep their intranet clear from outside intrusion, their blockchain is maintained and the user data is secure in the blockchain as well, only retrievable when the user provides their private key password and their public key bank account.
Bitcoinception basically. Then you could deal with a trusted bank which is run as a business which yes, you'd pay a fee to every month to maintain your bitcoin and process transactions on your behalf to vendors (likely each time you spent Bitcoin they'd just skim their monthly fee off that transaction so you didn't notice but ya).
If the bank was run well enough it could work I think. Just ideas. Someone, anyone could do it. It's software and a secure intranet. Not hard for a small group of dedicated developers to achieve.

You can, if you want, which is the power in it. You can run your own node, hook up a mining machine, and participate in being both the printing-press of the currency and be a payment processor. So if you want to, you can, whereas with all other currency, you are prohibited through law from doing so (because they want the power to steal from you and don't want others gaining such power).
Just like any currency, you do not have to participate in that. If you are a fisherman, you can fish every day and sell your fish to a restaurant that provides you a room to stay, no money required (this is just an example of barter). A good currency should allow anyone to be able to enter into the space of being the producer/verifier.
No one forces you to use Bitcoin. People do force you to use your nation's currency.

Firstly, the government is made up of people, and people value things that rise in value, and they value things that cannot be devalued. So governments banning the use of Bitcoin by corporations just means they will want to buy it first for themselves, and well... people generally don't fall for that.
Bitcoin is good enough as a store of value - if this is all it does it is still infinitely better than other stores of value. If any nation bans Bitcoin, they force money to stop flowing in their own country, which means their economy would slowly crumble as everyone finds Bitcoin's value still goes up while their fiat dollar still loses value. This is the end result either way; if they accept Bitcoin or ban it, at least if they accept it their economy doesn't crumble as much and can be rebuilt on a sound store of value currency instead of inflationary fiat.


The first people buying Bitcoin, for the past ~8 of the 10 years Bitcoin has been around, have all been regular people. The market doesn't care if you're a corporation. I don't own Bitcoin because I can spend it today, I own it because it stores my value better than anything else. 
It's like... if you value marbles. You can buy lots of marbles with your money. No big deal, you now have a lot of marbles. You're storing your value in marbles. But anyone can make marbles and there's tons of them and people can just make tons of new marbles so it's not a great store of value.
Someone else might like old cars. They value old cars and buy and store old cars. They like them and like working on them and yet there's a lot of old cars and it's really specific what kind of old car someone else likes so it's not a great store of value.
Certain things are good stores of value, like gold, because you can't make lots of gold. And certain stocks are good stores of value because you're storing value into a company which does something in the world and provides a valuable product or service. Stocks are decent stores of value but if that business dies off, you've lost everything.
Gold is a good store of value because it's practically useless for anything else, is rare and hard to find and some people just like the look of it. It has no real purpose outside of sitting there as a heavy, hard to find, rare piece of metal that does nothing. It will likely sit there, doing nothing at all over time, and over time you can always say, "Yep, that's gold and there's not much of it," because unlike marbles you can't just make a bunch more of it.
Bitcoin is the best store of value because it can also be used as a currency where gold no longer can (because gold cannot be divided into 0.00000001 parts easily and spent like that easily) and Bitcoin has a ton of features that make it where you just cannot make more of them. This is a big deal - never in history have we had something that there's-not-more-of-this-thing. So some people like collecting rare baseball cards, or rare Magic cards, or a rare digital card for a video game. Rarity adds value. Bitcoin will never have more than 21 million Bitcoins made. Ever. Not because someone 'won't print any more' but because they cannot print anymore, because the math limits it. Add in all the other things like proof of work and a distributed ledger recording transaction accounts for all time and Bitcoin becomes the natural best store of value you can possibly imagine to date. This means if your goal is to store value, marbles, old cars, gold, baseball cards and so on are *worse choices* for that. Someone can always make more marbles, old cars will always have a different value based on who likes that type of old car, gold is heavy and heavily regulated and hard to transport and hard to divide up, and baseball cards no matter how rare can just be reprinted (though, some value comes from having 'originals' which reprints are not common).
This store of value has no regard for governments. If someone wants to store their value in gold, or in their own business, or in a piece of decorative wood, or whatever, it cannot be stopped. People do the storing of the value. No one else. As such again, if the intention is to store value, pick the one thing known to date where there's not 'more' of it out there. There's more gold in the universe than there is Bitcoin.
So it doesn't matter what any government says. People will do what they do and the governments - you might think they have power over the people - but the governments really have little power over the people, and Bitcoin will remind them (and you) of that.

Eventually one of the sides will solve more blocks faster than the other, due to luck alone, and become the valid blockchain. All the transactions that occurred on the invalid chain would be wiped out. The wiped-out chain would download the full ledger from the trusted blockchain and continue on as a full network, fully healed, although the transactions that got wiped out would have to be dealt with by those who made those transactions. The end result is, still, a ledger that can be highly trusted.

So often, people think it will go lower, because that's what the charts say, without considering adoption rate isn't linear. It's not based on sound judgement and strong analysis of a business's profit margin and business structure and offerings.

I've studied it. I've been around since it was created. I've studied money and how the world works and philosophized about human nature. In the end I see Bitcoin is the best currency that has ever been created to date.
History shows people always moved towards the better currency. From sea shells and other rare monies, to pelts and durable goods, to gold and silver. There is an evolution of money and the people are the ones who pick what money is going to be used. Necessarily, if all the people - who are the farmers and the bakers and the small businesses - if they all begin using Bitcoin, if you're rich and want to eat, you're going to pay them their Bitcoin that they value! Otherwise the rich starve. They don't like starving.
So I know companies will exchange goods and services for Bitcoin because the people already do, and companies already do. The value of Bitcoin rises against all fiat currency in the world, meaning the more the governments print (all governments, as a whole, because currency is relative), the more Bitcoin grows in value. The more it grows in value (because it is non-inflationary) the more the people will see it as a better store of value. And the more valuable it gets, the more they will be willing to use it to buy things. And the more they are willing to use it to buy things, the more businesses will rise up to meet that demand.


Bitcoin is a currency where the value is locked away in a math equation where only you know the answer to the equation. That answer points at your value of Bitcoin owned. We have 21 million Bitcoins, and we spread them out into a practically-infinite sea of possible mathematical equations. So finding one in the wild is more rare than finding life on another planet. Finding one would take more energy than it would take to blow up the entire Earth (this is not hyperbole either). So as a store of value, it is as close to perfect as humans have ever come to date.
Bitcoin is just information to a math problem. Governments have been able to ban gold, and paper dollars, because those things existed in the physical world. You can take gold from someone. You can take their paper dollars. You can try to get them to use your paper dollars and not someone else's. But Bitcoin is information. Your Bitcoin is stored in your mind. How you access your Bitcoin IS Bitcoin. The information in your mind, as to how to access your wallet and recover the answer to the equation which points to the box where your Bitcoin is stored is the value. Your mind becomes a bank. No one can steal your mind. No one can force you to reveal the information about your Bitcoin - they don't even know if you really have any - and if they kill you, they can never steal your Bitcoin because the information will be lost.
So there is no banning Bitcoin. It's pure information with no company at the top to regulate, and nothing but 1's and 0's at the core of it to 'ban'. To ban Bitcoin is to ban all computers and all technology. It's not possible. It is precisely because Bitcoin cannot be controlled or banned that makes it so valuable. No longer do governments own the power monopoly of money. Now there's competition in the biggest industry in the world - money.

It doesn't hinge on government force, an army, a king or a dictator. No one decides except the people making the trade in the moment. The volatility is the heartbeat of a new currency.

Yes but expand the timeline and number of events out long enough and you'll see that dumb criminals no longer get rewarded and thus 'die off' in the evolution of committing crime if they never profit from their crimes.
Normally a dumb criminal can commit a theft, which might include killing someone, and they might profit from it and survive (afford living etc). Over time with less opportunity to be successful the number of instances where theft happens, because it never leads to success, tapers off.
As such in the long run Bitcoin vastly reduces dumb crime and protects your life.

Yes, Bitcoin is being used as a hedge against inflation and more.
I think any lag behind gold is because gold has a lot of interest behind it. Lots of elderly people still love gold and when they stir - and they will stir a bit more easy than younger people - they will make moves practiced over decades.
I doubt you'd find someone 50+ who could ever decide to go all in on Bitcoin. They'll probably split gold/Bitcoin if they have any technical understanding, just because they cannot be sure to trust new technology that late in life.
I think in 10-20 years as old money finds its way down to new hands, the young people will dump gold in favor of Bitcoin. I do not know anyone who is comfortable with digital currency who will value gold and let it sit in any investments unless some kind of trust is set up in their name and they can't do anything about it.
Weird I just realized I would sell gold before BCH.

OK you don't want to mine with your phone. No big deal it's optional. With that said, you have an incentive to at least run it as a node, which is consuming energy and calculation cycles. My point is over time, the amount of such calculations will be small to your phone in comparison to speed and efficiency, where it becomes 'why not'.
For example, if a cell phone carrier/manufacturer becomes a full-Bitcoin loving company, they would be best served to find a way for every single one of their phones to be a Bitcoin node, and mining is not out of the question, since people who enable it might get a free cell phone bill, but you, the phone company, get any mining proceeds. Your (customer's) electric bill pays for your phone bill, so to speak.

No, a 51% attack allows the 51% controller to sign and validate their own transactions - similar to a central bank today. In effect, they could say, "braised_diaper_shit sent me 10 Bitcoin," - but you can do that too, just create your own fork of Bitcoin and you can make your own private ledger seem like anyone sent you any amount.
They could still not unlock your Bitcoin private key.
What would happen is Bitcoin users would swap to a new fork, and permanently kick out whomever tried to do something like that. It's not as big a deal as you might think. It's the same as today where a central bank has over 51% of the power to create money. The difference is users have a choice here.
All governments which use a central bank basically gave the central bank &gt;51% of the power to confirm transactions. In actual use, it might be around 90%, maybe higher (considering barter and other weirdness still happens). The effect is the same.
If I get more than 51% of the power to create the fiat money in a nation, I've gained the power to print my own money that others will accept.

@_date: 2019-07-07 15:26:36
Hehe... market cap... funny one mate.
We do need mass adoption, no doubt, but good currency gets mass adopted. There's a reason the USD is so well adopted - it is well known and people around the world trust it is worth something. Bitcoin can do the same, without boarders or limitation. Not even governments can prevent you from holding Bitcoin and selling it to someone else around the world without being a complete isolated dictatorship like North Korea.
But back to market cap.
If I sell you 0.00000001 BTC, one Satoshi, for a penny, we're assuming a market cap of $20 trillion, right?
$20 trillion / 21 million = price per Bitcoin = ~$950k / 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 = ~$0.009 rounded up to $0.01 or 1 penny.
Market cap is just what all-the-things-are-worth-if-they-were-sold-at-that-worth-in-a-single-moment. But it has no real reflection on how much actual money goes in and out per day.
Amazon has an average daily volume of 4 million, at $1900 per share, is ~$7.6 billion in currency changing hands per day. But their market cap is $956 billion. It doesn't mean there's $956 billion dollars sitting in the company. Half of that could be from people who bought in at $5 and never sold. It just means what it could be worth if everyone sold all at the same time, which is of course illogical since doing so would drive down the price so hard, right?
So if anyone ever buys 100 satoshi for a dollar, we'd see a representative market cap of $20 trillion. I don't see that as too far fetched.
It's not an "insane amount of money" either. Money is a representation of human work effort, or labor. There are at least 7 billion people in the world. Assuming we need some granular amount of currency, that is, we need to cover at least a penny in worth and we need to be able to transact in larger volumes, each person in the world should be represented by some amount of money. That is, their labor is worth something just by being a human who can do stuff. In fact, if inflation was simply tied to the number of people in the economy, we'd never have any monetary issues. So anyway, assume that $30,000.00 is worth 1 person's labor for their whole life. When they die, we remove $30k, and when someone is born, $30k is added to the economy somehow. We'd get a true-value, not just a market cap, of $210 trillion in the world economy with 7 billion people. And again that's a) assuming only $30,000 is worth all the labor of a person's lifetime and b) that there aren't millions of people added to the world every year which would increase that true-valuation.
Instead what we have is banks printing money, as much as they want, by making loans to all these people. Inflation is much higher than the rate of people entering the world, and as such, their system fails as some people's labor is worth more and others worth less. You are worth more when you take out a loan and create debt, and worth less when you save cash into a bank account. In essence, the banks give you the true-value of a future human's value today, with no risk to themselves losing out on their work effort value.
Anyway, it's not an insane amount of money, because it's just printed money. Bitcoin would be worth $100, maybe, if we had sound monetary policy. The price of Bitcoin should not be seen in the sense of, "Wow Bitcoin is at $11k!" Bitcoin should always be viewed as, "Holy crap the USD is weak compared to Bitcoin, you can only get 1 Bitcoin for 11 thousand of that paper stuff!"

Which is why I said sometimes not having to worry about owning a car is worth the price.
Like renting a car - why rent a car, you have your own!
Certain cases it's worth not owning your own car.
Example: You get a job in Seattle and you know it's likely to be a 3 year thing. You plan to move back home when the job is done. You then lease a car vs. buying. 3 years pass, job is done, and its time to move back home. You don't need to deal with the car, and you might not have wanted/needed that kind of car or brand or whatever. Return the lease and head home with no worry about how to move this car.
Financially, not worth it. But the peace of mind is.

If you're young, go for it. Good luck. Put everything you have into Bitcoin if you have learned about the technology and think it is a good idea. There's a better chance that it will 'pay off' in a few years compared to anything else you do. And if you ever hit tough times, it's not too hard to sell some and take the fiat out to deal with life problems.
One of the reasons I'm not fond of debt is because when you take out debt you're causing inflation. So you might get a house today but you're making your money more worthless tomorrow. It's good for you today, for sure. But everyone else pays for it later. It really sucks and is sickening once you can see in your mind the gears of the inflation economy at work.

Literally anyone with your email can call them and PayPal reps just "OK phone number changed."

Because computers are made to be faster and faster at doing work over time, where your efficient phone doing even 10% of some minor work 10 years from now is valuable in a pool of billions.

That's the problem with hypotheticals - they often don't make any sense and then the person posing the hypothetical can make remarks questioning the hypothetical and seem like they've got a point when in reality it just shows a lack of understanding of the person posing the hypothetical.
You're constructing an argument field where if someone does not argue on your illogical and flawed reasoning you will respond, "But that's not the point of this hypothetical."
All your hypothetical shows is that your premise, that some people here just want to get rich and must be weeded out and are perhaps 'in it for the wrong reasons' is completely skewed by your own bias. That's why you needed an illogical hypothetical to structure your argument from, because if you posed your argument with any bit of honesty you would just say, "I think people who are into Bitcoin just to get rich are bad people," and everyone would destroy you on the equal argument 'battlefield' that such a position would have to be debated upon.
Basically it shows you are weak minded and need support from a completely illogical playing field to have the courage to pose your argument.

My 1% is just based on one thing - and the only thing that should affect currency valuation - the rate the population increases. Indeed, it could be 1-2%, but that's why I mention it.


I mean, kind of. You have to eat, right? You'll still go out, eat, drink, buy gas, "consume" yeah? So the world will still exist. Your next question is more of the 'concern' I think.


Because you believe in something. You've spent 20 years working, you're 40 now, and you have 10 years worth of labor saved up because you didn't waste money, you saved it. And saving is good in a fixed economy. So you have 10 years labor worth something. You can coast on those 10 years of savings if you want, gaining only 0.02 years worth (2%) of spending power each year, so you're not going to live off that 10 years labor forever, right?
So you find something, either a business you start yourself, or something to invest in, that you think will bring more value to the world. And if you believe in it, you will back it with your money. No longer will people be rewarded for playing loosely with the labor of future people. You will only lend what you can afford to lose.
Now, this does have some kind of issue - stealing the labor from people can be powerful. Some people just don't produce much in the world. So stealing it from them to use as you feel is best probably sounds good. Otherwise their labor goes to waste. And in doing so, you decide which businesses succeed and which fail today. Because you have all this extra money to put wherever you feel it should go. With human nature, you treat your friends and family better, give them more of the money, and the rest of the human population loses out, while you got to pick the winners and the losers.
I've heard that argument in some fashion before - that the economy just won't be as active - and it is a lie. It just won't be in control of the bankers. That's it. The same technology will exist, and the same drive to produce great things will exist. In fact, we have no idea how many good ideas were suppressed, only because the people who had those ideas either didn't want to play with the current banking/loan system, couldn't engage with the system, or were pushed into poverty due to this system before they could reach their potential.
With a fixed currency supply, you can save up years of labor and then decide what to do and take your time. You can go to school for 4 years and not worry about your money losing value. You can start a business. You can save up for a house in a reasonable timeframe, knowing you're not working against all the people inflating the economy by taking out loans. There is no flaw in this kind of system, and keep in mind, it was never ever possible to occur before Bitcoin.

Almost all successful ventures achieve "200,000 percent."
Amazon was an idea, someone took that idea and bought the first business-related item. Maybe some boxes. Those boxes were the first capital invested in the Amazon company. If we could track those initial investments to make the first sale, we'd see the current valuation of Amazon would show a 200,000,000x growth.
Amazon has also been around 10+ more years than Bitcoin.
Amazon is only valued since it became a publicly traded company. We only know its starting value due to its IPO back in 1997. Bitcoin as a technology that is currency has a known valuation from the very beginning. That's why the numbers look so big. They're not that big compared to other things, but it's also only been 10 years and I think that is where the story is. It's not a 50 year old company like Apple or a 22 year old Amazon, it's a 10 year old shot in the dark technology currency idea.
As such the massive growth in the short time frame is the 'magic' to focus on. "Who could have known" is more accurate a story.

This was a major vulnerability I considered, but in the end, you have to dismiss it due to the complexity of shutting down all wired, wireless, satellite and ground communication in order to isolate any one area of the world.
It is not worth considering an even split - this is pretty much impossible - but consider a state such as Alaska being cut off from the network for a week. If during that time, internal Bitcoin blocks were mined and internal (to Alaska) transactions were made, when Alaska reconnects to the major network, all those transactions will be made invalid, even if they had many confirmations in the local network.
Yes, that means if you bought supplies with BTC during that time and then the networks reconnected, your balance would not show that you spent Bitcoin, and the vendor would have lost out.
Of course, the vendor has a receipt for the transaction in common format and will be able to show you never paid for your supplies, so they could demand payment and take you to court if you decided to try and capitalize on the network being disrupted and didn't want to actually pay the vendor anything.
If Russia isolates itself for a long period of time, and releases it's own internal Bitcoin software whereby the Russian Bitcoin network will no longer talk to the worldwide network no matter what, then there's just a hard fork in Russia, and well... anyone who owned Bitcoin would also own RussiaBitcoin too.
The eastern nations use a lot of satellite for communications, so I don't expect any kind of network outage to really occur. It would be wise for large mining operations to have direct satellite internet and redundant systems in case something like this occurs.

The price is what any two people, or entities, or bots, or whatever, decide they're willing to trade for at that moment.
Think of... writing code (browsed your history for a quick something to relate to).
Would you write code for me for a year for... $1?
No of course not. Your time is worth more than that. But... what does it mean where time has worth? It means that for the time you spend doing something, you need to be able to provide for your own survival at the bare minimum, and hopefully upkeep a decent standard of living.
Would you write code for me for a year for $1,000,000?
Yes, very likely, for $1 million you'd work a year for me. But I, the person paying you, might be overpaying for your labor. I consider that I could hire 20 people for a year for that amount maybe, maybe more, or maybe less. They might not all be as good quality but I can roll the dice. It doesn't seem too good to pay $1 mil for just one person for a year though.
So we have an extreme where you will not work, and an extreme where I will not pay.
We then work towards the middle, towards some understanding of what value your labor is worth. You consider that at the bare minimum, you need like $24k per year to survive, but it won't be a good life, so you want more. I then come down and say, well if he's good at coding, he might make my company a lot of money, so maybe $100k per year, since he might make me $1 mil per year in returns. You come back and since you know you can make the company a lot of money, since you consider you can probably make this company $1 million per year, you counter offer for $200k/year.
This repeats until we get some value of your labor and agree on a price which becomes your salary.
The back and forth swinging of the price of Bitcoin is due to thousands of transactions going on, some by bots, some by people, some by whales, some by some guy getting his first 0.0005 BTC. All together in an open marketplace, all constantly evaluating what someone else is willing to pay for the thing at hand. Everyone is making trades with the idea that this thing might be worth more or less in the future. The price any unit of Bitcoin trades for is where the price someone thinks Bitcoin is worth less (the seller) matches up with a person who thinks it's worth more (the buyer). That fine line can change dramatically from one moment to the next, and you get the current market value. Some market values are higher, and then immediately lower - this is usually due to volume. A strong trade at a certain market value sort of indicates there's a good support for the price being that level. If someone is willing to put in millions of dollars at a price point, it suggests the price should really be at that level. Then you have a lot of people buying and selling around this level, those who think it will go up or down based on any number of reasons and there's no actual way anyone can define it. The value is whatever two people think it's worth in the moment.

It is bad advice unless you're certain of Bitcoin's success. In which case it's not bad advice. It's the exact same bad advice from people who said, "Buy Amazon. Put everything you have in it today even though it looks like they're not making any money. Amazon is cheap at $10 I promise, just take the risk."
All you had to do was foresee the internet's takeover of retail markets and the subsequent closure of many retail outlets due to the success of the giant online retail seller(s). Most people probably realized this the moment they ordered a single thing online using dial-up, but failed to see the bigger picture of which company would become the giant, or didn't care to look.

First I'll point out a fallacy:


No. If a small business makes $1000/day on average and processes 100% of their transactions through a credit card, that business is paying 2-3% transaction fee for that. So that $1000 cost them $30 to process. Over a month, that's $900. Ask any small business what they pay in credit card processing fees. They pay a lot.


No. A small business doesn't get their money the same day. Credit card transactions are batched and processed once per day at best. This means the money doesn't land in the bank account of the business until the next day usually. They have to wait 24 hours for "confirmation" that they indeed got paid. If someone using a credit card calls and cancels the payment, or does anything in that 24 hour period to disrupt their payment to you, it gets into a legal battle right away. Businesses are just hoping no one goes through that trouble before the payment is processed and they receive their money *and even then* the customer has ways to get a refund by claiming 'fraud' or 'service/product not as described' even on a legitimate transaction and the payment processor will take money out of the business's next batch of funds until the issue is resolved.
Bitcoin can process $1000 in transactions very cheap, and very fast, much much faster, and much less expensive, than current payment processing systems. The only reason the antiquated system seems faster is due to the smoke and mirrors payment processors like Visa do to make the customer not realize they are paying more for services because the business has to increase prices a bit to cover the transaction fee. Truly if you trusted Bitcoin just as much as Visa, you could let a customer pay, and if you run your own node at your shop and see the transaction populate the mempool, you're pretty certain it will go through - no need to 'wait' for confirmation. The same level of trust exists with Visa except you have to wait 24 hours to know if it actually 'went through'.
1. Store of value. See Venezuela.
2. Spread adoption, get the value of BTC up to where it should be (at least $100k), and then a few $100 price swing isn't going to impact people in any meaningful way. The only way to get hodlers to spend is when the value to do so is high, but there will always be hodlers - or just people who save for the future - and the value will rise to meet them one day.
3. Why would you want a non-consensual transaction?

I wouldn't give you a single satoshi for your nugget of gold. Value is completely subjective. Nothing has intrinsic value - everything is valued by the individual.
A simple example: during a particularly devastating natural disaster, your gold might not be able to buy a single meal.
I'm tempted to agree to a social value of things, if I think about it more. There is some value in knowing what others value something at. Value by association I guess. Still, not intrinsic, but reasonable to consider that something does indeed have value to the masses just by being what it is. In the end, this is just faith I guess, not 'real'.

You're welcome. Remember, as a currency, Bitcoin is no different than USD. You go to work for money. You want money because it allows you to buy things. When you first learned you could do some work and someone would pay you money so you could buy things, you immediately wanted more money!
Bitcoin is a future currency. So if you buy it now, you're getting it at a discount - that is why the price goes up. And in the future, you will want more Bitcoin. But that means waiting, and only like 10% of Bitcoin buyers have the willpower to not sell long term. But if you're young, just do it, you have the time where everyone else has less time.

If you bought 0.1 BTC, you will ALWAYS have 0.1 BTC. Some people will say you lose value because the market value has gone down, but this is only the case in the immediate moment. If you look back, nearly everyone who kept their Bitcoin for a few years has been happy with that decision. So don't worry about it too much and live your life, secure your keys, and buy more when you look and think it's at a good price.

Yeah they're guessing some values to add into the block header to hope to get a hash of the block header which beats the difficulty. That hash must include the previous block's hash. So there's a link - a blockchain.
They are competing, spending lots and lots of money on electricity, to guess that number/value.
What they're doing is proving that work has been performed, and preventing anyone else from going back and making a change and re-doing all the work. Proof of work is necessary to the ledger and is really the key innovation.
Unlike a traditional Excel spreadsheet keeping track of who owes you money, in Bitcoin, in order to go back and change a transaction (with Excel, you can just go to the cell and change the value instantly) you have to re-work all the blocks after the change you wanted to make, spending basically millions of years solo-mining the old blocks to try and create a valid chain. If you release an invalid chain, all the nodes mark it invalid and you wasted millions of years solo-mining for nothing.

 NOT. USE. ROBINHOOD.
Or any other service which does not allow you to withdraw your Bitcoin directly to your own personal wallet.
You're just betting on the Bitcoin price.
If you buy at $13k and the price drops down to $8k - you can't sell without taking a loss, and you can't just "hodl" because *you don't own anything.* So you're stuck with a loss and nothing to your name. And if in time, Robinhood decides to shut down, they take it all with them. You lose everything.
Poland just had an exchange shut down. Do not, ever, think you're safe.
If I open a business and say, "Yeah buy BTC here, we just don't ever hand BTC to you, but you can sell it (this BTC you don't own I just say you own it) back to us any time." What does that sound like? It sounds like a scam. Because it is a scam.

Yes, for the same quantity and quality of the element, it should fetch the same price.
BUT! What about diamonds!? Someone turned these damn carbon crystals into non-fungible elements! What the heck!? Well, that's the thing. If I loan someone a diamond ring for a photo shoot, I want that same diamond ring back when they return it, not something else! So the idea of fungible is just that - an idea. It's the idea that in order to facilitate trade, legally, some things are no different than something else. In fact, you might value crude oil from Texas higher than crude oil from Mexico, because you're able to sell it to someone else who you've convinced it has special magical properties. But in terms of trade, currency and commodities, 1 equals 1 when making the deal.


I'm tempted to say it is a component. I cannot think of something fungible which cannot also be divided. The idea of fungibility is that you are considering the value of something, not an inherent property. So for example, if you ordered 100 barrels of oil, and someone brought you 50 from Texas, and 50 from Mexico, you just accept the delivery. You don't cancel your order because it was divided up somehow.
A $20 can be 'divided' into 20, $1 bills. And so on. So again, tempted to say it is a component.


Like I mentioned regarding the magical Texas oil, it is kind of grey and on a spectrum like you said. It's just an idea. If you do indeed value crisp $100 bills, or magical Texas oil, then you can definitely pay more for them, and try to get someone to sell dirty $100 bills, or Mexican oil, for less. But when it comes to the legal contract of signing a trade deal, you're not going to win in court and get out of a contract by telling the judge, "But he didn't bring me *crisp* $100 bills!"

I think you're not following the key part - rate of buying Bitcoin.
At his current **rate** of buying Bitcoin, if price remains constant, he will be able to purchase a lambo from his investments **over time** in 2037.
In other words, if you buy 0.01 Bitcoin per-time-period how long lambo?
The idea is to keep adding and hodl, yes, and *if you do that* at his rate, you'll lambo in 2037 if price remains static, which it won't, it'll go up, so much sooner for this fellow.

This is why you are not taught about money in school. Imagine the following scenario:
Bob and Alice go to a nice school. The teacher is teaching about money today. The teacher invites Bob and Alice up to practice how money works using Monopoly money.
Teacher: "Ok class, we're going to see Bob do some work for Alice. Bob, please move the chair across the room for Alice."
Bob moves the chair across the room for Alice.
Teacher: "Ok class, Bob has performed work for Alice. Since he did work for Alice, Alice is going to pay Bob for the work he performed. Alice, please give Bob $100."
Alice gives Bob $100.
Teacher: "And now class, I get $6."
Imagine the absolute terror of the children who then have to ask why the teacher gets $6 for doing no work, sitting there watching. No one would use this system.
"Why do you get $6," the class exclaims!
Teacher: "Because I am the central bank, and I printed the money you use, so I felt like printing more for myself."
The class asks the natural next question, "So every time we do $100 in work you get to print $6 for yourself?"
Teacher: "Yes, of course, I'm the bank, I can do what I want, and if you disagree with me, you get detention."
The theft of your money seems small, but it exists over time. The banks skim money off you and everyone else, and they don't teach you this, so by the time you learn about it, you're adjusted to the system and just go with the flow of things. You're turned into a beast of burden for the benefit of someone else and you can't do anything about it. Until now, with Bitcoin, when you can reject that system and only put value in a system that does not allow the printing of money. Your life is good enough where you don't have to question the theft. It works for you. You can continue living your life without caring about it. It's not that big of a theft, to you, individually, anyway. If you research further, you will see that mentality cannot be further from the truth.

I covered this in that an exchange like Coinbase using USDC is doing what any company does when it holds an account in their records for customers. If you return a mattress to Ikea, you might get an in-store credit for the amount. As an exchange, they are also heavily incentivized against destroying their own business - if they accept Tether, they already do not value their business enough to maintain their own internal accounting.
Tether has no reason not to manipulate the market as much as possible - and again they cannot help it even if they wanted to - and as such only exists as a trojan horse. There was no $5 billion "MISTAKE" of minting Tether. They just tested the reaction of the public. Nothing like that is accidentally done. It's meant to gauge the tolerance level of the public for more manipulation.
The exchange that uses Tether will lose their reputation and business as a whole when Tether finally compromises them fully. Until then, the exchange profits, so if they make enough profit, they probably don't care, they could even collude with Tether to be taking cuts of any profit. Remember, only the crypto users are hurt in this. Anyone holding Tether will be the ones running to Tether when it finally crashes, asking to get their money back. It is possible, if the exchange trusts Tether, that they would accumulate a lot of Tether in holdings instead of Bitcoin or something else, and get truly burned, but I think any exchange that accepts Tether has already been compromised, because it's such an unnecessary risk otherwise. Any exchange can just keep accounts on their own books representing a stablecoin. The idea of a stablecoin is literally an Excel spreadsheet saying, "I owe you $10 USD." It's no different than if a small business owes you in-store credit for a returned purchase.

Right now, I know it's hard because you have emotions to deal with, but only 10% of the people who bought Bitcoin actually hold it. If you can just... do it once. Suck it up and buy just 0.1 BTC and just hold. Store your wallet super secure in multiple places and forget about for a long time. Just in case, just maybe. You will make up for every 'failure'.
To be fair we needed people doing what you did to spread adoption. Thank you.

Anyone who thinks Ross Ulbricht is the worst-guy-ever just keep in mind how the media manipulates stories and writes everyone as the worst person ever.
Most people bought the media lie that Martin Shkreli is a bad guy because he raised the cost of his drug 5000%. I bought that story too initially; and for a couple years at least. After I actually learned about him and his company, realized his drug only goes towards a small number of patients each year, learned it used to cost $14 (now $750), that he offers it for free to people who have no insurance that cannot pay, that the cost was because of healthcare laws which forced insurance companies to pay whatever the drug cost is so he's capitalizing on the corrupt laws, that the drug is harmful to patients' well-being when they use it but helps with their disease, and that the guy was raising the price to put those profits into funding and researching a better drug for the same disease, I had a different outlook on the situation. Many drug companies have skyrocketed their drug prices. A family member with cancer for example has an $11k/month prescription right now. I vowed to not trust the media's take on people after gaining that knowledge of Shkreli, but most people bought the media narrative and now most uninformed people think he's a bad guy for the business move.
As such I'm not going to pass judgement just because the media says so and I hope more people do the same. Not everything is actually as sensational as the headline. I do not know much about Ross Ulbricht so I can neither give sympathy or support, I can only say it's not always what you're told to believe.

An exchange which begins holding more and more funds in Tether becomes ripe for a full crash.
It is my opinion that this is what Tether is meant to do, to trojan-horse exchanges and Bitcoin-related infrastructure. If all the major exchanges use Tether, at some point there will be a huge reliance on Tether, and if they shut down any/all payments at the right moment (Tether closes shop), every exchange using it will 'crash'. So indirectly, because all the exchanges crash, people will assume Bitcoin is a bad idea, and will sell like mad on any remaining exchanges, crashing the price there, and crippling the entire market.
I think this is going to happen, period. I think Bitcoin has to survive this kind of manipulation to succeed, and I do believe it will survive even this level of manipulation.
Bitcoin is classified as property, so you can exchange property without incurring capital gains, since you have the same property now as before (Bitcoin-&gt;Tether, same value property in hand, no sale occurred, just a swap), so there is incentive for exchanges to store funds on another property token instead of using USD. This gets more and more exchanges holding more and more of their funds on account into tokens - Tether.
Coinbase uses their own internal token. They'll be the exchange that everyone panic-sells on, since they don't use Tether, while everyone using Tether grinds to a complete halt.
If your exchange uses Tether, you should try and explain this problem to them and get them to secure their own internal token like Coinbase. Right now I think almost all the other exchanges use Tether, so they're set up to fail. They could have been paid off. There's no knowing. It's an unnecessary risk though.

You need to take the time to learn more about money and how it's made.
Fiat money (USD) devalues by ~6% per year due to inflation. Inflation means central banks print more money every day. They take a cut, and the rest goes into the economy. That's their business.
Bitcoin will gain value and not have any inflation (that is, very controlled and limited inflation, but a fixed supply any moment). If Bitcoin increases in value only 4% per year, that's a 10% spread in value increase. (keep in mind, Bitcoin does a lot better than 4%)
So if your concern is 'why is no one trading it' it's because fiat exists, and people holding Bitcoin over fiat will always be profiting more over people who just hold fiat.


People are using it. As a store of value over time. Eventually the fiat becomes so weak that people sell their Bitcoin and buy things. They will begin to prioritize people who accept Bitcoin directly, because it's easier and safer and so on to deal with people who accept Bitcoin directly. When the car dealership takes Bitcoin and Bitcoin is $100k per coin, they will certainly do whatever they can to earn Bitcoin. Eventually they too will get wrapped into the Bitcoin economy and will begin spending and saving it and so on.
Bitcoin will always gain value over fiat. Since we can always convert Bitcoin into fiat, we're still spending fiat. Currencies are relatively equal. If you have $100 USD, you have 10,000 JPY. You just have to find the means to convert it. There's no difference though. Both the JPY and USD get you the same product.
Since Bitcoin is working and successful *merely* as a store of value is good enough, but you want to know why it's not being traded. The reason it's not being traded is because it is grossly undervalued compared to fiat. Just holding Bitcoin is making you money over fiat. It will take until Bitcoin is comparable to fiat, and beats it, and makes fiat worthless before people truly go out and spend Bitcoin every day. At that point the value is $10M+ per coin.
We're in the very early stages of the transition period between the old fiat money systems and a true non-inflationary cryptocurrency world. People who pay attention to new monies in the past can see that holding on to the new currency always does well for them in the long run. Eventually mass of people will adopt the better currency, and that is when it will no longer be traded. Then it will be used, to buy food, to pay rent, to buy a house, to get a paycheck. All in the new form of currency.
This isn't a bad thing. This gives the technology all sorts of time to figure stuff out as it grows. And as it grows it receives funding by people coming into the arena for the first time.
As long as you can spend in USD, because JPY isn't as valuable, you will do so. Why don't you use JPY? Because it's not worth as much to you. It's 100 JPY to 1 USD. Why would you hold it? But if JPY was earning you 10% every single year, you'd hold all the JPY, and you'd notice over time that JPY is not 100 to 1, but begins being 50 to 1 USD, and 1:1 USD, and then 1 JPY would get you 10 USD. Bitcoin is 1 Bitcoin for $10,000 USD. So as long as governments and central banks print money, it will be in your best interest to hold Bitcoin, and convert it for fiat when you need to buy something. That's why no one is trading it; giving it up is not worth it, and doesn't need to be. Storing value is use enough as a reason to hold it.
A fast and easy currency is not a good store of value. Facebook's Libra will not be a good store of value (necessarily it will have a zero-store-of-value and never increase in value because by design they're taking all the value out of your dollars when you buy Libra).
Today gold is still traded, but it's on another level. Central banks buy it and ship it around and melt it down and play games with it. But it's still traded and highly valued in those areas. Would you say gold is not traded? Is not a currency? It is, but only to the super-rich banking systems. Bitcoin competes with that.
Finally I'd remind you that the timeframe for a people to accept a new form of currency is fairly long. When gold was first introduced it was not like immediately everyone knew what price gold was, and they didn't have coins at first, and it was hard to figure it out and find how to facilitate gold into trade. Over a long, long time people found out how to mint gold, and then governments took control and so on and so forth. It was never instant. Bitcoin is super new, super young, and you can buy this future currency at a discount today - not use it - and wait until it becomes more valuable in the future. Then it will be worth it to spend. Then it will have massive infrastructure around it making it easy and seamless to use. Then it will be integrated into every facet of your life just like fiat money is today.
Bitcoin is only 10 years old. The iPhone is 12 years old. Facebook is 15 years old. Amazon is ~20something years old. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, look nothing like they did at the beginning or even 10 years after they began. Get in while it's cheap.

Like Amazon and Apple and Microsoft stock then? Pyramid schemes I tell you! Buy early and hope to make a profit *doing nothing, just owning some of this virtual ownership token!* It's a crazy idea I know.
Imagine those people who bought Amazon at $5 and now can sell for $2k per. Imagine their pyramid scheming.
With Bitcoin the point is the price validates the idea, just like a stock price validates the business is going in a good direction. There's not much difference except Bitcoin is a technology layer and a currency, not a stock, not a company, so it's reach is much greater overall. Amazon has no business in Iran. Bitcoin does.

I was corrected here on a previous post. I'm not sure the mechanism technically for a long orphan chain, but here's information regarding it:
If the valid, but longer, say 50 block Alaskan chain reconverges with the longer, 2000 block rest-of-the-world chain, the 50 block chain becomes an orphan and transactions are pushed back into the mempool. I'm not sure how it would handle a massive split and a large number of transactions, something I should look into.
Thanks for questioning the idea. I will look into it more to be absolutely sure.

Sure. There's 4996238580 troy ounces of gold. Get your hands on 7. Pretty good deal I guess.
Lots of IFs for gold too. "IF" people continue to value it in the future (younger generations are not seeing it as a store of value) and "IF" you don't get paper gold and "IF" you can trust that you get pure gold and so on.
Bitcoin is an idea not something that's going to go away. We can store value in math - that is valuable as an idea and is not going to disappear. But some people need to hold and feel their gold to feel like they made a good purchase even though if they took a step back they'd see a bland metal that doesn't do anything (which is good). It's a store of value, as is Bitcoin. The exact same properties exist in both, with Bitcoin being better at everything you'd want in a currency.
So get your 7/4996238580 troy ounces of gold for 1/21000000 Bitcoin if you want. I'll stick to the currency I can send around the world without anyone knowing, without risking carrying it, and with security better than any gold vault I could devise.

You're not buying a digital currency on Coinbase. You're *using Coinbase* for them to exchange your fiat money for Bitcoin on your behalf.
So many people are **complete novices** when it comes to exchanges. It's not using Bitcoin, and it's not supposed to be instant, and it's not for weak hands.
You pay a fee to Coinbase for them to transact on your behalf. That fee is the service you're paying for. You're not using Bitcoin one bit - you're using Coinbase to broker a Bitcoin trade for you. As such they are going to comply with every single law they're told to comply with. You have the option of going anywhere else, but to put the blame on Coinbase is extremely naive.
Coinbase can *only* piss you off if **you're a complete novice to trading and exchanges.**

You're early! Welcome to the show. Like I said, you have to convince others in your town that it's a good idea, and slowly but surely everyone will come around to the idea, just like everything else. We had dial-up in the 90's and the internet exploded in the 2000's. We're in dial-up right now. It's fun. Get to see all the new stuff happening.
But you're probably going to want SOME kind of computer. You just need "A" computer, like a tablet, smart phone, smart watch, really any slow as heck old piece of junk can send a payment, if it can connect to the internet. And if not - like I said, paper wallet is still doable and very reliable for the person receiving it.
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:40:17
Yes, except no matter what you decide to exchange in, there is only one currency which also stores value the way it does, and that is Bitcoin. So the time between now and when Bitcoin is just more reliable and easier to use than exchanging Bitcoin into fiat or other unknown currencies isn't much of an issue. We'd like for it to happen tomorrow but that doesn't matter - I mean, it matters to our life, right, but as a whole, the idea is good and will persist through time. The properties that make Bitcoin a great currency are why it will grow over time.
Adoption is the only limitation. So we should all do what we can to spread out adoption rates.
We're very early. In 10 years we will be internet-old and then concerns will be more worth... concerning yourself with.

I agree, which is why I debated the idea for a few days in my post history. Lightning is setting up watchtowers - basically you run a node at home that watches for an old-state transaction to be posted. If that happens, your node at home transmits a 'justice' transaction, closing the channel in your favor. In nearly all cases, this is in favor of the business, not the customer.


This isn't true. In a situation like this, if you went to the business that closed on your channel (because malware sent a fake initial-state closure on your behalf), you could ask for a refund since you did not initiate the fraudulent closure, and they would likely reinstate your account and open a new channel with you. If you're a customer with a $100 channel to a grocery store and you're at $90 and malware ends up forcing a closure and the grocery store got $10 there's not much risk and the business is going to want to stay in favor with their clients and refund the money, since their internal books and accounting shows the customer did in fact only buy $90 of product. In this situation, I'm assuming you, the customer, were forced through malware to send a closure transaction of the initial channel state, in an attempt to defraud the business, and the business's node and watchtowers perform a justice transaction, scooping up the entire balance.
Also, money is never really 'lost' in Bitcoin in this case, only states on the transaction.


The penalties would be on the watchtowers, which if you ran your own, there's no penalty to yourself. A third-party watchtower, I agree is a bad idea as I covered in my posts. Lightning should be kept in small amounts and channels closed on a regular if infrequent basis (no more than necessary to maintain trust).


Then you should know these are solvable problems. We trust in human innovation if given the chance. We will find the best solution. Think over the idea of how computers - AI - would handle a cash transaction. It is exactly how lightning is set up.

I'll give you a simple example: say you loan 10 BTC to someone. They go and use 5 of it, and then tell you they can no longer pay you back, but give you 5 BTC back. According to your loan terms, let's they owe you 5 BTC.
You sue them. You take them to court and the court decides in your favor - this person is to pay you 5 BTC back. Is the court requiring that the exact same 5 BTC be returned to you, or the fungible equivalent?
The word is basically just a thought experiment, so if you try to put modifiers to it, every single thing that could be fungible fails. If you think gold is fungible, I can destroy that idea by saying gold minted a certain way is worth more or less than gold minted a way that I prefer. That's not the point of the word. The point is to give some idea to the thought of "does a unit of this object perform the same as another unit of this object" and, outside external modifiers, yes, Bitcoin does.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:54:10


So it needs trust before watchtowers.
But with watchtowers are we not just outsourcing trust to a third party? I'm not seeing much in terms of answers (maybe it's too new of tech to describe) just people saying "watchtowers" like the "aliens" meme.
I've read two ideas; one is you connect to a watchtower whom you pay to watch your transaction. This like I said, can be compromised, if the price is right, so I think this fails.
The other idea is to have every watchtower watch every transaction, making a second 'mining' layer of the network. This seems ok except if no one is stealing from the system then you are doing a lot of work for nothing and no one would run a watchtower, because it's not a thing, meaning there would be few watchtowers, which leaves open vulnerabilities. Still, this method seems more secure, but counters itself in terms of incentive.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:11:25
Like I said, in the way you are using the word, anything can be determined non-fungible, simply because someone says so.
If I loan someone 100 Monero, and they only pay back 50, and I take them to court, the judge only has to say, "The value of the unpaid balance of the loan is $50 and the defendant may not use Monero to pay back the loan because it's not valid in this case," to make it non-fungible if you use the term incorrectly.
At least it makes sense now as to why you jumped at this topic :)
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:51:07


Are you saying the internet?
Damn this is good. Yes, convenience wise it would be a pain in the ass to manually write down hashes and move transactions around if the internet was wiped from the face of the Earth. I'd still trust Bitcoin more than any other currency in that end-of-the-world scenario. Just wouldn't be too convenient. We'd replace wired internet connections with running messengers who ferry paper transactions across vast distances. I mean..
It's kind of absurd. I've considered this and many other threats and this is one that still, still doesn't matter that much. If I'm in Venezuela and I find out I cannot reach the rest of the world, I hold my Bitcoin. Don't spend it for that period. That's all. Get out of the area that is isolating you. After you're out, you've got your Bitcoin, because it exists as cryptography on the network.
The same could be said for prison/jail. You get locked up for 5 years - don't spend any Bitcoin, right? When you get out, you can spend Bitcoin again. It's not actually that difficult. If you get cut off from the world, just don't spend. The real threat is if you didn't know you got cut off from the world.
Even in that case, I was corrected by someone else who mentioned that when a block chain gets rejected by the bigger ledger, all the transactions return into the mempool. So those transactions that did get placed simply lose their blockchain confirmations and return to the mempool. From there, once the isolated area rejoins the network, eventually all those transactions still post. The risk of this is if someone spends their Bitcoin inside the isolation - and outside the isolation - at the same time. Then the isolated transaction will be seen as invalid and the person 'double-spent'. Legal action can remedy this though.
So, you could in effect take your 100 BTC down to Venezuela and try and buy 100 BTC worth of oil. You then shut down the internet for Venezuela to the outside world while at the same time posting a 100 BTC sell order to USD back in the USA. Inside the now cut-off Venezuela, 6 confirmations occur within the nation for your payment. The vendor thinks they are good to go. The vendor in Venezuela gives you the oil and you take off on your boat. After some time, your stranglehold on the internet slips, and the nation rejoins the world network. Since Venezuela now has a smaller blockchain, theirs gets rejected. Since yours was already written into the bigger blockchain, your 100 BTC is spent. So your 100 BTC transaction in Venezuela gets treated as invalid. The vendor loses out on 100 BTC.
I'm a fan of going into detail if you have more concern.

Seed: You get 24 words out of 2048 possible words. If you do the math, there's more combinations than would be reasonable to guess over time. And then when you add in the 25th, private password, the chance becomes near impossible.
There are roughly 25892008055647378700916274834106651525738683598033725572049016676308484096000000 combinations, before your private passcode, which adding the passcode sends this already impossible number into universal orbit.
In comparison, if you have a 10-digit email password with upper/lowercase, a number and a symbol, there's roughly: 3743906242624487424 combinations.
If you can guess at an email password 1 million times per second, it would take over 100,000 years to guess someone's 10 digit password. So compare that email password combination number with the seed word number above.
Your seed words together, in the right order, with your passcode, to point at the point in that huge number where your Bitcoin is stored, basically. So one in more-atoms-than-exists-in-our-solar-system is where your Bitcoin is stored, and only you know the combination that points to that location in the math, basically.
Bitcoin isn't stored on your computer. It can be thought of as existing in a lockbox in a math formula where your private key points to that specific location in that huge number. You're given a receiving address that is public, where anyone else can send Bitcoin to that math function where your private key points to. It's all done by math really; nothing actually physically moves. Just information.
The seed words are used because it allows you to recover your private key in more human terms. A normal private key looks like this: 5JKwwV5BPr7e68sCFqDr8ZAF9EeyqAHJvF7TFnEYa3FL6b2H8Jm
That's an actual private key. Your seed words basically make up something like that; easier to write down or remember or split up the seed words than that string of characters.
So your seed words, along with your 25th passcode, always point to the same private key like the one above. You don't even need the Ledger for this. If you lose the Ledger or break it, all that matters are the 24 words and the passcode for recovering your Bitcoin. With that in mind, if anyone else gets your 24 words, they could try to brute force your passcode, but if your passcode is 10+ digits long, chances are they're not going to unlock it. So it's super safe. So never write down your passcode, always remember it, make it not an email password, make it something you will never forget, like your first/middle/last name, your mom's first/middle/last, and dad's first/middle/last all combined or something you know is super simple for you but no one else is going to guess it.
This also means your Ledger doesn't matter in the long run; as long as you have those 24 words and your passphrase you've got your Bitcoin (and its just a matter of finding a wallet to import your words/passphrase to then access it). So make back ups of those seed words and store copies in super secure places where they won't get seen but where you can access them in case your house burns down or some other craziness happens.
Ledger is just a device that stores your private key not on your computer. So when you sign a transaction to send, it's easy and done on the Ledger (software sends the transaction to your Ledger device to be signed, Ledger sends it back to the computer for transmission) and not your computer, which could have malware or a virus hunting for you wallet file. So it secures the use of your private keys in that way.

If I know the person's node is their phone and they don't use a watchtower I have a 100% chance of successfully stealing from that channel by use of physical violence or other physical means. This information can be obtained over vast timeframes and since Bitcoin rises in value, so too does the channel value.


Now you're finally getting it! Except when the incentive grows, so does the chance of that actually happening, like if the person saw you pocket a huge stack of $100 bills before heading to the restroom.


1 BTC back when you were still a virgin was not worth a damn thing. 1 BTC is enough for someone to kill you today. The value of BTC rises constantly, and adds incentive over time without the person owning that BTC doing anything, just living their life. You don't get it, that's ok, just realize physical risk grows over time when you leave a channel open long term. This is unique to Bitcoin compared to fiat cash, and should be acknowledged seriously. The harm I see is if third party watchtowers make people too complacent in opening channels and leaving them open for very long terms where they don't realize their channel is now a tempting target for a bad actor. This is only a big risk in the transition period between now and mass adoption when the value of Bitcoin stabilizes, but over time it will become less of a risk.


Most people are; you'll figure this out in time. Remember, Bitcoin and Lightning are supposed to reach the greater masses over time. So do think about the fact that a huge volume of actions will be stupid ones. Many people will mishandle their money. Many people will be irresponsible.


It has nothing to do with that. The increase in value over time can make an otherwise amicable relationship turn into one where due to the value increase one party wishes to obtain the full value of the channel and would commit physical violence to do so.

That is only a mistake when talking about products though. Currency is the medium of exchange of all products. As such if it is a good form of currency, it eventually takes over the entire world. The first people who found gold and decided it looked good had no market. They'd have traded away a brick of gold for some food. Eventually people realized it was a good store of value and the brick of gold can now buy you a lot more than just some food. It didn't need to be a product and they didn't have to sell it to anyone; adoption caused the price to go up so much even the most powerful nation in the world had to stop backing their money with it because they couldn't keep up with demand, as physical gold was not possible to divide up into tiny fractions.
OP's use of the reality of a future currency is correct because we can look ahead much easier today to see where the future is going. Are we growing more or less digital? Are we going to want more or less war? If we create AI, will it be using gold coins to transact or a 'digital gold'? Are stores of value historically a good thing or a bad thing? We have information as to what makes a good store of value, and Bitcoin checks off every single feature you'd want in a currency. So if you can hold that 'brick of gold' today - that 0.3 BTC that's worth a single cheap vacation today - and wait, adoption is occurring much faster than gold ever did, and in 10 years that 0.3 BTC will set someone up for life.
Bitcoin is not a product, it's an idea, a currency, a means of comparing value, where no arbitrary person can come along and print more of it out of thin air. History has shown good currencies become worldwide currencies. The USD was the world reserve currency just because everyone considered it as such. It's not forever, it will change, it's just a matter of time, and we have the ability to look ahead a bit today and realize we're right in the middle of the transition period between currencies.

Mining today is as it has always been - it is either good as a hobby where you like to participate in the system and enjoy the technical side of things knowing you might not be making a 'profit' on a day-to-day basis but you don't mind paying the electricity cost and getting some Bitcoin along the way is fun.
Or you can run it as a business, meaning you invest a lot of money into setting up infrastructure, getting the orders for a large number of mining devices, and running the place like you own your own business, taking profits out of managing your large network to pay for your bills, owning your job basically.
There's not a middle ground where you can just hook up a couple miners and make profit, and there basically never was. It has always shown to be better to just buy the Bitcoin versus mine it, but if you run it like a business there is value in owning your own job.
If you want to do it, do it. Buy a miner for cheap and get it running and join a pool and get some passive BTC, but do it as a hobby, not with the intention of making huge money. Over time, after mining, if you hold for a few years, THEN you will see profit. When the small amount of Bitcoin you get rises in value, then your hobby pays off.

Visa charges 1.6% up to 3% or more depending on their 'rewards' card. People who use Visa rewards cards for example are dirty, dirty people, because the business just has to charge more to cover those extra fees - meaning everyone pays a higher price because some people want their 'cash back' i.e. they want to be charged more everywhere they go and everyone else has to pay more, too.
For Bitcoin, your fee can be whatever you want, there's some sites that show recommended fees, but it's whatever you want, just higher = faster 'service' in confirming your transaction.
You can include a 10-cent fee for a million dollar transaction and it will still go through at some point, just might take a few hours. Most fees are in the same of a couple dollars or less. Smart people who wait for there to be low transaction volume know they can put very low fees and get in the very next block. Again websites for that, look em up I don't know any off the top of my head.
Also this is why businesses will adopt Bitcoin - the fee can be super low, so they save money using it (quite a bit) and allows them to offer lower prices to their customers which drives more business to them.

Inflation is already much higher, maybe 6%.
If the Fed cuts rates, it means you can take out a loan to buy a house much easier. This means, on aggregate, more people will be taking out loans, because it's just cheap. Since loans are basically 'money printed out of thin air' using the Federal Reserve fractional reserve lending, this means each time a neighbor takes out a loan from the bank to buy a house, that neighbor is devaluing your money by causing more dollars to exist in the market.
You rarely notice it - you have to zoom out - but most adults know what used to cost $1 is now costing $3. This means in 20~ years prices have gone up tremendously even though technology and automation should have made everything cheaper. Inflation is not just the amount of money pushed into the system, it's also the amount stolen from innovation, efficiency and so on. Remember every company sending their workers overseas to manufacture products in other countries? Why didn't products get cheaper if they're saving on manufacturing?
Yes, the rate cut will mean more cheap dollars flooding the market, which means your dollar is worth less annually, which means people will look to buy things that hold value more. It means your money will lose value faster over time, not slower. As we're getting into interesting areas like negative rates and so on, this cannot last, and some war/crisis/failing of banks/some event will have to occur to con the people into accepting more of their assets taken away "for the good of the country" and so on.

Well, if we're in the USA, a simple court of law would show that there is no difference from paying someone $1 for giving you the answer to "What is 2+2?" and Bitcoin. They are, in effect, the same thing. So if our courts are not corrupt to the core, which they are not, no one would lose a case brought against them saying owning or transmitting Bitcoin is a crime.
Keep in mind, Bitcoin is JUST a math problem. That's it. I'm not worried about anyone banning math. Bitcoin is a math problem where the answer can have value. All math answers have value.
So I know governments can and will and have and will continue to do the most stupid things ever, but history shows it doesn't work out. I just watched a great video (YouTube, OverlySimplified French Revolution) and although I've learned about the French Revolution before, to re-learn that during a short period of time the government went around chopping peoples' heads off - 40,000+ people - like legit prosecuting people who said anything wrong about the revolution and chopping their heads off...
It never works out for the government, that's all.
Libra is actually just fine; it's a company trying to make a currency that is *at least backed by something* where the USD is not backed by anything. So Libra will be stronger than the USD, because it will reach 2+ billion people, where the USD is ~500 million or so. I don't like it, but it takes away the power monopoly of the government, so I like that part about it. This is why governments are trying to ban/stop Libra - and they can, because Libra is centralized. Bitcoin is not. Bitcoin is unstoppable. It's just an idea. People will always gravitate towards the good idea.
The price tanking is not due to news, it's due to the futures markets. People betting on Bitcoin price, failing, and having their accounts liquidated to support the failed bet. I don't pay attention to it much, but this one was big. There's a post about it; over $200 million liquidated. People bet, people lost.
Keep in mind, the government is losing. The government is talking about Bitcoin. They're not talking about Ripple, or Litecoin, or anything else. They're talking about the threat. In fact, the entire government, from the President, to the Fed, is talking about Bitcoin. And all Bitcoin is, is a math problem, with a hard to find answer, and a public record if you find an answer or not. That's it.
The reason they're talking about Bitcoin is because it is "The One". It is coming and there's no stopping it. We will see all sorts of craziness in the next 10-20 years (I think 10), where attempts will be made to shut this down, but it will only cause economies to crash as people realize their fiat money isn't that valuable or trustworthy.
I am glad to be in it with you, and people here, fellow users, to see this all first hand with you all.

If for example, the gold value rises so high, that the trace amounts of it in your electronics is worth more than the electronics. Then everyone would break their electronics for the gold value.
Every good feature of gold exists in Bitcoin, and none of the bad features. It is as far as we can tell right now the perfect currency. It's storing value hidden within information. Information becomes currency.

Tether is a Hong Kong based limited liability company, location unknown. It's not mentioned in news because it's a way for central banks to cripple crypto-markets. They can inflate Tether and use anyone who accepts Tether as a means to damage the crypto-markets without having people demand restitution from their banks and so on. When Tether is forced to fail, everyone who owns or trusts Tether will fall, and Bitcoin will suffer due to exchanges being linked with Tether. Bitcoin will survive, but damage will be dealt for sure.
You don't hear about Tether because it's controlled by the same people who control the media. So it can continue to 'oops' mint $5 billion Tether out of nowhere and people don't notice. Exchanges that use Tether are compromised - all it would take is one 'oops' minting and a subsequent buying of massive amounts of Bitcoin followed up by a Tether company shutdown to cripple any and every Tether-accepting exchange and force any Tether holders to be holding dead bags. The shock will disrupt crypto for quite some time and sow distrust among the public.
There's nothing Tether can do about this either, even if they're a legit company trying to operate to the best of their ability. I do not think they are a legit company, but that's just my opinion.
Moral of the story is any exchange which accepts Tether is compromised. You don't hear about Tether because it's meant to be a trojan horse for the crypto-world. When Tether falls, no bank will be questioned; just some Hong Kong LLC that failed and took everyone's internet money; everyone should have known how risky it was and shouldn't have bought Bitcoin will be the narrative.

Yes, any investor, regardless of who you are, if you put $100,000 into a company, and that company does not return you at least $10,000 in 5 years, is a waste of your money. You would be better off not investing, for sure! This happens regardless of an inflation/deflation economy.
2% is small, I'm not sure your concern. Here's Amazon's ROI - return on investment:
Yes, they beat 2% on average. They've had some bad years, some negative years too! But 2%? Any company can do that. And like I said, it would be much less than 2%.
You're right, price isn't "easier" to buy, it's the same relative value. Except if you saved, and did no investing, you'd earn 2% (in your case) value on your money over time just for doing 'nothing'. How it works now, is you lose 4-6% of your money every single year just for doing 'nothing. Why should the labor you do today lose value just because you didn't spend it today? Who would enjoy this system where you're forced to spend your money immediately to gain maximum benefit from it? Bankers enjoy this system. Saving money in an inflation economy is the dumbest thing you can do!

You only "lose" if you sell.
With that said, "Not your keys, not your Bitcoin." Learn to store your own Bitcoin on your own wallet that you control and no other company is 'custodian' of your Bitcoin.
So if you can, spend some time learning about Bitcoin wallets and send your Bitcoin to that wallet. You can get a hardware wallet, or load up a software one like Bitcoin Core ("official" program) and securing your own free software wallet. Spend some more time researching and learning before you do anything, but you should secure your Bitcoin.
You could risk it, leave your Bitcoin in Revolut and then sell when you feel like doing that. It's just riskier because you're trusting this other company not to close down. Up to you what is easier/worth the risk.

So my thinking with that is someone opens a 167mBTC channel and *forgets about it for a few years* and now it's worth way more, which incentivizes the other party to attempt theft. The more the value rises - because you know if Bitcoin exists long term the value ONLY rises - eventually that value exceeds the human mental barrier for committing crime to steal that money.
It's less worry, but more considering the concept of risk, when dealing direct with BTC is very low to no-risk. People like to set-and-forget things, and without regular closures of channels and re-assessing the risk of the channel's BTC amount, the value can rise unknowingly to someone to a point where they are at risk of being physically attacked.

Say it with me: "*journalism*"
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:30:53
I feel like explaining something, and you're the victim to read it.
The reason fiat works is because people don't really care that they're being stolen from, and it doesn't affect their life that much anyway. The idea of fiat will never go away. There will never be a 100% Bitcoin society. This is because whomever can convince people to use fiat is able to direct the labor and power that people create (by existing) and can always dominate any Bitcoin-only society. In other words, a Bitcoin-only society is weaker, because the government cannot steal from the people.
If you have 2 million people in a Bitcoin society, and I have 1 million people, I can convince more of my 1 million people to slave away for me with a fiat system, out producing and beating your 2 million people because I can steal from my people. We then conquer your 2 million people and install fiat, granting us even more power.
This is how the central banks work today.
Bitcoin gives people the option to store value outside this system and to in effect, choose to be central banks ourselves. Where central banks have only been isolated families preserved throughout time, the long run is Bitcoin holders become the new central bankers, able to weild vast power. So, if you own a piece of Bitcoin, you hold some power during this transition period.
Why do people even care about central banks? Because they still own lots of gold and 'cash' and assume they can still, if needed, buy all the protection and force required to dominate an adversary. So a central bank still has a lot of power to persuade people to do its bidding, because people still value gold and cash.
Bitcoin eventually replaces the gold and cash part in the central banks, but there will always be the desire to steal from people and fiat systems will be built upon it. Central banks don't fight each other, and can only get the other to do something by trading in hard assets like gold. So, when Bitcoin becomes this reserve currency for the central banks, if you own some if it, you own some of the power that is wielded. And in addition, those who accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin end up becoming the central banks of the future.
But most people will just live their life with no worry of being stolen from year after year from inflation. Because the majority of people are ok with that arrangement as long as they get food, shelter, sex, they will continue on that way no matter the system. All you can do is keep pushing for adoption because eventually owning Bitcoin is like owning a chunk of the world gold reserves - you have great power to do things. And if you then decide to make your own bank, you have even greater power.
The only way Bitcoin can take over is if governments adopt it as central currency and eliminate all fiat - effectively giving up all their power. This would make that nation extremely weak compared to other nations for a while - meaning that weak nation would be ripe for invasion and the installation of a new central bank. So... there's a small chance. But if things remain as is, you're still in good shape owning Bitcoin going into the future compared to the billions of people who could care less about being stolen from.
In the long run, if things continue and fiat remains strong, you will just become a central bank yourself, stealing from the people, becoming the monster you hate.

@_date: 2019-07-16 11:07:43


Ok, there's a limit, but some businesses exceed the limit? So there's no limit?
Keep in mind if Bitcoin does gain value, a 167 mBTC node today is worth a lot more in the future. That raises the incentive to steal. That's one of the factors that need to be considered. Bitcoin will grow in value over all time, as such leaving a 167 mBTC channel open seems like no big deal today, but in 20-30 years it's going to be a big deal.


Higher? Ok higher.


Sure, but before all that, you're highly incentivized to remove the target from the equation. So even if the transaction fails, the target is potentially dead. If you do some action-movie, hold them in a locked room kind of nonsense, you run the risk of them escaping and preventing the theft. That would be fiction. Once an open channel is established, the full value is in public to be conspired against.
The difference is when you are dealing with BTC, if someone knows you have $1 mil in BTC, killing the target 100% guarantees you don't ever get the money. You buy time, and your life, just because you control the information on how to access it. I hope this can process correctly because humans have never had this possibility before Bitcoin. Outside Bitcoin, every store of money has always been at risk of physical attack where they do not need the target to be alive at any point to get the money. Consider that for a moment please. Some thug holding up a convenience store does not need to keep the store clerk alive to get the money from the register. A Brazilian motorcycle duo holding up a food stand in the middle of the night does not need to leave any of those people alive to steal their wallets and cell phones. If someone wants your BTC, they necessarily have to keep you alive and devise some scheme to get it that involves them obtaining your BTC before you die.


Yes and when you open a lightning channel you incentivize this happening more than if you keep your BTC secure on chain, because parties know you have BTC and know it is in the open. You've removed the need for you to remain alive to access however much Bitcoin that channel is worth. So we go from zero incentive to some incentive. That's a big leap, especially when we just got the ability to have zero incentive with Bitcoin.
The risks with a low enough value channel are not high, and I'm not disparaging the tech. From what I've concluded, lightning is exactly like paying with fiat cash in the sense of you revealing how much cash you have on you when you open a channel. The negative to me would be using third-party watchtowers to outsource trust, where people feel comfortable. Personally-run watchtowers and so on would make sure you never open too high a value channel, because you'd always know you can be stolen from - this is a good thing. If attempts are made where you have no incentive to run a watchtower because every watchtower watches all transactions, this is where I see it breaking down. In that case, there is no theft for a while, so fewer and fewer watchtowers are run and maintained, and that opens up the system to organized crime to come in and run all the watchtowers.
As long as there is some level of distrust, it prevents this. For example, if you buy something from someone on Craigslist, before you take cash out of your pocket, they don't know for certain if you have the cash on you, or in your car, or whatever. But as soon as you take it out, there is some form of risk in being stolen from, by the person, or a third party witnessing the opening of this cash channel. So as such, we do subtle subconscious things to verify our situation is secure before we take out that cash, and once the cash is handed over, now the other person is at risk of being stolen from and they take on some level of needing to distrust the situation. If instead we rely on, for example, a police officer to stand there and verify the transaction goes through without a problem, we only introduce a third party who has just as much opportunity to steal from us. It doesn't actually make the situation any better.
So I like personal watchtowers and the LN in general. Low amounts and frequent-enough closures of channels will keep it healthy. A 167 mBTC channel left open for 20 years is not a good idea due to the value increase. But you'd get complacent if you didn't have to 'watch out' for yourself and thought a third party could be trusted. As such if we put the burden of trust on the user, the user maintains their own risk tolerance.

Then peel open that hologram -&gt; it should reveal the private key - this is your wallet, the thing that accesses the lock box where that 0.25 Bitcoin is stored in the math function.
You can import that private key into any wallet, like Bitcoin Core (search how to do it using the console feature). From there, you can, and should, send it to another address, hardware wallet, or Coinbase/exchange to sell, or whatever. Just do NOT leave it on that private key, because it is held in physical form it can be lost if you don't deal with it right away.
Also if you don't mind the privacy, letting us see the private address doesn't put you at risk; it would be fun to confirm this coin.

Bitcoin is an idea; the idea cannot fail. I know people get skeptical but this is not a company or even a nation. It's simply a way of storing value. So even if Bitcoin was instantly removed from the Earth, people would still come back to the same kind of system for storing value. It's a human achievement unlock. People know they can store value in rare math. AI is not going to rely on paper dollars either. The idea will survive all time, just as other key technologies will survive no matter what like the internet and electricity and so on. As such I do not see it as a gamble. You can argue with me and take the counter point if you want: "Bitcoin is not just an idea humans have unlocked and it can fail because..."

It is. I'm just looking out for others. If you buy on an exchange, and the price drops, you can enter into forced hodling and just send your BTC to your secure wallet and forget about it for a few years - you won't worry about the exchange even if it gets hacked or shuts down. But with Robinhood you're tied in, you waiting 2-3 years might mean they shut down in that time period and you have nothing, no way to secure your deposit with actual Bitcoin in hand.
It's a trick banks have been pulling forever, and it will continue working forever, I'm just spreading the awareness. Thanks :)

Yes however it is not uncommon for all manner of companies to have dedicated connections outside the realm of control of a government.
The first article you linked is I think a bit different - it speaks of making sure to use Russian-internal DNS servers so, for example, if Russia becomes more reliant on Germany-based DNS servers, Germany could shut off those servers and cause disruption in Russia's network.
It doesn't sound to be too alarming, besides forcing people to do things. Keeping routing inside your borders is probably a good idea.
The second article I just noticed reinforces that conclusion. Keep in mind if they cut themselves off from Bitcoin - THEY lose. Everyone else works just fine. That's the other piece of the puzzle. The only losers are the ones who are cut off. If I were Russia, I'd be wanting more connections to the outside world, not less. Especially if I were a Bitcoiner there.

When people warn about wallets they do so because 1 Bitcoin a few years ago was $100 and now it is $10,000 so losing 1 Bitcoin is heartbreak in the long run. So if you lose that coin or get it stolen it matters eventually.
The other reason is if you have a private key on a mobile phone and don't back up the seed words and you lose your phone you lose on that 'change' you had, which again can add up over time.
For your case none of this seems too big a deal so by all means use the mobile wallet for what you're using it for. Eventually you might see value in holding more Bitcoin - if you buy 10 years worth of VPN/Wallabag payments and spend $800 today, when Bitcoin rises in value over time and prices go down, you'll realize the money you paid today paid for your VPN for the rest of your life.

Anyone with a fraction of the Bitcoin hashing power could go over to Bcash any day and take over the entire network. It doesn't matter the fees if your platform is weak to invasion.
Bitcoin fees are quite low - if you can wait. If you can wait 24 hours or more for your transaction to happen - send it with zero fee. Some miner at some point will pick it up and add it into the blockchain. I've only sent zero-fee transactions, and I waited.
Now, when lots of people need a transaction NOW, then you pay for service, paying higher for the hope to get added into the next block. This seems like a good way to do it right? If you want it done now, you pay for it. If you can wait a while, you can send it for a super low fee and hope some late-night miner adds it in.
Obviously for day to day payments to facilitate tens of thousands of transactions per minute will require new technology, which is developing at the same rate as demand. Since it is all technology anyway, solutions will be found, because in a free market where there is demand, someone will find a way to make money off it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:03:45
No one charges you for sending Bitcoin - no one owns Bitcoin as if it is a company.
What happens is you can, optionally, add a "fee" to your own transaction to incentivize miners to add your transaction into the blockchain. Once in the blockchain it becomes a confirmed transaction; that your transaction did occur.
A higher fee paid means the miners are more likely to add you into the very next block. If you have a lower fee, it can take longer, because they'll prioritize higher fees. During times when there's low transaction traffic, lower fees will get in the very next block.
So, if you want it NOW, you can pay for the convenience. If you can wait a few days you can send it with zero fee at all, hoping that a miner who processes zero-fee transactions mines the next block. It's a capitalistic system. If you put a low amount of fee, good chance someone wants that money and will add it into a block sooner or later, but if you're making a purchase for coffee at the store, you probably want to have a reasonable fee to get it in the next block or two.
You pay the fee to send Bitcoin. The sender pays - which is what the sender always does, even with credit cards (just indirectly, when you pay for something with a credit card, the business is charged a fee from Visa for example, so likewise the business raises their product prices a few percent to make up for it).

Fiat money is printed in order to steal labor from the population to use that labor to do 'bigger' things than if you were not able to steal your citizens' labor in the first place.
The USA is the most stolen from nation on Earth, which is why it's so powerful, because the people in the USA are so taken care of in day to day living that they are willing to work for free for their entire lives. They have food, sex and shelter abounding. So they willingly work as virtual slaves.
This stolen labor lets governments flex their power in foreign affairs and build big buildings and construct big construction projects. If they did not steal the labor of the people, those projects would be much harder to get done, and Joe Averageworker would save his money and lead a quiet life without much effort.
Instead, Joe's money is constantly worth less and less and so he has to push a bit to live so comfortable and donate all his wealth to the greater national interests. He works hard for a constantly devaluing currency, never able to get ahead of things, but has enough to cover food, sex and shelter, and he is happy until he dies.
If a nation adopts Bitcoin as their national currency they immediately give up the notion of stealing labor from their citizens, meaning that nation now has vastly less power than it did before, and would be very weak as a nation for a long while until it found ways to motivate citizens outside of stealing from them. With so few opportunities to be corrupt, with sound money and thus, sound financial policy, the nation could rise to become a great digital-age powerhouse. But... before that could ever happen, some other nation would invade and conquer this now weak nation and implant a central bank printing fiat money in order to steal from the people again.

I'm not forgetting transactions. We're dealing with a shit situation here. We're not going to have the same volume. When a hurricane hits a city, people aren't out on the street collecting paypal payments from their neighbor to help them clear debris from the roads and from their houses. People work together in tough situations. The point is Bitcoin runs better than say, Litecoin, in a situation where we have to revert back to dial-up modems.
Sure, so we need enough room to handle blocks + extra data. 1MB at 56k completes in 1-2 minutes, leaving 8-9 minutes to handle catching up with everything else. This seems reasonable. It seems like over time, we'll process all transactions without it taking forever. This seems like the network would do just fine. The point of my post was to show that it wouldn't be just blocks that would be handled. With Litecoin, all you could do is utilize 100% of the dial-up speed to process blocks, with very little overhead in data transfer capabilities to talk to transactions and other nodes and so on. Since a 56k modem will handle 1MB in 1-2 minutes, we have 80-90% of the time to talk about transactions and other things. This allows Bitcoin to still exist under the new internet, instead of taking up 100% of the bandwidth of the new internet. This makes using Bitcoin in such a scenario still possible and not that huge a drain on the already taxed system. What we would not want is a payment network where it takes 10 minutes to transmit a block where the entire internet is congested with block traffic and nothing else, not even web pages, or communications. We need a block size small enough, compared to a mining time long enough, to facilitate communication and everything else the internet provides, while still being able to maintain an accurate distributed public ledger, and we *could* do it with 56k and Bitcoin versus many other options, showing Bitcoin is even friendly to survivalists and "preppers".
It would be slow going, but still possible and is more practical than Bitcoin SV's what, 128MB blocks or something now?

Watch these two videos:
As far as disabling the network, you'd have to shut down all communication. Bitcoin is pure information. Simply 1's and 0's. If necessary another encryption layer could be added on top to hide the 1's and 0's we're transmitting.

That's what everyone says :) Then they make a bet, and the people they're betting against have deep pockets, and force the market to go in the opposite direction, just to destroy you and take your money.
The news story of someone making $75 million was probably just a story so more people would bet! It was advertisement :)
The problem with futures is, with a volatile market like Bitcoin, if the price swings too far against your bet, you lose everything in your account. You don't get to 'wait a little longer to see if the price will come back.' If it passes your available funds, you get liquidated, losing everything you bet with.
It's the worst thing you can do especially if you make a large bet. If you did like 2x leverage, you might get lucky with enough coverage, but then it kind of defeats the purpose.
It really is the market for destroying stupid people. I should get in on offering BTC this way... hmm!

The only thing you need to watch is the hash rate. If it goes down (on average over time) then you have something to be concerned about. But as long as people continue risking their labor to mine more and more, it will continue to be the premier crypto asset.
There really aren't any weaknesses or threats. I mean, there's weaknesses and threats that might make you buy or sell emotionally, but actual threats, no.
List out yourself what makes a good currency. Then see if Bitcoin is missing one of those features. If Bitcoin has all those features, then you can be pretty certain it is going to stick around. If you list an advantageous feature that Bitcoin does not have, please let me know, we'll make a better crypto-asset and make Bitcoin's daddy and be rich!
Seriously, if anyone finds out a feature that Bitcoin should have but does not - currency/money feature - then it would replace Bitcoin and would become the dominant crypto. So if you can figure out what that one thing is, you're rich. As such, lots of people out there have incentive to find if there's an answer to that question. The good news is if such a thing comes to exist, hash rate would slowly turn over to this new currency over time - not immediately - so you'd have time to react. Hashing power is the strength indicator and Bitcoin continues to dominate.

Download Bitcoin Core. Run it. Now you have a wallet file and a receiving address. Send your Bitcoin to that address. Just make sure your computer is malware free, and encrypt and back up your wallet in multiple places, and then delete the wallet file from your computer. Then you can send all your BTC to that address and never have to expose your wallet. You can also get a hardware wallet, but the software wallet is free and easy. If you have more questions post them. If you want to read a bunch of long stuff about Bitcoin check out my post history. My earlier long posts detail wallets a lot more than recent posts. Lots of info on the sidebar on the right too.

When I see pictures of gold, I don't see wealth anymore. It's kind of odd. But it's like looking at a... bunch of metal. I know other people value it, but there's no attachment for me that it's valuable. I wouldn't perform any work for it. I wouldn't go out of my way to handle it.
Bitcoin on the other hand, that number is valuable. I would work for it. I would go out of my way to handle it.
I think seeing elderly people with gold kind of did it in for me. Seeing them praise gold for being gold and not as a store of value, being so illogical with the idea. Gold is good because it stores value, not because it's gold. But they cling to it. "Real money"
The image of gold for this article is like looking at sea shells. Collectors items of a previous age.

No, you are confusing the two as different.
A loan is always made out of thin air, with nothing behind it. The loan being backed by a house or a car is only so the bank can get the actual hard asset wealth if you don't make good on your promise. Since the central banks know the paper money is useless, they will put you in debt on things, and make you run up against inflation and an economy they control, so that when you default, they now own your actual property. It cost them nothing to do this, just the issuance of a loan and the printing of money from thin air.
I will make you any loan that you put up collateral for. My printed money is useless, so if I can willingly steal your house from you because you took my paper-money loan, couldn't pay me, and signed over control of your property to me (or allowed the government to do so by force), I have stolen your house, because you made a promise to my bank that you didn't live up to. All I had to do was print some money and inflate the huge economy a small tiny fraction to do it.


Quality of labor, experience and expertise are all features of labor. No one person's labor is exactly the same as another's. Labor is not currency in the wider market, but could be currency in a small community (you do this for me, I do this for you, no tokens required). The large disparity in number-value of pay today is mainly due to inflation and the printing of money. With a sound money we have much more equality of pay as everyone's worth is never inflated due to inflation.


It got dumped at 13k back to 10k too. The trend for Bitcoin is more stability over time. Contrary to what a normal person might think, the dollar is fairly volatile (and more so, world paper money as a whole is quite volatile, maybe VERY volatile). It does matter what you compare it to. Bitcoin is gaining stability over all currencies, which are all volatile. If pre-collapse Venezuelan officials printed off a ton of money and bought Bitcoin, it would spike the price of Bitcoin up before their internal currency collapses. We can be certain that no one can print more Bitcoin to spike Bitcoin prices up. This is why it's much better. Stability will come in time - it's only been 10 years. The iPhone has been around for 12 years and Facebook for 14 years, Google and Amazon even older. This is a growing idea, and it will take time for adoption, but in 10 years you will be using Bitcoin in one way or another for your daily life.

That's a garbage article. The argument claims two conflicting ideas, then lists "Bitcoin is a store of value" as both the conflicting ideas.
I liked this one:


"But what you may not realize is that in the neighborhood of 90% of USD value isn't in circulation, and that the USA is $25 trillion in debt, and most wealth isn't free-flowing currency but instead other assets, but don't focus on that, focus on the fact that investors see Bitcoin as valuable enough to hold 40% of the supply as such as a store of value."

Coinbase is fine. As soon as you buy the price will seem to drop. Or it will go up. Don't worry about it, just buy some and send it to your secure wallet. Don't leave it on an exchange. And buy with the intention to HOLD for a few years at least.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:10:01


It's fairly the same, except an internal accounting, like Coinbase's USDC, is most likely going to represent their funds because they're in the business of being an exchange. If crypto ends up failing, they fail too, so they do have an incentive to maintain accurate, internal stablecoins. The threat is in the third-party entity. And of course, any exchange can be compromised the exact same way, just less incentive, and it's unlikely the entire company will go along with destroying all their customers without someone sounding an alarm.
Back to your point, yes even USD accounting is at risk, but again this is kind of required. It's no different than if they put "I owe Hologhraphiks $1000" in a database, is it not? Every company which has an account in your name basically has an artificial digital token to represent that. The threat, again, is how easy it is to compromise, and the incentives behind it. Surely, if people trusted USDC enough, Coinbase could artificially create more and buy up all the Bitcoin it wants and go under. This is just less likely due to the incentive of being in the business of being an exchange and so on. The risk does still apply though.


Well, USDT wouldn't even be used then. The whole con relies that people "trust" that they're operating in good faith. Central banks print tons of money all the time, the only reason it's allowed is because 99% of people have no idea what is going on.

There are millions of miners - they get paid 0.00015943 BTC for every block completed, maybe. They're not rushing to sell immediately. But I understand the idea you're saying, that they 'have to spend Bitcoin to pay costs!' but it's not true. They can work normal jobs and cover costs that way and just be investing. Still, some 'numbers' you believe in that indicate big mining operations dumping their BTC every day is just as good an indicator as any other, so go for it. I just wouldn't put that number at $20 million or whatever. If you came up with a hash rate to actual sell volume to total mined coins per day and compared that to a potential cost of production model you'd get some indicator, but again, it would be about as good as any other model.
The reason this isn't too important is if something spooks the masses, there's a massive sell off and now your data doesn't really matter. Your data will be 'unsustainable' at a BTC price of $8k for example (when cost to mine versus 'profit' is negative), so if it drops down below a certain point, it would just indicate to you to always sell, every day, all the time, constantly. So it is just like everything else, an indicator.

Compounding on my own comment; without watchtowers, let's say you're opening a channel with someone and they're opening a 0.001 Bitcoin channel with you and Bitcoin is worth $1 million. So they're opening a $1000 channel - not too crazy for maybe a grocery store. If they accidentally enter in 1 BTC instead of 0.001 - for whatever reason let's say you're standing there and someone opens a 1 BTC channel right in front of you from their phone... you're highly incentivized to steal their phone and potentially kill them in that instant, to prevent them from closing the erroneous channel and fixing their mistake. Even with watchtowers, you're incentivzed to do this, because if you steal their phone, you can force the transactions of them sending you all their BTC and then close the state from their phone.
As unlikely as this is, I see multiple angles of attack for this kind of system, including literally watching two people opening a channel and ambushing them as soon as they establish it. Then I can hold those two people up, and use their phones to open a channel with me and force the payments to send and force the channels to close.
I'm thinking anyone with an open lightning channel can then be forced at gunpoint to open a channel to the criminal and send payments and close out the channel in favor of the criminal.

I mean... they already have it. It's called a bank account. I love the adoption by companies who have no idea and just want to co-opt the name. It seems very dot-com style.
Anything without proof of work is just a database, and anything that has proof of work is going to be susceptible to an attack by a larger volume of workers than the company will employ.
Still, fun to consider the heads of these companies saying, "We need blockchain! I'm not sure how or what for but damnit we need to be able to say that word!" Very dot-com.
There is legit need for this though I'm not discounting that need; companies will be able to track their history easier and provide better security in many cases.

All transfer of Bitcoin is off-chain. You stand there, and send payment to someone else. That exchange is off-chain. Eventually, the transaction is confirmed on-chain, though.
So exchanges are pools, where you put money into and anticipate the transfer that will be confirmed on-chain later on.
Exchanges make money by facilitating trade, so like any business, the one providing the best service to their customers is going to profit. The ones lying about volume and so on are going to go under.


Because humans value information, and the more information we have, the better decisions we can make. An exchange gives us real-time information about what someone is willing to buy/sell something at right at this very moment.
All you need to do is be certain you're dealing with an exchange that you can pull actual Bitcoin from should you decide to HODL. Fake exchanges are nothing more than someone's excel spreadsheet (Robinhood, Toro, others). Stay away from those.

I don't think you should be suffering, and you are not suffering, because you're here on the internet talking about Bitcoin. You're just fine.
But you shouldn't get special treatment because your your people made the wrong decision, either. It is hard to explain. Here's some kind of analogy: If your parents told you this was a good thing to do:  then you might put a big disc in your lip. If you somehow as an adult think this big disc in your lip is a bad idea, you can take it out and change your circumstance. But it won't stop there being a big stretch in your lip. You have to live with what they gave you and if you think it is wrong you have to change it. But make no mistake, this is what they thought was best for you, so be mad at the parents if you don't like it. Be mad at the people in charge.
In other words, it is on you to do something about it if you don't like it. You should be the product of your parents and the people before you - there was no choice. There is only choice in what you do today. Do you run away? Do you fight? Do you defeat the system from within?

No I understand the grocery store won't have 1:1 connection per customer. What I mean is they will have to verify it is you, in the store, making the payment. As such: 


These open channels establish 'roots', I guess I'd call it, in the local economy. If your roots are constantly changing, that means you are moving around a lot - always opening new channels with someone. If on the other hand your business has solid, years-long open channels and relatively fewer 'filaments' then your business would be verifiable as a cornerstone of the community. A new business, for example, would have no roots, and you'd know it based upon those channels being created for them and their age.
I could be wrong but I see a metric here for business viability. If some company comes along and offers the next best thing, you'd check if it has any roots and the age of the roots. Nope. Ok so it's a startup and we should be cautious dealing with this new business.
Maybe, maybe not, it's just a vague idea into what could be. Thanks for the response.

It will come out in the economy, but not in a negative way - it's the same as if you had a hodler who never sold until they died. It doesn't affect your day to day one bit. On the other hand, in 100 years when Bitcoin sends a message out to everyone that any 100 year old un-moved transactions will be rolled into the mining pool in 10 years, giving people a 10 year warning to move their heritage-coins "or else", then it will matter and there will be an inflation spike.
Fewer movable coins only matters when you cannot divide Bitcoin into tiny fractions i.e. when gold coins existed, you couldn't do 1/100th of a gold coin. That's when there's a problem.
Now if the valuation ever hit where 1 satoshi was too big a denomination because the supply was so lost... well... moon. But only then would a few more decimals be needed to continue on as normal.

No you only changed the history. And again you use the word incorrectly.
Let's go back to your misunderstanding: 


Fungibility is not the inability to distinguish one coin from another. It has nothing to do with the human capability to distinguish something as different. Humans can find all sorts of things to distinguish two seemingly identical objects - for example, location. One coin is on my left. The other is on my right. Thus I can distinguish them from one another.
That's not the point of the word. The word is just a thought experiment used to facilitate trade, so that if I tell someone I will buy 10 bushels of corn for $100 I don't end up nit-picking saying, "Well I meant red corn," when you deliver the product. We as a people decided when someone says something, it means basically that thing. 1 bushel of corn is the same as another bushel of corn in abstract, for use in finances and for use in trade and in the courts. There are a million things that distinguish any two items of anything. That's not the point, and again the misuse of the word. It is simply an abstract that everyone can agree upon - yes, a gold coin is worth another gold coin of the same weight, no matter who minted it. Yes, a $20 bill is worth the same as any other $20 bill even though you can easily distinguish the differences between them and even though one might be ripped. They are fungible, just like Bitcoin, and Monero, and any other currency, or else by definition it wouldn't be a currency.
If you think this property is something actual, physical, that actually exists, you run into the problem misusing the word. If you think it is something to achieve, like a cryptocurrency that cannot be tracked, then you're missing the point. It's an abstract property of all currency, in that we can agree if I tell you to pay me 5 sea shells by Friday, you can hand me *any* 5 sea shells by Friday, and not specific ones I deem are the specific ones that must be paid when you show up with 5 random shells, unless obtaining specific shells was was part of the initial agreement in the first place.

It's like the real world. Do you think your nation is the best? Well then, prove it with force! If you can't, then your nation is not the best.
As such, the fact that a small amount of hashing power coming from BTC over to BCH would rip BCH into the stone age invalidates any claim that it is any better than Bitcoin. It doesn't even matter if it is. The cryptocurrency with the most hash rate is the better coin, period. Other coins like ETH and LTC and others have some actual use-cases that are preferable *only in those use cases*, whereas BCH is literally just a copy of Bitcoin with some extra modifiers on top of it based on what people think the protocol should be doing. As such, it's filling the same need as BTC with nowhere near the hash rate. I can do that too - I can make my own fork too!

I mean, a $10,000 car or a $50,000 car?
Anyway, don't send them a note until you're ready to buy within a few weeks. Otherwise it won't matter. But when there's money sitting on the table and someone is telling you "I will buy right now" it tends to get a dealership moving.
So save up, and when you're ready, send an email CC'ing all the dealerships that have the car you're interested in and see who responds.
How to word the note? "I have $50k cash to buy a car hit me up."
Paying with cash is not special or 'event worthy' honestly. It might seem like it to you, but the dealership is most likely converting that to fiat instantly. And if you pay in cash they're not getting any financing from it or anything. Their margin is pretty low for a new vehicle. If they wait, they could lose out on the purchase price value that they're used to.
It's more important to get low level vendors using Bitcoin. Farmers, supermarkets and so on. It has to grow from that side. If every car dealership accepts it so what - they're so entrenched into the fiat money supply they can't deal with making changes. But a local independent supermarket could, given time, convert to full crypto in 10 years, if they saw the value in it (which they would, in the form of less fees paid).
I'd pay for the car in cash and tell your local supermarket you have $50k to spend at their location but you only will do it with Bitcoin. Then you'll move the needle.


You're right. Car dealerships are not the general marketplace. Build the ground layer to the point where a dealer sees value in Bitcoin because he knows he can buy food or pay some employees with it, because those employees probably see the value and know they themselves can buy food and pay rent with it etc.

You, like many here, are the reason the dollar is failing.
They need to lower interest rates and pump more money into the economy because you've checked out of the system, and yet you drain on it, putting your value elsewhere instead of feeding it back into the system which steals from you. They're not able to steal from you as much, so they will print more money to try and make up for it. Before Bitcoin, this was not much of an issue. When gold became too difficult to steal from people they decreed that everyone must hand over their gold. Now the people have a choice that the government can't this demand this currency be turned in with much effect, and the currency is already global so the nation regulating it necessarily loses power in the Bitcoin economy.
Thanks for all you do :)
Edit: By what metric (by what measure, or what comparison) is the dollar failing? The rise of Bitcoin, a currency, over the dollar, another currency. Compared to Bitcoin, the dollar is failing. A nation's currency which is hyper-inflating loses value against everything, including barter goods. The price of Bitcoin assumes you'd rather have 1 Bitcoin in hand over $11,000 paper dollars. This shows the dollar is failing when compared to Bitcoin.

Your 24 seed words will always open up your wallet by default. That means if someone guessed all 24 words - since they're publicly available words, people could try - they would have access to your private key and thus your Bitcoin.
The 25th word/phrase is a password on top of that. So that you introduce a non-public password.
Guessing your 24 words is practically impossible, and the 25th password word makes it even more astronomically impossible.
You can take your 24 words and your passphrase to recreate your wallet - your wallet by the way is just a key that unlocks where your Bitcoin is stored in the math - you can recreate your wallet anywhere, be it on a hardware wallet or on a computer or whatever.
If someone found your 24 word seed, they could try to brute force your passphrase just like any modern password. But if it's something you memorize and don't use anywhere else, guessing that passphrase is super hard. But still, less hard than guessing the 24 words. So you want to secure both.

This isn't correct. A high hashrate means there are a LOT of computers working to solve new blocks - that is, write transactions onto the public record. But the rate of new BTC is constant no matter the hash rate. It was 1 block per 10 minutes back in 2009 and is 1 block per 10 minutes now. In fact, the rate has gone down due to halvings.
The hash rate is representative of how many people will work to operate those mining machines and has some impact on what value Bitcoin is at, but it is not a direct relationship. The all time high of the hash rate means a lot of people are betting that Bitcoin will be worth the same or more in the future. But, bets can be wrong, and there have been times where the hash rate has fallen.
The hash rate is a reasonable indicator for future value and but is more an indication of the strength of the currency. It's basically a popularity contest - whichever crypto has the most hash rate, the more people/processing power are convinced it is a good idea, and so it's more likely to continue existing for a long time. Bitcoin could lose 30% of its miners and still be the top cryptocurrency by a long shot.
The other guy's analogy was pretty good regarding mining gold. Just keep in mind, just like mining gold, mining Bitcoin is a bet. Not all bets pay off.

When you make a trade in person, it's off chain *until it is confirmed* basically, is my point. So an exchange is like a bunch of transactions *yet to be confirmed*. Remember, your transaction doesn't matter until it's mined into the blockchain, so there's no difference in an exchange trade and a real life trade except the time between being confirmed on the blockchain (being shorter with an in-person transaction).

Except this is never the case. A gold coin minted by one group has different markings than another. As such they do not hold the same properties, even if they are the same troy ounce in weight and the same purity.
A Monero paid to me by someone I consider a thief is worth less to me than a Monero paid to me by a good customer. The history of it is irrelevant. The misuse of the word is the only way you can achieve making an argument about it.
If I put a little scratch in a gold coin and use it for payment, and then demand that exact same coin in return, I'm introducing modifiers not meant for the unit as currency. As a currency, the gold coin is fungible, as is all currency, or else it wouldn't be currency.


Every currency has this property. If I misuse the word, I could say any transaction on the Monero network is illegal and has no value, thus making it non-fungible.

Yeah through inflation. I was raised with a desire to save money. I thought saving money was good. I was so absolutely 100% wrong. Saving money in an inflation economy just allows other people - central banks - to print more money to buy whatever they want.
In contrast, saving in a non-inflation economy does what you'd think it does, make your money more valuable over time, where you can 'save for something' and actually have that make sense.
If you save any amount of money you are just causing money to not flow, which means a central bank can print the exact same amount of money you saved, and use your money as if it were flowing. It's sick and twisted if you consider this. The smartest people have very little savings; all is investments and so on, all fueled by inflation. This means if you're saving money not only are you losing value due to inflation but you enable banks to print more money on you expense. The 'loss'... I cannot calculate.
Bitcoin, which fiat value is fueled by inflation, is a currency and its idea is fueled by adoption.

Consider using this: 
You can use a nice photograph of the family or of you and your mom, and secure the wallet with a passphrase. You can make a bunch of copies of the photo and send it to all your family and they won't know it is the seed for your Bitcoin. The passphrase means no one can just use the same photo to check a Bitcoin address associated with the photo itself. As long as you remember the passphrase, you will know how to recover it - you just need to get that same photo file that is spread all over the place; all your friends and family's emails will be storing your Bitcoin for you and they'll appreciate the picture in the interim. It's a genius solution in my opinion as it gives people who are otherwise out of touch (older people for example) a means to 'see' their wallet somehow.
You would want to remember the method for recovering the seed by using the photo, however. And this is not widely tested and you'd have to be confident there's no malicious code here, but it's an idea to look into. Most of the code is just using existing tech, and the html file just gives you a method to upload the file (offline) to generate the seed and passphrase. From what I see, I trust it, although I might download the core .js files from their respective repos just to be 100% sure.

To be fair, value implies currency and money, which only exists due to people and human labor, so there is such a thing as intrinsic value - the human being. But we don't want nor need anything except humans to be inherently valuable. We value those bytes, but those bytes do not themselves hold value on their own. The bytes are nothing without the people storing copies of the blockchain on their computers.
Then we can get into talking about AI.

A wallet is just a key. The key unlocks the part of the math system where your Bitcoin is stored.
As such, you don't need a wallet, just some math.
This, is a wallet:
You and I could click to generate wallets for a thousand years and never come close to finding the same result. Not a thousand years, not a trillion years.
It's just math. Every time you generate a private key you are just revealing a section of code that literally anyone could have stumbled upon in that moment, but it was you who did, and no one else has a chance in hell of doing the exact same thing.
Necessarily, any wallet 'held' by any app or any program is then potentially able to be 'grabbed' by the app, program, or even hardware wallet. So, the best thing you can do is secure your keys, some how, some way, that only you will know the way to get them. The paper wallet above is very secure - you don't even need the paper, or to print it, just the keys, that's all you need, to save that image somewhere. And speaking of images, you can save your key like this, which I think is quite marvelous:

Yes. Your Trezor or hardware wallet does not need to be connected to receive any Bitcoin. You only need it connected to send, but as soon as it's sent, it's done and you can remove the device. No Bitcoin 'moves' from a device to another - it's not like a USB flash drive. It's all done with math.

It's not illegal, and no one could stop you anyway. Once you put money into Bitcoin, that is to say once you have any, the information on how to recover and use that Bitcoin resides in your mind. Your mind becomes a bank vault. The method to access the keys that unlock the address where you story your money is in your mind. That information is all in your head, and cannot be broken into and taken from you (at least not directly). Considering Bitcoin is also accepted in every western nation, putting your falling UK pound into Bitcoin means if you ever had to go anywhere else in the world, you have money to do so - not a failed money, but the most sound, un-inflating money ever created to date.
So do it!

You would just do everything offline... the software is just hashing algorithms of which you can find many libraries of code that perform this, or write your own sure.
The transaction can be built offline, and since any manipulation with the transaction would make it invalid, it wouldn't matter what the software did. It could read your key and do all sorts of stuff with it but you can verify all the stuff online before you even submit the transaction.
Remember no Bitcoin 'moves'. It's all positions in a math formula. So if you were sending to X address you can build the send transaction offline, and then take your resulting hash of the transaction and manually enter it in on an online computer and see that you did in fact have a transaction pointing to that address, and that your transaction is indeed signed by your key and no one else. Then you can bring that transaction to the online computer and send it off.

And when the world reconnects it comes back together, kicking out only double-spent transactions. That is to say, only if you were able to spend on "both halves" of this "split world" would it be a problem.
If both worlds stayed split forever then... who cares right? Both would have accurate transactions.
If they ever rejoined, the network would defeat the shorter chain, kick all the invalid blocks out, flood the mempool with transactions, and take a long time to confirm all those transactions... but it's just not a valid scenario to consider.
I posted before about, say, Alaska being cut off due to a natural disaster. True, in that time, if someone in Alaska spent Bitcoin, received some product, then jetted down to mainland USA and spent Bitcoin again, then the double-spend would occur and when the network rejoins together the smaller, Alaska transactions will be kicked out and whatever this person bought in Alaska would not have been paid for. We have legal ways to deal with this kind of situation.
If no one double spends, when the Alaska network rejoins - the transactions don't disappear, they just go back to the mempool for confirmation again, so before you had 50-Alaska-Local confirmations and now you have 0-actual-blockchain confirmations. But in a short while the main blockchain includes the missed transactions. It is self-healing in this regard. You only 'miss out' if you accept payment from a criminal in the middle of a disaster where you're cut off from the world. And if you know that person go punch them in the face or sue them :)

Plus fees. This is not false, what the hell.
13 Bitcoin / millions of miners = each miner getting 0.00015943 or some small amount per block that their pool happened to mine.
You need to look into how mining is done. It's not 1 corporation just getting 12.5 Bitcoin every block. It's a lot of people with miners all pooling their work together and all getting a small cut of the prize. Meaning the average miner is not selling right away, he's probably saving up over time.

Yes, Coinbase is fine. But use Coinbase Pro to get a lower fee. Deposit fiat to Coinbase -&gt; transfer internally to Coinbase Pro -&gt; Buy Bitcoin.
Just place a limit order. If the going price is $11550 put an order for $11551 and hit that "max" and place your order for however much Bitcoin your fiat will buy at that market price (so, its as if you buy $400 worth of Bitcoin at a BTC price of $11551 = 400/11551 = 0.034629036 Bitcoin you will receive for $400). If someone grabs your order, you'll have that much at least.
Then set up a wallet off Coinbase (or leave it, up to you) and send your Bitcoin from Coinbase to your wallet. Boom you got Bitcoin. Enjoy.

You should always know how to create a wallet that is not an app or exchange and always know how to transfer your Bitcoin out should you want to. You don't want to not know how to do this thing. If you know how to do this (it's actually really simple: Download Bitcoin Core wallet. Run software. Get receiving address. Send bitcoin from Cash App to receiving address) then it's not too big a deal to leave smaller amounts on an app or exchange. Just not everything ok?
There's more details to holding a software wallet securely like encrypting it and backing it up, but if you can do at least those steps I mentioned above, you will have full control of your Bitcoin if something turns sour and you think about pulling out of the app.
Like GeneralZex said, Bitcoin cannot be seized without your consent if you control your wallet and your keys. If you became a political prisoner for example because you said a bad thing about your government, they could throw you in jail and take everything you own, but since your Bitcoin is stored as information in your mind - that is, the steps to recover your Bitcoin is a process only you know how to complete, only you know the password to, etc - no one can confiscate it from you without your consent, if they even know you have it in the first place.

Except channels are meant to be kept open long term, so if the Bitcoin value grows, it would potentially be worth it at some point.
You don't even need to DDOS you can just literally physically destroy the node (in the case of a single watchtower) and the physically destroy the person and node whom you're trying to steal from.
Bitcoin for example, if someone kills me, they never get my Bitcoin - no one does. There's no real incentive to kill me no matter how much Bitcoin I have (except, maybe, to make the price rise? weird thought... lol... but they don't get my BTC at least). However, if a criminal found a target that was worth it, they might kill that person, take out their internet, and take out any watchtower dealing with the person.
The timeframe is not a factor. 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years. You could say that the value of channels over lightning should never be worth too much, however people do crazy things for even a few hundred dollars. And as far as I can tell, it's possible to open a channel with as much BTC as you want, so the possibility to target someone is out there.
For example, let's say I open a channel with some business today with 1 BTC.
BTC rises and I only make a couple transactions with this business.
10 years from now that 1 BTC channel is worth $1 million, but I've only spent maybe a few thousand satoshi. It's now worth it for the business to collude with a watchtower to collapse my channel state in their favor. They would come kill me off, steal my phone, shut it down, shut down watchtowers that they could find that are watching for me, and then broadcast a final state where they claim all the funds. I'm dead, and maybe a few watchtower node operators are dead. But killing us was the best possible way they could attempt to get the full amount. Even if it fails, they are incentivized to kill us off before trying to broadcast the state. And again, if the organization was organized enough to own all the watchtowers, this attack would go through.

50TH is pretty good but if you haven't even checked out a mining profitability calculator then you're in for a world of fun getting set up and running...
Keep in mind **you will need a 220V input** so it's not something you can plug into a standard US wall outlet. Sometimes this means you need to pay for your electric company or an electrician to set you up with a 220V line to your house. If you're experienced with solar this might be easy to do off your inverter, not sure.
Also they pull upwards of 2kW power (Turbo is 2700 watts) so your solar is probably not going to cut it and your electricity costs are going to be something. In addition, you will probably have a computer running 24/7 along with the miner.
Mining is good as a hobby or a business, but not in between where you want to actually make money. If difficulty doesn't change that 50TH might make you $5k/year but if you invest the $3k into Bitcoin now you'll probably make another $3k by the end of the year meaning net +$4k just by holding Bitcoin. (-$3k cost, +$5k profit = $2k. $3k invest + $3k growth = $6k)

I'm... not talking about working satellites. I'm not talking about a working modern internet infrastructure. I'm saying if we had to revert to "primitive" technology, the capability to string two wires together would in fact allow us to maintain the Bitcoin ledger across multiple locations.
Modems are not hard to make either, the technology is fairly ancient with telephones having 150 years of history, and again, it's two wires.


I think you're underestimating the scenario. If we had any better communications, we would use it, but we could, if necessary (key word here), resort to dial-up. Even if it were slow - that just means we couldn't wait for confirmation and would have to trust our fellow humans more in these end-times - we would still process those transactions eventually.
(that key word, if necessary) this is contrary to Litecoin or other cryptos that physically, literally could not survive in this kind of scenario. They are scientifically pushed out of existence in this scenario. Considering stringing two wires between two computers at a distance is something we will probably always have in terms of a technological standpoint (if we have two computers, we definitely have two wires), it goes to reason that we should only trust an information-based currency system that can operate on those two wires strung between two computers at a distance.

Bitcoin is the ultimate free market. So if you want to risk your 10k Bitcoins, which is ... $110 million dollars ... 'driving down the price' of Bitcoin by selling them all, hoping everyone else will sell with you, so that you can then buy back 10k Bitcoins, driving the price back up, and will recover all those 10k Bitcoins in your buy-order and hope the price doesn't skyrocket above $11k per coin while you do that, by all means, go ahead.
In other words, if you wipe out 10k of the Buy orders, you then have to wipe out 10k of the sell orders to 'recover' your 10k Bitcoin. If you do any bit of math on this you will realize that except on small scales (like &lt;10 Bitcoin) you can't just sell and then buy and recover your initial Bitcoin at a profit. The people selling don't just drop down to meet your new buy point immediately. There's never enough Bitcoin at the lower price point to allow you to rebuy immediately with no loss (with large numbers).
What generally happens is someone holds a lot of Bitcoin, say 1000 or so, and buys/sells it all when they think the market is about to do something. Say they sell, since you're concerned with that driving the price down. The price of Bitcoin drops ~$150. That's it.
The point of selling is if you think the price will go down. So imagine you do this and sell a bunch, but the price goes up. You lost out on a lot of money by selling at that point. You made a bad call. This happened just recently, too.
Over the July 4 period, people sold (the first big drop on the left) around 3k Bitcoin, and the price fell ~$500. Except price didn't go down. It went back up. And the cursor there is held on the ~2k Bitcoin that were purchased after. Since the buy and sell candlesticks are in the same ballpark, if this was one person, or many people, or whatever, someone lost out a lot (that is, they took profits haha).
So there is nothing stopping you from driving the price down, or up, or doing whatever you want to do with your own Bitcoin, that you own and no one else owns. That's part of the beauty of it. It's yours. Do what you want with it. And if you try to manipulate the market, say by driving the price up, you make more people get interested in Bitcoin due to the price going up. And if you sell a bunch trying to drive down the price, you let those people get into Bitcoin at a much lower price today than yesterday. This is a natural cycle and you should not be concerned with 'whales' as you put it. They're part of the system just like everyone else.
This system is the most fair. As far as stable, that can be a good thing and a bad thing. For now, Bitcoin is 'unstable' in that the price fluctuates ~5%-10% per day, which is actually comparable to a lot of things. But eventually as the value rises, it will taper out a bit and stabilize. In the meantime, it is necessary to have the volatility to drive interest. And again, it's natural, it's to be expected, and healthy for anything that has volatility. What you don't want is stability in the short run - that means you failed. You want it volatile for a long while until it's not. If a stock stops being volatile early on, it's dead, the company is dead. So enjoy these price movements in Bitcoin because it means there's a strong heartbeat.

Not really. They're not lost. They're just not moving and we cannot tell if they are lost or not moving. We really can't. I do think that after 100 years Bitcoin will just truncate those transactions that haven't moved in 100 years and roll the BTC into the mining cycle, but... that's 100 years from now :)
In other words, them being lost does nothing to hurt the supply.


Yeah could be. Probably. Regardless, the valuation I am using is the rate of population increase. What is money except the representation of human labor? The perfect inflation system would simply add a fixed amount of fiat for every human born, and no more, and remove that same amount of fixed fiat for every human that dies, and no more. We'd never have inflation or deflation, we'd have a fixed currency.
But, like always, humans cannot be trusted, and they will always, always print more, and fake the books, and lie and cheat and steal. So we have Bitcoin instead.

Let's say someone got 51% hashing power AND decided to manipulate the blockchain by writing invalid transactions and stuff.
When we found out (very quickly) we could 'fork' and ignore this entity that was corrupting the chain. But we'd have to roll back some of the transactions and begin at a block we all agreed was the correct block to begin from again. All previous transactions would still be valid, but it could make Bitcoin lose credibility because if you can roll it back once, you could do it again, right?
But that doesn't really mean anything - since after that point we still have a valid ledger representing all the transactions that ever occurred on that ledger. Only transfers that happened in the short term would potentially be removed (if someone double-spent). So I think it is an overblown issue.

How to access your Bitcoin is purely information. If you can secure information, you can secure Bitcoin. Your seed, if you use one, is 24 words and maybe a passphrase; not hard to remember if you had to. Or write it down. Or secure it with a picture:

Of course. Just like people mining gold could think gold will always be worth something no matter what and will continue to mine gold for the rest of time. Gold is pretty dumb and useless to young people these days. Gold is World of Warcraft currency to young people. No one thinks of gold as any good anymore. But they'll keep on mining it! Could you imagine spending 16 hour days digging in the dirt for yellow metal? That's your life? Because you think this yellow metal is valuable? Ouch.
But keep in mind, the miners getting attached has nothing to do with how you value Bitcoin. If YOU see flaws, if YOU see something else looking better, then YOU are responsible for making the correct moves out of Bitcoin should that be the right move.


Regarding block size, people who maintain Bitcoin, that is, the people who are mainly accepted as the ones writing the software that people will use to interact on the Bitcoin network, decided, with community support, to just leave the block size small. This is just a decision. It could be completely different, but it is what it is. There's good reasons to do this - it means more miners have more chances to pick up on mining fees because there's more blocks with fees attached to them per day. No one miner scoops up 100% of available transactions per block. So it incentivizes mining. There's bad reasons for this too - slower transactions during heavy periods of activity. BCH decided to make their own hard-fork of Bitcoin, to write their own software to try and be the  and only Bitcoin in existence, hoping all the miners would switch over to their software which now has bigger blocks and is much more dynamic. But dynamic means "dynamic based on what we say is dynamic", meaning... once they begin to make changes, do they ever stop? No... not really. And those programmers would fully control this new, budding network. You're at their mercy. If they want to add something, you don't really have a say. The organic growth of Bitcoin is one of its strengths. Over time more people continued to vote into it with their hashing power. It's beyond the point of control by someone releasing a single software update to change everything.
So, not many people ended up switching to BCH. It could have taken off, but it didn't, so it doesn't matter. I have no idea why they get mad, though, at Bitcoin, considering all they did was copy/paste Bitcoin code and add their own code to it. Anyone can make their own hard-fork of Bitcoin. Theirs was of some success, since it is available for trade on many platforms today. So if you like it, use it, but there's no reason to, since its control is in the hands of their software creators and there's not as much hash power behind that network, so it's less secure.
Bitcoin itself still has programmers who work on the code, but due to the size of the Bitcoin network, if they ever release code that is bad, people just don't run it. In other words, the size of the Bitcoin network requires consensus if any new software is run. If the Bitcoin programmers add a change that no one wanted, then no one runs their new software, and nothing happens. So Bitcoin programmers, if they want to make an addition or change to Bitcoin, have to do so with massive community support, otherwise they're just wasting their time creating another hard-fork of Bitcoin for no reason.
Bitcoin has added some new features over time and generally they're well tested and thought out and only when there's enough awareness are the ideas pushed forward. In that regard Bitcoin is slow to advance, but that can be seen as a good thing. What happens if you add something and then in a few years it becomes obsolete? Can you revert your code? Can you remove it? What happens to all those past transactions? So new technology has to answer all these hard questions before people accept it. "Just increase the block size" is one of those things that is easy to say but has long term implications that might not be worth it in the long run.

Yeah but Bitcoin doesn't represent cash. Just like if I call an elephant a giraffe, does not make it a giraffe.
Bitcoin does not operate like cash. It's digital gold, not digital cash. It's digital-amazing-store-of-value, but not digital cash.
During a cash transaction between two parties, there is a period of anticipation. One party has the cash, the other party has the product. Then, both the product and the cash are revealed and both parties know fully what the other party has - this is the opening of a lightning channel. A channel is opened where both parties have something of value sitting on the table in the open. You put your cash on the table. The other party puts the product on the table.
The channel is open. You both know what the other has, and yet, either can attempt to now take both the product and the cash at that moment - one of you can try to commit crime and perform a theft. This is inherent to a cash transaction which is why Bitcoin is not cash - with Bitcoin there is no putting your money on the table, and no moment where both parties can steal both the money and the product. If you send the Bitcoin, it is gone, and you can only take the product, and cannot also take the cash.
So, back to the channel. The channel is when both parties have cash on the table and have the opportunity to secure both the product and the cash. Then the exchange happens, where the cash is given to the seller and the product is given to the buyer.
The two parties now leave. They still have a channel open - the buyer and seller both know what the other has at this point. Even after they move away from each other, the knowledge of what the other person has and the ability for each party to steal both the product and the cash does not change. Again, this is inherent to cash.
The buyer and seller now leave and go on their way - but the channel again is still open. The buyer still knows the cash is out there, somewhere, possible to be stolen. The seller knows their product is out there, somewhere, possible to be stolen. The channel is still open even though the two parties are vast distances apart.
Finally, the seller deposits their cash into a bank. This closes the channel. This is when the lightning channel settles to the Bitcoin ledger. The buyer no longer can steal the cash from the seller. The cash transaction channel is closed. But the buyer doesn't know the seller deposited the cash, so they might still want to perform the crime and try to steal the cash even though the seller no longer has it - the buyer doesn't know that yet. But regardless, the channel is closed.
Lightning has all the features of a cash transaction, and gives the added benefit of both parties knowing when the other closes the channel. When the seller or buyer closes the channel with LN, both parties now know the option of theft is completely gone at that point, just like when the seller deposited cash into the bank. This makes LN better than a fiat cash transaction in person.
The title of the Bitcoin whitepaper is better stated as "Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash-Like System" which still doesn't do it justice. There's nothing like Bitcoin. It's not cash, it's like a perfect banking system more than cash. Lightning is electronic cash. But calling it a banking system would not be a good title.
Cash can be stolen when revealed. Bitcoin, you either own it or you do not. It cannot be stolen (in electronic form) in the sense of you placing it on the table in anticipation of a transaction. It is first in place A, and then immediately in place B, with no timeframe where it is possible for both the buyer and seller to commit a crime and steal both the product and the cash. The seller always has the option, sure, but as soon as the buyer sends Bitcoin, the buyer is in the dark and must trust the other person will fulfill their obligation to hand over the product.

If you control the money supply, but not the way in which the people transact, then the thing that controls the way people transact is in control of the money supply.

Seems like the same thing. Happy to take a crack at the idea if you can clarify it a bit more.

Human greed. The Fed prints 'aces' - USD - all the time. Every loan made is made not with something at risk behind it. It's made from thin air. The human greed is the factor we can eliminate. You might not print aces, but somewhere down the line, someone will, because whomever does so gets to print aces and pay everyone to do what they want for the rest of their life.


If you study why so many wars occur it is because central banks invade to conquer other nations and install their own money printing machine - a new central bank for every country invaded. So you're right, you wouldn't let us have a say, because you could print money and get a 4th person to kill one of us and control us. This is what the central banks do.
Bitcoin eliminates the possibility of you killing someone to obtain their wealth, because necessarily, killing them prevents the information about how to access their Bitcoin from ever being revealed. Bitcoin *protects your life* in a way, but that's for another long write up.


If the intention was just to hand the Bitcoin back and forth, sure, no effect. Keep in mind, money isn't buying something - it's not buying a product - it's buying human labor. So if two people just hand something back and forth all week, they are performing some work. They are performing the same work, handing it back and forth, no one profiting, no one losing either, just expending energy.
As soon as one of them says, "I will give you this Bitcoin to do X for me," is when it has an effect on paper money. Now, think about it, two people handing something back and forth constantly, there's equal labor, equal work. Now, you have a disparity - someone wants the other to do something extra, to perform some labor. As soon as that occurs, as soon as one person wants from the other, money is 'born'. So you might ask the other person, "Hey I'm hungry, since you're getting something to eat, will you also get me something to eat?" The other person, could, especially in small communes, just get you food. But when we hit a larger market, the other person will want something in return. They could have used paper money, but if they choose to use Bitcoin, they strengthen Bitcoin, and since the dollar sits there unused, the dollar is weak, because the Bitcoin is capable of facilitating the trade.
In a perfect system, that person would get you food, and then the very next time you're both hungry, you would go get food for the both of you. An equal exchange. This is Bitcoin, the equal exchange. When one person expends energy for another, that has value, and in an equal exchange system, we'd both work equally to help each other out. In a larger market, I don't need all the things millions of people can do for me all at once, so we represent our labor with tokens representing the work effort we put into the world, so that at any time, we can go to another human and ask them to perform work on our behalf, because we have performed work elsewhere for others.
If in that system anyone can print money - even the possibility of it - then that person is the most powerful person in the world. They can buy all the labor, basically, since at the moment, the population doesn't know or believe that printing money can even happen, they just see money. For example, if you make high quality hammers - you're a blacksmith. You make these hammers and it takes you a day to make just one. You sell them for $100 each, because they're amazing. If I can print money, not only can I come in and buy all your labor for the rest of your life, but I can also pay $500 per unit to make sure you only sell to me. You're amazed you're getting paid so well, but it cost me nothing, I just printed the paper dollars for you. You were my slave your entire life and didn't know it.


I disagree, and you can confirm this yourself, seriously, in a very short time frame, like a minute or two. Just list out every single thing you would want in the best currency you could ever invent. You will find that many of the features you think you want, you don't actually want, because they cancel out something else.
Bitcoin is not slow - we can discuss why this is if you want. It is faster than payment processors like Visa, who only settle credit card machines once per day usually. Meaning, the business doesn't get their funds into their bank until 24 hours later or a few days later if it is the next business day. The payment processors do a good job hiding these delays from you, the paying customer. You just swipe and go, not knowing the risk the business takes each time (and pays for it, in fees, for the 'privilege').
Bitcoin is not cumbersome, but I can admit it is not like a piece of paper you can pick up and hand over to someone. It's only 10 years old, it is in its infancy, and since it is code, just technology, technology gets better over time. This issue will be solved quite easily. Gold is cumbersome, for example.
Anonymous is not a feature you want in currency. If you don't know that a transaction happened, you don't know if anyone is printing the currency or not. Necessarily, the best money ever to be created cannot be anonymous if we are to trust it. Every transaction should be verifiable by anyone who wants to do so. We could agree, the best money should allow for a layer of anonymity if it is desired, and to that degree, Bitcoin succeeds.
Last, I will say if you find one single thing that a currency should have that Bitcoin does not (and does not cancel anything else good out), you would be rich beyond belief. So let me know if you think of anything. It's not that Bitcoin is first 'crypto' and that's why it is good. It's not even the name or whatever. It's because it's the only currency that has all the components of the best money you could design, and again, if you could add just one thing that the best currency is supposed to have (an inherent feature, like ease of use) you would create a better Bitcoin and everyone would transfer their wealth - over time - to this new, better currency. The fact that it is first, and has a great story behind the creator, is just icing on the cake. This technology will exist for the rest of time. It has been unlocked. Buying Bitcoin now is just buying a future currency at a discount.

"Actual" is a qualifier. Value implies currency/money in that value creates those things. We cannot discuss value without also discussing currency/money. Even without any physical representation of value, my work effort is possible to be traded for someone else's work effort. 1 hour of my time, for your 1 hour of your time. We have currency, because we value each other. Those units can be kept in account in our minds. "Implies" not "Creates", just to be clear.

So you're in favor of the Fed printing more money to counter a crisis they created in the first place by printing money?
I am under the impression you, like most smart people here, understand the monster that is the Fed and would like it eliminated and a return to sound monetary policy that does not include endless printing of fiat money. If you are instead in favor of inflation and the Fed and want them to retain power by maintaining the status quo then you would think any disruption to monetary policy is a "mess". I believe the American people won't be able to push for any different way of doing things (such as a return to the gold standard) unless there is disruption in the financial policy - such a disruption can be brought forward by either a) paying back a lot of debt or b) printing off a lot more money than the Fed expects. Instability will reveal the problems in the Fed making the people pay attention to why the problems exist in the first place.

Value is determined by people; not companies. You can produce something YOU think is valuable, but no one else might like your neon-colored knitted hats. Stock is the company's way of raising money and extra investment early on so the investors might get a chance at making a profit for doing nothing later.
Bitcoin is based on speculation, use cases, lots of work and effort put into it by people from all over the world, a solid ledger stored worldwide, and a system which is secure with the most processing power towards one human-created goal ever put forward to date.
The technology isn't inherent to Bitcoin - glad you're understanding it now! It's a technology. It's not going anywhere. If Bitcoin gets replaced the replacement will have all the features of Bitcoin, including a massive hash rate, and that will take time to achieve. So there will be Bitcoin until there isn't, and any successor will need to grow slowly over time just the same, and people will transfer their wealth into the new, potentially better option of storing value. But for storing value, Bitcoin is a great choice - this has nothing to do with speculation or stocks or companies. The storing of value is a human-based thing we do. Some people store their value into old cars, some into stocks, some into bonds, some into old baseball cards, some into old coins, some into gold, some into paintings and art. Do any of those have value outside what someone thinks they have value? It is all perception which is unique to your perspective and what you feel is the best store of value that you enjoy.
Bitcoin just happens to be the best place to store your value long term and it's not going anywhere - which means either tens of millions of people are getting scammed or they think this thing has value.

When you go forward a bit and consider an economy on a non-inflationary currency, the moment you buy Bitcoin with your labor you profit, and the increase in labor into the market makes your Bitcoin immediately worth more.
Of course, people can sell their Bitcoin and *not profit in fiat* (they can also sell their Bitcoin for dirt; point being people make bad choices) but the moment you buy Bitcoin for the first time the value goes up and you have profited if not yet realized those gains. Time and increase in labor mean in a fixed currency economy everyone who buys Bitcoin with their labor does actually profit and it is not mathematically impossible because the increase in the labor pool is the other side of that unit of account.
This is only worth pointing out because of how it differs where when you earn some fiat money today, the rate of inflation immediately devalues it and not everyone can make a profit by buying fiat because the supply is constantly increasing.

This is unfortunately a relative term. For someone, it will be worth it. People kill other people for their pocket money. If there is some way, it will be attempted, and one big 'score' would make up for minor losses.
If there is even the possibility, people will try, is my point. So the system has to prevent more attempts than is possible to try in a human lifetime. If 1 attempt per year goes through, it's not secure. If 1 attempt per million years goes through, then ok no big deal. Bitcoin for example, you need the lifetime of the universe to hope to guess my private key.

"That’s what watchtowers are for." doesn't help but thanks anyway. Looking it up, watchtowers kick the can down the road then. We cannot trust each other, so we'll trust someone else. The watchtower itself can be compromised. Or if I'm a watchtower and notice a singular connection from someone, I could collude if I knew there was enough to make it worthwhile and either broadcast a state that the attacker wanted, or just prevent the person whom I was supposed to be watching from ever getting their old state transmitted.
In other words, if there's 2 BTC on a channel, and the thief knows I am the watchtower for this transaction (again, we can cut off the intended target's network to force a single watchtower to be the trusted one), the thief could tell me, the watchtower, that they will pay me 0.5 BTC to prevent the old state from being transmitted. Even though I have to pay the target a penalty for letting the false state get broadcast, it's going to be fairly low compared to the 0.5 BTC I'm getting from the attacker.

I understand those risks and still see them as less risk than fiat, which is not bound by the Constitution - it's bound by bankers' will. The illusion of government control is the only reason it succeeds.
When we look back and see in the 20th century we had two Presidents steal gold from the people, it's not unlikely to see this happen again in the future unless we choose otherwise.
I trust neither Libra nor fiat, but I will support the competitor over the decreed.

I've posted a lot on this. Read my post history and pay attention to the long posts. You'll get info on wallets but also a lot of 'why' Bitcoin is good. Basically you can easily get a software wallet by downloading Bitcoin Core, encrypting and backup your wallet, make copies of it and store it super safe in multiple places, copy the receiving address and save that, and then delete the wallet file from your computer (since you have backups!) and you have a very secure wallet you can send any Bitcoin to using the receiving address. This software wallet is free, and you can think about a hardware wallet or something else as you learn more, if you need it. But this gets you going and gets your Bitcoin off the exchange pretty fast - you can do this in a few minutes.

"centralized crypto-fiat" is not crypto. It's just fiat with a new name, lol...
From what I read, she admitted crypto is shaking things up, and they don't want things to shake too much! Meaning they're scared and don't know what to do.
Any move a central bank makes is a bad move. If they develop a centralized crypto-bank - people will ask, what is crypto? And they will find Bitcoin. Adoption is all Bitcoin needs. More people who understand it. You don't even have to 'use' it. Just to understand it, and maybe stash away a little bit of money over time to store the value of your labor.
If any bank mentions crypto... Bitcoin has only been around 10 years, and already it has central bankers talking about it. Think about it. I don't think I've ever heard a central banker even talk about Facebook before Libra.

No, 51% does not result in stolen assets, just an invalid blockchain that has to continue being 51% forever to succeed. The moment it drops under 51% all the invalid transactions would be kicked out. I.e. the controlling group would need to main 51%+ for all time.
Bitcoin would not die. It cannot die. It's a technology. It's like saying the internet would die. We now have this technology, it will not go away.
If you are concerned about the 51% problem, research it more, I think you're under the impression everything stops existing regarding Bitcoin and the blockchain at that point, and it's not the case. All previous transactions are still maintained in the ledger. All it would allow someone to do is double-spend their own money, if they decided to do this knowing it would make everyone else stop doing business with them, and not allow them to 'actually' steal from others.

On BitMEX, you can bet on the future of Bitcoin. If you think Bitcoin will rise in price after some time, you can bet to go 'long'. If you are right, you make a lot of money. If you go 'short' you bet that Bitcoin will be lower than its current value. If you are right, you make a lot of money.
But in doing so, often these people use "Leverage" which is to say, if I have 1 Bitcoin on hand, I can "bet" as if I have 10 Bitcoin. I think BitMEX allows up to 100x "Leverage".
Again, I don't follow this too closely, but that means with 1 Bitcoin, you can "bet" with 100 Bitcoin worth of value. So if you "win" the bet, and the price of Bitcoin rises after your bet, you make 100x the "profit" you might make otherwise.
But this comes with insane risk. If you "lose" the bet, you lose your 1 Bitcoin, and all of the extra money you need to have put up to 'purchase' the leverage you bought. So you lost 1 BTC PLUS all the money you put up to be able to leverage. You get "liquidated" and lose everything.
$240 million or something just happened.
What the futures market is, is you borrowing someone's Bitcoin or money today, betting that Bitcoin will rise in price or fall in price. So, someone might let you borrow 100 Bitcoin at today's price - but you have to pay them back 100 Bitcoin (or the # equivalent) in 4 weeks (or some time frame), no matter the price. So, when you borrow their Bitcoin and have two contract options and you choose one option only.  Go short: sell the 100 Bitcoin at today's price, sit on $1 million cash, and in 4 weeks, you owe the person 100 BTC. If BTC goes down in price - you can buy back the BTC at a discount, giving the person 100 BTC, and you keep all the remaining profit. If Bitcoin was $9000 when you had to pay back the 100 BTC, you spend $900,000 out of your $1 million to buy the 100 Bitcoin, keeping $100,000 profit. Option  Go long: instead of selling at today's price, you hold the Bitcoin and instead of paying them back Bitcoin in 4 weeks, you pay them today's value of cash in 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, if the price goes up to $11k per Bitcoin, you sell your 100 Bitcoin for $1.1 million, pay the other person their $1 million, and you keep $100,000.
If you can pull this off, you can see, you make a lot of money.
But this seems weird - why doesn't everyone just do this? Well, you're betting against someone else. Meaning... someone has to give you the 100 BTC or $1 million to make your bet. They win, or lose, depending on what the market does and the bet. If you win, they lose. If you lose, they win. When they lose, they didn't lose anything, they just didn't gain anything (they lost their opportunity cost). When you lose, you lose everything.
And, since you're only betting with 1 Bitcoin and some extra money in an account, they don't let you rack up debt. If your position is 'short' meaning you think Bitcoin price is going to go down, but instead BTC price goes up too fast, if it crosses a point where you cannot cover the leverage amount - for example, if you go short and bet Bitcoin will go down in price, if it goes up 10%, that means you "owe" the other person 10% more at that moment, and if that 10% more isn't covered by your 1 BTC and other cash in your account, your account gets liquidated - you lose everything, and the contract cancels, and the other person wins your money.
As such, this is SUPER RISKY and STUPID AS ALL HELL to do with Bitcoin, because it is so volatile and can be manipulated by people with deep pockets. But people do it a lot, and they get absolutely destroyed losing everything on their bets.
So, when you hear $240 million just got liquidated, it means a bunch of people literally just lost $240 million, and when that happens automatically due to the liquidation levels set by the contract, there is either a huge buying of Bitcoin (when someone bets short and loses) or a huge selling of Bitcoin (when someone bets long and loses). This is all done automatically within the exchange, so you never actually hold the amounts in question, you just profit or get liquidated.

No the person's comment is still valid. Westerners are already 'richer' than 95% of the world population.
A 100x price increase is not unfathomable. People said it was impossible for a 100x price increase when Bitcoin was $100.
I would agree with you if we were talking about a stock, which a lot of people think Bitcoin is - some investment. It's no investment. It's buying a future currency at a discount today. Slightly different than a stock which requires a company to continue to produce products and services to maintain a share of the market which they operate in. Currency operates in every market.
The only limitation to growth is time and trust. So in 10 years... yeah I could see another 100x increase. Everyone always forgets the extra ~1 billion people that will enter the world in the next 10 years. Currency is a representation of labor, and with more people versus an non-inflating currency, the price should always go up if it is trusted as a store of value - a store of the labor produced. Indeed someone saving even a little partial Bitcoin today could be buying their house with that Bitcoin in 10-20 years.
Amazon stock started at $1.50 and is now over $1900. Surely anywhere along that path, there were people saying, "It's not like it's going to do 10x in the next number of years!" They were often wrong. The bottleneck with any company however is the market share. How many people will use Amazon versus their local Walmart? In either case, they will be using fiat money at Amazon or Walmart. When Bitcoin (or crypto in general if you want) becomes more widely adopted, people aren't going to be using fiat at Amazon or Walmart, they will be using Bitcoin.
I think all anyone has to do is look at gold. A useless piece of yellow metal. Not backed by anything except this shared idea that it is worth something. Same as Bitcoin, a math function, not backed by anything except this shared idea that it is worth something.

Lightning doesn't run the risk of your wallet being hacked. There's also more at risk with your physical wallet, as it contains your ID, credit cards, important numbers or whatever else of value. You expose much more with your physical wallet.


Yes, it does, and often times much longer, but this timeframe is usually hidden from you. For example, if you saw something you wanted to buy from Craigslist, you might be at a grocery store and get $20 cash back to then head over and buy the item from the Craigslist seller. That $20 seems instant to you, but the business has to wait for the credit/debit card terminal to process the transaction in batch format later on in the day and only receives the funds in their own bank account 24 hours later. The idea to you feels instant, because we've hidden it from you, and you are blind to the workings behind the scene. Establishing a channel is faster than modern banking.


When you pull fiat USD cash out of your pocket, you are in essence establishing a channel with the person you are transacting with. You are putting money on the table. At that moment, they know you have cash. And when you give the cash to the other person, now you know they have that cash. That knowledge does not disappear just because you leave the room, or the location. If you buy from someone on Craigslist, you know where this person lives, and you know they now have at least $20 in their house. When that person then goes the bank and deposits the cash, this 'closes the channel' - except I might not know that he deposited the cash, and so I still think he has cash and I might go attempt to rob him the next day only to find out he deposited the cash. With Lightning, while the channel is open, you know the other person has the cash, but when they close it, you also know they closed the channel. When they deposit the transaction to the Bitcoin ledger, you know they did that. This removes risk from the cash transaction. As such it is way better than a normal fiat cash transaction.


I know, but it's only been 10 years as of this year. The iPhone has been around for 12 years. Facebook for 15 years, Amazon for 20 years. We're in the absolute infancy and it's growing very fast. Buckle up and get involved. The same motivation that makes you go out into the world and perform labor to get paid in money will be the same motivation that makes you go out into the world and perform labor to get paid in Bitcoin (because, it's money).
Lightning is more secure than cash and is literally the digital representation as such. It's as important to Bitcoin as Bitcoin itself. And I say this as a complete Lightning skeptic and critic as of a few days ago.

51% isn't required, it can be stolen by a 1% attack or 0.00001% attack. The amount of effort is quite small compared to Bitcoin.
If I have 51% of the power in a nation, I can steal your gold, but I can also do it with 0.00001% of the power. My own personal volition is enough.


Well, yes, it's central to whomever holds the asset, right? All my Bitcoin are centralized to me, but the ledger that says what I have which everyone trusts is held by the decentralized public.
Make no mistake - Bitcoin's 51% vulnerability is epic magnitudes more secure than gold and any other asset. Nearly an infinite ratio.

Either way is valid for disrupting the Fed's control on the population - if they print too much, hyperinflation. If they print too little, massive economic downturn.
So to get through to regular people, which approach would catch the attention of more people and lead to a disruption of the Fed's control:
1. "The Fed should stop printing so much money it's bad for the economy."
2. "The Fed should print a lot more money so everyone has more money and the economy can flourish!"
Only one of those will people rally behind - the one with more money in their pocket. Both options lead to a failure of the Fed. So which one gets popular support? The only way to not disrupt the Fed is to let it continue playing it's balancing game. Imagine if Ron Paul held a platform saying, "Everyone should get $100,000 printed off from the Fed if I had my way!" He'd be a winner in no time. The end result - flaws revealed in the Fed and the requirement for new monetary policy - would be the same as the, "End the Fed, we need to not print so much money," approach.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:55:34


Well you guessed wrong. Go look up what Bitcoin is and try to understand it.


Definitely not! Imagine if you put value into baseball cards. After some time, those grew out of fashion and you'd be sad when your rare baseball card is worth less than some digital card game's rare card. Your question is like asking, "Considering price alone, are you happy with your brand new car purchase when it loses $4000 value the moment you drive it off the lot?"
It's not all about price, though that brings enthusiasm because higher price means "it's working". It's actual proof that the idea is working. And if you look up what the idea is you'll understand how much better Bitcoin is than a baseball card for storing value.


If you're willing to trust the person behind the printing press, then yes. But why have that risk of someone behind the printing press? That's kind of the point. We eliminate the human desire to print more money when given the chance. Many non-inflationary fiat currencies can be thought up and considered, but behind each will be someone with the power to print more money. So why even risk someone being able to print more, even if the goal at the outset is to not do so? It might not be this generation or the next, but somewhere down the line someone will say, "It is in the best interest to print more money," and then it's all over. This isn't inherent to fiat either - any lesser crypto can be compromised and someone can change the code and all of a sudden you have an inflationary currency where there was none and the price plummets. Bitcoin's size prevents this from happening, where a smaller crypto would be easily compromised just by Bitcoin-enthusiasts alone in order to cripple them.
Back to price, a rising price, and even where it was earlier at ~$4k is indication it's working. So the price rises and sends a signal to everyone; this is an idea worth paying attention to. And as more people learn about the technology and understand how it stores value, more people get involved and the price goes up. The price is the last step in the equation and the least important, but the most easy to judge performance by. If it were a bad idea, if it were a baseball card and baseball dies off as a popular sport, then the card loses value and you're not too excited anymore.
Bitcoin is currency, not a sport, so it's not some obscure unique thing. It's money. And everyone in the world is interested in money, and every speculator known to man will agree; humans are probably going to be interested in money in the future. So if Bitcoin is money, and you've learned about the technology and think it is the best money ever made, then you're sitting there looking at a $10k price tag and saying, "I'll buy that, because I know in the future this is going to be worth much more."
This is also where we are at; there's nothing wrong with price discovery and we're still at it. As a money, Bitcoin will likely be volatile for some time until most users deal in satoshi units regularly. A ~$200 billion market cap is nothing for what a currency represents. So knowing that, you know the price should rise every cycle as it gets closer to actual valuation. If the price does not rise (likewise, the hashrate which eliminates all other cryptos), then the idea is not working and there's a problem that needs to be considered. But as it stands, the price reinforces the fact that Bitcoin is a good idea.

I've been discussing the vulnerabilities in depth for a couple days. It's the in-person cash transaction of the Bitcoin world. There's risks, but no more than taking cash out of your pocket when buying something off Craigslist. Using Bitcoin direct is infinitely more secure, but if you want - because LN is completely optional, mind you - you can have ease of use and fast and safe cash-like transactions which settle to the Bitcoin layer whenever you want. Feel free to read my history attempting to attack the idea from multiple angles and ending up concluding it is exactly like an in-person cash transaction in real life.

It is, but that volatility is hidden by massive manipulation of the world economy so you think it's stable. It's also sitting on top of inflation and monetary policy stealing from everyone.
There's a lot that happens that makes you think it's stable which is why I said, "Surely my government won't remove gold from backing my dollar..." "Surely my government won't remove gold as the reserve currency..." "Surely my government won't favor printing paper fiat over using gold for currency..."
It shows how unstable it is. Bitcoin can not be manipulated like that, and solves all the problems that caused that manipulation to occur. The mere fact that fiat can inflate by the will of a few central bankers where Bitcoin simply cannot be inflated period by the whim of anyone shows fiat is more risky.
But the claims of stability are like saying, "No crime has happened to me so there is no crime rate." "Surely my government won't hyperinflate my money..."

You seem to be under the impression that if the money is just in a vault then it is somehow not printed out of thin air. I don't know what to tell you. Your adherence to this idea that money is somehow physical is your own downfall. Maybe you think gold is money, because you can hold it. Money is an idea; a medium of exchange between people. When I say 'printing money' it's not the fake propaganda you saw on TV of printing presses printing money. It's a computer, entering in a number into someone's account.

You spend more on the transaction fee, making more of an incentive for the miners to add the transaction to the chain, where each block is mined every ~10 minutes. There's no actual real guarantee unless maybe they pay you if the miners fail to accept the transaction or something, which would be weird. A high enough fee would be confirmed in the very next block, scaling downward from there.
Since they are not telling you the fee, when you select the "priority" fee schedule, they put a fee high enough to get your transaction mined in around 30 minutes, but charge you as if you would get in at 10 minutes, keeping the spread.

I wrote my case against Tether here. If anyone disagrees I'd like to hear it but I think my reasoning is correct. This also applies to any third-party stablecoin. An internal exchange stablecoin isn't that much of a risk, because by design, any company has to keep internal accounts for their customers anyway (it's inherent to every single business basically that each business has their own accounting). A third party 'stablecoin' that can be freely minted out of thin air is a huge, monumental risk, probably the biggest risk to crypto I can envision. That risk is only realized when an exchange accepts it. Any exchange accepting Tether is compromised.

I valued Bitcoin at $10,000 each when it was at $100 when I sat down and really thought about it.
I was wrong, as I only considered the US economy's currency, and didn't take into account all things of value, the global economy, and the fact that fiat money is debt-as-money. I didn't know much. My initial thinking was just a guess. Although I've learned a lot since, I still don't have a complete understanding of the entire world economy, so I can't say 100% where Bitcoin's worth 'sits' at. But a rough guess will be Bitcoin becoming more stable around $1 million per coin. $100k per coin is as certain as $1k per coin in my mind. Bitcoin has time as well - much of my thinking was considering the long term growth, so although I think it hits any upward target, these are valuations I think will be hit in my lifetime to be worthwhile to my own life.

I get use out of streets, electricity and many other things that we all agree as people are valuable to all of us. I draw the line at healthcare because your own personal actions affect your health and only your health (sometimes others' health, negatively) so I should not be forced to pay for something I have no use of. I don't get to use your health. I can not benefit from it like every other accepted expenditure. And the fact people abuse their health means I am not wanting to pay for their care and basically be an enabler for them to continue being unhealthy.
Helping each other is fine; holding a gun to someone's head and saying, "You must pay for that junkie's healthcare," is bad. Giving you the opportunity to help should you want to is good. Throwing someone in jail for not helping others is bad.

I've posted a lot about this. Most recently this comment on the matter: 
 Proof of work is why crypto works, and having the most work is the only security you can have to ensure no one can overtake your cryptocurrency. For example, BCH can be dominated by 2-5% of BTC's total hash rate. All it would take is a small number of miners to just swap over and obtain 51%+ of the mining reward. What this means is that the group which does this - they don't need to attack BCH's blockchain - but the income they receive from mining will allow them to buy more mining machines more than any other player in the system, and eventually own 90%+ of all the hashrate in BCH, because no one could receive value enough to outcompete their production. At that point, the miner is able to control every transaction. They can for example decide to never accept transactions which have fees less than a certain number of satoshis. Even if some other miner in the 10% bracket accepts low fees, the rate of block creation will force any of the 10% miners out because their blocks will always be invalidated by the larger 90% chain.
So the only security in crypto is the hash rate with proof of work. Every single crypto that a) has less hash rate than Bitcoin and b) is not gaining hash rate over Bitcoin over time, is inferior. Not due to "it's Bitcoin" but because of proof of work and math and logic. Nothing to do with the name, just that everyone is trusting it more.
The reason this also invalidates every altcoin is because a player can make more money with Bitcoin to then eventually go back to the altcoin and take it over. In other words, if you had $100k to drop on mining machines, you could invest in Bitcoin mining, and make enough profit where you go back to altcoinX with new mining machines to dominate that space. So every crypto with less hash rate is inferior.

Fiat ATM can run out of physical cash inside them. Bitcoin ATMs don't need to be physically restocked so should always have 'funds' to transfer (since it's pulled from the BATM servers anyway). It's a decent representation of where Bitcoin has benefits over fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:57:45
Yeah it's my own idea.


If you lost your own Bitcoin and no one knew, you know of something more scarce than Bitcoin that also still exists. Something no one can have but yet it also exists. I know it seems weird but it is worth something. Like the stone in the water, you still own it, but you cannot move it, and taking possession of it is only valuable in the sense of everyone trusting that fact. So it's not like you can do much with it, but it has more value than something that does not exist.
Put it this way; if you owned that Bitcoin and could lay claim to it, legally over time as people accept Bitcoin more and more. If you somehow had a way where governments would back up your claim to something lost - this is possible, for example like Mt.Gox claims, someone is buying other peoples' claims to something that may be unrecoverable. If in time SHA256 is broken somehow (before this, Bitcoin moved past it to something more secure), your coins could be 'recovered' in a sense. You'd maintain ownership.
That time frame is immense. But if you kept track of your lost coins throughout history and had claim to them, maybe in a few trillion years your descendants get to unlock it and become the most wealthy people in the universe, because that claim was maintained for such a long term. It's fanciful, but also possible. Your lost coins are indeed still out there somewhere. They're just not reliably recovered in any time frame we can observe using modern understanding.

No, the US has *already* attacked the entire world and conquered it. Just look at your nation's central bank - it is connected to the world central bank, controlled by the banking families that created these central banks - Americans, in 1913.
It's already done. The threat of US attacking anyone is only if you're a nation that does not yet have a central bank installed, like North Korea and Iran. Libya was one such nation until just a few years ago. Now they have a central bank.

It doesn't matter where it comes from; a printing press, a digital account with some numbers typed in, old money sitting in a bank vault. The lower rate incentivizes loans which pour extra money into the economy for reasons only the Fed is able to decide upon. Surely they will always make the right call as to how to balance between the inflation they cause and the deflation they cause. Surely they will always maintain just enough to constantly steal from people and never cause any trouble. Surely they won't remove gold from backing the dollar. Surely they won't remove gold as the reserve currency. Surely they won't replace gold with fiat printed money.
Bitcoin allows people to do away with any hope of anyone manipulating the money supply. Holding fiat is the risk.

Pretty much every Bitcoin business is worse than "just Bitcoin". Meaning, if you are offering services and so on, your users are generally better off just getting the Bitcoin on their own, since it's so easy to do. Still, if you can convince those users to remain ignorant of the processes and have them pay you for managing their Bitcoin, sure. The Bitcoin ATM market seems the best possible option for a service though, because it is a free-for-all market, with no banks controlling it and is completely unregulated as far as I can tell. It will be completely dominated by who can produce the cheapest machines and offer the cheapest prices. As such it will be very competitive - but also means a low margin over time (as it should be). Getting in early is the only hope I think.

It's more that due to how power works, someone will be the most powerful, so if it's possible for that most powerful entity to have as much good intentions as possible, the net effect is overall better than allowing someone with negative intentions the same power.


Free healthcare means you literally pay for every health related stuff you get over time for your entire life with no choice in the matter. This is step 1 and not knowing economics. The cost is just distributed to you and everyone else over your entire life so you don't feel the burn of paying out of pocket as much. But you do pay it. It's not free.
US infrastructure is not falling apart, that's just a politician talking point. We have maybe the most roads and infrastructure in the world and we hate when things go wrong so if something goes wrong we make a big deal about it. But overall things are just fine.


Your country probably doesn't maintain world superpower status, meaning you rely on the current world superpower to offset your defense costs. Because really, without defense, another nation could just come in, assassinate all your leadership, plant a leader and a central banking authority, and reap all the rewards of taxing your people. This has already happened in your nation - the USA has done this to you already - so the only difference is now the USA protects anyone else from doing this to you. That's all. So you have this false sense of the presence of money that can be used for health and education, without understanding how it is made possible.
Really, this doesn't matter. If you like health and education and don't like war expenditures and so on, Bitcoin is the solution, so you're in the right place. All the free healthcare and all the wars rely on the fiat inflationary monetary system which most of the world operates upon. Bitcoin disrupts that. So not only will you be able to be happy that there is no more war, but I will be happy knowing no one else gets 'free' healthcare.

It doesn't matter if they allow USDT/fiat. If an exchange allows Tether holders to buy BTC or any crypto that can then be used to buy BTC, Tether can flood the market with free printed money, buy up tons of BTC driving up the price arbitrarily, then close down their operations and never pay out anyone wanting to sell their Tether for USD. There is no stopping this either, because even if Tether operated legitimately, banks could manipulate it from the outside and then have governments shut down Tether's ability to pay out, freezing all their funds and making sure no one ever gets paid. It would be like Mt.Gox^2 or worse in terms of when it happens.
And I do mean when it happens. Every Tether holder will lose all their money, have no Bitcoin, and exchanges would lose all their reputation and crash, be unable to meet liquidity, and fail. As each exchange fails, everyone sells their Bitcoin crashing other exchanges and everyone distrusts the markets longer. It's dirty. Bitcoin will still survive but it will wipe out a lot of trust and adoption, which means lower value.

Your argument is related to semantics. Raising the rates 7 times in 2 years does not invalidate the devaluing of money today. That's like saying, "Well I didn't steal from you the past 2 years, but this year I'm doing it and you will remember that I didn't do it for 2 years before this year."

From the point of view of this being serious, it is kind of like when you're a kid and you learn that if you give a person some of these paper things, you get a toy. You get ingrained with this idea that if you get more of these paper things, you can get more toys. As you grow, you realize if you want things, all you need is to get some more of this paper stuff and hand it over and people happen to give you things you want. You learn that these paper things are so important, you will do stuff to obtain more of them. You then realize you will spend 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week showing up to the same place over and over to obtain a regular flow of these paper things that you can use to obtain anything you want.
Bitcoin is money. Eventually you will be spending 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week performing labor to obtain more Bitcoin, no different than fiat, gold backed fiat, and gold before that. Some of us already do this; we're ahead of the game, buying this future currency at a discount.

Gold does not cause the metallic smell when you touch it, so maybe the insistence that you don't actually touch the 'gold' is because it's not real.

Lower prices. Amazon for example is acting as their own payment processor so they can afford giving you a 5% discount *and they are making a profit on that transaction in terms of fees*. Amazon has low fees to themselves, basically. Now imagine the discount if the customer paid the transaction fee and you didn't have to a) worry about the fee the payment processor charges you or b) fund waste-of-time chargeback and other nonsense without dealing with the customer directly.
Likewise, every other business tacks on a rough 3% to every transaction because they don't know if you will pay by the most expensive 'cash back' card or cash. So the pricing is wrapped up in the macro pricing that all customers could use the worst-case credit card with that company. A 2% cash back card might cost the company a 3% fee on the transaction, for example. Cash back is just you 'stealing' back money from the vendor, and yet you feel good about it, when all the company did anyway was increase their price to compensate, and you ended up paying yourself, and forcing everyone else to be stolen from at the same rate even if they didn't use the cash back card.

When the exchange crashes, they probably hold a lot of Tether in their accounts too. In addition, *the exchange crashes.* This means no one uses them any more. This means they go out of business. Because they are the reason - the middleman - entrusting Tether enough to perform a trade on their customers' behalf.
The exchanges that accepted Tether will die, 100%, not because they did anything wrong but because their product is trust, and trust can be lost.
Thus, it's only reasonable to conclude that exchanges, seeing this, are only accepting Tether if they are compromised and are going to get paid big money when their exchange dies and they 'cash out'. When the exchange dies and the central banks hand over the owners fat sums of cash for their 'service'. That is why any exchange accepting Tether is compromised. They're either ignorant to the threat, or taking a cut when the failure occurs.

With a long enough passphrase, you could write your seed all over your walls and hand out cards to everyone in the world with your seed words. The likelyhood someone brute forces your passphrase (if it is long/good enough) is infeasible in a human lifetime. Bitcoin's SHA256 just makes it more than infeasible to guess a private key. So even though giving out your seed (passphrase protected) to the entire world is about a trillion trillion trillion trillion times more risky than not giving out your seed, it's still secured by the long passphrase you select.
I'd just use a mobile wallet. There's no reason to use another device to be honest. Keep bulk stored in a wallet only you know how to access, and send usable ones to a convenient thing like your phone. Carrying multiple devices kind of ruins the whole idea of security. If you carry around a lockbox, people are going to wonder what is in it, and you attract more attention. Carrying around the money that would have been in that lockbox in your pocket is much safer - no one knows you're keeping a lot of value in your pocket.

Definitely. But unlike today with the no-risk free money-printing central banks, you'd actually take risks in investing with Bitcoin, so it will matter more what you choose to invest in. This means better ideas surface faster, but bad ideas will get squashed really quickly - which is sometimes bad, to be fair, but overall good because good ideas will have time to come to fruition without being destroyed by no ability to compete from the outset.
Investing will be the same as always, just without someone stealing from you forcing you to invest 100% all the time to stay ahead of the game. You could just -save- Bitcoin for a few years to buy something you really want, without having that value eroded away from you.
Anyone with good capital will still be able to invest in projects they like, same as always. Bitcoin's natural valuation in the long run should keep pace with population, so a small growth of like 1% each year at best just for holding Bitcoin. This means any company able to produce 2-5% profit is doing amazing, compared to today where 10% profit on fiat inflationary terms is considered 'pretty good'.
Everything regarding 'passive income' exists it just has a bit more risk and you'll spend more time qualifying your investments and actually have to educate yourself about money in the future versus today how everyone just says, "I have a 401k that's good right?" and calls it a day.

Sorry for the late reply, but any password using a-z, A-Z, 1-0, and !-) symbols (72 different characters) would yield a very rare password that would be hard to brute force. But, since it is somewhat known and possible, it's better to use a simple phrase that is longer, like, "how now brown cow" which is more secure than a 10-digit password especially since it has spaces. Of course, it's pretty common so someone might brute force that, but really, really unlikely.

The part of the equation you leave out is how much easier it would be for that person to save BTC every year to buy their house, since their house's price won't be running away from them like it does in the current fiat system. It will be much easier to save and buy where taking a loan stops being the main way you 'get ahead' in life. You work and save to get ahead instead. This is a good thing.

We definitely do. Things of scarcity go up in value. For example, food. Food becomes worth a lot of paper fiat dollars when there is financial uncertainty. Bitcoin is as simple to understand, as it is simple to understand the central banks print money out of thin air. It's just up to the individual to accept the reality of such a simple thing.

As a reminder, due to proof-of-work, Bitcoin is the superior currency. The only way another crypto gains on Bitcoin is if over time, they secure more hash rate over Bitcoin, while having all the same features of Bitcoin (but maybe one extra thing we don't know we need yet). So if 100 TH/s enters the proof-of-work world, if 51 of those TH/s goes to another coin, then over time it would gain hash rate over Bitcoin and end up being the dominant crypto. This is unlikely to occur for centuries if not longer, and in addition, the ramp up would require a slow growth of hash rate over Bitcoin where eventually this other crypto would overtake dominance. There's no uncertainty; no crypto is making moves on Bitcoin's proof of work, and as such, Bitcoin is the superior currency for the long-foreseeable future.

This is not true. Every currency fluctuates. Check out Venezuela - their currency has done way crazier things than Bitcoin. The only reason you believe the lie that the USD is 'stable' is due to intense manipulation of education and the monetary system where you think there's a stable currency. The reality is the 'stability' comes at the cost of constantly stealing more and less from people all around the world to make you think it's stable while they slowly erode value out of the dollar over time. They've won you over. You think the dollar is stable. Yet ignore the wild swings of Venezuela among many other countries in recent history who have seen their dollar collapse. Keep in mind - all these nations are under the thumb of central banks.


This is because gold could not be divided into 1/100ths and 1/1000ths and so on to actually take into account the rise of value, and this is also because the government didn't care about gold - they were already printing more fiat than gold they held. This has been the case for every single bank ever to exist - they always, always print more certificate paper money than they have 'reserves' of actually currency for. Inflation does not exist in a gold-based economy, but gold fails because you cannot divide it up smaller and smaller as the value rises, among other problems.


Inflation/deflation is a product of inflationary fiat paper money. There is **never** a situation where there is not enough Bitcoins in circulation. We can take 1 Bitcoin, and divide it by 100 million currently and send a satoshi about as easily as sending 10 Bitcoin. There really is no difference between a 1 satoshi transaction and a 10 BTC transaction except fees and what not; if we need smaller than 1 satoshi we just divide it smaller and smaller. There is no limit to this. It is just pure math. What this means is the value of the item can rise indefinitely and still be just as easy to use at any price level. The problem with gold was people would hold it because they could not divide it smaller and smaller. Not because they didn't want to buy things, but because they couldn't reliably use gold after a time, and no one wanted to pay for their groceries by dropping a grain of gold on the counter. Again, there will never, ever, "not be enough Bitcoins in circulation" because a single Bitcoin could handle all the value ever to exist. If one day 99.999% of Bitcoins magically disappeared because every wallet owner died by some random chance, the last 1000 Bitcoin could facilitate all trade for the rest of time just as easily as 21 million can. The number is completely arbitrary. The divisibility of Bitcoin means we can use it no matter what; and the amount is irrelevant. The important part is proof of work and scarcity, that no one can make more of it.
There is no such thing as deflation in a static currency economy. We've never had this option before; it's never been possible to have something finite that no one can print more of or create more of or steal from others and so on. Your idea that an economy would not work with no more fiat printed money pouring in stealing from the people is a taught idea. You were taught this is how it works, but it's completely wrong. The only reason we need to manage inflation/deflation in today's economy is because central banks set up this problem in the first place. In reality, it was gold's lack of divisibility that led to banks doing this. It's gold's fault we've had to deal with fiat for so long. We no longer have to. We now have a choice for something better than both fiat and gold.

Literally anything is comparable. It is to what degree they are comparable that makes such a thought have any value.
You saying two things are not comparable does not make it so. We compare Bitcoin to fiat all the time. I guess if you feel there is something special about an object you can hold in your hand, that somehow the idea of currency requires a physical medium (which is proven is not true), then you might be confused into thinking the BATM doesn't spit out physical objects so it is not comparable, when the root action taking place is simply gaining access to value.

Well since no one knows your passphrase length, it's kind of irrelevant. I don't think there is a limit to your passphrase. So it could be some poem you remember that is long but easy for you to remember, with spaces and everything. There's no possible way it is going to be 'guessed'. Keep in mind, the 10-character thing I listed is just like a common email password, which gets captcha'd after a few tries and you can't guess 10 billion per second. Your email password is quite secure.
Some lyrics of a song that you know you will never forget. Your mom and dad's full names. The names of your children. All as a single passphrase with spaces and everything. Not possible to guess that - no one will know where to start. Most likely if someone found a seed word, they'd just try up to 8 characters to see if they can guess a p style easymode passphrase. But beyond that is pretty infeasible anyone would be able to guess it. It could just be 200 letter a's for example. No brute forcing is going to randomly guess 200 letter a's. Beyond 8 characters it's a guaranteed no-brute-force risk basically.
Of course, advances to decoding and so on might make it easier, so none of this is 100% certain forever, but very safe for as far as we can see ahead with current technology.
As a side note, most passwords in computing don't allow spaces. So the password "pass word" is pretty secure for a passphrase considering most brute forcing does not consider spaces. Of course someone doing Bitcoin seeds alone would try it, the small point is the presence of spaces means you'd likely only be worrying about people specifically focusing on brute forcing crypto-passphrases. Which means they know how futile it is. Which means it's a smaller pool of potential attackers.
Also never write down your passphrase. It should be something you would be able to remember on your deathbed.

I'm not saying it is. I'm saying someone is making the decision on how much money to steal from everyone every year, and trying really hard to make sure the amount stolen every year does not mess with economic growth. You've somewhat said the same thing in the bulk of your reply.
When the Fed adjusts the rate of borrowing, they are either a) incentivizing people to take out more loans by lowering the rate or b) disincentivizing people to take out more loans by raising the rate. Since fractional reserve lending is 'printing money from nothing' the net effect of lowering the rate is causing more cheap fiat money to enter the economy. If the cost of borrowing was -1% - if you got PAID to take out a loan, hyperinflation would occur. In contrast, if the cost of borrowing was 50%, no one would take out a loan. The balance they are seeking out does not eliminate the fact that when a loan is created, it has nothing backing it, and is created as pure inflation to the current money supply. This isn't realized over every loan, but in aggregate the net effect is inflation and the devaluing of currency when rates are lowered.
By lowering rates, the Fed is saying more money should be flowing in the system and more debt as money should be created. That they made the wrong call at the previous interest rates, that it slowed things down too much.
The whole point is that there is manipulation occurring to avoid cycles of deflation and hyperinflation. So "Surely these people will always make the right call and never hyperinflate my money..." is your choice. You are OK with that.

One thing proponents of big government should like; if people must volunteer their money into seeing government programs succeed, the programs that get funded will likely be really efficient and good programs! So if you *really* want to help people, you'll only have those who want to see the program succeed pay into seeing it succeed. You'll have 100% support for your cause from the people paying for those specific things and can achieve much more with that support.

Buy and hold and keep buying more over time and hold for years. It's not a short term thing unless you have tons of money to risk (which is super risky).

The price went up to a point where someone holding a lot of Bitcoin - or many people holding a little Bitcoin each - thought the price is not going any higher, at which point they cashed out. That was their target to get out. This will happen constantly forever. Eventually you will be asking "Why did someone just sell 1 whole BTC!!?" when most trades are 100000 sats at a time or something on average.
In the early days seeing 10,000 BTC swinging around was nothing. "Why did someone pay $33 for Bitcoin when it's only worth $30?!?" and "The price just dropped from $33 down to $27 what the hell!?!?1"
All the same thing. Better to wrap your head around the idea and not the price changing. After all, the price changing is just showing you how poorly the USD/fiat is doing in comparison to Bitcoin. People who sell are mostly making the wrong call.

This is because of governments forcing healthcare on people instead of letting people live with the consequences of their actions - precisely the same mentality you displayed which is why I revolt against it.
"You cannot be responsible for your actions so I will force you to purchase healthcare for your own good!"
Orange juice has the same sugar as a soda by the way.
The best option is to remove the way people are costing you money - by removing the government from being able to take your money in the first place. Then instead of them literally taking money out of your pocket and redirecting your anger towards the "fat fucks" like they do today, you get to look people in the eye and say, "no, I don't think I will pay for your healthcare since you obviously do not care about your health." Then it's on the individual as it should be, and some people who want to do more can, and those who do not will not be forced into the arrangement.
Your issue is not with the fat people or the amount of sugar in a drink or the kinds of food people eat. Your issue is with the government forcing you to pay for other peoples' bad decisions, and I'm with you 100% on that, I just put the angst where it belongs - on the source of the problem. Bitcoin removes the government from being able to take your money in the first place. Bitcoin is the solution.
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:55:53
No I'm saying you are paying the tax for the US to attack, whether you like it or not. Your labor is being taxed through your central bank's inflation, created by the US central bankers. You are already a vassal-state of the USA. All your stolen labor through inflation is used to power the war machine needed to make sure no one disrupts this system.
So when you want 'free healthcare' all you're doing is giving more power to the central banks by asking them to steal from you more using inflation (taxation is completely irrelevant, it's just to confuse you and blind you to reality, give you something to think about). They simply print more money to cover the 'cost' of your healthcare. This means you're paying for your healthcare your entire life by the erosion of your currency's value. This means you steal from everyone else and every future person ever to exist in your nation when you get 'free healthcare service'. But because YOU don't have to pay for it, you feel good, even though you're a dirty disgusting thief. You just don't understand how it works, so your ignorance allows you to feel good about yourself when instead you literally stole a small amount of value from everyone around you.
The main point is Bitcoin eliminates all this and achieves what you want. You want nations to serve citizens, and I agree. In doing so they will have to give up the stealing of labor. This means giving up all 'free' services too. Because instead of offering 'free healthcare' with Bitcoin, they'd literally have to require people to send in payments to cover healthcare costs, because they couldn't steal the labor over a long period of time using inflation to fool everyone into ignoring the fact that they're paying for the healthcare their entire life.
Every time the central bank prints money, they keep some for themselves. This means it's costing you more over your entire life to receive your 'free healthcare' that you think is so good. Because it's not only costing you the price, but also the inflation value, plus the fee the central bank takes every time they print money for you.
This is why not understanding economics or Bitcoin is really bad - and why no one is taught about money in school. Otherwise you'd understand why 'free healthcare' is similar to attaching a leech to your body to cure a disease - it doesn't work. The leech of 'free healthcare' is sucking innovation and motivation from your labor force.
Why don't you get free food? Surely, getting free food would be less expensive and is more important than just free healthcare, right? So why healthcare? Think about it. Heck, why not free food too in addition to free healthcare? Why does your government hate you so much and spend money on military when it could just give you free food too?
The reason that doesn't work is because the people understand the value of food much more than healthcare and they cannot be lied to regarding 'free food' as much as 'free healthcare'.
Again, all that matters is you know about Bitcoin and hopefully you have some and plan to get more of it. That's the only solution to both your perceived problem and the real problems in the world.

I agree, but history shows fiat money always fails, because someone along the line will game the system if it can be done. Just like the bank bailout that occurred in your lifetime. The government/fed/whomever you want to call it, they decided to steal a lot from the current and future labor force at the time, to offset the impact of a failing bank which took too many liberties. They decided to steal your money from you as you are today in time, to pay for the bail out that occurred then in the now-past.
We didn't have an option. We do now. That's all. We have a sure thing now, where before we had to trust that hopefully they won't print too much money. Keep in mind, there's never a problem with not printing any money for the rest of time. The only variable that forces inflation/deflation, boom and bust, is the presence of inferior money. Bitcoin and crypto solves those problems. You cannot print more, so you can have no boom, and it can be divisible to any fraction, so you can have no bust.

Lightning is the digital representation of a cash transaction. I wrote a bit about it a while ago, but basically it's just like a cash transaction.
Let's say you meet with someone to buy their grill off Craigslist for $40. You show up and inspect the product; the seller doesn't know if you actually have cash on you. Then you decide to buy and pull out your cash. At this moment both you and the seller know how much money is on the table. He knows you have $40, you know you have $40. A channel has been opened.
When you hand over the $40 and take the grill, the channel is still open. At this point, you no longer have the cash, but you still know this other person has $40. The channel is still open. Even when you load up the grill and drive away, you still know this person has $40. You know where they live and that they have at least $40. The channel is still open even if you leave the area.
The seller then goes out and deposits the $40 cash into their bank - the channel is closed. Except you don't know that. You still think he has at least $40 and you might even think about going back and stealing your $40 back. But it's been deposited to a bank (or spent), so in reality the other person does not have the money and the channel is closed except you don't know about it yet, because it's cash.
Lightning is different in that when the seller closes the channel and writes the funds to the blockchain, you get notified that the seller no longer has open access to those Bitcoin. When it is written to the ledger, the funds are completely incapable of you 'stealing' them back. In this way it is better than cash. You are notified when the other party closes the channel and there's no ambiguity whether any party has the funds on them or not.
Bitcoin is like having digital gold in a vault and Lightning is like taking out some digital gold and putting it in your pocket as spending money and walking around town. Like Bitcoin is digital gold or digital cash, Lightning is the representation of a digital cash transaction.

I think you're doing it right. When young you can take the risk, and Bitcoin is an idea that is not going to just go away. It's a human technology unlock-achievement. It as an idea is here to stay. Lots of people will avoid risk, but when young, you have no reason not to take risk, you can always recover. I've made it a point to be the 'unreasonable' voice (which is also the most profitable one) in telling people to go all in. It is the correct thing to do, but not everyone has the risk tolerance to do so - that is, not everyone realizes the risk is in holding fiat money, not holding Bitcoin. This fact eludes so many people. They see Venezuela's currency fail and think "surely my government won't do this here" when with Bitcoin you don't have to "hope" no one prints more Bitcoin, you are guaranteed it cannot happen. I'll take the sure thing any day over "surely my government will not hyperinflate my money" literally two days after the Fed just reduces interest rates.

Bitcoin is just the current leading name for the idea. It's not actually Bitcoin - the idea is the value. So if for example some currency comes along that is a better store of value (meaning, it has all the same features of Bitcoin but adds some other unknown feature that is not yet worthwhile, for example, the ability to keep a perfect ledger through time travel), if something comes along that is a better store of value, there will be an easy transition from the idea called Bitcoin to the other idea, which will be based on Bitcoin.
Proof of work is the factor in this. The leading system will have proof of work, and the most proof of work. So the moment anything has 25% of Bitcoin's hashrate, you're pretty certain this thing is going to take off and should begin moving funds over to this new idea.
If you can find out this new idea, you'd be rich - because you could invent a Bitcoin+ that has all the same features but some other super important base feature (not like larger block size, I'm talking about a feature of currency) and over time it would take hash rate from Bitcoin and eventually overtake it.
But keep in mind, people are slow, and this future 'better idea' does not exist for a few hundred years or more. The big power of Bitcoin's hash rate is why we know Bitcoin will be the one that's adopted, because it already is. Since any new competing idea would have to be able to achieve the same amount of hash rate - again, keep in mind proof of work is required to make a cryptocurrency work, it might not even be called hash rate, but computer cycles none the less - the ramp up to that means any 'better idea' would likely take as long to adopt as paper fiat money over gold (as in, potentially thousands of years).
So it's not about 'one specific coin' and if you think altcoins have any value for any reason you're likely being misled by false information (for example, lots of people seem to think Monero is good because 'muh privacy' not considering that privacy is how central banks operate - it's not a feature of currency we actually want, we want all transactions to be 100% solid and be possible to confirm without a doubt that you did indeed make that transaction). The idea is labeled Bitcoin, that's all.

Maybe they sell fake gold which is why they don't want you to open it and touch it - then you'd notice the smell and know it's not real.

Well, imagine "8675309" but you add "Matilda" as the name? I don't do songs but that one is catchy. Still you'd then have to compile a list of every song ever made to then brute force lyrics and then you'd have to hope you got all the spaces and symbols correct in the lyrics and so on...
It's just impossible. Harder to compile that list of characters than to just set and forget a computer which randomly guesses.


Definitely. So you know, something like &lt;firstnamemiddlenamelastnameFIRSTNAMEMIDDLENAMELASTNAME&gt; is probably something you're not going to forget. There's something most people will always remember - some stupid song when they don't even like music, to a childhood memory, to their own name. It doesn't even have to be complex - it could be your full name and then you do something to it, like alternate caps or write it backwards. You could even tell someone you trust "Hey if I ever forget my passphrase just let me know it's my name and I did something to it." Then if you truly did forget or let's say you died and no one knew your phrase they'd have some chance at brute forcing it over time to recover it.
Bitcoin is awesome in that it is for the most part, practically, infinitely secure (as far as we know to date). As such it's maybe too much security in a way. Devising a system of recovery is always less secure than just leaving Bitcoin in a wallet and remembering the private keys. Even then, you remember the keys, so one person knows how to access that address when before, no one could access that address, so your presence actually makes that address less secure, in a weird way.
Everything you add to recover Bitcoin addresses makes it less secure, but we can do that because it's still so secure it's infeasible to guess. Like seed words - much less secure than Bitcoin itself, but still more secure than would be worth even trying to guess in a million lifetimes. So we have room where we can reduce security for our more practical needs as humans, and you don't have to be a complete edgelord when it comes to security. Designing a way to remember and recover your Bitcoin through a lifetime of potential forgetfulness, memory issues, diseases which affect the mind, accidental injury to the brain and so on is pretty important. Bitcoin allows you to be as secure as you want or as least secure as you want, which is good. Walking the line of where you are comfortable, security wise, is important to counter potential losses due to just forgetting.
This probably only matters for hodling anyway... if you buy and use Bitcoin or in the future when people transact in Bitcoin regularly, backups will be very easy and the presence of so many wallets means you're not likely to store a lot in any one wallet and you're not likely to worry about having backup lying around. Getting a new wallet would be more or less like getting a new mobile phone; different for a little while but overall it's basically the same thing, you just update everyone your new number.
Bitcoin just gives us all the option to be our own bank where before we were at the mercy of governments and banks.

You have an emergency leak of oxygen in your main oxygen storage facility. Your 2 year supply was cut down to 1 year supply. Oh. Shit. You radio back to Earth, you need 2 years supply of oxygen delivered ASAP! It's going to take 8 months to get it, and you need it priority. How then is anyone back home going to get paid for doing this for you? Gold? Nope. Cash? Nope. Barter? 8 months to send anything you have back to Earth. Rocket fuel? They're on Earth they don't need it. Oxygen? Same thing, useless to Earth.
They will accept a currency that is trusted and valued that you can securely send digitally nearly instantly.
Yes a space faring civilization will need a digital currency that is strong and trusted and will not be prone to the whims of a government. If it takes 8 months to get gold back to Earth to pay for your emergency, the world could be massively different by then and the local people might not want gold or might not accept that amount of gold anymore because it's not worth as much anymore. A speed-of-light transaction is the best anyone can hope for and ~1 hour turn around for payment is reasonable considering current wire transfers today can take days.
If any remote location needs their own currency they just fork off their own fork of Bitcoin.
Not sure your Earth/Venus comparison. The only way the Earth people reap the labor of Venus workers is if the Venus workers accept cash for payment somehow instead of Bitcoin. If dealing in a finite crypto, their labor will always be worth what its worth.

The great time to buy Bitcoin is the time you do buy Bitcoin. There was no time before that time where you did do it. It's the best time of your life the moment you actually do.
Some new 16 year old kids are just now learning about Bitcoin - this is the best time in their life they will be able to buy Bitcoin. In 10 years when they are 26 they will regret not doing it. So the moment you hear about Bitcoin is the best time to buy because you never had the option before that because you had no idea about it.
The waiting and procrastinating is the worst thing you can do. You don't even need much to profit in the long term. Shoot for 0.1 BTC and you're 1 out of 210 million people in a world of almost 8 billion.

A 10 character password of upper and lowercase letters, numbers 0-9 and 10 different symbols (72 possible characters) ends up being a 1 in 3743906242624487424 chance to guess a password. Some efficiency can be had if you think the person is using actual words somewhere, so cut that number in half just for fun to 1871953121312243712. At 10 billion guesses per second (faster than modern computing), it would take 187195312 seconds to go through them all, or ~6 years of constant guessing. A supercomputer might be able to guess it in a shorter timeframe...
So just ... use more than 10 characters ;)
To guess a Bitcoin address takes longer than multiple ages of the universe to guess, in comparison. So a passphrase is much less secure, but still really secure and built on top of the Bitcoin difficulty anyway.

Point of an ATM is to get the ability to transfer value to someone else who does not otherwise have a payment channel open with you.

I say forever because at one point you will know when it's time to use that 0.1, but don't have that mindset of 'selling it'. Keep it forever.

This provokes some thought. Even if you lost your keys to Bitcoin, the knowledge of such and the fact you did own those Bitcoin actually has some value. You could sell provably-lost Bitcoin to a buyer who might hold on to them in their family's legacy in the long-long-long term chance it can ever be recovered. It's not going to be worth much, but would be worth something. This reminds me of that Mt.Gox settlement of someone paying $900 per Bitcoin claim. In 100 years if those Bitcoin can ever be recovered, the investment was well worth it, and if not... wait longer! You still own those coins in the sense of being one of the few to know they are actually lost and in some rare case they become available through whatever means you'd have a claim to them. Anyway weird stuff.

The only problem with a fixed supply currency is a) we've never, ever, ever had one before and b) you need to be able to divide the currency up into smaller and smaller units over time as value rises forever.
The lack of divisibility is why gold failed. You couldn't pay for your groceries with a flake of gold off your gold nugget. But we can pay for our groceries with an exact number of satoshis no matter how small a number we reach.
Since Bitcoin is math, we solve the division issue because there are, effectively, unlimited decimals in the system, so it can handle all valuation with no problem no matter how much it grows. It means if you have 1 BTC today, it will be worth quite a lot in the future.

There's no best approach, just what you're comfortable with. Since Bitcoin is practically infinitely secure, any methods of recovery drastically reduce the security. So finding the balance between security and recovery is based on everyone's unique tolerance for risk and perceived threat. It doesn't have to be too complex, but every time you write it down you introduce risk.
I think a good method would be involving government in the method to recovering your full keys. I know it sounds weird but, for example, if you die and the executor of your will can use your death certificate and your will to gain access to some digital account(s) which have your seed and passphrase, then you're eliminating most anyone else from getting into your digital accounts (like gmail or something like that) to get your keys. Of course you then leave those keys on a computer system but having corporations preserve your data isn't that bad if you secure it correctly.
A will that states your seed is &lt;24 words&gt; and the public address is &lt;address&gt; and your passphrase is split into two parts - one part in your gmail/google drive and the other in your wife's email/google drive - which are files called 'part1.zip' and 'part2.zip' where each file is encrypted with the password &lt;password&gt;.
You're pretty secure. Goal is to be creative but not so secure everything is so complex it becomes lost. In the case above, if you and your wife die in a car/plane accident, the person holding the will can obtain legal (government ok'd) means to access your accounts to recover the parts of the passphrase and recover the funds.
If someone gets your will, they'd know your zip-file-encryption password, so you'd want to update and change this information every now and then especially if you think the will became compromised/viewed by someone untrustworthy.
There's 100's of other ways to do things and more, just get creative.

In 1913 the USA adopted a central banking system. Since then, a central bank branch of that was installed in almost every other nation on Earth. The same people who control US monetary policy also control every other nation's central bank, and their monetary policy. In addition with a global economy, if you can get money cheaper in the USA than in your own country, you will do so, so every bank is 'adjusted' when the US makes a change like this. If rates go up, every country knows it can earn more by matching US interest rates, and if rates go down, every country knows no one will borrow their money if they don't match the new lower rate.
We may have different nations that we are patriotic towards, but the controlling entity of every nation is the same central banking system.

This is incorrect. Anyone who is smart enough to know the implications of a lowering interest rate knows their future money is worth less. So the best option is to borrow money today with the new lower rate and use it before that money is devalued through inflation in the future. Remember, the first people to use inflationary money are the ones using the money at its strongest buying power.
So people are forced, because if you're planning to start a business and you need $500k to start it, if you don't take the loan out today for that business, you probably won't be able to start your business for $500k in the future when the money is devalued.
You're right, it technically is persuasion not force, but the net effect is the same. If they set the interest rate to -1% and paid everyone to take out a loan, you could still say, "They're not forcing anyone to take out infinite loans and hyperinflate the economy," and you'd be technically correct, but the actual effect would be everyone taking out infinite loans and hyperinflating the economy - and the ones who took out the loan the earliest and spent it would be the ones who profited from the resulting destruction of the economy.

A normal Bitcoin private key is 51 characters of (basically) random characters. A wallet file which contains this data is a small ~1MB file. This is hard to write down and keep track of, and files are risky. It's not really human readable, and doesn't make much sense to normal people.
So seed words were invented as a way of dividing up your private key into actual words, where if you recombine those sequence of words, you have your private key. Most wallets use 24 words out of 2048 possible words - trust me, the math makes it infeasible that anyone could guess your specific 24 words in multiple human lifetimes.
But, someone -could- randomly guess your words, right? Just out of blind luck and chance, since all 2048 words are known. So a passphrase was added on top, letting you be absolutely certain that even if someone guessed all 2048 words, it wouldn't point to your private key unless they also had the passphrase.
This allows you to have 24 words which you can secure, which are easy to write down and keep track of 'only' 24 words versus a private key or a wallet file which can be copied/stolen, and the passphrase which should be something easy to remember and more difficult than your email password and never used for anything else.
This way your funds exist in the combination of your seed words + passphrase. It's easy to work with on human terms and even if someone knows your seed words (like they somehow found out what your words were) they still don't have your passphrase, which if it is 10 characters or longer would take a very long time (longer than human life) to brute force. And if you ever feel your seed words were compromised, you just create another private key, with another passphrase (or the same one) and get 24 new words and move your funds to that new address and you're safe again, very easily.
If you did not have a passphrase, you're still safe - guessing 24 of 2048 words is impossible (do the math, it's impossible just trust me). You just need those seed words to recover your private key and thus your Bitcoin, and you can restore it on most wallets.

All anyone has to do is make a competing product. That's all. The market takes care of the rest in deciding if you made a good product or not. The great thing is lots of unwitting people back even the worst of projects (like most altcoins).
Competition is good, however your claims regarding this exchange makes me think it's intentions are not to engage customers in legitimate actions. Coinbase is not slow - you're just using an exchange wrong if you think it's supposed to be instant. Coinbase is reliable - the speed of light is a pain for anyone offering digital service. If you have not been able to access your account during 'highly volatile times' you're doing it wrong and should look to use a trading app instead of wondering why you cannot log into their website where 99% of everyone who doesn't know what they are doing is trying to log on DDOSing the web authentication servers.

Everything is good for Bitcoin. It is only your time preference that changes.
Think of it like the internet... "What will happen to the internet when someone cuts an underwater fiber cable between two continents?" Did that ever... destroy the internet? No, it made people get better at making these cables and protecting them. The internet has been 'cut' before, more than once. Each time we get better at mending the connections. So even though Bitcoin could face huge adversity in the future, it will always be good for Bitcoin, because the idea is what matters. The technology is a human-achievement-unlocking, which means we have access to this idea for the rest of history. It will never go away, even though the name could change in the long, long, long term future.
Now then, back to election stuff; I would say the 2020 election will be good for Bitcoin (in the near term) as uncertainty has a big effect on markets. So nearing the election we'd expect somewhat stagnant movement and then afterwards, "Ok everything is relatively stable for the next 4 years," and price goes up.

You got a poor reply from McBeeff there about how the "Fed can't print money" - this is only technically true. It's like saying "The US government does not bomb people," which is technically true. The US military bombs people. The banks, through issuing loans, prints money. The net result is the same, and in conversation it is the Fed who decides the interest rates, just like the US government decides who to bomb. As such, the Fed is the decision maker and they know they are inflating the money supply when they lower rates, just like the US government knows they are killing people when they order the military to bomb someone.
When the Fed lowers interest rates, it causes loans to be cheaper. This means it's easier to take out a loan. Since loans and money is made from thin air, this inflates the money supply as more loan money pours into the economy. In doing so, this steals some value from everyone else by means of inflation. It feels small and you don't notice it year to year, but the theft still occurs, as evidenced by the buying power of the dollar over history.
The people who do well are the people who take out loans at the new rate - they got cheap money, and lots of it, today. So 'smart people' will take out loans and build a business or go back to school. The money is more powerful today than it will be in the future, meaning it has more buying power today before the inflation actually drives noticeable prices up in a few years. Anything you wanted to do with money this year, is going to be harder in the coming years, because it will cost more to do.
Most people have no idea this is happening, they just keep struggling to get by within their means, and they 'save money' which is almost the worst thing you can do.
There are lots of people who can not purchase a house at the previous interest rates, who now can purchase a house with the new interest rates. This means millions of people will finally be able to get that loan for the house they always wanted. This debt-as-money pours into the market as all of a sudden, more people seem to have more money to spend out of nowhere. Since everyone now has more money for some reason, people are willing to pay more for goods and services, because it was so easy to get that extra dollar, they're willing to spend it easier. This drives up prices over time, eventually to the point where the people stop spending their money so easily, at which point another monetary policy rate drop occurs. The timeframes here are long term and not many people notice the bigger picture, they can just live their life.

Ah an ACH transfer. Yeah sounds weird if they just accepted it. As someone mentioned, you might not be able to transfer out until they clear all funds. But if you can send BTC out, try it. If it works, you're a madman, and hodl! Pay the bank/Coinbase with fiat over time, with the increase in your BTC amount ;)

Yes world events play a part. For example, I think the reason Bitcoin is going up more now is people realizing inflation is hitting harder, and the Fed hinted at lowering interest rates in July or something. It's more market forces than anything else. It's less hype right now than ever. It's just solid hedging against inflation.
If the Fed lowers interest rates, money becomes easier to get, so there's more loans, and more money into the world, meaning inflation goes up, and Bitcoin price goes up.
The way the Fed works, any time someone takes out a loan, there is inflation. So, are college kids taking out $300k loans for college? Yup. Are people buying 1000sqft houses in California for $1,000,000 and taking loans out for it? YUP!
Smart people will catch on and try to find a good investment to hedge against all that, and Bitcoin is the best way to do it.

You (the other person I notice now but also you) injected this notion into the original comment. The original comment assumes an able bodied person who could accomplish goals - meaning there is no qualifier placed on the person in his comment except "mature adult" - you adding in qualifiers like disabled or down on their luck was not in the equation. You added that and came to your own biased conclusion. The default position of "mature adult" is not (someone who has lots of hardships and deserves empathy). You added that.


Which is also known as failure. Because anyone can mow lawns in their neighborhood for $20 per lawn per week and mow 10 lawns per day and make much more than minimum wage at a fast food restaurant. Meaning, if you choose to be lazy and have no drive for accomplishment, you fail. That is not a empathy situation, it's a factual real situation. People can fail, people can make poor decisions, people can be lazy and so on. Pointing that out is not snobbish. It's more respectful of the other person, to tell them they can do better than this, than to take your position and say, "This person is helpless and can achieve no better goal."
You take up the 'snobbish' position in the argument by claiming a person's maximum life effort is acceptably used in the kitchen of a fast food restaurant.

Proof of work is the one key feature of cryptocurrency that makes it work. For example, in a fiat system there is no proof of work. They can just print unlimited money (and by print, I mean enter a number in on a computer and it's done instantly, boom someone has $1 million).
So, if a bank wants, they can just go in and change an account that has $10 million in it, and make it only show $1 million, with no actual work and really nothing stopping this from happening. Or, they can just freeze the account; making the account worth $0. Likewise, they can increase their own funds by any amount with no one stopping this from happening - this is after all what they do literally every single day when they print money by making a loan. They just put some number into an account. Nothing more.
Proof of work is the reason cryptocurrency works because it ensures no one can go back and change the history of transactions. No one can go back and change an account that has 10 BTC in it to now only show 1 BTC. And no one can change their own account from having 1 BTC and now having 10 BTC. If they had 100% of the hash rate, they could - they could go back and change everything. For example, if you download and run the open-source Bitcoin software, you can make your own blockchain, and have 100% control over all transactions on your own blockchain.
Proof of work ensures no one can go back and change anyone else's accounts, and then it becomes clear that proof of work is represented by hash rate. The more hash rate, the more difficult it is for someone to change a past account. With low hash rate, like BCH, or no hash rate, like Tether, it means those are vulnerable to being overtaken by even a small fraction of hashrate from Bitcoin. A handful of Bitcoin miners could, for example, decide to pool together and conquer BCH and literally own BCH completely.
With low hash rate, it means someone can come along and, basically, print their own money, because they can control more than half the hash rate. For no hash rate, it means whomever is in control of the core software can print unlimited funds like a bank - they can change any account they want really. They can just add more funds to their own accounts, and now they can sell it, with almost no impact to overall pricing.
Proof of work is the key. Bitcoin's hash rate is literally the limit of human technology at this moment. We, as humans, have a current limit as to how much resources we can combine from the Earth to make computer processors, and as much of that market that can be secured to make more mining machines is being obtained as fast as humanly possible, because doing so is so valuable. This doesn't even involve Bitcoin, it's a factor of all cryptocurrency - if you can mine the most of it, you get paid the most, so there's a constant push to obtain more and more as fast as humanly possible.
Since Bitcoin is securing most of the hash rate from all this new human-limited push for more processing power, it is proving itself more and more every day as being the only cryptocurrency worth anything. Because remember, at any time, someone can make enough money with BTC to then buy enough processing power to completely overtake any inferior cryptocurrency and suck it dry just for the hell of it - this cannot be done with Bitcoin.
So, if a crypto a) does not have proof of work or b) has less hash rate than another cryptocurrency and c) is not gaining hash rate over time in relation to the current hash rate leader, it is the inferior currency. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin either. If a better crypto was invented, it would begin to secure more hash rate over time compared to Bitcoin - meaning, for every 100 TH/s that enters the market, 51 TH/s or more starts being put to use on this new crypto instead of Bitcoin. If that happens and you saw any crypto make moves (long term) against Bitcoin you'd then consider the other crypto. But as it stands, all the other cryptos are securing less and less of the total market share of hash rate over time than Bitcoin. As such, logically and mathematically, Bitcoin is the superior currency.
It is worth pointing out that every single Bitcoin account already exists from day 1 of the Genesis Block. There are no 'new accounts' in Bitcoin. Every address exists in the math, and your keys only reveal the specific location of that account. When you generate a new wallet/private key, you only point to an account that already existed. This just means no one can ever change an account by making a new account or something; all accounts already exist. This is in contrast to a bank, who might have 300 million accounts (1 through 300 million) and they can just slap a new account number and add funds to it whenever they want, fully manipulating anything they want. You cannot, for example, 'go back', even with 51% of the hash rate, and change an account that has zero Bitcoin in it to now have 1 Bitcoin in it without a transaction. Doing so would require re-doing all the proof of work since the beginning of the blockchain, where every single account had 0 Bitcoin.

No, they deal on the same layer of confirming transactions. If you go to any bank and transfer $100,000 to cash in your pocket, they might be able to facilitate that transaction, but also that means they will have to move cash around from other locations to restock their vault.
Most is done digitally, so they don't have to move it around, but they still have the settlement layer to confirm transactions. If you work inside the bank's network, for example transferring $100 to your friend who also has the same bank's accounting, then yeah, it can be quick, because you're trusting the bank with your money... the banks would love if you accepted one world bank.


No, Bitcoin is faster, again, there is always the settlement layer. Banks generally hide this settlement layer from you and just approve every transaction but the underlying settlement layer is still there. To you, the customer, it might seem quick, but the back end is not. Such layers can be put onto Bitcoin by third parties (many apps do already) and you're just trusting those third parties just like you trust a bank.


See payment processors and the very high unlikely event that people go around spending $10 at a convenience store in BTC and double-spend that. Same thing happens with credit cards, people double-spending. Checks too. There's no reason a payment processor can't take that risk for the business and still charge an much smaller fee.


... no. It's a convenience fee instead of paying cash which is zero fee to either party with no other safety required.


Maybe the credit card is backed with BTC. Maybe you will understand what currency means in the long run.


You can absolutely use Bitcoin as a settlement layer and do transactions on top of it. You can agree with your friends that you will exchange a pre-made currency token between yourselves but once per month you all settle up in Bitcoin. No issue. I personally think Bitcoin will achieve the convenience you are thinking about with today's modern system of smoke and mirrors, but done without the need for a payment processor layer. Just time for that technology to develop is all.

Bitcoin allows you to transact in a fixed supply system, so everyone should strive to only transact in Bitcoin, because no one can lie to you about anyone else's transaction. No one can over print, no one can say they sent you something they didn't, and no one can get a 'refund' on a transaction unless both parties are willing. It's such a good system.

We're somewhat limited to what already exists on a standard keyboard though. Programming languages and so on, most all are fixed on the standard US keyboard layout, and that's unlikely to change because it suits all needs. Changing from a $ to some other symbol is extra work for no useful reason. I feel Bitcoin will eventually become represented as $atoshis using the $. It would be easier if we think of the $ as being the symbol for the international reserve currency or petro-dollar instead of the USD. In other words, what currency enables economies to work should always have the $ even if the underlying currency is something other than USD. That's my opinion based only on the reality that so much is ingrained into technology already where $ is dominant as a symbol and serves the purpose of indicating currency.
And when you think about it, why is USD an S with a line through it? There's no real reason 
So it's more a product of strange coincidence (which doesn't exist) than anything else.

Eventually all miners cost more to run than they're worth. If your goal is to run a mining operation for profit, you need to invest in more hardware over time to keep ahead of difficulty and phase out your older hardware that isn't worth the cost to run. Otherwise you just get your bang for your initial mining purchase and then you get pushed out of the ability to continue mining due to the difficulty increases.
This can be seen as a function of profits to new hardware/hashrate cost in anticipation of difficulty increases. Not sure how that doesn't work.

It's not about privacy or blacklisting, it's about novelty and scarcity. It's not about a pool either.
Imagine a bitcoin address that contains 13.6 Bitcoins all generated from a single block mined today that was valued 40 years from now. It would be worth a premium to have that novelty of no previous transactions for the 12.5 block reward. That's all I'm saying. There will be a market for it much like there is a market for weird shapes of gold and precious metals and weird stones (diamonds) that are cut into odd shapes. 14k gold is worth less than 24k gold, for example. The more pure the more value. People buy anything.

Almost all government action is a positive for Bitcoin. For society and the world... not so much.
So, if "free college" happens, then basically the government prints a lot of money for each kid who goes to college. From there, inflation goes up. Now, they could just raise interest rates on loans and balance the inflation by instead handing out 'free college' but the net result would be the same.

Why are Canadian dollars valued less, and why are the Euro and Pound valued higher than the USD?
Will something of value ever drop to zero? You can still buy stock in the company that owns MySpace.
I think you should ask yourself if all the features of Bitcoin as a currency have no value or not. The ability to send cash worldwide without dealing with exchange rates, fees or governments trying to stop you should tell you there is already value built into the idea.
You can send $10,000 in value to someone in China and the Chinese government cannot prevent you from doing it. No one can stop you or interfere with that transaction and no middle-man is needed to do such a thing. Is that kind of feature something you think there will be less of in the future or more of?

It does, because if Binance allows people to buy BTC with Tether, Tether can 'mint' unlimited funds and buy as much BTC as possible. The exchange is there saying, "I trust Tether is worth something enough to secure this trade on your behalf, customer."
So in driving up the price, more and more people would be holding Tether in return for their BTC. After all, if Tether to BTC is trading at 20k Tether to BTC, when fiat to BTC is only trading at $10k, and everyone believes you can trade Tether to USD, then people will only sell BTC for Tether for that run up. More and more people will exchange their BTC for Tether, thinking they can some how convert it to USD later.
Then, when Tether has secured enough BTC where they think they have the ability to cripple the market, they just mint and buy up as much possible BTC as they can before people figure it out and the market crashes. At that moment, they just shut down - willingly or due to government intervention 'freezing their accounts' - and they cannot pay out anyone wanting to exchange Tether into fiat USD.
Since this crash is occurring, exchanges will all be held responsible for accepting Tether. Every exchange that accepts Tether will be blamed for all the people holding Tether bags worth literally nothing, and they'll all be out of their BTC too.
The crash will affect every exchange as price plummets and people sell whatever they can, and because if one exchange can be compromised, they all can, trust in all exchanges will hit rock bottom and the Bitcoin market will be crippled for some time.
Tether is not a crypto. Tether IS fiat. Tether is fiat not linked to a government or nation's money supply that needs to be kept in balance with inflation and so on. Tether is a fiat that can be used to fail on purpose and wipe out the holdings of millions of crypto users.
There is no stopping this; the only thing you can do is protect yourself from this, and when you see Tether-&gt;BTC is trading higher than USD-&gt;BTC you should get ready to sell BTC-&gt;USD before the crash, or, dig in and hodl for another 10 years until the Bitcoin community learns its lesson and stops accepting 'stablecoins'.

Access to the labor, raw resources, infrastructure to scale production, and public will to complete such a measure. Keep in mind, China spent a long long time building their recent massive hydroelectric dam. Why didn't they just make a solar plant to power the world? Because the cost was exponentially more than rerouting one of the biggest rivers in the entire world to build a dam.
Every bit of raw resource dug from the Earth is sold today. There's not really a sitting stockpile of materials just hoping someone will buy it. Everything is being put to use. The move to secure all the technology, resources and manufacturing to accomplish projects the size we're talking about would bankrupt any nation unless the people worked for free to do it - and even then, the unnatural decision to turn an entire nation into a power-plant is likely doomed by people who do not want to participate.

It's not too late. I don't know if there are guides... I've posted a LOT recently about how I would recommend getting in. Maybe I need to write a guide.
It's not too late. You should first understand the technology and really see if you think it is a good idea and if it has any value to humanity. Just like in the early days of Amazon, when Amazon stock was worth $5, people had to ask, "Is this thing going to go anywhere?" The people who held Amazon stock from $5 profited immensely. But it was always a risk.
I posted a lot about it so read some of my previous post history (the longer posts). Basically I encourage new people to learn how it all works first. Download Bitcoin Core software, run their own node, create and secure their own wallet on their computers (and off their computers) and then buy what they can afford to lose. Then you're invested in the network and know how it works.
Most people who understand the long term benefits of the technology value Bitcoin very, very high. 100k, 200k, 1 million, 10 million, take your pick. It's no different than when Amazon was at $30/share and people saying, "Amazon could go to $60, $100, $1000!" Who was right? Time reveals the answer. Google Amazon's price today.
My advice is if you are young, go all in, devote a large portion of your time  to learning the technology and then, when you think it is a good idea, put as much into it as you can stand. And then wait. It's not going to happen overnight. Just wait. Put enough in where you don't mind if in 3-5 years it goes nowhere. And wait wait wait, continuing to exchange your fiat money for BTC at a rate you are comfortable with over time. And wait.
Most of us know long term it is well worth it. If you need more info read my post history or ask more questions. Everyone will give you different advice - mine is simple: use the actual software, run the thing, create your own crypto-wallet, see if it makes sense, and then go in as hard as you can.

But your transaction will still go through.
I've only sent zero-fee transactions myself, not minding the delay, because I like to test the network and make sure zero-fee is still possible. I don't use recommended fees because I'm not in a rush. I've never had a transaction not occur, although it's been a short while since I last sent anything, and the delay was not too long.
Right now there's upwards of 1 BTC worth of fees on top of every block. It's amazing and great to see. The kind of transactions I am discussing are cross-planetary ones where you wouldn't mind a delay and would not mind whatever fee because all that matters is that the transaction gets through. As long as that happens - and I don't know of a case where a delay would void a transaction if there was a fee attached - everything operates normally. It's just delayed. You're on Mars. You're used to it.
I understand the concern in fees when you're dealing in smaller transactions however I think those will be handled by more local layers. There's no reason a Bitcoin Mars can't split off the main fork and integrate just fine on exchanges on both planets, where it's better to be on Mars than Earth for trading in BTCM and better to be on Earth for trading in BTC due to those delays, but in the end it is perfectly fine to transact on both if you really wanted to no matter your location.

I post a lot of long responses to these kinds of things, check my post history for some inspiration hopefully. The best time is when you learn about it.
You grew up using dollars, right? You got money, spent money, bought things. You had no idea what money really was. Then you got older and said, "Hey, this is weird, I want MORE of this money. I will actually use my labor to obtain more of this money! I will show up every single day to a job to get more of this money."

I see your problem; you want them involved and you want them to be taken care of too, so you try to show them how well you are doing and try to get them on board. Most people do not take this level of someone caring about them easily, and as such they think it is a scam. Your actions of being helpful come across as being a scam - not because of you or anything like that, but because normally, humans don't selflessly help another person.
Your best bet is to try to educate them by asking questions, like, "Hey do you guys know where money comes from?" And "What does it mean the Fed lowered interest rates?" Questions will sit with them. You have to find questions that erode their idea of what money is and approach it as if you are planting the seeds of doubt in their mind regarding what money actually is. These seeds of doubt are actually truths but you have to present them in ways where they answer the question, not you.
Your intentions are good, your approach needs more tact! Good luck.

This is good as I explain here:
It's like any other thing that has ever traded. When a 'whale' 'wipes out an order book' what they've done is spread adoption to a wider audience and took a profit. The net value of Bitcoin goes up with this move, and the whale actually loses out over time.
You are right, the transactions get smaller and smaller and the price rises and rises. In a few years people will be talking in satoshi values instead of 1 and 2 BTC like they are now. Keep in mind, someone paid 10,000 BTC for a pizza - they had to go to an exchange and drop ~$10 for 10,000 BTC.
Over time the market value of BTC becomes realized and trades happen on smaller fractions of BTC, but the total amount held by any person could be 10, 100, 1000, and at any time they can 'dump' into the market. This just spreads out holdings to everyone else, and yes the price goes down being volatile, but eventually this adds value because more people are now invested into the currency. Rinse and repeat this and over time, overall volatility grows less and less as people own less and less total satoshi and eventually people just trade on the raw labor value of the currency.
Likewise, the people who sold Bitcoin to buy their Lambos back when Bitcoin was $1000 - they sold 300 Bitcoin to buy a $300,000 Lambo! Well, today that 300 Bitcoin is now worth $3,000,000. They now own a $3 million Lambo that's worth like $80k in the car market maybe (I don't know lambo values). But it cost them $3 million!
Looking back, they made a dumb move, and also probably hate their lambo.

As always, it's your own personal decision.
I tell most people to only 'cash out' when it's lifechanging money. So if you're there, then yes, if not, then no.
There is no profit in holding fiat money, just keep that in mind. The only thing I could imagine selling for is to buy modest real estate.
If you went through the ups and downs and know the technology, then the best thing to do is make your own personal valuation, your point where you say, "You know, if this happens, I'm doing X and getting out."
My "get out" position is 100 satoshi for a loaf of bread (basically, by that time I won't ever deal in fiat ever again).

I think getting Amazon to accept BTC is probably the best angle. They're huge, make risky moves and it takes a day for Visa/Mastercard to process payments where BTC takes 10-30 minutes. To me I see Amazon as the most likely adopter.

Look at the amount of coins for sale. If someone came in and said "I want 5000 Bitcoins right now!" they would drive the price well over $40,000 per coin on the exchanges.
If you're using Coinbase Pro you can 'zoom out' on the buy/sell ... trough? Hmm. I don't know the exact word for it but the limit order books where buy and sell meet, looks like a V. I found this for reference:  (someone remind me the word for this thing). Bottom graph of  if you don't have CB Pro.
Anyway if you zoom out you will see the 3500th full Bitcoin is listed over $40,000. Someone has a sell order there because if someone wanted to just gobble up 5000 Bitcoin, this person wants in on that premium price scoop and listed a sell order for that amount.

Anyone can convert electricity into Bitcoin.


That's my point, they're shooting themselves in the foot! Bitcoin is a hedge against government fiat money!


It doesn't need to hold any transactions. The announcement and subsequent adoption of Bitcoin by any world government would do a few things, one being it would cause their nation to become the weakest nation on Earth, submitting to the power of a cryptocurrency that they can no longer steal their own citizens' labor with, and two it would force the adoption rate to skyrocket, forcing every other nation to achieve adoption much sooner. Meaning if you wanted to kill the USA's power, if you are Iran, doing this would make the USA citizens insist on following suit sooner than later, sapping the USA of all its power - that power being the ability to steal it's citizens' labor for free.
Actual transactions can be done with fiat in the meantime during the transition to Bitcoin backed printed money.

Miners sometimes don't want to build your transaction into their next potential block if the fee is low - in other words, if someone is willing to pay $50 to get their transaction in right this moment, some miners only listen for high fee amounts. They then listen for those and try to mine a block with those new transactions. It's kind of dumb - most likely some other miner is just going to come along and mine it sooner, but if it is a mining pool or something, all that you need to know is higher fees result in faster service, kind of like real life. You pay for priority service!
So your fee is $1.92 but for the size I think it's fine. This means if someone is paying $10 for the same size, they'll be prioritized, however when there's enough room on the block to fit you in, it will be fit in and mined into the blockchain, there preserved for the rest of time.
Anyway just wait. lol...

You can buy $100 in Bitcoin and you should go for it.
I like Coinbase myself, so I recommend them if you are in the USA. If you are somewhere else maybe not - but they have customers worldwide so shouldn't be a problem.
Sign up for Coinbase and buy what you want. It's pretty easy. From there, just keep in mind, Coinbase is holding your value for you. If you don't have a crypto-wallet, "not your keys, not your Bitcoin" is the saying. Meaning you have to eventually put those $100 worth of Bitcoin into a secure wallet that you control and become responsible for to really "own Bitcoin". But that can be done down the line when you're more invested.
Buy $100 from Coinbase every month and in a few years you will be so happy.
In the past, some exchanges got compromised and hacked and so on. Sometimes that meant the customers lost everything. Other times it meant the exchange paid up for the lost amounts. So that's why eventually you need your own wallet, because an exchange is just a 'bank' holding your cash and you should always be in control of your digital cash by securing your own wallet. Again, something to worry about down the line, not right now if you don't want to.
Feel free to pick my brain on anything you want regarding this topic.

An exchange is just a convenient place to buy and sell Bitcoin. Shutting down exchanges would force adoption at a higher rate as people would still continue to value Bitcoin at similar levels and would now have no other way to transact them.
There are definitely dangers, but the idea is required for the future, and as such it should survive, and has to survive all manipulations tried against it to exist.
But that's what good ideas do.

I know of a feature of a blockchain that would not be useless, that would have immense value that Bitcoin does not provide. It would be different though, and not impact Bitcoin at all; it would be very similar though and have valuation to pay for the 'miners'.
But yes, for storing value, Bitcoin is king. I'm just saying there are other features that make other blockchains valuable, just not as a currency when that role is already filled and yes, backed by tremendous hashrate and work effort.

Let's say you work a job for 50 years and then retire at 65. The government (USA) gives you a social security check of maybe $2000 per month. In order for them to give you that $2000 per month, they took 13% of your earnings for 50 years - 6.5% from you, 6.5% paid by your employer who could otherwise have given it to you.
If you live until 85, 20 more years on this income, you got paid back $480,000 and after you die there is no more payment made to you or your estate, your children or anyone else.
If you invested 13% of your income for 50 years into pretty much anything else you would retire a multimillionaire. You would also be able to spend that money at any point along the way, and would get the full sum any time you wanted, meaning at 65 you could pull it all out and spend it however you felt was best. You wouldn't be scraping by at $2k per month.
So what's the difference? The difference is the government steals your labor and everyone else's over time. They don't just end up with millions of your money after 50 years - they also only give you $2k of it back per month and since that money could provide that ($2k/month) in investment growth alone, they're basically paying you off for free until you die. They add new money into the market with lower interest rates, driving up inflation, and keep using the money you give them today to earn a return for themselves instead. I use 'they' in a weird way here, it's not any one person or entity or organization, it's a broad term meaning the whole of governments around the world. Every government is in the business of stealing their citizens' labor and this has always been the case throughout all history. I'm not even saying it's bad, I'm just pointing out how one might think about these things and decide if they want to go down the rabbit hole of finding out how to protect their labor against such things as much as possible in the long run.
Over a lifetime you didn't notice much. You didn't factor in everything, and so it was ok, because they only took a little at a time. You always felt a dollar was a dollar, but had issues whenever you needed a car or buying a house, but thankfully the banks gave you a loan when you really needed it.
Feeding the system. Now... I've fed the system and will continue to do so. But with the knowledge of what is going on and the ability to be my own bank and to, myself, profit off the government's theft of everyone else's labor... the power dynamic is more in favor of those who own gold and Bitcoin and other assets, even stocks and so on. Rather than the government stealing everyone's labor, when you own assets you get paid by those who enter into the market later than you. They have to work extra hard to buy something that you didn't have to work as hard for. If you bought Amazon stock at $5 and held to today - it's worth $1800 now. Your $5 beat out the government in stealing someone else's labor... but your dollar value is constantly being devalued due to inflation too.
If you bought $10,000 in Amazon stock in 1997 or so for $5 per share, and then today sold all 2000 shares, you'd earn $3.6 million. Sounds good? Except the buying power has dropped by 40% in the past 20 years, meaning it's as if you are only selling it for $2.16 million. This is because all prices and real estate has gone way up, so you can't buy as much as if you had $3.6 million in 1997. Still not bad! Ok now you have to pay taxes on it, say 35%: $2.7 million of the original amount is yours to put into your bank account (only able to purchase ~$1.62 million in buying power when comparing modern value due to inflation). Ok well at least you have a million! With other factors, inflation and so on, the government has taken over 50% of the value back. Thanks for donating!
Sure, the $10k investment is still valuable ending up being a great investment, but we're using Amazon's monumental growth for this example. If your stock performs pretty good over time, and you sell your 2000 shares down the line for $50 each - a 10x improvement over 20 years is not terrible! You end up with ~$45k in buying power for investing in that share for 20 whole years.
This isn't something you can really avoid, but it is something you can resist with assets that appreciate well. Real estate is always a good option, and the right stocks and indexes are ok long term beating out inflation. Still, the end result is a lot of stolen labor from you and everyone else no matter how you cut it. And gold - the standard for storing wealth! Only up 439% in the past 20 years (4.39x). It's lost out big against stocks as a means for storing wealth. The future is unknown. Bitcoin is positioned to beat out (and has beat out) all stocks and markets in the long run. It could be the settlement currency of banks in 20 years, forcing them to adhere to sound financial policy. Or it could get hacked and die tomorrow and people lose everything they put into it.
Just like Amazon at $5 was probably a bad buy if you didn't think ahead. Risk.

The main difference is adoption - it's a gift card for all businesses and for 2 billion worldwide users; this makes it a currency not a gift card.
Those users will use it to pay bills, buy food, receive payments from others for good and services, and so on, because of ease of use and low fees.
A gift card is only usable at the one place of business, generally.
Even though pegged as a stablecoin, if Libra is easier to use than the USD for payment - for example if it's just super easy to pay for your Uber ride with Libra, and the Uber driver pays for his food in Libra, and you work at the food joint so you get paid your salary in Libra, the currency cycle turns Libra into a currency. It doesn't matter if they want it to be a replacement currency or not, the reality is people will trade in whatever medium makes the most sense to them. Lots of people trust Facebook and will have no problem dealing inside that ecosystem. It will turn into a currency causing all sorts of issues for governments, namely the inflation of their currency depending on how weak it is compared to the Libra.
And yes, they will back it with all manner of assets, so likely it will be stronger than the USD! Imagine using currency in the USA which is stronger than the USD, and how that will impact national pride and so on. I cannot see the government allowing it, if they can control it. The reality is the government has little control. The only real control is the Fed in this situation - either they partner up or have a micro-Fed created within their sphere of influence that operates better than they do. Their best bet is to partner up, and link the Libra to 1 USD and call it a day, even back the thing. It's wild, massive changes all pointing to one thing -&gt; crypto is the future.

No worries, the best time to get into Bitcoin is when you finally do.
There are apps and hardware wallets (like a device) but why not keep it cheap and run your own wallet? Google Bitcoin Core and download and run the software.
You need like ~230GB of free space on your computer hard drive (that's a lot) and will need to let it run for a while to download the entire blockchain. Actually I'm pretty sure you can receive funds without having the entire chain but whatever. Download it all. There's a wallet section - well, the wallet is already created when you install the software. This gives you a receiving address. Any BTC sent to that address is now permanently yours and no one can take it away. How it is yours is because of a private key that is attached to your wallet that only exists on your computer in that wallet. So using the software you can encrypt the wallet with a password, and then find the file and back it up somewhere, like an external thumb drive, or store it in the cloud, or however you decide it is possible to recover that wallet 10 years from now if necessary. Some people print literal paper wallets out. Some have their keys stamped onto metal plates. It's amazing.
Anyway, when you have a receiving address on your computer, tell Coinbase to send the BTC to that address. Then it's done. Eventually the transfer completes and the balance shown on your computer Bitcoin Core wallet will be 0.00001394 or whatever. That's it. Then you just wait.
At that point, deleting the wallet from the computer and relying only on your backups is a good idea, because if you get some virus or malware in the future that steals the wallet (and happens to learn your password, because you encrypted the wallet, remember?) will have access to your cash.
Your money is no longer stored in a bank, or in a vault, or anywhere else except your mind - where you stored your wallet, and what your password is.
You don't need to run the software to send money into your address either. You just need that address and to be fully in control of that address. Then you can take your wallet off your computer and have it backed up in a few places and that's it. Just send whatever you buy to that address. And you can confirm every transaction using websites like Blockchain Explorer and see the transaction occurs.
Then down the line if you ever want to spend or sell Bitcoin, you restore your wallet to the software and send the Bitcoin out to whomever you are sending it to (or back to Coinbase or another exchange if you're selling it there). When you restore your wallet, after the blockchain downloads on your computer, it will update with all the transactions that occurred and you will see the balance and be able to send it wherever you want.

You do not understand the technology then, and need to look into it more. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm serious about that.
I will humor your claim: Ok so the government(s) gain 51% of all the hashing power in the world (which currently is more computing power than all the supercomputers of the world, but you say they'll force all these people to run BitcoinGov) - then what?
What will the government do once they have 'control'?
"They will just create more Bitcoin out of thin air, inflating the supply and turning it into fiat!"
If that were the case, people would sell off all their Bitcoin in that instant and move their wealth into a new cryptocurrency, which could just be a fork of the current Bitcoin main network, and the 49% remaining nodes would turn into 100% of the nodes on the new network.
"But then the government will just switch all the original miners to the new network!"
Which would probably take countless amounts of time to download and install the new software on all the computers/miners and get them going on this new network which has seen a huge spike in mining power (and probably a new algorithm incompatible with BitcoinGov specific ASICs) due to everyone who cashed out of their BitcoinGov buying up more hashing power on the new network.
If the "government" does not maintain 51% of the hashing power their blockchain would not be trusted. Any threat of trust would see massive pullout and investment into other crypto. Keep in mind, Bitcoin uses SHA256, and miners are specific for SHA256 and cannot be just 'flipped' to hash other cryptos.
There's no stopping this thing. You need to look into why a lot more.
But what scenario are you concerned about if a government gets 50% hashing power (or if anyone does)?

Ok to make it clear - you can send Bitcoin to someone else with no fee. It takes a bit longer though. Paying transactions (people who include fees) get processed first because miners make money on writing your transaction into the blockchain.
If you are buying or selling Bitcoin from ANY exchange, or ANY app, or any other way besides cash to a stranger, you're paying a fee for their service. That's completely different than the transfer fee which again, could be zero. The fee you pay is the exchange or app fee to make the transaction for you so it is convenient. Back in the day it was hard to really figure out where to buy and sell. Not it's much easier.
Since no one knows anything about Bitcoin, everyone is going to try and get you to pay a bunch of fees, because what do you know?

Your own wallet does not require verification. Load up Bitcoin Core and boom, you have a wallet on your computer. You can then receive funds there whenever you want. Just make sure to encrypt and backup that wallet etc (I have lots of posts about this in my post history if you want to take a look).

One consideration is that if you are being tortured you're not dead. If you hand over how to access your Bitcoin, you're surely going to be dead at that point. So if at all possible, your best bet is to not tell anything. In this way the level of torture must keep you alive and if they make a mistake and you die then no one gets a thing anyway - hell you might have deadman switches where your family gets it at least.

The nuance of your arguments and those responding to you keep focusing on currency. That's the wrong way to consider the situation.
Money is a representation of human work effort. I could bring a bushel of corn to Bob and he can give me half a pig in return. That exchange is very time consuming and we don't always want the same thing. So instead, we've all decided that a medium of trading the representation of the work we performed is a good idea - currency. Now I can sell the bushel of corn to whomever needs it, and I can buy the half pig from Bob whenever I need it, using this medium of exchange we all agreed upon. Everyone is happy, because it is convenient, and the currency fairly accurately represents the work effort we put in to obtain it.
The issue came along when the governments began printing paper money and further along when they removed the backing of that paper money by any physical thing. Although this idea is generally a decent one as it allows people to reach beyond their means, it also steals labor from the population - and here's how.
Let's say the money supply is constant, at 1 million units (including small denominations). Everyone is able to trade just fine, and everyone works well together using this form of exchange to deal with each other. With no taxes and no new money printed, it is very stable, with basically one risk - one person producing so much value that they take nearly the entire money supply for themselves. That risk is basically none, however, as even the most profitable and biggest businesses in real life are only a tiny fraction of the economy, so we'll ignore the risk. A group of people operating in a closed currency network all benefit because the value of their work is directly represented in the market and the amount of payment they receive for their services.
If in this system you felt like being frugal and wanted to save your labor, to work hard for a short while so you can coast on that labor in the long run, you could save up your monetary units. You could maybe save 1 or 2 of these 1 million units over 30 years, and then live off those 1 or 2 units for the rest of your life, knowing that in another 20 years, the currency is a direct store of the extra value and labor you put forward into the economy. As more people are born and the population increases, there's more demand for currency, so the denominations become smaller - meaning your labor pays itself interest over time as more people want your unit and will do more relative to everyone else to get it. Those 1 or 2 units will last you the rest of your life on interest alone.
Now introduce the Fed into this system. They 'print' or digitally create 1000 units. It's not a lot but it's something. Whereas 1 or 2 units can last a 40 year old the rest of their life, the Fed just made 500-1000 lifetimes worth of labor out of nothing. Because everyone still considers the value of 1 or 2 units very high, the Fed now has immense buying power. They can buy pretty much anything in the entire world at that point, as they are more wealthy than the wealthiest corporations.
Of course, they don't spend it directly in that manner, nor do they create it instantly for no reason. They set up banks which will lend money to people, and the banks will ask the Fed for a loan, only needing to promise to hold 10% of the loan amount in their reserves. If someone requests a loan, the Fed just adds the number into their ledger with no balance, prints the money and sends the money to the bank. In comes Joe Businessman who borrows 5 units of currency from the bank. The Fed gives the bank 5 units of currency (printing it) and the bank gives Joe Businessman 5 units of currency for his loan. The bank has to have and keep 0.5 units in reserve for this loan, but basically takes no risk. In return, Joe Businessman promises to pay back the bank, and the bank promises to pay back the Fed. As Joe Businessman works hard, he pays back an interest rate of say 5%. This 5% is on money - representation of labor - that never existed. It did allow Joe Businessman to start up his new contracting business building houses, so that is good for him, and his fresh money went a long way because people thought that the money was as valuable as if someone saved up 2 lifetimes worth of value to begin that business. In the beginning, Joe with his new money is extremely powerful as the perception of value is extremely high for the units he has. Eventually Joe distributes the money through paying people to perform work and he buys products that he needs for his business and eventually he becomes profitable and begins paying back the loan. That money filters back to the bank, which takes its 3% cut and pays back the Fed, which has now received 2% of the loaned out representation of human work effort, and they didn't have to lift a finger. In fact, no one did, because the money was created out of nothing.
Eventually the people on the street realize they have been dealing with someone who had a lot of money from nothing. No work effort behind it, just Joe got a loan and was able to buy all that stuff. They value their currency a little less because someone can just get more of it from nothing. They might also realize the best option is to get a loan themselves, because the people who take out loans are dealing with the most powerful, least inflated currency at the moment. And each time that new person takes out a loan, they are borrowing the representation of human work effort that never existed, and yet promise to pay real human work effort back to the Fed in the terms of their loan.
You, who saved 1 or 2 units of pure labor in your first 30 years working, who wanted to live off that 1 or 2 units of pure labor for the rest of your life, now cannot do so. Your 1 or 2 units of labor have been inflated and are now worth .1 and .2 units - a fraction of what it was worth and what it should have been worth. Instead of 1 million units there is now 10 million units of currency in circulation because the Fed has been printing money over and over. And over time that unit will devalue even more. Your labor which you stored up for 30 years has been stolen from you. You thought you were able to save and be frugal and smart about your money and then live your life, except now everyone is borrowing money from the Fed and slowly but surely devaluing the spending power of the 1 or 2 units that took you 30 years to create.
The net result is your labor was stolen from you. Your work was stolen from you. And the ones who profited are the Fed and the banks who acquired your labor through inflation of the monetary unit, yet made sure to always get their 2% back from their loans. Who didn't have to lift a finger to steal your life's work value away from you, and you didn't have to do a thing, and you couldn't control it, and you had no way to hedge against that except if you were smart at the very start and invested every monetary unit you had into gold.
In comes Bitcoin - digital gold that is even more powerful than gold. You can continue to play the Fed's game and allow them to steal your labor, or you can invest all your labor into digital gold. You won't need to defend your digital gold with a vault and with guns. You will defend your digital gold with information and cryptography. The net result of having such a fluid finite asset is that it is more powerful than bulky gold, which has trust issues (is it pure?) and requires physical presence to exchange. Bitcoin serves currency purposes and is a direct counter to the Fed's stealing of the world's work effort.
The Fed goes on with a combination of taxes and interest rates and loans and monetary policy to make sure they are always stealing just enough from the people that they don't really notice. Everything they design is to continue hiding the theft from the people, to keep them uninformed and happy with being able to make purchases and live their lives and then die.
Contrary to how I might come across, I acknowledge the power of the Fed as being a good thing overall. Most people *are* dumb. Most people have no issue having their labor stolen from them slowly over time as long as they can get along. Far more important is the fact it was an American invention made to make America more powerful by stealing the labor from its own people to bolster foreign presence. It's very smart and very good, and those who borrow money now in America are dealing with the most fresh, least inflated dollar they can get their hands on, so it's great for starting businesses and so on. The power the Fed has generated here extends around the world as they installed central banks in pretty much every nation, forcing them into the same system, all leading back to the Fed.
For those who are smart and see the option of gold; we choose gold. And seeing liquid, digital gold that can be used around the world, we choose Bitcoin over gold. There's no comparison except adoption - trust and acceptance. You can choose to have your labor stolen from you for the rest of your life, or acquire 1 or 2 units of Bitcoin and live the rest of your life off the interest of that invested labor, or do anything in between as Bitcoin completely restores the monetary power back to the holders of Bitcoin.
A long one but it was fun thinking through it all. Money is a representation of human work effort that is inflated. Bitcoin is a representation of human work effort that is not inflated.

Yeah lots of people cashed out (the volume), and lots of sells drives price lower, and people have stop-loss so those get hit and it cycles for a while until the market hits its lower threshold... and then it continues on - everyone asks: is this thing still valuable? and they continue on.
Don't panic. This is only the start, just hang in there.

The population is increasing year over year - why would they need to charge more for products or services when the labor to perform the tasks costs less and less? In a closed system, you don't have these rising prices like in an inflation system. In a closed system, the presence of more people means a stronger value, driving prices lower as there is competition for your currency which they cannot get anywhere else, meaning you can count on your unit of currency to be more valuable over time, not less so, according to the population.


I'm not saying it's bad for society or in general - I stated somewhere that I think it is overall good, because most people are going to waste away, and stealing their labor is much better than letting them waste it (according to the government and greater foreign affairs). The Fed is the reason for US dominance in the world, because we had so many hard working people to steal labor from who had such a good quality of life that they didn't need to worry about it too much as long as they got paid and got by just fine in life.
The only bad part of the Fed is if or when the system fails. For example, if you held Bitcoin in Venezuela instead of the local currency you'd be so happy today. When the government fails or makes bad choices, it affects your life, stealing your labor. For a strong Fed this isn't much risk - however recently the Fed stated/hinted that they were going to lower interest rates. This means more cheap money for the masses, which means more inflation, which means gold hit a record 2k per ounce in Australia and means Bitcoin is going to follow suit. It's a bad decision by the Fed and it is stealing from the people.
Which is good, overall, but bad for any individual who cares about their labor and their future. Which not many people do - so it's better to steal it, as a government, than to let it go to waste. Those who get Bitcoin or gold hedge against that theft and ensure they have something finite that cannot be controlled the same way as fiat. And for me Bitcoin is much more secure than gold, for many reasons.

I think he is citing the timeframe of investors - the best stock investors are now dead. The timeframe is a killer. Bitcoin probably has a very short timeline compared to other stocks though in terms of reaching lifechanging value. So the sooner you're into it the better. Quebeth is just saying don't stress it, success comes with time. 
I'd say stress it, you need to be into crypto as soon as possible, so when you're 26 you're in an amazing financial situation and aren't beholden to fiat currency for your entire life. The digital age sharpens the exponential rise of assets. Amazon used to trade for $1.50 or less and now $1800 per. If you bought into Amazon and believed in it when Amazon came to the world, you're in great shape today. That was only a 20 year timeframe.
Right now, think of Bitcoin like if Amazon was at $10 per share. Would you still get in? Do you trust and understand the technology and the value Bitcoin creates?
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:34:21


This is incorrect.
If you want to get more Bitcoin, someone else has to exchange their Bitcoin to you and will only do so if you give them value worth the amount they are exchanging in return.
In other words, it's not about loss, it's about transferring human work effort, or labor, for it. If I want more Bitcoin, I don't just force someone to lose theirs, I perform a service for someone else and get Bitcoin in return. It is a medium of exchange. There is zero loss to anyone in that arrangement. Both sides agree on the exchange.
This expenditure of human work effort, or labor, is the increasing, collaborative value.
Imagine working in an isolated town; you and 1000 other people are able to perform every single necessity to live (food, water, shelter). What happens when you all have kids and now there are 2000 people? Shouldn't the cost of labor go down, because there's more people to do the work, even if there's twice as many mouths to feed? If you had 10,000 currency tokens in the town, before, the same labor would cost 10 tokens, where now it costs roughly 5 for the same labor (just exampling here). The human work effort did not go down, but the value compared to the currency tokens did.
You can still compete in this scenario, and would still want to make products to secure more tokens that symbolize human work effort. But any time you exchange them for labor, you are collaborating on the market value of the tokens; how much a token represents human work effort.

There is only one currency which works for you and doesn't require someone else to take a (massive) cut to make investments on your behalf and then end up handing you over devalued fiat down the road with a bunch of conditions and fees - if they let you take it out and don't declare that the government needs to take every's 401k money to pay for the next war.

Well in the scenario you propose, a government comes along, forces developers to create a new client...
And then everyone across the world accepts the client?
Because the client is only as strong as the number of people who vote in that it is the right client by running it on their machines. If you make a client and get 10 friends to run it, no one would accept any of your transactions, because the strongest network is the biggest, most trusted blockchain. Someone linked this and I think it is a good explanation: 
So unless you think the government(s) will create millions of nodes and miners to take control of a crypto currency that would then be worth absolutely nothing as everyone moves all their assets to the next best crypto (which would just be a hard fork of Bitcoin)... then ya.
So yes it is immune to government fuckery *mostly*.
Governments could suicide. The USA could print enough money to buy Bitcoin into $1 trillion per Bitcoin and then crash their own economy and cause world war to break out where a loaf of bread rapidly goes from $1 to $100,000....
In such a case, it will still be a great idea to own Bitcoin but it would be really hard to find a buyer who is not the government at that point, and you'd move your Bitcoin and sell it for some other national currency and not USD at that point (well before that point) anyway, because that means the dollar is worth shit and everyone else's currency is worth way more.
So they could fuck with it but never in any way would it benefit the government.
All Bitcoin does is makes it so the government is not the monopoly on stealing other peoples' labor. Whereas governments used to have a monopoly on this (within their own country) now regular people can be their own banks and hold their own value over time.

If you buy BTC with PayPal, the seller is an idiot. If you get the BTC and transfer it immediately into your secure wallet, you can 'refund' or 'dispute' the PayPal charge and get a refund and the other person can never get their Bitcoin back from you (outside potential legal battling, and even then, if you don't give up the keys...).
If you want to just deal on the up and up, there's no risk for YOU buying BTC using PayPal. PayPal does cover fraudulent transactions as a payment processor, so if someone scams you they will reverse the transaction and the other person won't be able to get their money (usually).
PayPal might have some weirdo thing with buying currency though, so best to contact them and make sure they cover that kind of fraud. Maybe they have a section saying "We don't cover Bitcoin jackass" and then you'd be screwed.
As weird as it sounds, I'd have him send the Bitcoin first to make sure it is confirming on the network, and then pay the fiat. Why? Because established channels exist to trade Bitcoin now, so if someone is selling it outside those channels, they are the ones who should be taking the risk, not you. And doing so would be dumb over PayPal by principle but 999/1000 times no one would worry about it, they'd just complete the transaction and carry on with their day. So the BTC seller should make the first move building your trust, because they were advertising, before you send them anything.
Bitcoin is digital cash.

Yes, there is going to be a lot of resistance. In fact this is why Libra is so good for Bitcoin. Already the regulators are swarming around. Already Russia said it will not allow Libra.
Why have they not done that with Bitcoin, which exists right now and serves a similar function?
Because they cannot control it and they know it. No one can. That's why people call it a revolution.
If you think about that for a moment, that Russia blocks Libra, and even India is outlawing all crypto but that just causes Bitcoin to rise in price there, it should blow your mind.

Just posted this to someone else, edited it for you:
First, obtain some Bitcoin using an exchange or a wallet app or some manner where something somewhere says you own $300 worth of Bitcoin.
Then, download Bitcoin Core client, run it, download the entire (huge ~230GB) blockchain. Then create a receive address for yourself on your own computer on your own fully controlled wallet, and then send your wallet/app Bitcoin to your own address.
You will feel weird having this $300 valued thing on your computer that could be lost at any time if the wallet gets deleted or if someone steals the wallet or if your computer explodes at that moment...
Then you'll feel empowered when you back up your wallet with encrypted copies and put them on thumb drives and secure the wallet however you want.
You can then delete the wallet from your computer, knowing you have backups, and send any BTC to that wallet at any time in the future to store it securely (without having to re-load the wallet or interact with it any way, you'll just know BTC lands there by watching the blockchain).
If you ever want to spend it, then you'll have to restore the wallet to your computer and transfer some BTC to either a different wallet app or the person you're buying from.
This will get you into it and the feeling of having your own wallet is huge and you get to download the massive blockchain and get a feel for all the work behind it.
Keep in mind, no one else can mess with your Bitcoin. This means if you forget about it for a couple years and then get reminded "Oh yeah I had Bitcoin" but forgot all about it and lost all your backups you lose it all. This means you are personally responsible, 100%, for your private keys, your wallet, and the BTC they hold. If you lose it, it's never recoverable. It's quite a good feeling to have that control though.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:06:06
The value of things is completely determined by what someone else is willing to pay for it. With regular stuff, like stocks and so on, what people are willing to pay for 1 Amazon stock is $1800 USD. You also have to keep in mind that USD inflates, so $1800 in Amazon stock today - if Amazon stock stays flat - is not worth $1800 in a couple years. 
Bitcoin is a store of value as a currency and not a stock - it is not backed by any company. It's as pure as you can get pretty much - it's value is however much someone else will pay (exchange their labor) for it. As it cannot be printed or mass produced, its value rises over time compared to the fiat money supply's buying power declining. As no government controls it, and no one person owns it, and no one person was the 'creator' of it, its value will continue to go up over time as it hedges against fiat inflation around the world.

Buying Bitcoin now is like buying currency at a discount.
I made this analogy in another post: if you drop 1 million gold coins into a society that never used gold coins and doesn't value gold at all and never knew what gold was, the first people who held gold coins would be spending their coins to buy stuff. Someone might spend 1000 gold coins to buy a loaf of bread (someone paid 10,000 BTC for a pizza if you recall). Over time as people realize the value of gold coins they will continue to trade it in smaller volumes and each coin will become more valuable as people realize there aren't any more gold coins, just the ones they have. They can't get any more from anyone unless they work for it or have a great idea to get others to back their idea with actual gold coins.
Soon the person who paid 1000 gold coins for a loaf of bread looks back and says, "WTF did I do!?"
Now imagine you look ahead and noticed 1000 gold coins might be worth 10 years of labor in the future and instead of spending those gold coins you held them as long as possible. Over time, now you can get 10 loaves of bread for 1 coin, and your value of the currency has gone up because you could see ahead better than other people.
Buying Bitcoin now is like buying 1000 gold coins when they're not valued much, when you can see ahead in the age of the internet and the digital world that it should be worth a lot more in the future. You buy future currency at a (huge) discount now. So you hodl it for as long as possible until you can exchange in that currency, because when you don't have to overpay for that loaf of bread, you'll be able to buy a loaf of bread for 100 satoshi.

Hm I see.
Well, yes all coins can be traced back to when they were mined, but if there are 1000 transactions between now and then, it is not easy to find out when you obtained them. If you mined them and never sold, then yes they could say you had Bitcoins that cost you $0 that now are worth $10k so pay up!
Nevermind the trillion-dollar mining machine you bought to mine them. It says right here on my ledger, 1 BitCoin Mining Machine XL purchased for $1 trillion USD.
Then you can challenge the government to prove the digital code on a computer is actually worth anything, getting them into Bitcoin, and forcing the world to accept it, causing the entire monetary regulatory system to be called into question (they make money on money, so how much do they pay in taxes?) and so on.
Also remember you paid for your miner back then, so it's $1 trillion 2010 dollars or whatever.

To a degree, yes, and to another, no.
Some altcoins provide some benefits compared to Bitcoin  which may you may see as being better or worse for a cryptocurrency or blockchain. Some are just blockchains that use the money spent into them to achieve certain product offerings and so on.
Litecoin handles more transactions faster and has some other stuff and is fine. But I don't see that as a benefit, personally. A computer could handle transactions much faster. Having a human timeframe attached to a cryptocurrency is part of the value in my opinion.
Sure, the bottom 1000 cryptocurrencies are marketing, hype and schemes. But not all, and the top altcoins don't deserve that label I don't think. Good tech will come from other cryptocurrencies yet to be invented yet.
But to store value, Bitcoin is king.

I skimmed the article and it seems to know what it's talking about.
I try to get new people to make their own wallet, because most don't know they can.
Download Bitcoin Core software and run the node. Download the entire blockchain - this will make you realize the size and scope and also be one of the nodes verifying transactions - you strengthen the network and help the technology and begin to understand it. You then create a wallet on your own computer using Bitcoin Core and viola, you have your very own wallet.
Then back it up. It's a wallet with nothing in it, but that's the time to back it up! Find your preferred method of securing it, and do that.
Then send some Bitcoin into the wallet. Then realize that unique address now has something of value in it. Digital currency.
From there do as you wish. I recommend then deleting your wallet (your Bitcoin is in your backups that you verified you could restore when it had no value in it, remember?) and now you have a secure address that only you have and only you know about and only you know the password to the encrypted wallet and ... you can send value to it (yes, even when you don't run the software, you just need to have your receiving address).
It's a good experience to see how it all works by doing this and from there you can branch out to hardware wallets or other things that might make it more convenient to buy and sell Bitcoin, but nowhere as safe as you having complete physical control over the information and data with no other layers on top of it. Down the line, in a few years you might spend some Bitcoin and want a convenient hardware wallet for it.
Doing it this way is free for now, and you get to be a part of the whole system.

Ideally you would mine you own block and receive the pure coins into a clean wallet/address with no other transactions. From there, you'd probably hold it until you saw a market for mint bitcoins become available. Then you could entertain offers - either selling each coin for a premium price (say bitcoin is worth 300k and you sell each mint coin for 500k) and transfer that coin the buyer. There would be one transaction on that coin at that point. Or, if you found a wealthy enough buyer, you could sell the whole block and just hand over the wallet to the buyer.
It would be like holding on to rare jewelry. How do you sell an antique piece of gold jewelry for more than the gold-ounce value? You find the right buyer who appreciates the history of the jewelry and sell to them. It's going to be a small market for sure, but it should exist at some point.

Yeah... I agree on the basis of being prudent to tell people to invest only what they can afford to lose, but in reality I am all in and think anyone who feels fiat currency is worth holding onto is not paying enough attention.
Meaning, you're losing Bitcoin by thinking the risk is being in Bitcoin.
You're losing Bitcoin by buying and holding fiat today. It's backwards, because Bitcoin is a currency, not a stock that goes down. It's a store of value, not a stock.
I'd say never to invest more Bitcoin into fiat than you can afford to lose.

I like the guy who posted about doubling your position: If you buy Bitcoin now and it dips - will you continue to buy? If not then you need to learn more about fiat money and how Bitcoin technology works first.
Those who bought above $17k and then sold low and got out and felt burned were not really paying attention. Some even held - but they never continued to invest into the system over time either - so they're just hoping to 'break even'. If they're patient enough even the $17k buy will pay off.

I think you have to look at the problem a little more realistically. If the government installed, even with infiltration, their own programmers with the intent of ruining Bitcoin, they would have to remove the open source code. If they do that, no one on the network would trust this non-open-source client, and it would not be accepted.
Now, if the millions of nodes and miners all agreed to download and install and run this new code knowing that it would destroy the value of Bitcoin - then yeah. That's called suicide.
'A bunch of world governments could create enough nodes' is not likely, if not impossible. Even if so, even if they did so, people would notice and would fork off another pure fork of the blockchain. The governments would then need to infiltrate this new group (which due to trust would become the biggest blockchain) and so on.
If that amount of effort was put into trying to disrupt Bitcoin, the valuation would be sky high, because you're talking about double-digit-percentages (like 10%) of the entire world's productivity poured into trying to take down Bitcoin over decades.
Would bankers do it? They'd try. So buy Bitcoin now, sell it only for what amount would change your life, and then hold the rest. The value has to skyrocket for them to do it.
Let's say they held a gun to everyone's head - what does that *mean* overall? It means they are stealing from everyone, stealing their labor and their hard work, forcing them to pay their electric bill to suit the whims of the government. The government already does that with fiat money. It would be a similar cost for the government to, instead of buying all these very very specific computers to mine Bitcoin and become nodes, to just BUY Bitcoin and try to force the value out of the hands of normal people, making 1 Bitcoin worth $1 trillion dollars. In doing so, that government commits financial suicide, as everyone who sold at $100 million per BTC goes out right away and buys houses and gold and other assets. And if the government turns around and says, "HA! We only created that inflation to force you out, dirty Bitcoiners!" and tries to steal the property and things you bought at that point? You'd fight back, and there would be revolution.
The only long term for Bitcoin is for banks to accept it and sit back as the value rises naturally out of the range of everyday people. They will sit and watch it become a pure mirror of the amount of fiat currency around the world. And when it is no longer in the price range of normal individuals, they will invest with fiat into programmers to create additional layers - settlement software and payment processors - to begin eroding the ability, or should I say, incentive, for any one person to fire up a node and download the blockchain and strengthen the network. They will set up lending layers and all sorts of layers that it will be hard (psychologically) to get an actual, honest to goodness Bitcoin in any market. The altcoins shall inherit the Earth.
Keep in mind, this is in 100-200 years from now. So if you're in Bitcoin now you're not going to live to see that happen. All you will see in this lifetime is Bitcoin rise and the power of governments wane a bit as Bitcoin holders become members of the central banking system in a way. Large holders of Bitcoin will be offered entry into the inner circle, and smaller holders will become regional banks, with all these layers being created to facilitate trade. All with the promise of "just trust us."
Back to your original point: The current blockchain that has the most hashrate and the biggest ledger behind it is most trusted. If a government somehow obtained near 50% of the processing power of the entire world and decided to make a run on Bitcoin, the fork could split in two - the government Bitcoin and the Organic Bitcoin. Knowing the move was done with malicious intent, all new users would sell off their GovBTC immediately, dropping the value to nothing, and buying up shares in OrganicBTC, driving that price back up to where it was, roughly, when the GovBTC began to act in bad faith.
There's no actual solution for governments except lying to people and convincing them that they should use a bunch of third party payment layers and altcoins instead of Bitcoin, forcing them into false ledgers and fractional reserve systems layered underneath Bitcoin.
As long as we, the people, continue to buy up all the hash rates, develop new technology, and run nodes everywhere we can, we strongly resist this from ever happening. Just like anything else, if, and when, the Bitcoin community slacks off, the banking system will be there to take advantage - a couple centuries from now - but they have the time.
One potential outcome is if the largest Bitcoin holders, in the long run, invent their own fractional reserve with a layer underneath Bitcoin, they could outperform the current central banks, and reinvest profits back into the economy and infrastructure... But more than likely they would be assassinated before that. Fiat doesn't like to play fair, nor should it.
Keep in mind, fiat is made to steal your labor, to steal your life away from you, to make you work your entire life essentially for free, so that those in the banking system can do whatever they want in the world. This kind of system has always existed and will forever exist. Fiat - the stealing of human labor - will never go away. It will just be hidden deeper and deeper in layers. Right now is one moment in history where people have a chance to simply turn things around for a bit and remove some of that power from those banks - to steal human labor for themselves (in a way, taking back their own labor) - leaving the banks with less.
But less of all the 'money' in the world is not that difficult for the banks. They will have no problem, unless everyone stops using fiat money, period; and that is unlikely. Time is on their side if people remain ignorant, which history proves is the greater force in the whole equation. (I use they/their to mean banking as a whole).

Maybe you meant 500 years? Which is not true? Stability? Did you not see all the "Surely" quotes?
The US dollar has not been stable for hundreds of years, you should study money and see how much it has been manipulated over time. Central banking didn't even occur until 1913. Most of the 'stability' you prize came from stealing people's money (which involved removing gold as the reserve currency and then removing gold from backing the dollar among other issues since then) occurred since 1913.
Bitcoin is new - the volatility you see is the exact same if you go compare any two currencies. Go look at USD to GBP or USD to VES for that matter. You will see fiat is very volatile even with all the manipulation. You are not genuine to claim that the US dollar has been stable for any period of time. It is so unstable because it is at the whim of a few people to decide how it works, and it keeps failing. There's probably about a dozen events in your lifetime that can be pointed to showing how unstable fiat is.
You should keep in mind, the "volatility" of Bitcoin is not Bitcoin being volatile. The most volatile thing in Bitcoin was BCH splitting off to form Bitcoin Cash - that's volatility. The price comparison between 1 Bitcoin and USD shows it is *USD that is volatile* not Bitcoin. The mentality of thinking that the side of valuation which is moving the most is the least volatile is backwards. That's like saying when you compare USD to Venezuelan dollars, the USD is unstable because VES fluctuates in price so much. It's backwards. The more stable currency is the one that you need less of to purchase more of the other one. You need 10,000 USD to buy 1 Bitcoin. You need 1 USD to buy 100 JPY. There's no comparison. Bitcoin reveals how insanely volatile USD is - where in 10 years Bitcoin went from 0 to 10k against it.

Yet if you consider how money and value is created, this should not be the case. There should not be an endless sapping of your buying power as the governments dictate. If you have more people to perform the work over time, the monetary cost should go down, even though labor and value has gone up. It is not unreasonable that, with the true fixed money supply that is Bitcoin, that we invest more heavily into our future generations because it is more profitable to have them do the work while they are young, and as they build wealth and their own value, eventually they pass that down to the next generation, with similar amounts of return where you're never too concerned with 'cash flow' because the system always has a flow of value into it in the form of new humans.

In the long run, if people can just change over their $100 fiat into the equivalent BTC at the moment so they can send their friend $100 worth of value with no issues then they will use it. But the relative exchanging doesn't matter to them. Bitcoin might be $100k a coin then, they don't care, they're sending equivalent value and that's all that matters.

That there's very few "hodlers" when it comes to stocks. People will buy quick and sell quick. So if all your assets are in stocks, you're not diversified, even if you spread it out over multiple companies.
I think the best way I can describe this is, "If you buy stocks you buy the market."
Doesn't matter which stock, you're beholden to the market as a whole, which swings together, generally.
Much like altcoins that swing with Bitcoin. If you buy an altcoin you buy the market. The difference is we know Bitcoin is the superior idea and there's no reason to pick altcoins, where in stocks it can be very random which one succeeds and which one fails.

Governments steal money from their citizens using inflation and taxation - Bitcoin rises against how much fiat money is printed by all the governments around the world as a result, because even if your country's economy crashes due to printing too much money, Bitcoin will still hold the same value (probably more).
There is a big incentive to ban Bitcoin, except due to being distributed and worldwide, it has no means of being controlled. So all it does is increase Bitcoin's value and adoption rate. If governments can't steal from their citizens they lose a lot of power.

USDT is like a bank. So if you want to put your money into  a bank, that's an option. A highly untested, very difficult to verify, Hong Kong based bank.
I'm sure they would love for you to send them money.
I am more inclined to deal with Coinbase's USDC considering they're an exchange and have to hold people's money in the first place, and then move it from there as desired. Coinbase suffers if the bottom falls out of crypto, whereas Tether could print money, buy up tons of Bitcoin, and then cancel all its account and shut down operations and anyone who held Tether would be out of luck with no recourse.
Coinbase could, too, shut down, but less likely as an exchange wants to facilitate trade, not prevent it.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:25:48
You have no idea do you?
It's roughly 5000 Bitcoin to a valuation of $40,000.
If we assume a sharp rise after that...
If Mark Zuckerberg wanted to buy 100,000 Bitcoin to be a "top-dog" and we assume the value rises exponentially every 5000 BTC Mark can not ever hit 100,000 Bitcoin.
Fun to consider, let's do it.
Let's say the first 5000 average a price of $40,000, and then we put 50% of the previous value back in for the next 5000 as people start rapidly increasing their sell price. 20 total increases.
The next 5000 will be $60,000 average.
The next 5000 $90,000 average, and so on.
At that rate the last Bitcoin would average 880 million and the total cost would be 1329702692031.86 or $1.3 trillion.
Heck I'll be generous and only do 10 hops adding only 25%:
First 10000 at $40,000.
Next 10000 at $50,000.
Next 10000 at $62,500 and so on.
At that rate he'll get 100,000 BTC for a total cost of 13301161193.84 or 13.3 billion and Bitcoin would have an average value of $298,000.
Considering how markets work is the more someone buys in quick succession the higher everyone prices what they have, the first example is probably more realistic. Even at the second very low valuation all that would be happening is Mark spreading his wealth around to a ton of people to hold Bitcoin, and since the Bitcoin price would drop rapidly back to lower levels, it's not even worth it.
Now consider there are 17 million Bitcoin out there.
As a side note, this is why no one can 'buy out' Bitcoin. Even someone, even a government suiciding buying all the Bitcoin by inflating their nation's currency to the sky and forcing their entire economy to collapse, would only slightly dent the supply.
I also want to stress that this exact same thing happens in every single market if someone tries to buy a large volume all at once. It's not just a Bitcoin thing. If someone wanted 100,000 shares of Apple tomorrow the price would rise rapidly as well.

The Federal Reserve also hinted at lowering interest rates in July. This means more cheap money can flow into the economy. This devalues each dollar in existence (it happens all the time, every time someone takes out a loan). This means more people will have money to spend. This means they will want to hold onto that money value over time. This means they will invest into stocks and other means to secure their wealth. This means the most prudent people will invest in assets that appreciate over time against inflation, like stocks, gold... and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the ultimate place to store your value. As such, the more people understand this, the more people using Bitcoin. As Bitcoin only has ~17 million 'coins' in circulation, this means Bitcoin's price has to be very high and be sold on fractions-of-Bitcoin to meet the demand of everyone wanting a sound storage for their value. The more people that want to store their value in a currency that cannot be inflated, the more the price will rise.
By the way, all this is doing is showing you how weak the fiat currencies are *compared to Bitcoin*. Just like $1 USD is worth ~$1.30 Canadian. $12500 USD is worth 1 BTC.

As an exercise in understanding more what you're into, download Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.org and run it. Download the entire blockchain which is ~225GB of data. It will take a long time to download. When it's done, congrats, you're an active member of the network verifying transactions, and securing and strengthening all Bitcoins. From there, create an address using Bitcoin Core's built in wallet. Send your exchange-held Bitcoin to your new wallet, and watch as your local wallet now contains your Bitcoin.
That's your digital wallet, your cash. If your computer then instantly dies - you lose everything. If your computer lights on fire, boom, you lost it all. If you get hacked and someone copies off your wallet - yep you lost it all. But it's a good humbling experience to be fully in control of your destiny like that. From there, get hardware wallets, or encrypt your wallet, encrypt it again using third party file-software, rename the file to summerfun.jpg and email it to your mom with a nice note, saving it in the email cloud. Spread your encrypted wallet out a bit and make sure to never forget your passwords - or else, you lose everything. The file size is small, you can fit it on a thumb drive, you can print it out and store the paper-code in a safe deposit box, you can do whatever your imagination desires where you feel secure about it.
And when you ever need your Bitcoin again, just import your wallet back into Bitcoin Core and send the coins as you wish. Note: I would recommend not leaving your wallet on your computer - if left alone and someone got a hold of your computer or wallet (due to virus/hacking) and it was not encrypted and so on they could use your coins. So best to delete the wallet once you're done securing copies of it.
Some people get actual coins stamped with their keys or some nonsense. When you have full control of your coins you can secure it however you wish, but whatever you do, definitely secure it.
Keeping coins on an exchange is not a good long term plan. You're not really in control of those coins. At any time the government could come along and tell the exchange not to send you your coins *or else.* And it's unlikely the exchange will take the fall for you. As such the only way to be certain is to take the risk of securing your own keys in the way you feel is best. It's like having fiat cash in your physical wallet - someone could steal it, but it's pretty powerful at facilitating a transaction and no one can really prevent you from using it.

Referral links get stored as cookies on your computer and can sometimes last up to 30 days, or more.
So likely your browser history was not cleared between when you were checking out Bitcoin and the when you finally signed up on Coinbase.
No issue really. I tend to use Incognito mode any time I'm signing up for stuff - not because I don't want to support someone who helped me, but because there's a good chance some spam cookie landed and it would go to them instead of the person who offered advice on their own website.

This isn't correct, at all.
If you will never change your job, never make more money, and have zero changes in your life for the next 20-30 years, then a timeshare might be a break-even investment if you take a trip at the exact same time every single year and are consistent.
If instead you invest that $50,000 down payment and $400/month 'maintenance fee' into literally anything (hopefully Bitcoin) you would end up making money on your investment to pay for your vacations.
In addition, if you simply took that $50,000 and had 10x years of spending $5000 per vacation each year, you'd save the $48,000 in maintenance fees for those 10 years too! Meaning you could take 10x $10,000 vacations!
Remember timeshares generally only cover your hotel stay. You can vacation for a whole month on a cruise liner for $5000 and get food included and all the entertainment and everything else.
Timeshare is complete garbage no matter what. The flexibility of keeping your own money is better.

Ah yes then in that case you're relatively fine. Your keys are secured by the code words, and those code words are basically your keys, so you need to never forget them and make sure you have them written down in more than one location, not just on some notepad in your office or on a single file on your one computer. Have backups off-site. Store the code words in a text file and encrypt the file and throw it in a zip-file using 7zip and email that zip file renamed as 'summerpics.jpg' to your mom so your words are secure in the cloud and so on and so forth.
I can tell you over time you tend to forget things, and life happens and you move and so on, so having your keys secured in more than one location is extremely important.

It's kind of complex. You should look up how inflation works. You don't notice the inflation year after year by design. Only when you look back do you remember what things used to cost.

Read the longer posts in my comment history, I talk about this a lot.
You don't own Bitcoins with Robinhood so just sell for USD and have them send the funds to your bank account. From there use Coinbase to buy back in and use Coinbase to send Bitcoin to your secured wallet.
I recommend Bitcoin Core wallet because I like having full control of my keys. Again see my longer posts in my history - lots of good long detailed information. Backup that wallet and secure it with a password (through the software) and send all your Bitcoin to your receiving address. Then you're good and in full control and actually own Bitcoin. It's free and you get a lot more knowledge of how all this works.

I also just noticed/read your link. It's your own post.
Your apple analogy is incorrect. There is more value of the apple in the store, because some human took the time to bring it there. This idea is drained from our monetary system completely by design and most people don't appreciate the logistics that go into the apple reaching the grocery store at your convenience. You're not supposed to realize the work effort that goes into things. You're just supposed to spend your money and move on and live your life.
I do like your idea of assigning a value to each 'thing' in the world, except that we cannot really do this on human-scales. Meaning, I cannot tell if an item is 1 trillion atoms or 2 trillion atoms on the fly. We do need something we can relate to. There's also the issue of what happens when a smaller unit of measurement comes to exist and when robots replace 99% of all the required human work effort for life.
As such, the arbitrary, abstract idea of a token of exchange between two people for human work effort is ideal, and Bitcoin solves the problem very well if not perfectly. It gives us this imaginary token which we can use very effectively and have solid trust in its use and future use cases.
I do like the thinking of assigning thermodynamic value to things, but I am 100% certain that level of detail will only be achieved by AI.

Gold has been around 5000+ years. Bitcoin only 10 years. Give it time bro. The argument, "~19k down to ~3k in a year," holds no water considering the timeframe. The value of $1,000,000 USD in 100 years is now $40,000 (96% value lost).
Just like the **gold backed US dollar** got replaced by the fiat dollar, I do admit that Bitcoin could have some other, more powerful cryptocurrency (not weaker like the fiat dollar replacing the gold backed one) come to exist that slowly, over time, begins edging out Bitcoin and everyone begins using the new crypto. It would NOT cause an overnight destruction of Bitcoin value. It would have to go through the exact same trials and tribulations that Bitcoin is going through.
If anyone (and many did) thought the gold backed US dollar would never be simply decreed by a President that the dollar would no longer be backed by gold and all dollars were now fiat - they were dumb. So I am open to the possibility, except the great thing is no one can come along and swing an axe on Bitcoin and replace it. It would have to meet all the same criteria as Bitcoin plus something we don't know about yet (giving it MORE value, unlike the fiat dollar which gave the dollar LESS value), and one of those criteria/features is Bitcoin is democratic. It is only as powerful as those who run the nodes and secure the network with computers.
Bitcoin is not just great on paper, it's created an entire sector of the economy and uncounted jobs and new technology. Just go to any news website's financial section and look at the link that says "Cryptocurrency". They don't even list "foreign currency exchanges" on the front page. Meaning it's bigger and more important than foreign currency exchanges.
The volatility is good for Bitcoin because it gets people a piece of the pie, so to speak. The uncertainty is the same as if you dropped 1,000,000 gold coins on a population that never knew what gold was and never knew what its value was. People would be trading those gold coins in the early days 1,000 for a loaf of bread. Eventually as more people sell and buy the true value comes to bear as the currency spreads out over the entirety of the population.
Currency is nothing new and these cycles are historical and easy to understand. Bitcoin is a new currency with the benefit being no one can remove it as the backing for a fiat dollar. No one can control it. The whole point about volatility is that the sellers who are selling now instead of $100,000 in a few years lose out! If they knew where it would be they would just hold. Eventually people will notice the trend and stop trading it for less than its worth. Just like people who bought bread for 1,000 gold coins (for example, btw) look back and say 'wtf did I do'. Eventually the market settles on the valuation and people begin trading for the more stable value.
The whole point is that people who do not know its value are scared and over time when it smooths out everyone will wish they got into it. Just like those who wish they held their 1,000 gold coins instead of spending it for a small vacation wish they held their gold. The market will decide the value over time regardless of who thinks it is a good idea or not.

Long term bad news is transaction fees need to cover the miners' cost of operation or else some miners "go out of business" and stop mining. This isn't too bad if it's not a huge drop, but if enough miners drop out because the fees don't cover costs, then the network loses strength, because there's not as much hashrate behind it. So it's more vulnerable to 'attack'.
The good news is that won't happen until well after 2140 if at all, so we have over 100 years to figure that out. And by that time, the price of Bitcoin should be high enough where a few satoshi covers the fee.
Just random speculation for fun:
If 1 BTC is $10k right now but the miner gets 12.5 BTC as well right now, a pool that solves a block gets $135,000 in value. That $135,000 has to cover expenses, but some miners do mine at a loss for the BTC alone, but let's say that's not the case.
So the value to a miner right now is that they get some portion of the block that is mined, and that block is $135k. All things being equal come 2140, meaning same difficulty and hash rate and power consumption and economy, the transaction fees need to add up to $135k to remain in business and/or profit. As such, if the number of transactions per block remain static at ~3500, each transaction would cost $38.5 if each block was filled entirely, give or take.
Again, this isn't required, but to keep all things the same it would be. Since a lot will change between now and then, this isn't too much of a concern. A wire transfer right now costs a good $40 on your end and $10-15 on the receiver end.
And this is very far into the future to be a major issue for most people, and of course, some miners will operate much more efficiently over time (solar would cut their costs down tremendously) and so on.

Depends on some factors like if you have family to support and so on.
As you're closer to older age you can't risk the timeframe involved of waiting if Bitcoin stays low for a long time. It wouldn't be good, for example, going all in with Bitcoin at 55 or 65, because if it completely fails, you'd have to go get a job to work for your income again, and you don't have many job options. At the point you know it would be too difficult to continue living starting from zero in your bank account is too old to invest everything. At that point you diversify.
Anyone sub-40 should probably go all in though.

This isn't the case. Not many people have the fortitude to hodl. You can visit any exchange to see this is the case. People constantly are buying and selling at where they think value is.
There is no guarantee that you can cash out of gold either. If it loses its place as a store of value over time, buying now would mean you lost value over time. Gold works the same way regarding cashing out. People cashed out of gold when it was $1900/oz, and the people at the end when it's now $1400/oz are left holding the (heavy) bags, according to you.
The reality is many people have different timeframes and holding gold for 50 years might be overall an ok idea, if you trust that its store of value will increase over time. I don't think gold will increase in value over time myself. I do not know anyone who is not over 50 who ever thinks about owning gold. So it will take a while for Bitcoin to take root. Slow is just fine like any store of value.
I agree doing work and having your own company is the most guaranteed way to build wealth. If after you work your balls off for 5-10 years and you have $1 million in the bank free and clear, full profits... You then have to ask yourself... what will that $1 million get you in 10, 20 years from now? The fiat answer is in 10-20 years that $1 million might only buy you $800,000 worth of value, if that. That's assuming the USD fiat currency lasts another 20 years without being on a gold standard.
So in the end you will either let the government steal your labor through inflation, or you will store the value somewhere. Bitcoin happens to be the only untouchable place to store value (besides some altcoins, which have less hash power behind them). So as a store for value, there is only Bitcoin. Or gold. Buy gold I hear it is rising in value.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:23:45
121 years to go before that happens.
But as the Bitcoin reward goes down, mining relies heavier on transaction fees, and less Bitcoin in 'production' means less supply, while demand is going up, so that means price goes up, which means miners stay in business just enough off the fees, and so on.
The last block, should anyone here be around to see it 121 years from now, would likely not bother Bitcoin a bit by that time. It would be business as usual and a nice highlight in the news.

This was one thing I did not take into account when I placed my original valuation of Bitcoin at $10,000 USD back in the very early days. The massive amount of debt is kind of like currency in circulation, but it's just not circulating. It's like a huge behemoth, the submerged portion of a glacier, in terms of where Bitcoin should be valued. People want to get their money from their debtors but often can't, and that pressure is something I did not account for back then. Not sure the exact way it changes my valuation but definitely way way up. We have nearly 10x the debt as the currency in circulation.
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:15:33
I'll have to look into this more. Still, the value of a freshly minted Bitcoin has to be worth something. Down the line, someone will probably pay a premium to exchange their dirty, 50-thousand-transaction-history Bitcoin for a pure, straight from the miner Bitcoin with no other dirty transactions linked to it. Scarcity demands it. I love it. I want to mine pure coins.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:12:32
Yes as someone else mentioned it is possible if you can find up to 100,000 (or whatever his target) individuals willing to sell you a few BTC at current market value without using an exchange. If he got lucky and bought in increments of at least 5 BTC and averaged 10 BTC purchased, the costs are much lower and the market isn't affected much if at all and it would take a few months to make it happen but possible.
So yes it is doable. I wonder how many people are selling that volume outside of exchanges.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:45:18
A fake chain would be someone solving a block with transactions they maybe inserted that were incorrect. Since the rest of the hash power will confirm valid transactions at a rate faster than any one person can (in order to sign the block as valid you have to mine it with your ASIC miner which can only be done by guessing) if you create a fake block, unless you had ungodly amounts of hash power, you wouldn't be able to even sign that block in the first place.
Sometimes what happens is someone is working on a block and someone else around the world confirms the block, but the first node solves the block a couple minutes later before they got the update. Then it goes to the network - whichever 'solution' is picked up by the most nodes and confirmed by those nodes after the fact becomes the true blockchain. The person who solved the block later thought they had the right answer, and they did, and they were glad and thought they were rewarded, but the greater network ends up giving the mining reward to the first miner who solved it on the other side of the world, and completely disregards your entire 'fake' blockchain at that point.
Your block wasn't fake, it just wasn't first.
Keep in mind someone trying to fake a block would need to mine the block first to even try to get it into the system. A solo miner's chances are pretty low to mine a single block - and they'd need to mine every single block one after the other for a long chain faster than the rest of the network to even be considered valid for a little while. If the main, more powerful network ever surpasses the power of that one fake chain, the larger network wipes out all the transactions of that fake chain, keeping the ledger according to the consensus of which transactions were valid.
So you could be unlucky and create a 'fake' chain if your miner guesses the right number shortly after some other miner, more connected to more nodes, finds it. But the network resolves itself fairly quickly.
And finally the only thing you could really do is double-spend the bitcoin you already have in your control anyway, and only for a short while...
You'd have better chances at winning the lottery.

There is no forever, that is why you should know Bitcoin is next. Because even the USA tried gold coins, gold-backed dollars, fiat dollars, silver dollars. They tried a million things. Those who acknowledged those monetary systems before they became widespread profited.
You are completely right, I cannot ask everyone to HODL and the great part is not everyone will. I will continue to preach it with others here because it is a small amount of people who have the guts to do so. I promise 99/100 people don't hodl. That's a good, great, amazing thing though. The hodl crowd is just the ones who believe long term, just like the "HODL AMAZON STOCK" crowd was small in comparison to how many people bought and sold the stock over time. You see people who bought at $10k BTC thinking of selling at $12k BTC  and they should. They just don't have the insane mind to hodl.
Basically, imagine if you're in 1950 and you tell everyone, "Sell all your gold-backed dollars for gold! Hoard gold! Don't keep a single gold-backed dollar, it'll be the end of you!" Come 1971 and Nixon removes the gold-backed dollar and you're pretty happy now that you're sitting on 1000 ounces of gold instead of fake fiat dollars. You then keep telling people to hold their gold, it's gonna go up! But they don't listen. Eventually, it's year 2000+ and your gold is worth a nice investment. You've sold some over time and made out just fine, beating out most investments massively. Congrats. Very few people have what it takes and that's just natural.
I continue to tell people to hold because I want to be the person saying, "Sell fiat for gold now!" Just like everything, only a very small amount of people will listen, and that's good, natural, predictable, and obvious considering the current market. There are people who thought, at $10k/BTC, that it was the right time to sell, and they sold their 2-3 BTC for $20-30k. They feel good about it until the price goes up.
The person who hodls until Bitcoin achieves market stability are the ones who would have held gold way back when. The great part is Bitcoin moves faster than gold so the market value will achieve heights much faster, where we don't have to wait 50+ years to see a return. 10-20 years and we're all good.

USDC is Coinbase's stablecoin, basically means they have X number of coins and X number of dollars in their bank account for transacting. It's Coinbase's "bank" option, basically.
If Coinbase goes under, because it is a business, you would lose everything.
The most secure place is to keep it on the blockchain, and if you want to avoid government prying eyes, you would have to find a local cash seller. If that means you have to leave your country for a bit to do so, maybe that's time for a little trip yea?

Iran could instead just mine more gold, or invest in businesses, or force their people to create new technology. Having them sucking at the tit of the Bitcoin blockchain is actually funny. Iran's money is way less valuable than USD...
If Iran wanted to hurt the United States, they only need to do one single thing: adopt Bitcoin as their state currency. The first nation to say "We only accept Bitcoin" and throw out all fiat currency gives up their ability to steal the labor from their own nation's people, but would cause such a flood of currency to Bitcoin as people sees the first world government has adopted it, that everyone will pour USD into Bitcoin and the US government would soon have to follow suit.
I am not sure why no government has adopted Bitcoin. It's worth the risk for many of these countries to just say, "I'm tired of playing the central bankers' game."

There's actually not much FOMO (fear of missing out) I don't think. Not yet at least. Moving money takes time, and as for this week, Bitcoin hit over $10k last Friday, so the hype of where it could go is catching the eye of the early birds.

Do it yourself. Download Bitcoin Core, run it on your computer, and create a wallet. Then you can find some other wallets that might be more to your liking.
But if you do that step, you're part of the community, verifying transactions while the Bitcoin Core client is running. You don't need it running all the time, but it's a good way to have full control of everything to start out.
A wallet from an app or other thing is fine (although you have to trust they are legit, which most are, but still) but you would do well to inform yourself on what it is at the root first, in my opinion. You can do everything from the Bitcoin Core client but - it doesn't run on your phone and takes ~230GB of storage on your hard drive for the whole block chain. It's not for everyone but a good way to get a feel for it all.

Unless they hold long term.
If you sell $100,000 for a Tesla Model 3 right now - what would everyone's reaction be? The car is listed at $35,000 so if you sold $100,000 fiat paper dollars for it, people would look at you and say why the heck did you do that!?
Likewise, if you sell 0.100 BTC right now for $1100, in a few years people will be asking you, "Why the heck would you sell 0.100 BTC for $1100!?"
For most people it will be hard for them to make the association of selling their fiat currency but hopefully someone sees the point here.

Well, yes people manipulate all manner of things, Bitcoin is one of them.


The Fed hinted they will lower interest rates. This is very big. They're inflating the money supply. Gold jumped dramatically. Bitcoin is digital gold (and better than gold) so there's that. The more fiat money in the world the better Bitcoin performs.
You say:


So there's that too. The more people who know, want in regardless, because they know the long term value.
I have no issue with the system that allows people to exchange things based on what they value something at. There's no need for a third party to be the middleman. Some people will get burned, some will manipulate, and others will do well. There's no reason to be concerned as it is people making their own decisions. The market will solve any perceived problem like this in the long run.

Any stablecoin should be viewed with caution. I considered recently that Tether might be a system attempting to destroy Bitcoin's credibility. Any exchange that accepts Tether is basically trusting a China-based company to print money. As such if Tether one day flips the switch, prints tons of money, and then buys as much Bitcoin as possible from Tether-&gt;BTC trade markets, the Bitcoin price will go high, and the exchange will be sitting on millions or billions 'worth' of Tether, and then... Tether can just shut down, and not pay any claims, and go out of business completely. Walk away.
And the exchange is completely helpless to survive this.
Any exchange accepting a stablecoin is at risk I think. Not just the exchange - if this level of manipulation happens, it would affect the entire network.
Not sure a good solution besides simply having exchanges stop certain kinds of trades, like BTC/LTC and so on. An altcoin could become inflated/corrupted and then used to attack Bitcoin if a direct trade is possible.
I am not 100% sure on this, but thinking it over to try to figure it out.

Currency in circulation is what bnuttall mentioned ~$5 trillion in actual currency. Consider the USA has $1.4 trillion by itself in actual dollars and coins in circulation.
That's how I thought about it. If Bitcoin is a currency, then it should be relative to other currencies, right?
Yes. With one other thing - inflation and debt. The USA has $25 trillion in debt (money spent but not paid back) which means the USA needs $25 trillion in currency flow just to pay that off. World debt is much higher, like what $280 trillion? Debt stands for "currency that should have moved but didn't" basically, so if you add that all in to your decision on if Bitcoin is a good idea or not, and tack on a conservative 2% inflation per year for the next 10 years, then look at Bitcoin again.

Lastly just uninstall everything, clear all temporary folders, install the latest core and redownload. CCleaner is a program that could help clean out the computer (just be careful as bitcoin can store files in temp locations). Oh, you might also have an antivirus causing conflict too.

My short answer is definitely do it. You are probably young. You will deal with any issues if there is a downturn or something goes wrong with Bitcoin. Take the risk while you can - not many opportunities pop up with this kind of potential.
But know it is potential - not guaranteed. So only put in what you can hold and watch drop to literal zero if that scenario happens.
I try to tell new people to download the Bitcoin Core client and learn how it works before buying. You should not buy because "maybe it will do good in the future" even though that's just a fine reason to do so - you should be accumulating Bitcoin for the rest of your life because if it is what it purports to be, then eventually it will be something you buy food with and pay your bills with. That's why you'd want more - same reason you seek out money today. Just buying it now, it's cheap compared to where it will be in the future. It's like buying $100k for $10k.

You're right but consider the timeline. At some point that whale is going to (maybe) sell, right? At some point they're like "OK I worked my ass off buying and selling Bitcoin for 10 years, and now Bitcoin is worth X and I can just sell it all and live my life."
And then they sell. Market takes a hit, and then recovers, and the process continues. Eventually Bitcoin is spread out enough over billions of people where a 'dump' is 1 million satoshis and doesn't affect the total value much.
Or not. If they hold until they die they also increase the market value.
There is no downside to this only the emotional rollercoaster most people go through when they don't realize Bitcoin is a currency not a stock. There's no company behind it. There's no physical building or service offered. It's currency at the purest form.
Edit: I'd add that Jeff Bezos is worth many billions of dollars but he doesn't have billions of dollars in a bank account. He owns stock in his company which is worth that much if someone bought it all, all at once. If he dumped stock, people would begin to notice and the value would decrease and so on. If he sells 10,000 shares, he makes a big gain, and the stock price of Amazon goes down to compensate, and creeps back up slowly as more people now realize they can get the stock at a discount from the day previous. More numbers people are now owning more Amazon stock at this point. The one funny thing is that Amazon can fail as a business. As an idea, Bitcoin doesn't have a business behind it that can close its doors. It's run by millions of people worldwide all working together without having to think about it.

I mean, the entire USA can't put guns to the heads of a few thousand terrorists in Afghanistan, but you think it seems possible that 3 or more governments will all work together to put guns to the heads of millions of crypto-miners and force them to run computer software they don't want to run?
It's kind of funny to think about really. The other fun part is considering the economic output of these other countries - they'd need to buy so much hardware to do all this stuff themselves...
As governments ramp up threatening people for using currency - and if they threaten the network - you know what happens? The Bitcoin price goes way up, and more people buy mining hardware driving mining hardware prices up, making it less possible for governments to control more people.
I love thinking through all these what-ifs because it solidifies the strength of Bitcoin.

They say, "Our fiat money is now linked to Bitcoin!"
I know it sounds weird but currently they're saying, "Our fiat money is now backed by absolutely nothing!"
Fiat means money by decree. Just by them saying so. So they could just "say so" that it's backed by Bitcoin. They would then have to find the method to actually back up what they say or else they would be frauds. In finding that way, many people will ditch their paper money for Bitcoin. For example, if the government set up an office where you could exchange 1 fiat dollar for 1 satoshi. That would suit the needs and immediately peg their unit of currency to Bitcoin. Someone would come in, hand over their fiat dollar, and the exchange would transfer 0.00000001 BTC to the citizens' wallet address.


Nothing. The idea is that because it is easy to hold Bitcoin and transact with it, people will flock to get rid of their fiat. Everyone would exchange their fiat into the Bitcoin value. No one would risk the thought of the government having that ability anymore. So as more people demand the use of Bitcoin and more people use the actual Bitcoin the less reliance on fiat and eventually the government realizes it's too costly to print fiat and stops doing such things.


Human innovation solves every single problem we've encountered. Give it time.

I agree people will choose the easy thing - and they will get burned. Lots of people get burned every day with fiat. But at least now there's an option. Eventually people will find their way. It will take time and that's fine.
All stablecoins like Libra can provide some value, but there's more value in being able to confirm for yourself something transacted (or better yet, didn't transact) on the Bitcoin blockchain.
You could trust Facebook or a government, but you won't ever be sure (unless they use Bitcoin) if they're printing money or not.
I can be certain no one is printing Bitcoin. That's value is astronomical.

There's a big psychological barrier for people to buy something that previously had a high point. You seem to be buying the 'losing side' of the chart and it screws with the mind. That's why people who sold with a loss likely never get back in, no matter what it is. They just cut their loss.
I remember when Facebook was doing its IPO and I knew its value would rise, but life happens and you don't make moves when you should. The worst decision is when it rises and you still don't buy and you think you're "too late". That's the worst. You have to remember that all indicators show you were right, with your initial decision.
Bitcoin as an idea should be analyzed by anyone thinking of buying any. Does the idea check out to you? Does it seem like a good idea? If not, stay out. If you think there is value in the technology, then how much? That's your valuation. Go from there scooping up as much of that asset as possible until it hits your valuation, and go from there.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:06:43
Ignore that weak handed guy.
I have a bunch of long posts in my post history if you want some in-depth details. Basically you buy it - easy way is at an exchange like Coinbase - and then send it to your own wallet, be it a hardware wallet or software wallet. Congrats now you own Bitcoin. Then you can use it however you want, or store your wallet and just wait until time goes on and maybe something comes of this weird idea. Again check my post history for more details.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:45:06
We're not in a dip. Zoom out.
I have Bitcoin because I cannot invalidate the idea of a cryptographic store of value. I cannot find a hole in Bitcoin's idea. I am betting that now that the idea is out of the bag, no matter what, there will be cryptocurrency in the future, so I'm waiting for the day when I can use my cryptocurrency to buy a loaf of bread for 100 satoshi.
Buying Bitcoin is buying a future currency at a discount. It's like buying gold before everyone knows what it is worth.
You can buy and sell for a fiat profit - and this is amazingly good, so I don't shame anyone for selling. When you do this, someone else obtains some amount of Bitcoin. If you sell a full 1 BTC, there's someone out there who only bought 0.00013936 of it, and now they own something. The people who buy and sell hard are required to continue spreading out the adoption of the currency. If they were actually smart and everyone held, then adoption would be much slower. Thankfully, people who can hold are few and far between, and everyone's looking to make a fiat dollar today by buying and selling in short timelines. It's wonderfully natural.
Eventually it will stable out when the market value gets closer to true value.
Knowing this, the wild emotional swings of the market price is beautiful to me. It means people are fighting their own minds about the value of this thing. They're arguing to each other what the value should be. And while they argue, some new person comes in and scoops up just as much as they can afford, and adoption continues. If there is no fighting, and the price were flat-lined, there would be little attention, adoption would be slower, and no one would become emotionally invested.
tl;dr there is much fun to be had acknowledging the market price changes for what they really are. People fighting over what they think the value of Bitcoin is.

I don't know of any exchange or coin, including Tether, where you can obtain your fiat currency without them knowing who you are, unfortunately.
You would have to use a person who would give you cash for your Bitcoin I think.
I don't think any place will just take your stablecoin tokens and give you paper dollars without knowing who you are and potentially reporting on it.
I am not sure, maybe you can trade in your Tether tokens for cash, but I doubt it. They probably only operate in digital transfers of digital fiat money, and don't ever have actual cash on hand. I doubt they have a 'teller window' like a regular 'bank' basically.
The only way I can think of is finding a person who will pay cash.

Yeah sounds like a scammer. Good job keeping clear of it. You could try Craigslist and deal in cash in a public place.
Kind of makes me consider a 'safe' trading option, like for example dividing up the transfers into smaller safer amounts where if one person became fraudulent the other party only loses a small amount.
Like transferring 0.001 bitcoin at a time.
Would be weird but I think there is some efficient math solution to this kind of problem.

I agree, that's why I put it in 'quotes' but yeah, one has to live with their decisions.

Not that I wouldn't have done it, but real life issues side tracked me and took all my mental power at the time. So it taught me where I'm not going to ignore my opportunities no matter what they are in the future.

Well, if a government decides to link their fiat to the value of Bitcoin, they force themselves to deal in a more honest way that leads to them eventually abandoning fiat and relying on crypto for their entire money supply moving forward. It would take time, but by backing their fiat, pegging it to Bitcoin, they become early adopters in the future economic system. The first ones doing something are often profitable and have a lot of influence. But while their population adjusts to sound money, they will not have the ability to steal labor from their citizens, so they lose global power, which could lead to invasion as the central banks don't like it when governments don't use their fiat.
But if they did this and succeeded, eventually everyone would trade in their fiat for Bitcoin and their country would adopt all the technology to transact it and become much more advanced without the headache of all the problems that come with manipulating your population. Down the line, as that population interacts with the rest of the world, more and more people will demand payment in Bitcoin and adoption rate increases dramatically.


Mainly because there would be a Bitcoin oil millionaire in Iran who wanted to buy a product in another country and he would want to buy it in Bitcoin. I think you can quickly see how soon transactions would be adopted. If someone came to you and wanted to buy a product from you for 100 Bitcoin, you'd bend over backwards to accommodate that request. And then you might continue to pressure your government to begin accepting it and so on. The rate of adoption would increase much faster after the first government begins using Bitcoin.


Well... the thing is Bitcoin will eventually make all this happen. Adopting it now just speeds up that rate of adoption, and forces other governments into it sooner... But, if central banks don't like it, they probably invade and take over anyway. So it's a lose-lose I think. Continue using the central banking fiat system of stealing your citizens' labor, or adopt a more pure system of money and become weak and potentially be invaded and succumb to the will of those foreigners anyway.
I'd take the risk, but I'm a risk taker and not a corrupt government official who relies on the stealing of labor to pay my salary.

There's over a thousand altcoins, that's what people are mainly referring to. Litecoin is similar to Bitcoin using the same tech but slightly different. It, like every other crypto, basically follows in the wake of Bitcoin, so why not just use Bitcoin? That's all. The reasons to use the other cryptos are sometimes valid, but that's up to you to decide what the purpose is. As a currency, the one factor making Bitcoin stand apart is the amount of processing power behind it - the hashrate. That's the biggest indicator of strength for any crypto.

Do some research. The Fed hinted at lowering interest rates - this is good for Bitcoin and gold. Facebook said the word "cryptocurrency" - this is good for Bitcoin. This current market is on the weekend, so those who want in now might not be able to because their bank needs a 'business day' to do stuff.
The great thing is it's completely on you to decide when to get in and when to get out (if at all). Just do lots of research/watch news/keep your eyes open.
If you can help it, just hold, and if you ever need to dip into your Bitcoin, use it regardless of value at the time. Eventually the entire world will adopt cryptocurrency as the standard - and remember Facebook just said that basically, reinforcing the idea - so... a fall? You decide.
If I had anything left to buy with I'd buy more :) If you think Bitcoin could ever in its history be equal to the valuation of gold, then Bitcoin would be ~$380k per Bitcoin. That's just if it holds value as well as gold, which, since you can transfer and spend Bitcoin around the world, it's probably better (and cannot be manipulated by governments as easy as gold). 
Make a personal valuation and go from there. I valued Bitcoin at $10k back when it was $100 per. I was right in the sense it surpassed my valuation, but actually quite wrong because I never factored in assets or debt and how that plays into valuations... At the very least my personal valuation kept me in line during any downturns.

Transaction fees.
Currently for each block there is, roughly 1 full BTC worth of transaction fees. So each block has an extra ~$10k (currently) tagged right on top of it as a bounty for mining the block.

There is such thing as a sure thing.
If you had the ability to wrap your head around what the internet would deliver, it was a sure thing. The idea was not something people would dismiss. A cryptocurrency is in the same bracket. It is an idea that if you consider it long term is a sure thing. There's no way you can make the argument that we do not need a currency which has all the features of Bitcoin going into the future. Any argument against it fails when you add, "Just trust the banks/government."

Not correct. The defendant would be ruled against; judge would rule in your favor (you win cost+fees). Then you could use that to garnish their bank account to recover the money.
This is because when you sign the paperwork, you have to 'serve' the defendant - have either a person hand-deliver the document (not you) or certified-mail it to them (where they have to sign receipt).
In other words, they got the notice to appear, but didn't, so the judge rules in your favor.
Then it's just difficult to get your money - but you can with legal order take money directly out of their accounts or even place a lien on their assets with the court order. You can and would eventually get your money.
The only way the defendant stops that is by showing up and proving how they don't owe you that money in the first place. If the judge says yeah, they didn't owe you anything, you have to pay the defendant court fees and what not.

I upvoted because you're right. Every time someone new comes into power they want to finally be able to spend the government's money! And then they print more of it. No matter the country. Venezuela is a good example. So if you live anywhere unstable, Bitcoin is probably less volatile than what could possibly happen to your own currency. In addition, even the USA has swings of the dollar's value and that affects everything else.

You don't have to run a node but yeah, just an idea. Bitcoin Core just creates a wallet for you - a cryptographic key that only you have - and you can get a receive address and then just store that wallet securely and send stuff to that receive address. You don't have to run the full node - keep it in mind for the long term to help secure the network though. Such a thing goes under-appreciated by normal users.

When you use a bank, you pay them a) inflation b) fees per month if you don't have a certain balance c) user information and credit information they sell on certain markets and d) every time you use your debit or credit card the business you deal with pays a 2-3% fee to the bank or payment processor meaning they charge you more for the cost of the goods/services anyway.
It is odd for people to realize that they're dealing with digital cash with Bitcoin and to pay a small fee to move their funds when the banks are so good at pretending you're not paying those fees. By using Bitcoin, you are your own bank, so you have an incentive to yes pay a very nominal fee to get your money to move, to support the network and make it happen. Using a lower fee only slows down when the transaction is written into the blockchain, but it will eventually populate.
Yes, you need to control your Bitcoin in your own secure wallet. Do not hold them on an exchange.
I think Coinbase keeps your ID information for however long they are required, which is probably a long time.

I agree. I keep the idea much more down to Earth: every year there are millions more humans reaching adult age who are able to share in the workload of the human population. The value then of a unit of currency should rise, as more people are willing to do more work to obtain that currency. Instead, fiat steals what should be the "2x out" that you mention due to inflation, by printing more money. Instead of your money gaining value over time, the fiat governments and bankers get that value.

No, I don't think you understand, Bitcoin isn't backed by anything because it is the defacto best thing to ever back anything else. It's like saying, "Gold isn't backed by anything." Gold isn't backed by anything. It's a metal that looks yellow and is pretty stable but isn't really good at anything else.
The point of it not being backed by anything is no one can take it away, devalue it, or change its properties. It is what it is. It is a root currency.

Not really. The wallet private keys are stored on the Nano and so you sign messages through the device to send payments. You do not need to touch it to receive payments.
If the device stops working, they have you write down code words when you first set up the device. Those code words can be used by anyone to restore your wallet, so those words are the things you secure, either by keeping them in a safe deposit box, or figuring out some complex but easy to remember way to recover them should your device ever fail.
The device always has a pin to protect it, and locks after a certain number of incorrect attempts.


No... lol... paper wallet is for weird people.
I try to tell people to download and run Bitcoin Core and make their own software wallet and secure it. Encrypt it, back it up, rename it, and copy it onto a few different locations. Store the file on different types of media and always remember your encryption password and where you have stored the wallet file. You can email it to your Mom for example after renaming it to 'Summerfun.jpg' and then your email provider is storing it on the cloud hidden in plain sight. Bitcoin Core is free and if you run the software fully (~230GB blockchain data) you become a node, confirming new transactions and being a 'good citizen' of the network.
With all these methods, yes you can go to Blockchain explorer and view your wallet and see the funds. You can always receive to an address - you only need the wallet active to send funds out from that address. Such is the magic of cryptocurrency.
So if you set up a wallet with any of these methods you would have a receiving address and that is all you need to dump Bitcoin into it, and can view all transactions and balance on the blockchain.
The number one thing is being able to access that wallet when the time is right. Hardware wallets give you the convenience of having the ability to send your Bitcoin a bit faster than if you stored your wallet in a safe deposit box or something. Again, whatever you do, make sure you have more than one way to recover the wallet. If you lose your keys you lose everything. And again, hardware wallet gives you those recovery code words... but eh... I like the control I have over my own software wallet.
And never keep a software wallet live on your computer! Always delete your wallet from your computer when not in use, and even better, only use a secure environment to access a software wallet (such as a virtual machine or even an older clean-installed computer and so on).

It was only in 1971 - under 50 years ago - that a US President stood in front of the American people and said, "we're no longer backing the dollar with gold." Consider who made him say that and the motivation behind it. To think that such events - drastic events that slice your life savings in half - can happen again... I'll trust the math.

Sorry if I use your post for something else but I never really thought about stablecoins much. Sounded irrelevant to peg a currency token to fiat currency since all you were doing is ... well... holding any modern bank account in existence.
Every bank account from any modern bank is in effect a stablecoin.
So I'd want to know how a stablecoin makes money. If I deposit $100,000 to Tether for 100,000 Tether tokens, how does Tether make money?
Are they loaning it out? Are they charging a premium for amounts purchased?
Oh and you can only buy in if you have $100,000 to throw down, edging out 95% of the people who would use it?
So the wise "big money" investor is going to pay a fee so Tether can make money to issue these contracts so that the "big money" investor can then buy crypto?
I'd love if someone informed me on Tether more because I have just ignored it and now the more I think about it I can only assume it is a bank-backed fiat scam to infiltrate the crypto market without having to inflate native currency to do so.
To use Tether is to assume that they are not lying to you when they list their "reserves" on their website. They say the have X number of "fiat" in their reserves, but it could be more or less and you just have to trust them unless they use yet another party to verify their holdings at a bank or elsewhere. In other words, if they livestreamed someone checking their reserve account held in a "Wells Fargo" account then you'd have some idea that they're not lying to you. But if the reserves are just currency held in any fiat way, if they have pallets of cash in a vault, or if they simply have a bank account that says, "Look here it says I have X number of fiat dollars so that must make it so!" Any of that and it's garbage!
I can see Coinbase's USDC because it's the exact same as if they put a number in your account. If they put $1 USDC or $1 USD in your account, they're still holding it for you, so it doesn't matter either way. Plus they're on the line for those funds - someone who deposits $1 into Coinbase should increase USDC total volume by $1 (although I haven't looked it up). Because that's how it works in regular fiat banking anyway. Just like if you have an account with any business and they say, "We owe you $30," they are 'holding $30 in reserve for you.'
If the business goes under the $30 is not something you can get back.

I think the Federal Reserve indicating that they will lower interest rates - which means more cheap fiat money in the market - means stock prices should rise and people seeking out sound money will find Bitcoin and finally believe in it this time.

Download Bitcoin Core client, run it, download the entire (huge ~230GB) blockchain. Then create a receive address for yourself on your own computer on your own fully controlled wallet, and then send your Robinhood Bitcoin to your own address.
You will feel weird having this $100 valued thing on your computer that could be lost at any time if the wallet gets deleted or if someone steals the wallet or if your computer explodes at that moment...
Then you'll feel empowered when you back up your wallet with encrypted copies and put them on thumb drives and secure the wallet however you want.
You can then delete the wallet from your computer, knowing you have backups, and send any BTC to that wallet at any time in the future to store it securely (without having to re-load the wallet or interact with it any way, you'll just know BTC lands there by watching the blockchain).
If you ever want to spend it, then you'll have to restore the wallet to your computer and transfer some BTC to either an app or the person you're buying from.
This will get you into it and the feeling of having your own wallet is huge and you get to download the massive blockchain and get a feel for all the work behind it.

Also the 'keys' are information and just like a physical object as a key, a key in your mind can decay. Worse than a vault which can be broken open in the worst case scenario, a lost key is unable to be recovered with Bitcoin outside of key words, which is basically just the same thing anyway.
So if you do plan to leave anything to family 20-30 years from now just keep that one fact in mind - it is almost impossible to keep something for 20-30 years, and information decays. So have a really good plan for maintaining that information. You don't want your heirs opening up a box and finding a melted plastic USB stick and some cob webs.

An unconfirmed transaction means there's a transaction out there, but it hasn't been mined into the blockchain yet. As there's a lot of activity right now, it could take a while, but the fees are in order so a miner definitely wants to mine your transaction into their block. But they're back logged. Depending on where the sender is located it could take a bit for a miner to pick it up depending on distance.
If your address is the receiving address and you know it is, then all there is to do is wait.
Waiting is part of it. I had a good discussion earlier where someone said current fiat transactions happen instantly, and I had to inform them that fiat transactions (non-cash) usually take a full day to process through all the settlement layers. Bitcoin is like being your own bank - you have to wait for the transaction to be confirmed by everyone.
Oh this is also a good time to remind you that you can help the entire network by downloading and running Bitcoin Core and running a full node on your computer to help make these transactions happen (by relaying them to miners) and to be part of the network that verifies them.

I was thinking of this recently. There will eventually be a market for pure mined coins with a high premium. Coins that you'd pay 30% fee to obtain. Think of someone buying $7000 worth of mint Bitcoin for $10000, either due to wanting the pure stuff or illegal activities or novelty. There will be scarcity within scarcity, just like certain gold jewelry is worth more than others with the same weight. Makes me want to get back to mining.

I agree, but that doesn't matter right now. All that matters right now is verifiable activity. We have more of that verifiable activity every day now.
Basically, if someone wanted 5000 Bitcoins right this moment... they wouldn't buy it all at once. They might deal with people off the market, and some of these exchanges, if not all, allow transactions not on the market for sufficient volume, so big orders could be made that don't affect the market price.
The market price is what all the random, day to day, everyday people want to buy and sell for. When you see video of the NYSE floor, is it well-to-do people sitting around drinking tea? No it is hard-working people sweating their ass off. And who rings the bell? Well, the exchange, of course!
The traders are the people's outlet, the exchange is the whale's outlet. But the people set the price overall in small trades throughout the day, because well, value is determined by what two people want to exchange for. Money is the representation of human work effort - human labor. So everyone who values anything is basically saying, "Yes, I agree that I would do a certain level of work effort for this thing you have." Currency is there to facilitate that trade.

If this happens while Bitcoin is volatile, then you suck it up and sell for the 'low' value of Bitcoin to buy your car - though much better to just take out a loan though since interest rates continue to be pushed lower to stave off the collapse of the financial world.
But if you really had to you would just sell however much Bitcoin you needed to buy the car, at whatever the current value, continue to work and continue to buy back what Bitcoin you spent.
Over time Bitcoin's volatility will taper off until it is around as stable as any other government's currency. The only times it will spike up and down is when governments make bad monetary policy. If for example the government says USD will now be backed by gold again, Bitcoin will drop in price a little bit. If they continue lowering interest rates and continue printing money, Bitcoin will rise. Which one is more likely?
Eventually you will be buying your cars and everything directly with Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. Period. That's the long game for people who understand what Bitcoin is. It's not about 'selling it to make a buck' - not that there is anything wrong with it.
I love the arguments that people in Bitcoin are just looking for someone else to come along and buy it at a higher price.
What the hell do those people think stocks do? Someone ponies up $10,000 thinking Amazon will perform better in 10 years. If it does, then they make money doing nothing just waiting to see if someone else will come along and buy it at a higher price. If not, they lose money. That's how stocks and even world currencies work!
The store of value is your trust in Amazon stock to do well over time. Nothing is guaranteed. Amazon will have lower volatility right now because it has been almost 20 years since it started to trade, but in the beginning it was very volatile and people lost their life savings on it (if they made the bad call to sell when it was down) same as any other stock or risk or activity.
"If Amazon is low in 10 years, too bad for you. You are not going to be happy with your "store of value" at that point."
Same thing.

If somehow the thief managed to exchange her bank account funds for Bitcoin and never was able to transfer the funds off the exchange account, then you can maybe contact the exchange, but most likely the thief bought as much bitcoin and then sent it to another wallet/address and it's completely, 100% gone.

I hadn't compared the idea until you mentioned it actually, but yes. With a traditional company you are always facing the idea "they can't really get any better" and they must always fight to release a new product or offering to secure more market share. Or to deal with an upcoming competition.
Bitcoin is different and I continue to think of it like a currency and not a stock. The one indicator for Bitcoin is the hashrate - if the hashrate is strong, then that means more people are backing up the idea with more computers and more processing power. They bought mining machines to get to that processing power after all. They put their labor and time and money behind it.
Bitcoin doesn't have to have a new offering or cool new product release to stay relevant and technically the only ceiling is the level of adoption by people. Currency is always relevant. If there are a billion people who want Bitcoin, and there are only ~17 million in circulation, there is scarcity - but people can buy in fractional amounts if they wish, unlike many stocks. So getting your hands on enough Bitcoin for the value you want to spend in the Bitcoin marketplace is always possible or should always be possible.
I've told a few people how they should know to stick with Bitcoin and there is really only one answer - the hash rate. At least, if you understand Proof of Work and what it means. As such, the only time to be skeptical of Bitcoin versus something else is if the hash rate drops and begins to push up on another cryptocurrency. If that happens, then people would begin transferring funds out of Bitcoin into that new cryptocurrency (which, in order to take any market share from Bitcoin, necessarily has to do something Bitcoin cannot do or has some feature Bitcoin does not have, which I myself cannot find such a case, because if I could find a case, I could make a better currency and be rich, but I to date cannot think of something extra to add to make Bitcoin better, so it's still  and I'm but a participant). If people do begin transferring hash rate into a new crypto then you'd have to look at the technology and see if it is better, which as I said, is unlikely, but if it is better then again, the market would move over to that new tech slowly and the net result would be the same - a cryptocurrency. In other words, the idea is solid either way. The idea, and the technology, is not going anywhere, one form or the other.

If you do not have a secured Bitcoin wallet you do not own Bitcoin, nor are you in Bitcoin. If you cannot send Bitcoin from Robinhood to your personal wallet, then you are not buying Bitcoin. You are only betting on the price of Bitcoin from a centralized company who might not even hold Bitcoin for you each time you buy/sell. It would be like an exchange that never, ever, sends you Bitcoin. It would be like buying a stock where the broker never, ever, actually sends you a stock certificate.
It's just betting on price with no way to walk away with your Bitcoin to another exchange or wallet. You must always sell back into their network. It's like a casino where you buy chips and then can't use those chips anywhere else. You never own the chips and you can't leave with the chips, and the chips don't even exist.
@_date: 2019-06-20 06:36:29
The future price aspect is indeed not what Bitcoin is about. It is, however, a good goal for all the people who are emotionally invested in Bitcoin to look forward to.
There are thousands of Bitcoins traded around the world every hour. The few here talking about price are the minority at this point. Everyone else is doing business. Facebook stock entered at ~$30 and is now $180 - that is a 6x return on your initial investment and is something people who believed in Facebook at the very start should be proud of and talk about - how they multiplied their investment - and talk about the future if the price will rise or lower.
The great thing about Bitcoin is it is a currency. It is a representation of human work effort. Because governments constantly devalue human work effort through forced inflation, Bitcoin's rise in price is a rise in the power of the people against that system which robs them of their labor.
If governments constantly inflate their money and steal labor from their citizens and Bitcoin's price does not rise, then there is a problem. The price is a good indication of how corrupt the government is; more specifically, how many people know how corrupt the government is. The higher the Bitcoin price, the more people who understand how the government steals from them every single day.
If 50 years ago you hoarded your life savings of $10,000 USD under your bed... at the time, you were rich. Over time, because you stuck that cash under your bed, here comes 2019 and your $10,000 can't even buy you a nice used car. The reason this happened is because the Fed forced inflation to cover the cost of their printing money. The net result is the theft of human work effort. Again, all done to control the population and to give the connected central bankers unlimited income. Bitcoin counters all that directly.
Eventually all the governments will be shown to be massively corrupt and in those times, Bitcoin's price will be off the chart as everyone asks what option do they have. I read a post here or somewhere here recently about some foreign government (Venezuela?) which basically took 2/3rd of their citizens' bank deposits. In the USA, at some point some politician came along and said, "LOL hey citizens we just decided to not back dollars with gold anymore laterz."
They can do that again, any time.
If war breaks out, the government can just print money to pay for the labor of all the people who will fight the war for them. They have done it before, they can do it any time. It will inflate the currency, but by the time people notice, their labor was already stolen, and those who spent the money first profited the most.
Bitcoin is, so far, the best way to hedge against such a thing happening to you, personally. Fiat money is dead to those who understand what is going on. People who are trading aren't trading to get more fiat money, they're trading to get more Bitcoin. And those who are hodling aren't doing so because they want to sell when the price hits $20k, they're hodling because when it's time, they won't have to sell at all.
The rising price is just confirmation that we were all right about the whole thing this whole time. It's great to talk about being right.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:47:03
Not possible.
I know you said you didn't think these things were doable but let's discuss:
A change to the 310594th block would invalidate every single future block and force them all to be re-mined which takes lots of time.
Double-spend is fixed by simply invalidating the shortest chain. Governments would have to achieve 51% power continuously for all time and they would only be able to double-spend from accounts they control anyway. If anyone finds a double-spend arrangement, new software would develop, Bitcoin would hard-fork and everyone would swap to the new system.
As to your concern:
Anyone who runs the node software becomes a node, so if they you know, set up millions of computers all over the world, and controlled all the hash power at the same time, then yeah maybe they could do what you suggest.
Again it's possible for someone to rewrite the current open source Bitcoin software and do whatever they want. The only thing that matters is the democratic way Bitcoin works - the nodes say which is the correct software, the correct system. So if they for example captured all the nodes and ran different software, everyone else would just need to change software to a new blockchain fork and now 100% of this new fork are uncompromised nodes and the government would have to do the process of creating millions of nodes and miners all over again. All nodes agree on everything that happens so the moment there is a change, there's trouble and the network reacts and everyone changes over. If for example there was any change to the way blocks were validated, your node would receive a faulty block and ignore it, and if this happened a lot everyone who is legitimate would notice and begin making plans to switch to a new system.

@_date: 2019-06-26 19:24:56


You have no idea how the world works, let alone the universe, then. I'm sorry but you are completely, 100% factually wrong.
Your understanding of what makes money, money, is wrong. It is as the bankers designed - they want you to think it is about taking from others, so that you continue grinding away and donating your human work effort to their ideas and plans. Reading what you wrote is unfortunate especially here.
In order for you to gain money, you have to perform human work effort in exchange for that money. That human work effort is the true currency, the true value at the root of all currency. Money is just the convenient tokens we create to facilitate that transfer of human work effort.
This means as the population grows, there is more human work effort in the market, and thus the value of money should increase.
Money is never sacrificed either - someone exchanges it for goods or services at the value they think it is worth.
Most humans do get their basic needs reliably, you've just bought in to the idea that people can't fend for themselves, and that's incorrect.
So many more things are just off with what you are saying.
Focus on one thing. I said it in another post: Imagine you are in an isolated town with 1000 people and you are all self-sufficient able to produce everything you need to survive. You as a town decide that 10,000 tokens of currency will be created, no more, and you will use that to exchange the value of human work effort. With this closed system, everyone reaches an idea for the true value of their labor over time. Then consider this: the population rises as the town has children and so on. Now there are 2000 people doing relatively the same work as the initial 1000. What is money worth now? The value of money has gone up - there are more people who want this thing that has a fixed supply, and there are more people who are capable of doing all the jobs that require you to operate the town and be self-sufficient. If there are more people, able to share in the work to sustain the town - less work required per person - then the total value in the economy is doubled, and the currency is twice as valuable. What changed? Human work effort was added into the system.
That's all it comes down to. If you were the last person on Earth, you would have no value for any money at all. It's all to do with human work effort. No one ever loses to give you money unless you do not perform the amount of work effort that you have agreed to in exchange for that money. If that's the case, you need to increase your work ethic to be happy about your exchange of labor.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:01:09
The government didn't do anything - people did. Human labor. Human work effort created all this. The government in its attempt to flex geopolitical power found out that you can steal the work effort of your citizens to pay for your conquering of other nations. If you have 1 million people working for free, your country is more powerful than another country which cannot get 100,000 to work for free.
The USA is the most powerful nation because it has the most people willing to work for free! I hope you can wrap your head around that.
And this is NOT a bad thing, it's just a way for the government to flex power on the entire world. Life is so good in the USA people are happy to work for free. That economic output of all those people is bigger than nearly anywhere else.
Again, nothing wrong with it for what the world needs - lots of humans would waste their labor anyway - so having a government steal it is a net positive for humanity. There's no denying it. However they hold the monopoly on that (within their national borders i.e. within the Fed's influence), and Bitcoin restores some of the power back to the people who hold it. That's all. Bitcoin is the natural check function of the out of control theft of the people's labor.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:27:59
I think an important part of the story is that anyone can fork off their own chain if they really wanted to. New users need to know that this is part of the flexibility of Bitcoin. You could mine your very own coins and trade them among friends for fun. To the main fork they would have zero value unless you developed some special new thing that everyone liked. That's basically what many of the alt-coins are doing and is probably a necessary step very long term when space travel necessitates local exchanges that all reconcile with the main network. Right now it's just trying to make a buck and control their own coin. BCH was just a fork of the main Bitcoin, trying to do something different. Nothing wrong with it, but almost every attempt to do this is a long term failure/waste because it's not needed - yet.
And finally, Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone and was, at this point, not created by anyone. It's strength is completely on the users themselves and the network and the history of success. I think this point drives a lot of confidence in the network. There's no singular figure at the top who has an ego to serve.

Adopting Bitcoin for their fiat doesn't do anything for Bitcoin's transaction volume, it would just start making them go towards a currency that is not able to be manipulated as more and more people exchange fiat dollars for Bitcoin. I hope you can think about this a bit. Say Iran holds 10000 BTC. They'd just divide BTC by all their existing circulating fiat dollars.
Say they had I dunno, 1 trillion rial in circulation. So each rial could be redeemed for 1 satoshi if they held 10000 BTC. Then people could, over time, convert their rial into BTC by the government and begin using sound money.
This would force other governments to begin doing the same thing as people demand their currency be backed by something solid again. Because every country was forced off the gold standard by the USA. So they'd return to sound money, completely destroying every country's ability to steal from their citizens, making the power levels more equal.


Well... for the time that you begin this process, your nation becomes the weakest, because it's like saying you're dealing in gold again and no one accepts gold any more. But as more people (regular citizens) say they want to deal in gold too, because it's superior to all this printed money, then the rest of the world follows suit. And you're the early adopter of this new technology so your infrastructure becomes the shining example to the rest of the world.
It would be a hard move to make, but the best move to make, for any nation down on the world stage. Especially if you hated the western world and their ability to steal labor from all their citizens to dominate the world.

I'm not talking about making a $5 purchase - you'd probably cover those locally. I'm talking about selling 100 tons of gold for whatever the value is back on Earth. You contact your Earth broker and say you have 100 tons of gold and you want it sold at X price and you get it sold and sent to your wallet which happens to have the private key on Mars.
The delay is not an issue in these transactions. In this case, if you were concerned with the delay, you'd use an Earth broker to make the deal. If not, you'd not mind an hour confirmation. In the end, the fee charged is never going to be a problem compared to the size of exchanges Bitcoin will be handling.
Are you implying that with an hour to wait to see your transaction populate on the blockchain, that it is possible your transaction never happens?

I think that's the best way to secure yourself, because if you can come to the conclusion that I have, that a cryptocurrency is the future regardless of what anyone says, then you're more sound in hanging out when everything is volatile.
It is true, hodling and not trying to time the market *might* cost you, but trying to time the market could cost you too. So definitely try to time the market if its your job or if you think you can survive doing it and can keep emotions out of it. The people who play the market should, in the long run, always lose though. There will be that sell point where it looks like the price will drop and instead it goes up, and then you have to either stick with it, cut your losses and buy back in higher, and so on.
I don't think we're at the point where market players will lose - I think they're winning big - but in the long run, the more Bitcoin stabilizes the more people sell at $10k, wake up with BTC at $11k, and now what? What do they do? Buy back in! No way. And then it hits $12k and they're like WTF I should have bought back in!
Risk. Hodl is the ... safest option. Set a personal valuation and wait.

Everything you said is hedged against with Bitcoin. Bitcoin makes it where you cannot cheat and harm others indirectly. It means you cannot create money out of thin air. It means there's a system everyone can point to as being true throughout time.
Bitcoin is also collaborative. The reason it's strong is because so many people agree that it has value. When currency switches over to Bitcoin, greed and hoarding become irrelevant - if you want to live your life you will have to buy and sell labor using a fixed money supply to survive, giving the value a more pure value, completely tied to the labor of another human being as currency should be.
The only difference is it's only been 10 years and Bitcoin has proven to be successful. It might take 10-20-50 years for it to get to mass adoption. If 3 billion people use Bitcoin the average person only has a few Satoshi to their name to engage in real world trading. They only have 0.003 BTC to operate with and that is comfortable living. So if you're invested in the success of the currency now, there is 'profit' to be made, but all that is happening is the value of fiat currency is slowly being converted into Bitcoin value, of which there is a fixed supply.

Nor did I say the Fed was politically attached with the government. This shows how little you are paying attention to the argument. By lowering the interest rate, the Fed incentivizes people to borrow money from banks, who lend out money using the fractional reserve system creating money from debt. The net effect is more cheap money into the economy and the devaluation of everyone's money. Your argument seems to stem from the position of, "They do it all the time! They manipulate the economy all the time, it's for growth! Let them just keep manipulating the economy, surely they won't hyperinflate your money! They know what they are doing!"

I cannot imagine any country allowing Libra to exist honestly. It directly competes with the Fed. Unless the Fed links up and controls it. In which case not much changes - the Fed just causes more inflation over time anyway. The short term will affect Bitcoin's value in my opinion if Libra catches on as being very useful, convenient and mindless "crypto" transactions, but will stabilize Bitcoin value and not really hurt it. And stability will be good for Bitcoin, so it's a win-win, but it will kick out volatile traders and so on to do hit that stability. The end result is, still, astronomical, just less volatility getting there. This all assumes Libra even gets to exist as it wants to - a printed currency that reaches over 2 billion people seamlessly. Not even the Fed has been able to pull that off with all the resources in the world at their disposal and the war machine of the USA to hammer unwilling participants. Every country would have to say, "Yes go ahead and devalue my nation's currency so you can own our people and have control of our nation, Facebook."

**Robbingyou is a scam** because they are acting like a bank that has no actual Bitcoin in reserves and can shut down at any moment if there is a run on the bank. They are a private bank letting you bet on Bitcoin price. You own nothing but your bet hoping and praying that Robbingyou will actually make good on their promise to pay you back if you sell.
Even if they held Bitcoin in the amount you think they are - where is there wallet, first of all, and what is their receiving address that you verified Bitcoin at - since they control the keys, they control the Bitcoin, and at any moment they can say, "Yo this is a lot of Bitcoin let's just shut down and go to Jamaica!" and there's nothing you could do about it.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. That's the saying.
Coinbase owns your cash. They're like a bank in a way, holding onto your actual cash in their vault.
A wallet is just an address using Bitcoin's protocol, so there's many ways to do it. Hardware wallets and so on. Apps and so on. I don't know of good apps or easy solutions and I don't trust anyone else to handle anything as I like to do things myself.
If you like to have full control and want full control over your Bitcoin, download the Bitcoin Core software, run it and download the entire blockchain and become a node, create a wallet and a receiving address, back up your wallet (after encrypting it with the software), put that backup in very secure places and make sure you won't ever forget the password, and then finally, send Bitcoin from Coinbase to that address making 100% sure you entered the correct address.
Then in a few minutes, your Bitcoin Core wallet will update with the BTC. Then you have full control over your funds - you own your private keys and thus own your Bitcoin. You then delete that wallet from your computer and never have to load it up again unless you want to send BTC to someone else. Yet you can continue to send BTC to that address as you buy more in the future - it doesn't have to be online.
This is if you are holding as a primary strategy. If you need access to it more often, hardware wallets seem pretty good and involve a similar process of just sending from Coinbase to the address of your wallet.

Read this guy's post and then remember someone paid 10,000 whole Bitcoin for a pizza. As more people adopt Bitcoin, the numerical level of ownership will grow smaller. Most people in the future will only have a few thousand satoshi, and will consider their first 1000 satoshi an achievement.
So "the more that you can risk now, the better."
If you are young, under 30 or even under 40, go all in. If SHA256 is cracked next year, then we all lose all the value we've built this whole time (and the entire financial world will die too). But if you're young and only put in what you felt was worth risking, you have time to recover (even though the entire financial world would be on fire and everyone would be losing everything they had and the entire world would go to war.. anyway that scenario is not happening).

The more I think about Tether the more I realize it's a government backed attempt to debase crypto and you should not deal with any exchange that uses it.
Tether could 'create' unlimited tokens, buy up BTC at any price, and then go out of business. The end result is zero inflation caused to the native currencies, a removal of BTC from the network as they delete their BTC keys, and a sabotaging of the idea of a cryptocurrency.
That is, if the exchanges allow Tether to operate on them and 'trust' Tether to be operating truthfully.

Yes, that's um kind of the point, and has historical precedence as all nations which hoarded their gold became more rich over time without any effort, as the population grew and more of the workers accepted smaller and smaller denominations of gold, to the point today where the gold amount in their money is zero.
Yes, if you own 1 bitcoin today, you will be a multi-millionaire in your lifetime, and if you can pass any of it down to your children, they will have wealth as well, growing over time as any closed system demands.
There is no reason why 21M Bitcoin with 8 decimal places cannot represent the entirety of our economy. If 1 satoshi was $1 that would mean a $2100 trillion market cap. If 10 satoshi was $1 then $210 trillion. There's really no issue there. The ability for Bitcoin to add a fractional fork also exists (as in, change, pennies and nickels and dime denominations).


Space travel could take decades. You really think a currency without a fixed supply will work, ever, in space? Seriously? You save up money because you hear in Firaxis-6 you can live just fine on $100,000 fiat units. You spend 20 years getting there with your $100,000 only to find out you're broke as shit because the currency there devalued due to inflation and $100,000 is only worth $100 now? Keep in mind it only took ~4-6 months to send your crypto transaction by light speed to that same location and have it confirmed there waiting for you and you get the confirmation en-route if you want.
The only way to secure across those distances and time is a currency that does increase in value over time, that is fixed and unchanging, that you can rely upon. I'd love to hear the benefits you think a variable money supply brings to this kind of situation that forking off a bitcoin fork does not solve.
Gold - a currency with basically a fixed supply - worked for much of the past few thousand years and has always been valuable, period, even to this day. It also has amazing utility in technology and will be valuable in space, but not as a currency because it weighs too much and no one wants to spend the fuel to ship around something they don't have much use for day to day.
I'm not saying Bitcoin will be the only crypto, but it will be the gold standard by which everything else is kept in line. It may not be the intergalactic crypto because I cannot guess that far ahead, but it will be there keeping tabs on everything else for sure. Fiat isn't going away either unless governments stop being corrupt, which is a long shot, because corruption gives them power over other governments...
Anyway, yes, indeed, if you hold bitcoin long enough you will get richer just holding than doing anything else. Which if you have bitcoin today, you realize this is the case as the value rises, it's often growing stronger at a rate outpacing many peoples' day jobs especially if you live in other countries. This works because eventually all currency trades will have to occur back to the blockchain in the future, and you will not be able to buy food with fiat anymore, and will have to spend your bitcoin for whatever general market value it has at that point, slowly chipping away at your existing holdings but not chipping away at its value. Eventually you would run out, or your children would run out, unless they themselves brought more value back into the system by working and securing a net increase in their bitcoin holdings at that point.

With mining, you usually join a pool. That pool has thousands of other people mining, but when one person solves the block, everyone takes a share of the reward.
Your individual miner might not ever solve a block, but being in the pool, you get something for being part of the workload to do it. Whichever pool solves the block gets the reward, so you're incentivized to join with others.
Running 24/7 with a pool would take you 4-5 years for a 25TH/s miner to get a single Bitcoin.
You can see this at: 
Keep in mind the difficulty will go up over time, so these numbers are actually off. And if you're only doing 15TH/s it's much lower.
With that said, mining is generally 'worth it' in that what you earn per day does outweigh the cost of electricity by a small margin, but if your goal is to own Bitcoin, it is much faster to just buy Bitcoin. Mining is kind of like a job. If you invest $30k into a mining operation you can earn a living off mining, but you'll have to work at it and so on, but it could be a job and a fun one and you can always add solar to cut your electric costs and so on. But if Bitcoin price drops and you're not prepared, you're not in good shape, like any job that loses it's customer base.

Correct, if they make sure to hold 1 USD for 1 Libra, and super-pinky-swear promise that they will always hold 1 USD per 1 Libra, then it is not printing it. However all information regarding Libra seems to indicate they will use it like the Fed, with a fractional reserve component, making Libra nodes banks that print their own money.
If held 1:1 with assets/currency, then well... it inflates at the same rate as everything else, and still due to utility, it forces local currencies to inflate as less people want to deal in dirty dollars.
And even if they do hold 1:1, you have to trust that they're doing it, and really believe that they won't print money, and really hope that they don't make backroom deals creating Libra out of thin air to steal labor from people.

This is the most technical chart showing future Bitcoin price prediction.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:54:18
The highest estimate I've heard for 1 BTC is 10 million. There's a nice video on YouTube, just search for it.
I don't disagree, actually, but I know the timeframe for that is decades.
Some of us will be dead before it hits that number, others will be hitting their prime.
For this period, my crystal ball says $20k up to $40k depending on how this next week goes and if the Fed actually lowers interest rates in July. Keep in mind a lot of that is just new people wanting to get in at any cost - which is a good idea long term, but won't sustain the price because people are scared of risk.
If a billion people found Bitcoin tomorrow, the price would go up to $100k. If Facebook scraps their stablecoin thing and says, "We're going to just piggyback our tech off the back of Bitcoin," the price would go up to $200k. Anything is possible.
If everyone in the world used Bitcoin as a settlement layer for banking and so on - first the world would have to not be corrupt, which is not going to happen - but that would bring out a 10 million valuation per coin or so.
Ok so draw some squiggly lines on a graph ups and downs and throw a dart. You're probably right.
With that said, we can keep our eye on market indicators that affect the currency supply. If stocks are going up disproportionate to economic growth, and if the Fed is lowering interest rates - this means inflation is bigger than we thought, and means Bitcoin will go higher in a shorter timeframe.

Continue working and save up and buy more when you feel it is right to do so.
Back when Bitcoin was $200 and then dipped to $180 for example, people probably had a tough time buying. But those who did are now very happy.
Most people hodling trust the technology and what it can do for people around the world. Not in a religious sort of way, but 10-years of proven track record with billions on the line. If you're one of those people it doesn't matter what you buy in at as long as you have more Bitcoin tomorrow.
Gold has gone up and down, for example. Looking back, it was almost never a bad time to buy gold. Same with Bitcoin. This is because of inflation. Learn how fiat is made and how it works. Then you will not worry about Bitcoin one bit. You will love it.

Mining Bitcoin is work. The Chinese Bitcoin farms are working hard every day managing massive amounts of equipment.
Can you buy 10 miners and try to make a return? Absolutely. Just like anything there is risk and reward, and the great thing is by mining, you strengthen the network. It's really only for those who really believe in the technology - otherwise if Bitcoin tanks and you think you "lost" you will feel bad and shut down.
Like a business, there will be times where it is not profitable to run the business. You have to be prepared for that.
Whatever you do, don't get involved in all the side-businesses that are popping up around Bitcoin - that's not a 'secondary source of income' for you, it's a secondary source of income for THEM. They're selling some product or service or altcoin making a profit on you if you buy in. Stay away from all that if you want to turn things around for yourself.
If you have no Bitcoin, but read up about it (tons of links on the sidebar at the right) and think it's a good idea, start buying in. Buy what you can afford to lose, just like any investment, and keep buying slowly over time no matter the price. Eventually consistent investment and growth will turn in your favor.
If you never get started you won't ever get anywhere.
If you have $3000 to spend, put it all into Bitcoin. If Bitcoin doubles in a few weeks, sell $3000 worth and buy some mining hardware with it and give it a shot. Then you're even and hey you're more interested in this thing that got you this other thing for investing.
Make a plan, basically, and stick to it.

You're wrong though. The richest people in 1913 are still the richest families today. The whole point of the central banking system and banks in general is to consolidate wealth towards them while robbing normal people of their wealth.
Luckily your mindset is going to go extinct. If I agree to a mission to go mine an asteroid and it's going to take me 10 years to get there, 5 years to mine it, and 10 years back, I don't want to get back and my contract nets me an amount that has been devalued for all my work - I want a contract that gives me a stable value for my work.
Not many people would choose to put forward effort in their younger years only to suffer when they're old because their money isn't worth as much anymore.
Your only claim is that 'rich people don't remain rich' which is completely false. I doubt you could find any other benefit to inflation besides that false claim that rich people don't stay rich when that's the whole point of inflation - to make the rich people who have the means to stave off inflation continue to remain rich.

The thing with gold is someone could take it from you. Bitcoin cannot be taken from you. The thing with gold is the government promised - they pinky-sweared that they would for real honestly give you gold in exchange for that dollar bill! And then they said, "NAH!" And there was nothing you could do because you never had the gold.
Now, the same could be done with Bitcoin, but the thing is as people see fiat backed by Bitcoin they'd constantly convert their fiat into Bitcoin because it itself is a currency so why take the risk of fiat?
Meaning a Bitcoin backed fiat ends in the suicide of the fiat note. But it could exist on the outset for adopting the system.
I don't see collapse or civil war. Value is currently being rapidly transferred into Bitcoin. As more people see this, more humans will devote their time to making Bitcoin more accessible, more usable, and sell more products in it. It took 20 years to go from "I don't feel like going to the store" to "I can buy anything I ever want to ever buy ever from Amazon and do it in my underwear at my computer." It won't be long before this takes root.

Correct, the Fed is an organization and no one person benefits, however those who understand how it works, those who handle the Fed's profits, and the banks, are making money off the devaluation of every single person's labor. Not maliciously, but it is by design and implemented by design to do just that.
If you are a bank connected to the central banks you know you only need $100,000 in your reserve to loan yourself (just exampling here) $1,000,000. That money is powerful the moment you create it and if you're any good at making a return you will have no problem covering the small interest the Fed requires be paid back to them.
There has never been a finite currency source. There's no reason not to save 1 or 2 units of money in a closed system if you can guarantee it remains closed - which nothing has been able to promise, ever, with Bitcoin coming the closest. The only reason not to do so is if someone can come along and force out some of those 1 or 2 units from you, i.e. it's not secure. However, a currency which has recognized value by everyone, which exists in a secure closed system, keeping 1 or 2 units of it long term is no different than keeping 1 or 2 shares of Amazon stock with the main benefit over the stock being that a closed currency cannot really 'fail' in the same way a company can go broke and fail. It can fail, due to other reasons, but not due to the behavior of any one entity.
The way assets appreciate is because of inflation and because there's so much stealing of human work effort going on. An appreciating asset is one that steals value from laborers the most efficiently. In a closed monetary system, the value of assets would be very slow to rise and fall, and you'd nearly always know what things were worth with little variance. When an asset appreciates quickly, you are stealing from the work effort of other humans indirectly and has risk attached to it if it is a stock because the company could fail. The Fed has no such risk, and just directly steals the human work effort with no risk.
The ability to borrow money is fine if there is actual risk behind it. It's fine in the fiat system too, because it enables the government to steal labor from the masses to get things done. I don't, and would not ever, condone an economy with a full closed monetary system, because an outside fiat system would then be able to leverage their own theft of labor to force out the closed system. I'm more posturing that there is no way any individual who is not a bank can compete with the devaluation of human labor except to buy into things such as gold or Bitcoin. Doing so makes you 'one of them' basically. You're stealing the work effort of humans every time the value of gold or bitcoin increased, indirectly, because the government is causing inflation, forcing the value of your asset higher in relation to all the cheap money floating around.
Indeed investing in assets is how to make inflation work for you - this is correct. This translates into "being one of the people stealing labor from other people". Assets such as stocks come with risks, however, and there's some natural balance to it, while the Fed and banks have no such risks involved, and just straight up steal the labor. An appreciating asset is countered by the reality that it could fail - and that many assets do fail. Again, the banks and Fed have no such risk.

It's more manual, but then you learn how it all works, and also support the network when you run the software.
Definitely not for everyone but it is the lest expensive manual DIY option to really get a feeling for it. Not everyone will want to get to the nuts and bolts of it though, however if you do, you will understand what is going on more than most everyone else and will base your future buy/sell on more sound information. Or dive in and just pick whatever looks convenient, lots are good options and the only bad option is doing nothing.

Well, I've considered what would happen if a government bought up Bitcoin, and I come to the conclusion that... nothing happens. Price goes up faster as supply/demand shorten.
The long game for a government/Fed not wanting Bitcoin to exist would be to slowly buy up and never sell Bitcoin, inflating their fiat currency along the way. Basically driving all currency through Bitcoin, right? Then, Bitcoin eventually has very little activity and price is sky high and no one can obtain 1 satoshi for less than $100 and then the whole thing stagnates.
That concern is a huge timeline, first of all. Second, it is the technology behind Bitcoin that we're buying - the soundness of the money - so if the ideas are good it will survive even this kind of manipulation. There is no win for a government in this scenario.
The only value I can see with Tether if it were compromised is instead of causing inflation (if people never take out their Tether holdings) if they just shut down Tether after achieving a certain level of ownership in BTC and drop everyone off the books and close down, is there was no inflation to the USD at all, yet Bitcoin would be at a high price...
I think this is why most people here would say to not deal with "shitcoins" because there's too much risk and you're just entering into a control region dominated by massive banking institutions. And I agree to that.
So... it all comes down to risk/reward! Do you want to risk that Bitcoin will make it through manipulation? I think it will survive.

"Buying Amazon stock at $5 is not free money. This is betting that Amazon stock price will rise and other people will find Amazon stock more valuable than its current state."
You have no idea, and that's fine. People who bought Amazon at $5/share did nothing and yet 20 years later they can sell each at $1900, making a huge profit for doing nothing. That's kind of how investment works man. Think about it a bit more.

When you say 'fee' most people here think the transfer fee that you tack on to any Bitcoin transfer you make to incentivize the miners to add your transaction into the next block.
If you're dealing with any business, of course there will be a fee :) But you can, for example, send Bitcoin between you and your friends or anyone, without adding a transaction fee, once you all actually have Bitcoin. But more than likely you won't mind handing over a few satoshi for a miner to get paid to add your transaction into the blockchain.

Robinhood doesn't actually have to hold any Bitcoin in your name. You're betting on the Bitcoin price, hence "no fees" and so on - they don't do any transfers. They just sit on your money like a bank. Since most people hold and few withdraw, they can just pay out price rises with money people have sitting in the 'bank'.
If everyone did withdraw at the same time, it's called a 'run on the bank' - google what that means.
If you do not own Bitcoin in a secure wallet, you do not own Bitcoin.
You basically paid Robinhood so you could bet on Bitcoin price. Nothing more or less. They are an LLC that can shut doors any time they want and take all the money and run.
You're basically buying a Bitcoin certificate that you can never redeem.

I think the effect is exactly similar to traditional stocks/markets, with the one exception being that Bitcoin isn't a stock even if people think it is one - meaning it has no company behind it that is run by a CEO that can make a big call and bring it all down or make a bad product and take losses and so on. I think if people hold for a year or two they eventually learn enough about why the technology and the idea are good and maybe feel better about sticking with it longer.
I've seen a few posts here recently of people discussing their legendary (my opinion) hodling since they bought in at high price points, holding this entire time, and now that they're here, instead of cutting their losses or trying to break even, they're seeing the value and deciding to buy more while it's still cheap.
I would liken this to the investor who bought Amazon at $60 and then held while Amazon fell to $10... held the entire time... and now here he is 15 years later at a $1900 valuation and so happy he saw the value in the initial purchase.

I like the sarcasm, I do, however it's kind of the opposite. It's like Zuck-E-Cheese tokens that you can send across the country instantly, buy all your products quickly and easily and reliably from any vendor, pay your employees with, buy food with, give to a friend instantly to pay your half of the dinner tab, and maybe take out a loan of them to start your new Facebook-centric business.
The weird part isn't in the incentive to remain inside the business ecosystem like Chuck-E-Cheese's tokens do, it's the opposite. By making the Zuck-E-Coin more useful than any local currency, it replaces all those currencies with mass adoption. If a business has a gift card which is more valuable to the population than the actual currency the nation prints, who is in power?

Google Bitcoin Core.
You will not be rewarded. You will just be a willing participant - and you get to have control over your own wallet. It's a free wallet so that's the reward I guess. Full control means you are 100% responsible if you lose your wallet/keys or password. You're in charge.
You can do it from any computer, but also keep in mind it takes like ~230GB of data to download the entire blockchain and will take a while to download. But it's the best way to get a feel for the whole thing. It's well worth trying this out and again, having 100%, full control.

Miners are computers listening for transactions over a peer-to-peer network. Once they hear transactions, they add it to the block they are trying to solve for. To solve, they are guessing random stuff to achieve a certain result. The first miner to guess the correct result - which is harder as the mining difficulty increases - is able to fully sign off on his block and tell everyone else "I SOLVED IT!" and broadcast the completed block to the network of peers. Those peers then check the block, and indeed if the hash checks out, they then use that new block to begin work on the next batch of transactions which they see. They stop working on all the transactions included in that solved block, grab a new batch of transactions, and begin on the next block with those new latest or unconfirmed transactions they hear.
The miner is rewarded with new freshly minted Bitcoins and the transaction fees everyone included in the block paid. Most miners use a pool, so this amount is split between thousands of individual miners who all pooled together their effort to try to solve the problem.
The difficulty is set such that the rate at which all miners across the world solve the block should average 10 minutes (it's a bit lower in practice) regardless of how many miners there are - more miners, difficulty just goes up to compensate. That is how hard the difficulty to guess this certain number is compared to the amount of work going on in the entire network. More miners -&gt; more difficultly -&gt; harder number to guess.
Now, when someone mines a block, they have to include the previously mined block's hash into it. Since the previous block is included in the newly mined block, this forms a chain. Any change to a previous block would result in a change to its unique hash. Since all the blocks are chained together, if you went back and changed one single digit in any previous block, every block mined after that point would have to change, because it would have a different hash.
So, if you wanted to fool around and change a transaction you did 5 years ago and give yourself 5 Bitcoin instead of 0.5, every single block after that point would need to change, because not only did your block's hash change, but since your block was included in the next block, that next block's hash would change, and so on. And since the next block changed, every single block after (including the block you made the change in) yours would have to be re-mined to find the correct number to complete the hash.
With this Proof of Work, it means in order for someone to go back and change anything, they would need to not only control over 51% of the network, but would have to maintain that control, as well as re-do every single block from the point they made a change. This is... probably impossible? At least to a degree of actually achieving anything. In addition because the Bitcoin network is democratic - each node verifies transactions, so if you make a false change and send it out to be accepted by everyone else, everyone else will reject you.
This solidifies the ledger into something that cannot be changed, or else all the work that went into making a single tiny change to something would result in having to re-do every block after it.
If a crypto was made without proof of work, and all transactions were just accepted, it would allow double-spending to occur, as you could buy something on two sides of the world at the same time and both locations would have to accept it without the entire network confirming it. You need some delay where the network can confirm a transaction, so what Bitcoin does is when you make a transaction, it needs to be mined into the blockchain and have a certain number of nodes confirm it - the more nodes that confirm it, the more secure you are in knowing it a true transaction on the ledger, and thus you get digital cash that cannot be 'refunded' or invalidated.
Most transactions you wait for like ~6 or so confirmations before you're certain it is a valid transaction. When you download and run the Bitcoin Core software, your computer goes through and verifies every single transaction that ever took place, adding another counter to the number of transaction confirmations on your transaction. Thus we can be sure the transaction did in fact occur.

Fed gets the power backed by government to create money out of thin air and/or print it. You take out a loan from a bank and promise to pay it back at interest. The bank gets their money from the thin air at the Fed and gives you the money. You then go to work and pay back the real (earned) money and interest to the bank, who then pays the Fed their rate. The net result is you worked very hard to give the bank "their money back" while they did absolutely nothing, and the Fed didn't even have to deal with you.

This sounds like a lame marketing scheme does it not?
You need 400 of the 1000 shares to complete the code, and there's what, a few dozen released in 2 months? 12/month = 400/12 = 33 months or 3 years to get enough of the codes to complete it? And that's if you get every single part correct and don't have to wait for another 400 pieces to be revealed.


Just a really, reaaallly REALLY long timeframe. You have just as much chance to solve this waiting to start the whole thing in 3 years as someone has starting today. Since not your keys, not your Bitcoin, the chance the codes lead to anything by that point are zero.
The reason you KNOW this is a marketing scheme is because they didn't release all clues at the same time. A true hunt would include all available clues already available to be found and solved. This is just garbage. If someone has a true code they split up, the whole point is the race against time and other people, not a race against who can wait for the "next clue" to be released at the whim of the person holding the clue and the keys in the first place. They could get to clue 399 and the just NOT give you the 400th part and boom, you wasted 3-4 years of your life going to all their websites and following every single thing they said. Hell no.

I think what he means is if you only bought and never sold, 99% of all people who bought would be in the green over $10k. Obviously if you bought high and sold low yeah. I think the idea is that it has almost always been a good time to buy into bitcoin and right now is no different. Imagine in a month (or whenever) when BTC is $20k and people wished they doubled all their cash buying now. History shows 99% of the time you won't regret getting into bitcoin (but if you get out you will regret it maybe 50% of the time).

Bitcoin improves the more you take out loans.
It blows my mind because I, too, don't like debt one bit. But the reality is the more the system feeds the better Bitcoin does.
All 'sound' financial advice says otherwise but after studying how money works, the people who take out loans for investing (which is what you're doing, you're taking a $50k loan to keep $50k~ worth of today's Bitcoin with the idea Bitcoin appreciates, which it will) - the ones who take out loans to invest do well.
The ones who make the loan do better, though...
I have a similar situation in front of me and I cannot believe (figure of speech) that I'm tossing around a similar idea as you are. I 'believe' and trust in Bitcoin more than I believe in any fiat dollar I have.

Can you elaborate? You made a transaction with your debit card I assume, and it's not showing up removed from your bank account, but Coinbase already credited you to spend it?
If so, spend that shit quick, buy as much BTC as you can and send it to your wallet. Free money! 
But also would mean Coinbase is having delays due to all the massive traffic.
If your card should have been declined, but Coinbase didn't know, didn't care, or whatever, then there's a break with their system and they're in big trouble. Also if you have overdraft protection, then you've still gotta deal with your bank, it might just be delayed on their end because well, you overdrafted.

A hardware wallet has a device which holds the keys for you in that device. When you make a transaction from your Bitcoin address, in order to sign the transaction, your computer has to talk to the device to get the transaction signed with your private keys. As the device does the signing, your computer never sees your private keys.
A software wallet is like if you download Bitcoin Core and run your own node. The wallet it creates is the same but the keys are stored on the wallet on your computer and anyone who grabs your wallet file now has your private keys and thus now has your money.
The wallet file could be grabbed by a virus, for example, malware or someone just knowing where to look if they ever touch your computer.
You can definitely use a software wallet like Bitcoin Core and I prefer it because you are 100% in control, but you have to backup your wallet and encrypt it and not keep it on your computer. You create it, and then move it somewhere else. Some people even print off their wallet so it is in paper form.
Hardware wallets are generally better if you plan to do a lot of transacting or don't want to not have access to your Bitcoin outside of restoring your software wallet. Another feature is that using specific restoration words, even if you lose your hardware wallet device you can still recover your keys. So it's not like the money is in the device itself, but in the specific keywords that you write down, remember, or store securely yourself.
If you are using Coinbase, you do not own those Bitcoin - Coinbase does. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. As such, moving the funds from Coinbase to an address that you control the keys for is important for long term storage. Coinbase, even though they're trustworthy to a degree, could just go out of business and refuse to process any more transactions and your Bitcoin is lost. Unlikely, but not impossible. Once you hold your keys, your Bitcoin is stored and secured by you and only you. 100% secured by the information in your mind as to where your keys are and how to access them. Your mind becomes a bank. (hmm, know of any movies which use this idea?)
A hardware wallet is a good option, but not necessary. The Bitcoin Core software is the software that makes Bitcoin work. So if you run that and create a software wallet, encrypt it with a password, and then put that wallet file somewhere (many somewheres) like on a USB drive or external hard drive or store it (safely and renamed) in the cloud, you are fairly safe. Just don't keep it in one place - otherwise if the file is lost you lose everything.
Again one useful point about the hardware wallet is the restore words. The downside is the cost. It's worth it I think, but after creating a software wallet and storing it securely, you can always send to that address (or make a new wallet each time you 'receive' is the better option) even if the software isn't running, and even if it would take you a week to get to your wallet file. It can always receive a transaction - the sending/receiving is done with cryptography so you don't actually need a wallet that is connected to the internet, it doesn't store anything, the cryptography stores the transaction.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:13:39
How many confirmations did it get?
Who confirmed it? If it was mined into a block there's almost no way it got cancelled unless the same block was mined after someone else already solved it - in which case slow internet or what not would be the culprit.
No transaction is 'good' until a bunch of confirmations. If your transaction really got cut, that would be odd and more details would be appreciated.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:20:18
Agreed completely.
And regardless of how things go, there is a lot of logic in considering a currency that confirms and verifies transactions this way. We will never ship a pallet of gold into space so people can pay some debt. The price to launch it would outweigh the cost of the pallet of gold itself. The currency of space will not be a physical object. So regardless of where this goes in the long run, digital cryptocurrency is an idea that must exist for the future. As such, getting into Bitcoin now is like buying gold as if were 1000oz for $1.

I mean... current events and history shows you can't 'ban' stuff. Just make it harder to get, and thus more valuable. Drugs are illegal and not dead by a long shot. I have no idea why people acknowledge massive multi-billion dollar drug cartels that have to ship physical product worldwide yet think somehow the government will be able to 'ban' a super secret impossible to crack tiny piece of software that can be run on any computer and transactions can be kept out in the open but fairly anonymous...
It's gonna be fine. The only thing that would happen if govs tried to ban Bitcoin/crypto is people would ask "Why?" and they'd have to say, "They make it hard for us to steal your money."

What value is it to you to be part of a technology when it is in its infancy?
What value is it to you to not secure your money with a vault, a bank account or a government which promises they won't mess with it, but instead to secure it with information only contained in your mind?
It's not too late. Do some more research and make your own call. If you want the no-brainer thing to do, just buy small amounts over time in regular intervals regardless of the fiat price and in a few years you will hug us.

Not exactly sure your point but a few things:
Yes banks are, as always, bad with using fiat money and will lead to a lot of painful realization in the long run.
And any bank that enters into Bitcoin or decentralized anything is basically signing their own death warrant.
Lastly: because they can just print money, there's nothing a central bank can't own. Anything they want. Just print it off. Always forcing people to deal in 'fair market value' because if people knew they could charge double, the inflation would be even higher! As such, the underlying value does not seem insane amounts, to me. No one owns. Everyone rents.

That's a good article. Gold definitely has a value because it, as an element, is quite reliable. You know that if you bury a gold coin in a box near a tree on top of a hill, you can find it in 10 years and it won't have lost an atom of its weight.
That's why Bitcoin is so good. You can leave your valuable coin in a cryptographic wallet secured in the digital world recoverable by the password you keep in your mind. It will be there in 10 years when you go to get it, and you can get it anywhere at any time no matter your location. You won't have to revisit the tree on the hill and your Bitcoin won't have devalued one satoshi. It serves all the same function as gold except it cannot be held between your fingers and shown around. I would say this is a feature of Bitcoin, because gold has the ego wrapped up into it. Gold has the ability to be displayed as a social status. Bitcoin not so much. You can forge a document saying you have a million Bitcoin and no one would believe you unless you made a transfer from the address. In other words, to 'show off' Bitcoin would be to show off a digital necklace with a number on it - no one is going to care. This removal of ego and pride from currency is a benefit. The inability to go into a club and drop fat stacks of Bitcoin on the floor means those who use Bitcoin will continually do so with sound purpose.
If you value putting your hands on something to determine if it has value, then Bitcoin will be hard for you to understand. But keep one thing in mind - these words you read here have no physical property. You cannot pick up or touch my words. You cannot touch my words and yet these words have value. Someone writing an e-book creates value out of electricity and ideas, with no physical-world connection at all. Bitcoin performs the same function, but does it with cryptography, to make it the best currency, digital or otherwise, available at this time.

You confuse mining with verifying. You don't mine Bitcoin on Mars you just verify by running your software on your computer.
You can download part of the blockchain, disconnect your computer/internet, initiate a transfer, wait a week, turn your internet back on, and the transaction will eventually populate.
It's 3 minutes by light to Mars it's not that big a deal.

After some critical thinking about Libra I have come to the conclusion that Libra is just a threat to the US dollar (and all fiat) in the sense that it will inflate those fiat currency supplies dramatically.
Libra is a company which is trying to print its own money. That is as basic as it gets. They want to print their own money to bring people into their sphere of influence so it is hard to leave their sphere. Where nations have borders which demand local currency be used inside those borders, Libra demands that Libra be used inside the Facebook network for payments.
Because Libra will be backed by fiat, this devalues fiat. This is assuming that Libra will print coins and not establish a 1:1 ratio of current currency market rates. If Libra never creates a coin unless there is $1 USD to back it, then there's not much issue - it becomes a mass-adopted stablecoin. If they do any printing at all, which articles about Libra suggest (discussing credit lines and "rollbacks" if a hack occurs), then Libra just becomes another money supply.
It occurs to me that Libra is no different than if Facebook released a new series of stocks. This might be a violation somewhere in some lawbook regarding such a thing. The value of Libra to Facebook is when 200 million people each buy $100 in Libra, Facebook gets $20 billion to spend in the real world. People with Libra will then be locked into the Libra network, and can trade between each other for what they perceive as value, while the small but ever present fees chip away at the supply much as taxes do with normal fiat.
It also occurs to me that Libra is the same as if I went out and scanned a $20 dollar bill and printed off high quality copies of it and told people this was a myUSD dollar and tried to use it in normal exchange in everyday life. Facebook wants to print money above the Federal Reserve and have people accept it. I like this aspect - it does damage to the Fed and removes a lot of their power. For this reason alone I have a feeling this will not be allowed to come into fruition. Maxine Waters - financial chairwoman in Congress - is not a smart person. Yet she jumped and demanded Libra be halted until the government can address the issue. She didn't come up with that idea herself - the Fed and those who enjoy printing free money are at risk here, as the one issue preventing central banks from dominance is national borders and ease of transferring money, which Libra solves.
The more people who come to depend on Libra the more they will not see the national fiat currencies as worth much anymore. It's so simple to use Libra to pay for your Uber ride to the restaurant which takes Libra which pays its employees in Libra who buy your product for Libra that you pay for your Uber ride (etc currency cycle) that the USD will look slow and bulkier than ever. Eventually someone with USD cash money will want a Libra from someone else, and the Libra holder will say it is not worth it to just trade on a 1:1 basis - they will want a $2 USD to 1 Libra - slightly inflating the national fiat currencies. Of course, Facebook will likely control the entry point where the person with $2 USD can just exchange it for 2 Libra, but that is only if you go through their controlled entry point.
As people consider national fiat less valuable, inflation will occur in small but regular steps no different than the Fed today. This brings monetary competition into the arena again - something the Fed was specifically created to remove. If Libra is allowed to exist, the Fed and Libra will be competing to devalue each others' monetary value unless they join hands and well, then there's not much difference to today.
The end result is mixed. The utility Libra will bring to be able to send $100 Libra to someone in China (assuming they allow it) to pay for a product that you want shipped to you with an 'instant' transaction and nearly zero fee is strong. Since the transaction is recorded on a blockchain and you can always point to it occurring, it has some kind of security to the average user. The nodes however could, since they control it, just print off their own money to buy whatever product they want from any vendor who accepts Libra. They could still falsify their real world books but generate Libra in their own accounts with nothing stopping them. That is the risk; likewise that risk is still always there if the US government wants to print off $1 billion and buy $1 billion Libra, inflation occurs on both systems.
I feel that Bitcoin will be tepid during the launch of Libra as people worry about it replacing current crypto. I feel this must be what it was like when the US adopted the dollar instead of gold as a payment currency. Those who held on to their gold did very well, while those who jumped to the dollar did poorly. However at the beginning, no one could deny it was more convenient to carry around the paper money and use it.
The only threat to Bitcoin comes in the form of utility and mass adoption, where mass adoption is the more disruptive of those factors. Most alt-coins are not performing as well as Bitcoin even though they have greater utility (or utility potential), simply because there is not mass adoption of those coins; stability being a main complaint. If Libra can become so widely used that the use of Bitcoin begins to not be worth it to bother, because it's just so much easier to accomplish what you want with Libra, then there will be diminished interest in using Bitcoin as a medium to complete transactions. Bitcoin will still retain value - one of the core features of Bitcoin is its relationship to fiat currency. It is, on paper, directly proportional to the amount of fiat currency in circulation. This should not change, but utility is also a factor which can hinder price performance in the long run (for better or worse, that's debatable).
I am strained to compare Bitcoin to salt or pepper. Pepper was at one point worth more than gold, because of its rarity and its ability to do something nothing else could. Eventually, locals found out they could make their own pepper. Quickly the price due to rarity (in being something nothing else could do) dropped dramatically and now pepper exists at an extremely low price. You might even have a superior pepper, from the original lands it was grown in, but the reality is people will adopt the much more convenient and less costly local pepper because it does the job good enough.
That is a strained analogy and I don't think Bitcoin will ever have that kind of devaluation. It is just an example. The reality is more people are born every day, and governments will have to continue to print fiat money to steal the labor from those people, one way or the other. Bitcoin and crypto will continue to grow in the long run, but that's not to say there isn't a threat in utility where a more widely adopted system cannot come in and force Bitcoin out of its Fear Of Missing Out ranges and down to a more stable position. Overall even that is good for Bitcoin, and long term value is as strong as everyone expects, but I expect a large downturn during the Libra period as people rally around convenience for a bit until they get burned. 
These are just some thoughts that I wanted to share. Take them however you wish.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:02:08
That doesn't have any bearing on anything, though. It just makes the long run value much higher.
The true supply IS known. There is a maximum. There is no minimum, nor could there ever be - it's a currency.
Just like someone who put $1 million USD buried underground and then died has no bearing on anyone else.
The good thing is with Bitcoin we can always know they were there, that those Bitcoin existed. We can never for certain say they are not still being held by someone though. Even in 100 years in 2119, we could see some Bitcoins from 2019 and we cannot say for certain that they are not possible to be spent.
The minimum available is not the issue, especially since Bitcoin is granular to a high degree. The maximum is the issue. Governments can print $1 million whenever they want and make you lose your wealth over time.
If someone was able to 'print' 1000 Bitcoin right now they would have over $11 million USD worth. If they dumped it and sold it all on the market, they'd drive the price down a little bit, and the circulating supply would be 1000 Bitcoin higher. Repeat this over time and Bitcoin loses value and so on. This cannot happen with Bitcoin, so it gains value over time *compared to fiat*.
The *actual value* of Bitcoin has yet to be determined. I expect it will take 10-20 years for that value to be revealed in the market, maybe longer if we're unlucky. That is the point where people find the usefulness of Bitcoin combined with what they can trade for it flattens out and achieves widespread use.
There are tribes in Africa that if you brought a pallet of $1 million fiat USD to, they'd still chop off your head and burn the paper money because they have no valuation for it. They just don't value it. The internet, the digital age... this will value a digital currency that cannot be faked or fooled. It already is way underpriced currently. At least people are understanding more every day now.
Back to the main topic - the fact that you can never know if I am holding my Bitcoin forever or forgot my wallet and lost it all is a feature of Bitcoin, not a downside. No one should be able to know what you are doing with your own money! Banks would disagree - they want to know if you still have access to your money or if you lost your password. They're the controllers of the accounts. They want to know if you die so they can take your money or so someone else can.

No, not easily, there's many factors involved. No one can explain it to you and anyone who says they can will only be able to tell you some of the reason.

 wait you thought I was done?**
**See, how Robinhood works is if you buy their 'RobbingyouBitcoin' at $10,000 and then the price rises, you're happy! Like any bank, most people do not make withdrawals. So over time, lots of people pour money into your 'Bank of Robbingyou'. Since you never had to buy a single Bitcoin, but you have 100 people who 'bought' RobbingyouBitcoin at say $10,000 each, you're sitting on $1 million in cash! Easy money! Now if the price goes up you're in trouble, if someone cashes out at $12k then well, you have to give that person their $12k which is just using the funds those other suckers gave you to pay for this one guy's withdrawal. Since not many people withdraw, you're fine, unless everyone withdraws, which is called a "run on the bank" in which case Robbingyou defaults and goes bankrupt and all the users lost their money.**
BUT! If the price of Bitcoin goes DOWN and someone sells to cut their losses, guess what - Robbingyou doesn't actually own Bitcoin, you basically gave them $10,000 and now you sold at $9,500 and all that happened was Robbingyou just took your $500 for absolutely FREE! Thanks for playing!
The issue is because you could not just say, "Ah you know what, Bitcoin price is down so I'm going to hold on to my Bitcoin for a few years and put it in cold storage," and transfer that Bitcoin to a wallet you control.
And IF Robbingyou was any good and did secure Bitcoin in the amount that you buy in for, THEY are always in control of it. They can probably use it to buy/sell/trade on the market, taking risks with your money. You allow them to manipulate the market at that point, and try to get more money, or lose it all, who cares, it's not their money anyway.
**Finally because it is a business they could just shut down the app, close their doors and truly make good on their name to Rob you of your funds and never send you another transaction or deal with anyone ever again.**

Everything is taxable, so to speak.
If you bought BTC at $10k and sold at $12k the government would want a cut of that $2k profit you made. They will however let you slide if the profit isn't above a certain limit, because they don't want to bother will small change. This is another reason to hold Bitcoin long term. Eventually you can spend BTC direct and its value cannot be taxed, only the transaction can be taxed.

I think the more people who are aware of it as a store for value they will come to adopt it more. It might take 10-20 years to get to widespread use.
I can be sure Bitcoin or something like it will exist in 5 years because it is a good idea. Just like Amazon was a good idea 20 years ago. If you can think ahead and ask yourself, "Is an internet company that sells products to anyone around the world a good idea?" If you could say yes to that 20 years ago you'd be in good shape today.
Many of the people interested today are young. Amazon was started when I had no concern about money or finances and just lived my life. In time when people who grew up on the internet look around at finances, they will see stocks, gold and cryptocurrency as options to store their wealth. I am certain none of them are going to see a yellow metal as valuable. So the major options will be stocks and crypto. When they realize they can also spend the currency they place into crypto without wait times and without hassle and it also stores the value they put into it, they won't want to use much else for transacting.
Your question: how can you be sure Bitcoin will even exist in 5 years? It's a good idea, not just good; a great idea. Currency is just one option that cryptography brings to the market. There's so much more to the entire market now. So many new products and services. Smart contracts and so on. But I will ask you, what feature of money does Bitcoin have that is either bad, or missing? If you can find a feature of Bitcoin that is bad, it should lose value - and likewise, if you find a feature of Bitcoin that is missing, you could create a cryptocurrency with that feature that eventually becomes more valuable than Bitcoin. As a currency, the only 'downside' that makes any sense to the older generation is you cannot hold Bitcoin in your hands where you can otherwise hold gold in your hands. To me, I see the ability to hold and display currency in rings and jewelry and necklaces as a negative, not a positive, because it breeds greed, ego and envy and crime. So the fact you cannot hold it, yet it stores value like gold, is a benefit, not a downside. But those are the kinds of things to consider when looking at it. Does it do what currency is supposed to do, and is it missing something, and is something broken with it? If you cannot find answers to those questions then it is more sound money than anything else today.

**It is just betting on Bitcoin prices since you do not actually own the Bitcoin and cannot send Bitcoin from Robinhood out to your own wallet you must always 'sell' your Robinhood-Bitcoin back to Robinhood to obtain your money back so all you are doing is betting on the price.** 
If you are not buying anything, it's just betting on the price going up or down.

Like anything, I have to deal in local currency. I cannot go to Canada and spend USD at a local store. They'd look at me weird.
As such if I ever 'need' to spend Bitcoin I will convert it to the less superior local fiat. The USD is superior to Canadian. But I would rather do anything else than spend Bitcoin, so I will make sure that situation never arises.
Eventually I do see the spending on Bitcoin directly entering widespread use, and this will be when it becomes ok to spend Bitcoin, because you're receiving something for true value at that point.

Even if you own stocks, their value is in fiat, which is inflated over time. The dollar loses a lot of money over the long run. S&amp;P500 long term return is somewhere in the upper 8%, and I don't think it is adjusted for inflation. So you might get a bigger number in your account over time, but your spending power has been diminished by the whims of the government and banks - someone else has control of your store of value, period. Bitcoin solves that by giving you full control of a digital cash.
The reality is you can do everything regarding stocks and real estate but also store your wealth/value into Bitcoin.
You should buy Bitcoin as an investment if you think the governments will continue to inflate their currency supply around the world and will continue to get into wars and will continue to steal from their populations. Gold is an asset you can own which counters all that too, but it's heavy, hard to safeguard, and hard to buy/sell without heavy fees. You need a lot of infrastructure to hold gold and you're at risk of physical theft at any time.
Bitcoin does everything gold does but also has way more uses and security. One person who has access to a computer once a month and no home can still own and secure bitcoin and be fully in control of it. If they carried around gold they're likely to be robbed. Basically, you keep Bitcoin secure with math and information, something that unless people can read your mind or torture you for, is pretty safe.
And finally why Bitcoin: the hash rate. Any new coin coming along would have to compete with the trust Bitcoin has already created in the hash rate. That's what the hash rate is - how much trust is in the network. And because Bitcoin can do, even if slowly over time, everything any other crypto wants to do, and can fork off and become completely different if necessary, it's the best crypto to be a part of.
Any new coin which promises all the things Bitcoin offers would run into the issue - why not just mine Bitcoin?
Just like gold, there's room for silver and other currencies. If Libra is allowed to exist, it will be very good for crypto in general and will be a good product, being able to transfer money for dirt cheap is a good idea. You would have to determine for yourself if any new system has the ability to disrupt Bitcoin. Sure, something could, but so far Bitcoin has stood strong and has increasing trust into the network, meaning more people are agreeing on it and its value.
So if more people are getting in, more people are trusting it, and more people see it as a store of wealth - then there's only 17 million coins in circulation and you realize supply and demand drives the price up as more people adopt it as a form of value storage or currency. With Bitcoin you at least have the choice because with any fiat, you never have the option of storing value with it.

If shit hits the fan in real life you will be glad you have Bitcoin, because somewhere in the world Bitcoin will be exchangeable at a now much higher rate because shit just hit the fan. So if you can exit your failing country within a week, or a month, with your private keys that are stored in your mind, that no airport can check if you're carrying $10,000 across a border and so on...
Then you're fine.
Bitcoin would have turned any Venezuelan who bought it into very rich people if they decided to stay in their failing economy. Remember Bitcoin is worldwide so if one country begins to print too much money, if all your fiat was in Bitcoin you'd be just fine.
Unless you live in the USA or western countries, your government has full control over how it manipulates your currency with no recourse except hard assets like gold and Bitcoin. The western world can be fairly safe knowing that the value of their dollar will decrease 98% in the next 100 years on a steady sapping of your money by inflation. Any way you look at it, fiat is some of the most risky long term things to hold. Your savings account is just telling the bank to steal from you slowly, please. When they charge you any fees its laughable.

Bitcoin will definitely not change the power dynamic. Those who have wealth and power will always have wealth and power because they are good at obtaining wealth and power. They do this by making good products and services. Jeff Bezos was not the world's richest man 20 years ago. He is today. 20 years!
So people who continue to bring value to the market will be rewarded with higher amounts of currency.
Bitcoin will be the currency eventually.
If you have some weird idea that the 1% is a bad thing, that people working hard to bring products and services into the world is an unfair game, then you need help I cannot provide.

Yes but so what? The good thing is Bitcoin is a cash transaction between people. Whomever mines it is not really a factor. The size of Bitcoin is bigger than Iran.
You might be concerned, but there's no real concern when it comes to the meaning of Bitcoin, which is that two people can exchange value over long distances and have trust that their transaction will happen. That's all. The political layer doesn't matter.
USD cash is used to fund terrorists too. It doesn't matter the medium of exchange. It only matters the actions of people.

Well, if you're selling high and buying low and taking out USD in the process, then yeah... If your goal is to accumulate more BTC I wouldn't be concerned. Finally if you keep it in USDC then you didn't actually take any profits yet. You have to actually receive it first, and USDC/USDT is, still, an asset that could go under any moment.
This does sound like a loophole some regulators will want to jump on to suck some cash from you though!

I think the point is, Libra nodes can say, "Hey Bob here just gave us $10,000 for 10,000 Libra! Generate Bob 10,000 Libra! Yay!" While on the back end no money transacted because it's fiat meaning they can just change numbers in any account to facilitate the printing of money just like fiat.
It doesn't matter how you store the ledger if at any point the controlling entity can print off more currency to steal from users. I mean, it does matter - it makes tons of people at the top of Facebook/Libra rich like the creators of the Fed are rich. But beyond that it's the same old same old with the ability to cross borders (those that allow it) meaning they can steal labor from even more people.
The whole point of fiat is to steal the labor of people.

In the future, we can transact directly with Bitcoin. Truly, no one here would *prefer* to have to transfer their Bitcoin to fiat, and then spend their money. Everyone here knows they would rather just spend their Bitcoin and be done with it.
Eventually companies step up to meet the demand - because there's profit to be had in doing so - and then people can finally just spend their Bitcoin without having to do this fiat conversion.
It's like old style gold, where once gold-backed dollars were issued, people turned in their gold for dollars because it was convenient to use dollars.
In this case, we go from dollars to gold - Bitcoin - and the economy develops systems to make sure we can spend this gold - Bitcoin - easier than we can spend fiat.
Many people would be like "HA Bitcoin easy to spend!?" But it is true. The layers of payment processing tacked on to the fiat USD actually takes a lot of time and effort to maintain. There is a big smoke and mirror show going on to make you think that you are transacting instantly and so on.
This same system can and will be added to Bitcoin in layers, where eventually the user has the same convenience of modern payment processors with two huge factors - being secure, the person spending the money knows it. They're spending digital cash, so they will be more cognizant of what they buy, how they spend, and what they invest in. And second the businesses will realize lower fees, the ability to be their own bank in terms of issuing credit, more profit, and the ability to hold their funds for a time when it is not needed and gain value on their holdings rather than needing to spend it immediately to stave off inflation.
Ok I guess I went far off your comment but when I get to typing it just flows.

Inflation is seared into our consciousness by the government and the Fed. It's hard to consider a currency that 'doesn't have any more' but keep in mind how divisible Bitcoin is - how granular it can get.
When all blocks are mined, miners will continue to mine because the fees will be worth doing so at that point.
I'm re-reading your post and trying to wrap my head around it. If no one can buy any Bitcoin (of any fraction) outside of a new mined block, then how would a purchase happen?
For example, what if one person managed to obtain every single Bitcoin in existence, and then performed zero transactions, and their last buy/transfer was done at zero fees, and now every single miner in existence is sitting there listening for a transaction, but no transaction is occuring, so they cannot mine a block because the next block looks exactly the same as the previous block and there's zero transactions?
The transactions are only part of it. You could mine a zero-transaction block. The difficulty was known by all miners, and whomever solves it gets the next mining reward, even if there were zero transactions across the entire network.
If all Bitcoins were mined out, it's year 2140, and one person held all coins, and no one else had any, the miners have no reward to continue mining, then they would slowly shut down, and the value of Bitcoin would drop, making the person who spent the entire world's valuation to own all the Bitcoin a very poor person, where they might want to sell some of it to not let their money become worthless.
It's a fun thought experiment that is the same as "what if one person owned all the money in the world". Same result. Then that money would become worthless.
The first block had no previous transactions, and many had no transactions. Here's one random one I found from 2010: 
The miner still got paid for their work from the mining.

Well, you can just (especially if you are young) just say screw it, sign up for a Coinbase account, and buy whatever you wouldn't mind leaving in a paper bag outside your doorstep in the middle of the night tomorrow (someone used that example, I think it's a fun one).
Meaning, risk what you can afford to lose!
Just buy whatever you can handle, mentally. I'd try to convince you to go all in. You would have to hold even when the price fluctuates. That's the hard part, feeling like you lost or missed out or made a bad call. That's what forces everyone in and out of the markets in the first place.
But it's not too late. If you want to make a dumb decision with no thinking, consider how much fiat dollars you're willing to let go out the window, and then buy that much worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase as soon as possible.
If it goes up, great, if it goes down, you might hate me. If you hold on for years like many of us will, you will love us. It's personal risk, and my only recommendation is to understand how and why Bitcoin works because it might spark something in your mind as to why it is a good thing.

I agree that gold has had a lot of time to stabilize, except if you went all-in on gold when it was at $1800, and then you have to deal with the massive amounts of time it will take to ever get a return on your investment. Because gold is also volatile.
"As a currency, gold can't be widely spent, value is uncertain and could fluctuate widely (so your stored value could be worth a quarter of your investment in a few years)." Gold vs. Bitcoin only the timeframe is the factor, and gold moves slowly.
Keep in mind if you bought gold any time between 2011 and 2014 you never really saw an increase in the value of your storing of that value - and you had to wait 8+ years to see it come back to 'break even' unless you bought 7 years ago when it was at $1800 and you're *still waiting*.
Now, anyone can see that the world has changed dramatically in the past 8 years, so why hasn't gold appreciated in value? It seems Venezuela and the bailout of entire nations hasn't affected gold one bit. Maybe because as a store of value, no one is accepting it as such any more.
Bitcoin is volatile but 1 year to turn around from previous highs is much better than 8-10 years, and that timeframe will get shorter with digital assets because they move much faster. Eventually, just like gold, it will have a fairly reasonable stability in the long term.
Gold is already worthless to me. I wouldn't give you a fiat dollar for gold. The only thing gold has going for it is that there won't be another precious metal developed to replace it (if again, you want to hold on to metal objects and pay the cost of transferring said object around). Bitcoin could, maybe, be replaced by something in the future - I mean, if you design such a thing, you'd be rich! So um... get to it? The interesting thing to me is that there are thousands of alt-coins and none have chipped into the hashrate of Bitcoin too much. To me, the amount of power behind the network is an indication of strength. As such if Bitcoin hashrate drops by 20% over a year then we should all be worried and finding out what is going on. The Proof of Work is part of what makes the whole thing work.

I've posted about this in my comment history - lots of people asking these kinds of questions.
The short answer is they can't ban Bitcoin, just like China can't ban their citizens from viewing US websites (meaning, they can, but they can't *really*). The harder Bitcoin is to get, the more value it will have, so if they make any move against it, Bitcoin will react.
I wrote a few long posts tonight about why it's not possible for any government to do anything about it - check my longer post history.
I actually just thought of one scenario which *might* allow governments to hurt Bitcoin. They could cut all internet connections from every single nation. This would cause Bitcoin to fragment into a few hundred pieces and no one would know which is the most trusted network. This would cause your local Bitcoins to only have local value - so it wouldn't stop it, just fragment it, at the cost of you know, killing off the world's internet connection from every single developed country in the world, causing the financial market to collapse and the entire world to rapidly devolve into warfare....
Fun stuff to think about. But that's the most viable thing I've considered so far in terms of how Bitcoin could be 'hurt'. The best part is when the network reconciles, the system will prove itself to be resilient and much more value, withstanding a worldwide attack. They'd have to keep this attack going for a long time. Most likely each region would just fork off into their own individual blockchain. So it really doesn't matter unless you can disconnect all people for all time.

By default, anything that says, "Just send me your Bitcoin, and I'll give you more of it later, I promise," is a scam. Especially if they have referral rewards and give you $10 just for signing up!
They have to make money off your giving them Bitcoin to do this. So how can they make money off your Bitcoin, which is a fixed asset? They can only invest it, risking losing it forever. That's the 'scam' part. If they go under, you don't get your Bitcoin back. I'm not against investing, but investment companies will need to operate much better than this in the future.

I know, that is what makes the world turn. You could be selling food and then something dramatic happens and now you need food and can't find it anywhere - it's value would then go up.
I am sure of Bitcoin's success because if I take a step back and ask myself if I would ever buy gold for a store of value, I say no. I have no interest in a heavy piece of metal with no use to me outside of storing value, that I would have to carry around and worry about where it is and protect it and so on.
I know many other people feel the same way. They know gold has value, but they do not value the monetary value of gold anymore. They know they can't chop up a gold coin to pay for anything. No one takes 'gold' anymore, because there's no proof the gold you have is pure and so on.
Bitcoin solves all these problems. I try - and I'd note that I overthink everything - I try to find ways to 'break' Bitcoin. To make it less valuable. To try and find a way where it is no good. And every single problem I'm presented myself has been conquered by reasoning and logic.
Bitcoin has value in the same way gold has value, with many other beneficial properties over gold, and again, I've found no way yet to break it. I have found a way to damage it, but not really in a viable lasting way (which, in a way, ends up being like if we're on the gold standard and the government hands you debased gold for your paper note; it matters but not to the value of gold, only in that you personally were hurt by that malicious move).
I would happily discuss (and have in my post history quite often) risks you might not be comfortable with regarding Bitcoin. I don't plan on ever not considering ways in which it can be defeated, because if you can defeat it you can make a lot of money doing so! But also because if I find a way to defeat it that cannot be addressed then that alters my own valuation. As it turns out, over time I am now all in on Bitcoin due to much consideration.

Bitcoin is a currency so its value is purely what two parties agree to exchange it for. Since it cannot be manipulated directly by governments or any one person or company, it means you're getting the most pure exchange of value that exists on Earth to date. You buy for what you think it's worth, and you sell for what you think it's worth. In the long run, this model will likely expand to the entire world (because it's more stable than any government fiat in terms of future proofing value), just like gold is accepted worldwide. Gold however can and has been manipulated throughout all time and has plenty of risks in owning a physical object. Bitcoin is information-based gold built on math. As such, what value is that to you? That's the price you're willing to buy at and hopefully someone is willing to sell Bitcoin to you at that price and you've got a deal and another up/down tick on the charts.

If you design a cryptocurrency that can process instant transactions which is secure from a 51% attack, has zero fees and can keep a ledger over time with no risk of losing it, you might actually beat out Bitcoin in the long run.
But that's not really an option. You'd have to remove at least 1 thing from what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin, in order to achieve any of your goals, and in doing so, you break the ability to achieve a cryptocurrency status.
So, instant payment? This sounds good except what happens when I send a payment in China and the USA at the same time? I double-spend and because it's instant and everyone just accepts the payment, I got something for free. The blockchain prevents people from double-spending on Bitcoin. The small delay is part of it.
Zero fee - what is your incentive to have as many people as possible store your ~230GB blockchain data on their computer? The fee system (which is optional, you can put a zero fee and wait longer) incentivizes Bitcoin miners to store all the ledger data on their computers and to constantly update it and keep it in check with everyone else. Without the fee, you would not have many people wasting their computing power and electricity verifying your transactions.
Which leads to a 51% attack as eventually someone sees your instant transaction blockchain has no processing power and you can inject a bunch of nodes at once and confirm all your own transactions and cripple the entire project.
Stable is the next part. Bitcoin hasn't reached its valuation yet. It's like looking at any business's stock, or gold, or anything in the market. The price changes a lot. Even the dollar. People don't know what they are talking about when they think the dollar is stable. USD to CAD used to be $1.10 and now it is like $1.30 - a 20% rise against the Canadian dollar. All currency is relative and none are 'stable'. Value changes based on what people at the moment feel the value is.
For what it is turning into, Bitcoin has no problem becoming the settlement layer of the digital currency world. Every transaction recorded and maintained across many systems. Any issue you have with it is, first off probably naive, but any issue can be resolved in the future with different layers, apps, businesses and services that will integrate into the market.

Getting the feet wet is step 1.

Yes but you have to invest initially in the infrastructure, gain internet backbone access, purchase large data centers, acquire investors, develop security systems, rent or purchase real estate, so on and so forth. It's massive amounts of work suited for CEOs and investment firms and people who know how to manage employees well. One breakdown in trust in your system and the entire thing is abandoned.
Yes, an exchange makes money on every trade but they do take and have taken a lot of risk to get to that point, and they have operating costs which need to be covered as well.
The important thing is that new exchanges should try to exist, because that drives down the cost of trades. If a new exchange popped up and charged 0.10% for trades as a baseline they'd beat out a lot of existing exchanges for getting new traders into the system, and force other exchanges to consider dropping their fees as well.
So kinda right. We need more exchanges. And yeah anyone who wants to do the work of putting together a multi-million dollar enterprise, go for it. Nothing but good wishes for the success of your company.

I think you have slow internet. The blockchain does continue where it leaves off except when you start it up again it has to connect to peers again, so it takes a while to get going as it finds peers. If you have slow internet and an outdated version it might take longer. It's like 225GB or something, the size of the file, like downloading 250 HD movies from Netflix.
Check speed of your internet from that computer at speedof.me website. Assuming everything else is good with your computer, update the core software and try again.
If you have any proxy, VPN or other such thing, or if your ISP blocks peer-to-peer for some reason... so many variables.
You could also have a slow hard drive and processor and/or low RAM, which would make the computer use your hard drive more, which if the hard drive is slow... problems.

Thanks for your comment, I enjoyed reading it. I would also add that the government cannot confiscate your Bitcoin, because it is not secured by any physical location. It's location is in your mind, controlled by your encrypted keys, your password and your knowledge of the location of your wallet. It is the first currency to have no physical world component which can be controlled that an individual need possess. It is stored in your mind. That to me is priceless.

Bitcoin is digital cash. Over 18 years... there's not a good chance whatever you do will persist unless you do it yourself. The world could be drastically different. 20 years ago we didn't have Amazon.
Paper wallet, in a safe deposit box, with your grandchild listed as a trustee, would be the best bet. I'd keep some digital copies of the wallet encrypted and around just in case. Or just have two safe deposit boxes in different states with copies. Don't just keep it in one single place and it burns down. Make copies. Gotta be diligent.

I disagree here as gold has increasing intrinsic value due to technology. The useful value of gold is increasing over time, not decreasing, as we find more ways where it is a superior metal for technology applications. At an 8 trillion market cap, this shows the current value of gold to most people is not in the monetary aspect of it, otherwise it would be valued higher. The younger generation does not value gold in the same way previous generations have. Its use is more practical today, and I would say if it were the defacto most important asset, it would be valued higher to hedge more against inflation.
Your analogy regarding plunder leaves out a very important lesson - the reason stealing gold from other countries was profitable is because the peoples' own government had horded and restricted all the gold giving the people no access to this physical thing. They also coined it and regulated it and controlled it heavily. During those times, gold value was equal to the sum total market cap of the entire economy, minus perhaps land ownership and some other assets. Gold today represents a small fraction of the total market cap. It's only a valuable asset to those with an emotional attachment to it.
In addition gold didn't have a useful value until recently - again, increasing intrinsic value over time, not decreasing. It is important to note that gold can also be stolen by force, whereas information regarding your encrypted keys is completely lost if you die, securing the value of your life at least to the amount of crypto you hold, otherwise no one can steal it from you and no one would obtain it at all. No one can go to war and steal it from you, basically, at least not in the same way by just killing the mass population and scooping up the gold afterwards.
Do you know how a fixed supply deals with deflation? It breaks into smaller denominations. Gold was routinely minted into smaller amounts, then mixed with other metals, and slowly taken completely out of currency itself and the new paper or lesser metals represented fractional gold at that point. You cannot make one-millionth the size of a gold coin though, and so it has a limit to where it can be divided and remain useful.
Deflation caused by governments and their ability to limit who could mint new currency and how it could be traded. Every example you make of gold failing its use is due to its physical limitation and the government's ability to control it by force. It is not a fixed currency in that sense, it is more a heavy fiat. When ships came back with gold as plunder, it inflated the economy - and yes, the economy does well for a while when everyone has more money - and the controlling governments simply sucked up that gold over time with taxes and regulation to bring it back in line.
Fiat has its place, but there's no reason a fixed currency is not viable in any long term application with the attributes crypto has. I cannot think of one situation where being able to issue more of a fixed currency yields any benefit except in stealing the labor from other people. Keep in mind if someone hoards a large amount of a fixed asset, they had to obtain that asset through value in the first place - they earned it, not plunder it (maybe, lol), not print it. It's not like gold where it's just gone and no one has a gold coin anymore. People will simply begin using smaller satoshi amounts in transactions and the value of the coin rises. If the hoarder then decides to sell or to buy things at this point because you cannot buy a product or service without using the hoarded crypto, the value slides back down to compensate. A funny thing about this is generally wealthy people pay a higher amount for the same level of work as a non-wealthy person. The market will take care of itself in this situation if a) the currency is divisible into smaller amounts should someone hoard it and b) if the government has no ability to control the currency to prevent the population from freely using the currency.
How is the fixed supply a mistake? What benefit would be obtained from a variable or infinitely-increasing supply? Keep in mind, fiat will always exist, it has its power. So what benefit would Bitcoin have more of if it constantly inflated over all time?
I am fascinated with the idea of a ship returning with a boat load of gold, increasing the local economy. How different is that from a remote mining operation bringing back their hard-earned bitcoin into the local economy of their planet? They mined a ton of metals, sold them to Earth, got paid in bitcoin, brought that bitcoin back to their home planet, and bought up a ton of stuff after converting the bitcoin to their local bitcoin fork. It's the same net effect but without the whole killing, control, plunder and theft that occurs with an inflationary monetary supply.

Sure it is about that. It's about everyone getting into the game of figuring out what Bitcoin is worth. There will be manipulation along the way, just like the USD is manipulated, has been manipulated, and continues to be manipulated all the time. The reality is can Bitcoin survive manipulation and if it does, then it continues to solidify itself as a good store of value.
If you are willing to sell 100 satoshi for a loaf of bread, then the only way a big player can manipulate you is if they reach that valuation to get you to hand over your sound money. This would be good for Bitcoin, not bad.
Also, inflation means that if you can buy an apple for $1 today, in  a few years it will cost $1.20 to buy, but you won't know the difference, and they might even price it the same at $1, but the reality is the inflation steals the money from somewhere in the market, period.

Why not trust Tether?
The only people that will trust Tether will be the ones who use it. If an exchange says it is ok to exchange BTC/Tether where Tether is equal to $1 USD, then you're also trusting the exchange. Because someone might, in effect, 'print more Tether', or at least that is the concern?
But to what end? Since not everyone is going to exchange their BTC for Tether, the end result is the same as if a government came in and printed money to buy up all the Bitcoin - the price goes up. Now you could argue that if there was malicious influence from Tether where Tether is 'creating USD' out of thin air and artificially raising Bitcoin valuation with the intent to bring it all down in the future by selling massive amounts when they pull the trigger causing a collapse and ruining Bitcoin with no real cost because they can just shut down Tether and never pay out anything anyone has in the Tether system...
Then yeah, it's a risk, a risk that is due to exchanges that accept Tether, right?
In the end I don't see it any different than if a government tried to use fiat, with the only exception being by using Tether to purchase lots of Bitcoin, if Tether shuts down the trust in the USD is not hurt, only Tether, which would be an obsolete company.
I don't know enough about them to consider it much, however as someone who trusts in Bitcoin I acknowledge that governments and companies can manipulate things, especially exchanges which are just 'trusting' that 1 Tether = 1 USD.
If anyone on the Bitcoin market is selling their Bitcoin for Tether and holding Tether, then they're dumb.
I don't see this as an issue overall, maybe you have some different concern though. The only people trading their BTC for Tether are the ones who want to, and if at some point they run into an issue, it's on them for trusting a third party (same with exchanges).
It seems to me that exchanges who accept Tether to BTC trades are the ones taking the risk. The better option would be to do what Coinbase did and create a stablecoin for the exchange. The exchange dies if crypto dies, so they are positioned to want the space to succeed.
Coinbase doesn't accept Tether. I'm not sure how much influence Tether has on BTC but it is not different, to me, than if the government decided to drive up prices buying tons of BTC. The end result is - who cares, Bitcoin has to survive these manipulations to succeed in the long run anyways!

You said the 'return you get as an investor is the reward you get for participating in the risk of launching these ventures' and somehow I read emotion into that 'reward' where I would have expected 'profit'.
You earlier said: "investing is you giving money to others to do something that increases the overall wealth of society" which is a noble cause but incorrect. You invest to make big piles of money for little effort and screw society they better buy my expensive garbage! In other words, the increase in wealth to society has nothing to do with it; it's all about securing human work effort value and some paths to doing that are fast and others slow - the fast paths to doing that are called good businesses. Investing allows good ideas to bring value to the market which in turn speed up the flow of human work effort into the productive company which rewards the investor with lots of tokens representing human work effort.
My comment regarding sitting around waiting for Amazon stock is -3 right now (votes) as I look up here. Yet it's real. Those who come into a market later, pay for the current stocks at a higher price. It's not unfair that an 18 year old kid working their first job has to pay $1900 for one Amazon share, when back when you were 18 you bought 380 shares for that same $1900 now worth $722k. The only difference is more labor has entered the workforce and is now paying off your good investment, because the company is very valuable to a lot of people.

Slowness? I can send money with Bitcoin faster than any other modernly accepted method.
You think when you buy something at the store, the business gets their money right away?
Most businesses' credit card machines settle payments once per day. When you swipe your card you are only promising payment, and the system checks if you have the funds, and if you do, the payment processor verifies the total transaction once per day, and then credits the business's account the next business day. If you do not know how the modern payment processing system works you would be critical of Bitcoin for sure. Bitcoin is much faster than Visa and Mastercard.
Say you spend $20 at Walmart. They don't have that money right then. They have to wait until the settlement time on their credit card machines. They can and do spend the money before settlement, but there is no exchange until the settlement time when, all the thousands of transactions are sent in bulk to Visa and Mastercard and so on to say, "Yes, this money did get exchanged." Visa and Mastercard as payment processors then check all the transactions against the 'credit' of the buyers and says, "Yes, indeed I see you sold $10,000 in value today. We will now credit your Walmart bank account the $10,000, minus a 3% fee, tomorrow." Walmart then obtains their $9,700 the next business day
Bitcoin is way faster and less expensive any way you look at it, and can be used worldwide bypassing all the payment processors.
The value fluctuations are like any new currency. Every currency has this fluctuation. Eventually it will smooth out. Bitcoin's value is NOT in relation to USD, mind you. Bitcoin's value as a currency is determined by what people will exchange their labor or services for it. The USD valuation is simply an indicator of where it is at at the moment, but the true value has not yet been settled on. Eventually it will get there.
Bitcoin is fine for small transactions if people understood how it works. Businesses don't have to wait a full business day to get money in their account, only 10-30 minutes. There's less risk using Bitcoin than Visa, considering the person could turn around and say they didn't buy the thing with Visa and the business would have their funds rejected and enter into a big dispute. Ask any small business and they will confirm all this. It's much better to have the exchange happen in a short timeframe than 1 business day.
Visa and payment processors also charge up to 3% to those small businesses. Most small businesses would be happy to wait a couple hours for a payment to show up rather than a full day if they didn't have to pay that big of a fee. And since the person making the transfer of BTC pays the fee, the business doesn't even have to worry about it. Cash is always better than credit.
In addition if all that is "too slow for you" there's no reason a payment processing layer cannot be added to Bitcoin. It would still complete faster than 1 business day, period.

I think we'll always see big operations and more of them actually. I'd bet by 2140 every Bitcoin mining operation would run 100% on solar, only costing them the up-front and maintenance costs. Small groups continue to join pools and crank out Bitcoin and more will join in as they adopt solar, too. So I don't see it going down ever, honestly.
Everyone can mine, but like any business, you have to be smart if you want to profit.

Welcome back. I know people who got out (at a profit to them at the time even) and well... good for them. I'm happy where I am looking far ahead in the future.

There's a really harsh way to put this but I'll be easy on you: no.
Coinmarketcap shows XRP having 42,566,596,173 XRP "coins".
As such, if each XRP was worth $1000 then XRP would have a market cap of $42 trillion dollars - 6 times the valuation of gold.
Do you think that will ever happen?

Lots of people will tell you differently. I will tell you to absolutely 100% get into Bitcoin.
Read my longer posts in my post history as for why, as I've covered this a lot, and I will continue to repeat what I've said, but enough people have commented here where... just read some of the posts I wrote telling people how or why.
I basically tell people to download the Bitcoin Core software and run it and make their own wallet and try to wrap their head around the whole idea and then to determine how much value they would put on such a thing and then go from there. It's very easy to get started - download the Bitcoin Core and make a wallet. Boom. It has 0.0000000 in it. Then go from there, knowing that anything you put into that wallet is digital cash and fully up to you to maintain and be responsible for and make backups for that are secure and so on.
The cost to do all that is free, and then from there you can decide to buy a little Bitcoin and transfer it into your (now backed up) wallet and see if it suits you.
If you are young as your username suggests ('94) then I tell all young people to go all in, because you have time in case Bitcoin somehow fails down the line. If it does not fail... that's what everyone is here for.

Get an adult to sign up for you or broker for you i.e. buy Bitcoin using cash from sellers on Craigslist or something. It's risky, but a way in if you are young. It's not like there isn't some way to do it. Bitcoin can be held by whomever has the keys, so even a young child could hold it.
Most exchanges cannot accept you due to KYC (know your customer) rules imposed by governments but there's no reason you cannot buy and sell outside the exchanges right now, or utilize an adult or broker on your behalf.
Also no one can stop you from mining - even though people say it is better to just buy bitcoin with the money, you're young and can probably learn the mining game better than others if you get into it early. You can buy semi-profitable miners online no matter your age. It's a good option, treat it like a hobby and in a couple years you will be a pro trader.

Pure capitalism.

Bitcoin is completely at odds with more social systems and government control. Ideas like UBI are only possible with big government control. No one can steal your Bitcoin through inflation, so the only way they will get it is by having a good idea and you volunteering your money. Ideas such as UBI are only possible in a fiat system where the government prints money, devaluing the current money supply, causing inflation, stealing labor from future generations to do so. With Bitcoin this is literally impossible. Bitcoin is completely antithetical to UBI. No one is going to willingly pay 0.1 BTC out of their own wallet per month to hand over to some asshole who doesn't work.
You should study where money comes from and why Bitcoin is even a thing.
