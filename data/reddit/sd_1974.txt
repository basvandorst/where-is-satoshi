I wasn’t suggesting the wheel was after the university. I was just telling you the date of the first university (a date you referred to). 
I keep having to remind you to name names.
Funnily enough Marconi was educated at Bologna University.
This isn’t ever going to get tedious for me. It’s going to be much faster if you just name names.
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:19:44
Yes. Because it’s not the stupidest thing you’ve said so far. (That was doctorate/phd hilarity, maybe Liberpedia)

Next time you forget to add a new name I’m going to take it as an admission of defeat. 
You’ve established that bachelors are admissible and Einstein’s was awarded before he published ‘Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper’.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:34:29
There’s hundreds of books on Einstein’s life. Just buy one. If you limit yourself to fucking Liberpedia (!!!!) and YouTube you are not going to end up with any intellect. 
I’m obviously not going to use the literature prizes you dimwit. Artists express themselves, they don’t do empirical research, so credentials are irrelevant. Twain is such a crappy example because of this. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:55:07
Einstein. Dawkins. (Your examples don’t need to list the inventions, I’m not an imbecile).
My criteria btw isn’t a level of education. They need to have published in a peer-reviewed publication. I’ll quote myself.
“In order to be taken seriously as a published researcher by people who aren’t insane libertarian nut jobs? - a masters? People with bachelors are rarely published. Usually doctorate.”
Edison and Tesla were “taken seriously as published researchers”. Note I just said “people with bachelors are rarely published” - not discounting them but noting it was unlikely they would be “taken seriously as published researchers”. 
If you YouTube jockey has been published in a peer-reviewed publication and is “taken seriously as a published researcher” in economics then I’d be fine with his views.

You like his rant because it confirms your ideology. That doesn’t make it true.

‘You want to quit’. Four posts later ‘I quit’. 
You could have claimed some kind of hilariously retarded ‘win’ by those criteria ages ago. You could have argued for ages on the named person issue. But you accepted it and carried on. You also tried to give up a while back and I goaded you to continue. 
You don’t have the stamina. 
Prove you have the stamina - let’s argue the reason to not include pre widely-available- university contributions. My argument is clear and simple - you can’t judge wether X people or Y people are better for periods where Y people literally can’t exist. You have to discuss the contributions of both of those types of people during the era in which both exist.

Einstein had a phd in Experimental Physics from Zurich. His doctorate paper was "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions" (1905).

You made a statement about the contributions of non-academics. You proposed a game to prove it. I agreed to take part in the game. 
That in no way constituted a claim I believed the exact opposite to be true. I just knew you wouldn’t be able to find proof with that game. Turned out to be true, you gave up and resorted to common sense fallacy. 
My actual position is clear if you read my posts. 
It’s about what is more likely to produce more trustworthy academic research - peer reviewed papers produced by people with academic qualifications, or others (say, an attorney with a YouTube account).

It’s simple. Scare story in media, stocks with good fundamentals (generally use P/E and businesses I understand) go down, you buy. Then the scare story turns out not to be true, you sell. Trump is using aggressive language to get China to make concessions, it’s being reported as actual statements rather than posturing.
In a bull market you can make a lot more than the actual overall rise because you buy in mini dips. 
Rinse repeat. With crypto, I buy when sentiment here is terrible and sell when people start posting ‘I just bought my first bitcoin!’ Generally the dips here are longer 
I too am making a living mostly on this.

I’m not comparing it to fiat. Fiat isn’t commonly used as an investment instrument. I’m comparing it to the other common forms of investment which do have intrinsic value (you can live in them, they pay dividends etc.)
Why do people get upset when you say crypto has no intrinsic value? I just buy and sell crypto to buy things that do. It’s not a fucking moral crusade.
