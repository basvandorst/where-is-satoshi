The Pirates return to Scandinavia to rule once more...
with Nordic Socialism and more Internet Freedom. 
I don't really know how the former works so well for them and so poorly for everyone else, but can't argue with the results.

Q1: AFAIK, no, or is prohibitively expensive to brute force.
Q2: Yes, they see the plaintext and then send you an email of an event that occurred to you on Facebook. For example a reply to your status post.

The job of the jury was not to vote on the ethicacy of DNMs, but whether Ross was DPR, and since that was the crux of contest, he got convicted. Rightfully.
Defense could've taken a technical approach of saying that even though he created the site, he was not actually selling Hungarian passports and LSD sheets himself. Why should he act as the police? 
A second approach is making Ross a messiah, where he gives a speech on Libertarianism and the reduction of harm. Admits that he is above the law because the law is unjust and dumb, and gets sent to prison. His martyr status would skyrocket so hard that it would be a good chance he would actually change the law due to passionate support.
But instead the defense's argument was essentially "I didn't steal your horse, but you have a crummy horse anyway". 
edit: Here's my conjecture. From what I've read on Ross, I think he did initially choose the messiah approach, but then got pressured by his mom to dress up like an overgrown prep school student in a pink blazer, and tell the good society that he's not a cartel lord. And after many of his courageous decisions in life, right now he probably regrets cowering from his ideals.

Who is "we" — you? Whatever entity you represent, you're disseminating mis/disinformation.


Ulbricht got charged with seven crimes, none of them being murder-for-hire:
Narcotics Trafficking (Count One), Distribution of Narcotics by Means of the Internet (Count Two), Narcotics Trafficking Conspiracy (Count Three), Continuing Criminal Enterprise (Count Four), Conspiracy to Commit and Aid and Abet Computer Hacking (Count Five), Conspiracy to Traffic in Fraudulent Identification Documents (Count Six), and Money Laundering Conspiracy (Count Seven). (ECF No. 52.) 
So, no murder, no solicitation of murder, no furtherance of conspiracy to murder. No murder-for-hire. Your claims are bovine excrement, think before you get on your soapbox.

You are wrong. Better source than some 2013 article of what he was actually charged with — the court documents:
During the testimony, he was not charged for murder-for-hire, period.

By that statement they are predicting that Bitcoin technology is so groundbreaking that it will be around in 2045, but yet they will be laggards to adopt it. 
It's like they hired a jaded stoner from the mid 90s to do their marketing.

The analogy still applies, strong encryption just implies that the door's got a pretty good lock. 
The government is just asking to put a spare key under a rock.

The CIA wasn't trafficking it themselves, essentially it was a end justifying the means type of thing. It's not as nefarious as it first might seem, just dumb, really, really dumb.
The Contra counter-revolutionary army in Nicaragua needed money to finance its army in the late 70s. Considering the CIA cut off funding, Contra started smuggling cocaine from Colombia to the USA. 
CIA found out about this, but considering the States didn't want to have another Cuba, and weren't willing to fund Contra, they just...let it slide. They knew the dealers in the States, they knew the Suppliers in Nicaragua, and they did nothing to stop it.
The dealers processed the coke into crack and sparked the American crack epidemic, that is still prolific today. Nicaragua turned lefty and to this day a dictatorship.
**TL;DR: CIA tried to cure cancer with AIDS, but ended up with both.**
