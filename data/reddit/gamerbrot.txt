Please tell me how being vegan is bad for my health and the planet. All scientific evidence I have read so far (and I have read a lot) emphasizes the complete opposite. ��

Well, both make the world a better place

I cut out 95% of added sugar in my diet and went vegan a year later. I am the most muscular guy in my friends group and can do like 20 pull-ups straight. These YouTube aren't skinny because they are vegan. They are skinny because they don't eat enough.

[90% of soy grown worldwild is fed to animals]( Assuming that the soybeans and the corn that are cultivated are no longer used to feed animals but are immediately used as human food, another *5.2 billion people* could be fed sufficiently year by year. While only *863 million people* can be nourished with the meat that is produced per year. - I guess I don't need to mention that your point actually is a shot against the meat industry and not against vegans. If the whole world was vegan, we would be much more efficient, wouldn't need to burn down rainforests and wouldn't have any hunger problems.
Besides the fact that I am on a vegan diet for several years, never felt better and built about 8kg of muscles mass in the last 6 months, I also got some facts for you:[According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]( (the world's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals) vegan diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Also "it may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain health conditions, including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity."  
Please argue with facts and not with preconceptions, thanks

"Vegan" diet or not these adults clearly can barely take care of themselves let alone a child. Them being vegan has nothing to do with the death of the child.

Hey Bro, 22yo Student here who is heavily invested in Bitcoin. First of all congrats for already saving most of your money. You are way ahead of most ppl out there. The most important lesson I learned in the last years was: the the best Investment is ALWAYS in yourself. No matter how much the Bitcoin Price might rise, if you invest the same money in your personal development and growth, it will bring you even more money &amp; happiness than BTC ever could. Also never put all your money in one basket. Put some into Bitcoin but also consider other investments like Gold or ETFs. 
I myself invest the most money in personal growth, health and positive social activities. The rest of my money goes into Crypto, ETFs and my still growing emergency fund.
IMO the first thing you should invest in are at least 2 or 3 books about personal finance &amp; money like "Broke Millennial Takes On Investing" and "I Will Teach You to Be Rich"

You are welcome. I hope I could help you. If you have any more questions or concerns don't hesitate to ask me :)
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a collection of securities — such as stocks — that tracks an underlying index. The best-known example is the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, which tracks the [S&amp;P 500 Index]( ETFs can contain many types of investments, including stocks, commodities, bonds, or a mixture of investment types. An exchange-traded fund is a [marketable security]( meaning it has an associated price that allows it to be easily bought and sold.

Also most people just read the headline and instantly think its true cause some news site reported it... kinda sad
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:06:46
They accept Bitcoin since 2017 and you can also order BK on Lieferando since 2017. So basically its 2 years old news and news sites are writing about it now cause no1 is checking the facts...
