Let the fork proceed and ask people to choose freely. 
This situation is the one of the worst situations Bitcoin can be in and yet when compared to the current events of other financial networks this is a walk in the park. Greece is debating on how much money to steal from its users, and Bitcoin is arguing about the best way to solve a future problem. The comparison is night and day. The Greek people vote, and its ignored. When Bitcoin users vote, the core devs, the miners, the exchanges, they don't get to ignore them. They either respect the users and adapt or they are left behind on a dead chain no one uses. 
In fiat, trusted corporations are the center of the paradigm.
In Bitcoin, the users are the center of the paradigm.
There will be many more attempts to change course and turn Bitcoin back into something more controllable, but they have an uphill battle because the users hold all the power here and they can reset to the last known working version any time they need to. Its like playing a video game with automatic saves at checkpoints with unlimited lives and gaining immunity to the last kill move. Sure you can try and get in its way, distract it or through it off course but at the end of the day your just delaying the inevitable at your own expense.

The people who want to stop the block increase want higher transaction fees. Who they are isn't as important as what they want and what they want is not consistent with what the users want so even if they fork it they won't have anyone using it but themselves.

Is it an upgrade from the current system they use? Yes. 
Is it anything like Bitcoin? No.

[Increasing transaction volume.](
It is clear that bitcoin transactions are on the rise.


No. Bitcoin's killer app is the magic internet money bitcoins. Banks can still use it as a settlement layer and they can even do it cheaper but they will have to settle for normal bitcoiner status just like everyone else and not the gatekeepers of the "highway systems" they make necessary through artificial scarcity when none is needed.

You are a very negative and small minded person.

Merchants didn't deploy Bitcoin and ask to get paid in it. Payment processors didn't create Bitcoin and ask for a government regulated monopoly. Bitcoin was created and the users came. The users made it a currency. Merchants will accept the bitcoins that are used most.

Most wallets and exchanges will voice support or opposition before a fork. I agree your average user wouldn't pay attention but Bitcoin is still far from mainstream average users and everyone here knows that paying attention to these changes is an important part in mitigating the risk to adopting Bitcoin before it goes mainstream.

Logic. 
You have two identical Bitcoins, but one has higher fees. It really doesn't take a genius to figure this out. The majority of users will opt for the lower fees especially considering that was the main selling point for  bitcoin remittance services for the last 3 years. 
I will opt for the lower fees. It may leave the network susceptible to another spam attack but I see no problem with people that want to throw money at miners. It would even encourage that all benevolent fee market to develop for micro-transactions where it would probably be put to the best use anyway instead of everyday transactions.

The current trend suggests sometime within the next 100 years, any more specific than that and your just making guesses. 


Transactions = commerce so if transactions are rising so is commerce. Linear relationship.


unfounded speculation. 


This is the premise of the current debate and why everyone aside from a handful of special interests know that the block limit has to be raised. With the lead developer and most of the influential voices agreeing on this and a plan already presented it looks like we are going to get some type of block limit increase and now everyone is just trying to figure out how much and when. None of this is life threatening to Bitcoin because the incentives and users are against doing nothing.

An industry leader that doesn't update to the most widely used version of the network that the industry runs on. Goodluck selling that strategy to stockholders.

Welcome to the Bitcoin civil war. 
From my understanding;
Option A) increase block size as planned, a few of the bugs in the network will persist but the main problems around the block size will be pushed back another few years and bitcoin can keep going along the current trajectory aiming for mass adoption. 
Option B) do nothing, and let a fee market develop. This would increase the costs of transactions but possibly solve some minor problems in the network but changing the direction of Bitcoin away from low cost transactions and that may hinder adoption. 
So even though option B might solve some of the minor problems it is probably not the correct path for bitcoin to take right now as miners still get the block reward, when they no longer get it then I might change my mind but for the next decade or so I see no reason to not keep raising the block size as miners are rewarded more than enough already.

Stop fearmongering and lets find out.

I disagree, the argument that increasing the block size would increase centralization isn't an absolute and for the user its simply more expensive or less.

I down vote you because you are not on topic, rude, and post nothing useful.
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:36:32
No one paid a dollar for a transaction and waited more than the standard confirmation time. Only the default fees on some minor wallets are effected by a spam attack. Stop fearmongering.

I'm saying every opinion you have shared is wrong from all observable evidence. 






What is foretelling enough is your comment history. What that tells me is you have no interest in learning and more of an interest in posting negative opinions that are not founded on any tangible data.

Democracy is out dated. Sure the US has done a really great job, not perfect but great by any standard. Now we must look to improve it and we can start with the separation of money and state, that will not happen from within the machine. 
Vote for bitcoins by using bitcoins. Exit &gt; Voice
