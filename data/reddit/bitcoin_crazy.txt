Please correct me if I'm wrong, but this isn't a cryptocurrency. It seems to me like it's just a "normal" currency, but there are no physical notes/coins, and instead every transaction is made electronically, like a debit card or online. I'm a troll on this forum, and even I realize the difference.

Also how much would the payout be for the holders of the alt coins under such circumstances?

So you're saying that that we could align them (i.e. line them up) or not?

Also I think doge would be too big (cost wise) to bring in first. BTC gobbling up doge would be like the South Korean economy absorbing the North Korean economy. It would be prudent to first bring in the more serious coins, like Litecoin, even though bigger, because it would favor market stability, and then use the amalgamated and larger bitcoin to bring in the holdouts, doge, etc. because it could weather the instability.

The only stumbling blocks to incorporating Doge coin, for example, would be a) the logo and b) convincing the doge community to take their online coin collecting a little more seriously. Otherwise it's all coding that could be worked out, albeit via a lot of work, and then incorporated and merged. The unified coin could avoid inflation by a gradual payout to the lessor coin deposit holders and thereby ease the flux on the market without spooking anyone. So the altcoin would be converted vis-a-vis to bit coins without significant btc instability.

Because it would favor market stability over the long terms and prevent the eclectic mix of traders using different electronic coins. You know the old saying, "It Ain't Worth a Continental!" and this was a result of there being more than one fiat.

They don't at all right now, but I mean if they merge.
