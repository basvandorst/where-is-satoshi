We had a post a few days back literally warning everyone of exactly this. People are not rational on their money, let alone about bitcoin "gainz", DONT talk to them about such stuff!

Don't buy a car unless it's really needed. A car is among the most expensive things one can own. Fuel, registration, repairs and so on, it's a lot of money...

Getting 1 trillion liquid capital is nothing. And, consider they dont need that lump in one place. A few well placed "capital" nodes who hold way less capital (with lets say 50-100 Billiom USD in BTC) but have a broad range of channel connections are more than enough to lock the system down and make it centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:59:04
You know, unless some really smart ppl find a solution to this (and similar) "problems", such scams will happen a LOT in a decentralized system without regulation. Lets be real,
the responsible persons at CB/outside have made a fortune on this, who the fuck cares, there are no legal consequences to be even afraid of...
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:05:56


No. To run a HUB, you need to 'trap' funds in a channel. Imagine a billion people using the LN and having an average balance of $1,000. That is $1 Trillion in funds that would need to be locked in. No single company, or even 100 companies, can afford to lock up so much capital.
banks have that money, countries too. The more I research and think about LN, the more skeptical I become...

great article, nice work. thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:55:02
The reason is simple: Information. Who controls money, has significant power. To control Money and have all the information on all the transactions wit the possibility to lock down such a system, you made every states dream come true. A country always needs to have power over their monetary system. The whole financial system of today is built on this grounds. 
I cant say how much the nodes will need to have available BTC to function properly, therefore it is hard to asses a monetary value on this. We know they will need quite some BTC for sure or it defeats the purpose of the LN. 
At this point we dont have enough information. Maybe there is already a system to prevent this (max. node value? or something like that) so this would be no issue, but for now, my concerns grow.

The technology behind it is great, I thoroughly believe it is revolutionary by all means of that word and what it is set out to do it will do. It will change the future for sure.
Let me cut it here, Blockchain as technology is superb, a game changer. 
I will refer to bitcoin from here on;
Bitcoin (and his mass adapted iteration that needs to happen) still has a lot of obstacles to take, some being really major and scary (by all means) ones, just to mention one of the biggest, like the monetary monopolist of the whole world, USA. 
I can bet you, giving up the monetary dominance in the world is not an option for this country. Not only for the US, but a whole mass of other countries as well. 
The Geo-political implications of having no power over peoples money, the banking system + monetary, state controlled, money controlling system (like it is in place now, expl. the FED or ECB) are what one should be scared of. Every country, especially the USA, will do everything in their power to prevent this from happening. 
Let me state it like this: Bitcoin, the technology behind it, ***and all his supporters*** must grow powerful enough (in strength and numbers) by the times that he will be flagged as a threat. Or we will only have a pseudo "decentralized" cryptocurrency which will still be controlled by governments and centralization. 
For now, being labeled as "bubble" or "scam" and so on is really great for us, the powerful with endless resources simply not care. So it can grow and strive freely.

Hey can you put in some more, I would like to buy a little cheaper?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:13:22
There are to types of tax, short term (speculating) or long term investing (holding over a year). The second one is significantly lower. If you have major investment gains, seek professional advice on this topic.

I have done it and gone 100% BTC. It is money I can afford to lose, but it would still suck though. 
Stock market is also in overheating phase, 1-3 Years I would say at most we have before a serious correction. We are now short only a few months (12 or somthing like that) of the longest bull market in history (1990 - 2000)
The question is what you believe will happen with BTC before that correction? Will it survive and grow and hopefully clear the problems it has right now? And if yes, it will, how will the people behave during that correction? Will they believe and invest in BTC as safe heaven or will they loos faith and cash in the BTC?
If you believe BTC is the real deal, and it will survive, there is no limit to market price it can reach during a stock crash/recession.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:47:46
unless i can buy food from bitcoins, yes. 
If time shows that fiat is doomed, then of course i would not do it, otherwise, living a full life without needing to work (and I am at the start now, so plenty of years left) and just do whatever I want would be more than worth the cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:13
for reference, at this point if you count only the 4 biggest bank in the world (all are in China), they have around 13 Trillion USD in assets in sum. And it only gets up...
1 Trillion is a joke....
Ppl generally have no idea of the magnitude of the financial power of some countries.

My rough plan for now:
40k - cash out 10%
100k - 40% - here I would be financialy independent
200k - 10% - If fiat is still a thing
500+k - 10%
Rest - never

maybe he meant bcash? (I am so sorry for his soon to be, ex lefty ball)
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:23:25
As it was stated many times: contact FUCKING law enforcement and get a LAWYER. its 8 million USD we are talking about, if it's a official investigation binance isnt allowed to tell you shit.
  
And this all smells like shit my friend, you altering official binance mails- lying, resorting to reddit for advice, ignoring the suggestion of legal actions...

Will check it out, looks nice. 
One question: Can I enter the ammount of crypto I have without transaction data so it shows only the portfolio value?
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:53:32
Great, thanks!

Hatchet, going old school. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:07:26
And while you at it, also fork bcash, and start calling it the real Bcash, while calling the original bcash core.
Just to fu´k with him. Imagine the cringe..
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:01:01
How about no
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:40:23
Yes, I think you got it, wrote an example below: 
Just an example: 
in the last 4 years I bought/traded BTC 100+ times. I now have overall 2 BTC, but I cant enter all the values of the trades since I didnt keep a record of it. It would be great if I could enter just the amount (2 BTC in the example) to keep track of the actual value now. 
This way I could enter all Cryptos I have, see the overall Portfolio Value, and since I know how much they costed me (estimation), still know how much the profits/losses are, without needing to enter every trade for every coin. Just an idea.

You can report it to your police for sure. other than that, doubt you will see the money again. Damn, 70 grand is huge....

As was pointed out by u/hydraxe, you have the BTC.
  
  
You are a lying piece of shit.
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:03:46
Yes, I can say that. I would fucking pay up if I had a bet, thats why you gamble in the first place, you either make a sweet win or loose some nice money. Why not pay in 2 or 3 batches throughout a month or 2?, or every 2 weeks 20% for five weeks? There are plenty of ways to settle the debt, other than this crap you are trying to pull off here.
If the money is a problem, Work one or more months extra to get the gambled money back, and this way you learn from this experience and wont (hopefully) do it ever again.
Now, however, you are just scamming out, coz its the internet and you little wank-turd dont need to worry. You will not learn anything from this since you didn't loose shit and dont have to think about any consequences. But things come back, in RL you cant pull of such a idiotic "I apologize, we fine now?" crap... You owe someone 3k+ USD, you will pay em, trust in that...
If you have been on the other side of the bet, I am 100% positive that you would demand the money nevertheless of the situation.
