Japanese speaker here. Just listened to the whole recording. Doesn't seem to contain any "new" news, but a short summary:
- It's a recording from January 30th with a representative from Mizuho bank.
- First, they talk about the BitInstant arrest (which happened a few days before the recording date). Mark says that in cooperation with the US government, around 12,000 (IIRC, didn't memo the exact number) customers who used BitInstant have automatically been put on "highly suspect" with increased AML requirements.
- Bank rep. asks if Mark trades on his own site, he says no as it wouldn't be fair to customers, although there are no regulations against it.
- It becomes clear the meeting is about a request from Mizuho HQ to close their account. Mark finds they were quite forceful and rude about this, and they refused to give reasons why.
- Bank rep. comments that it's okay for Mark to ignore Japanese politeness forms in his speech if it means he can get his point across more easily (I thought I was mishearing at first, but is he seriously using "ore" to refer to himself in a business meeting? FYI, this is insanely rude in Japan). Japanese woman (his lawyer) comments he is French, is bad at Japanese and doesn't mean to be rude.
- Bank rep. says closing of account is not negotiable. Mark again asks to explain why as they are following the rules and regulations, but is given no clear answer. The rep. says it is caused by amalgamation of things and is generally vague about it.
- Mark mentions Citibank began refusing to serve deposits/withdrawals for them. Citibank apparently blamed Mizuho for this in a meeting. They are still in talks with Citibank, but no conclusion yet.
- Mark mentions a large Mt.Gox client was refused from opening a bank at Mizuho, and wonders if Mizuho is somehow anti-bitcoin. His local Mizuho branch apparently threatened to also close accounts associated with Mark's other businesses if he did not comply with the closing of his Mt.Gox account.
- Asked about bitcoin in Japan, Mark says it is still small but growing, and they are now processing around 200-300 million yen per day from Japanese customers.

Just re-listened to that part, and you're absolutely right - he's in fact telling Mark that it's okay to not mind his words if it means he can get his point across more easily. Misunderstood that bit.

Most likely just a virtual office: 
They've only changed their business address to a fancy location to give themselves an air of legitimacy. They're not moving anywhere.

is a joke/FUD account.
This thread should have made that pretty damn obvious:

Thanks for the info. It seems my status just changed to "processed", so I guess I'll have the funds tomorrow.

Could you disclose which bank you are withdrawing to? I've initiated my first withdrawal to a Yuucho account early last week, but it's just been sitting on "confirmed" since then.
