No, miners write the chain further. Wether they could sell the coins is another question but the chain is full functionally. That I couldn't say for your raspberry pie chain - this chain stopped, is without miners dead. With a stopped chain, you couldn't sell your coins also.

The miner are the main-network!!! The network and the miner are the same!!! 
A network without miner is a dead network, which means that either you invest in mining hardware or you are on the broken branch. It's not that heavy. Investing in bitcoin does not mean to run a nonmining-node, but to provide mining power.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:35:51
Blockstream bs! 
No they can't. If they try, they are on a dead chain.
Tell me how your army of raspberry pie generate a new block. Lol! Read the fucking white paper. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:17:58
The networks can very good live without nonmining-nodes. Miners are nodes and blockgenerators in one, nonmining-nodes only verify the blocks but that do the miner also, because they build the new block on top of the latest valid block. 
Nonmining-nodes are more or less useless for the function of the network.
Blockstreams false novel. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:18:02
Yes nodes are storage devices only. A node is a node, lol - that not a proof, it's only a memes. 
If you mine in a pool, then you must trust the pool operator, who is running a node for you, that he use the same consensus rules, than your nonmining-node. Your nonmining-node makes only sense, if you give them power - mining power - then it is a real full node, that matters. 


Because you get a steadier income, when you mine in a pool. 
Why do you think, pool mining takes over? 


Can an asics mine/generate blocks without a node? No! 
Can an nonmining-node generate blocks? No! 
Who writes the chain further, if not the mining nodes? Certainly not the nonmining node.
Which power decides which blocks are valid? Which power builds the other valid blocks?
The nodes do nothing but decide for themselves whether the rules are observed. If they are not met, they split off from the network and wait for valid blocks that will never come because there are no miners to generate the blocks. Or you have an mining node, than you try to generate the next valid block by yourself.
Pool nodes are of course very important, but they have mining power behind them. Your raspberry pie don't have any power at all.

That wasn't what this was about at all. Read the thread again - and the white paper!
The thread was about, how much nonmining-nodes help the network.
Nonmining-nodes are not at all important for the functioning of the network.
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:50:13
You don't matter! Make what you want but your raspberry pie don't matter for the network!


Why do you want to verify your own send-tx? Makes no sense, you wouldn't cheat on yourself. 
Receive tx:
What if you get an receive tx, your raspberry pie don't validate it but the miners include it in a block, which the majority see it as valid? Which power do you have? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:09:23
Nonmining-nodes mean nothing, read the white paper. You can install a hole bunch on Amazon servers - sybill attack.
Nodes are not the same as users.
If you have 51% hashrate you control the chain! Lol, read the fucking white paper!!! 
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:31:32


And you are alone on your own not functional forked chain. :(
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:26:03
That wasn't the point.
You can repeat it as many times as you want, it won't make it right. Technically, a chain without miner is a dead chain. Whether the chain has a value is another matter. A non-functioning raspberry pie chain has even less value. But keep dreaming, you will find out how much value a chain has without miner.
Read the fucking white paper!!!!!!!
Nonmining raspberry pie nodes don't matter!!!
Do you have any idea how bitcoin works? Apparently not.

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:09:27
You're right! Bitcoin combines the good qualities of gold and cash. This is what bitcoin has made great. Now they want to make a high prize system out of it - batty.

Sorry no, I want to know, who code the Segwit2x code in the future. The core team code the Segwit code, I think. 
And you code the original btc1 code without Segwit and without 2x?

You're ridiculous! The people are NOT happy with high fees, they have no other choice - until now BCH. 
Totally batty to think the NORMAL people would like to pay high fees. In which world do you live high fee propagandists?

I think you should take another coin. Btc is a store of value and not for the day by day usage. Day by day transactions are spam transactions says Luke-Jr.
Through your efforts, you would only make Bitcoin only more unusable.

What is the definition of the "valid" chain? Your chain? Blockstreams chain? "Consensus" chain?

If all this is so catastrophic with 1mb, how has it managed bitcoin at all to survive today? 1mb was 5 years ago definitely more a problem than now.
The 150gb is the complete blockchain of at least 7 years! They are only downloaded once and not every month. So this can not really be a serious reason.
How strong is bitcoin decentralized? How do you measure it, when would it be enough?
Lightning is not bitcoin, it uses only the coins but not the chain. Lighting is perhaps 50% bitcoin.
Lightning is not ready. How long should we live with this slow and expensive bitcoin? 
So I would say the centralization of the miner is a lot more menacing than that of the nodes - there is a lot more nodes than miners.
So would you prefer less transactions?
Do you think the price would be so high if there were only 25% of the transactions?

Thanks Cores 1mb limit! We live in 2017 not in 2011!
My mobile now has more power as my PC back then ;).

You don't really need to run a node but so you could.
You could rent a VPS and set up a full node there. Your full node does not really have to be with you, it just has to be under your control. You simply connect with your bitcoin client with your VPS and well, maybe over a VPN.
The press start digging. Debunk Blockstream's "miner is bad" narrative
I certainly feel like I'm still "my own bank" whe...

Investors do not decide anything except the price. They follow, they do not lead.
Buy hash power and you have a vote, anything other don't matter.
If you do not like it, you have to sell or to buy power! Screaming don't matter, too.

Maxwell, in particular, who became active around June 2012, has stated he proved decentralized consensus is impossible. Luke Dashjr, who became active around December 2012, has stated he believes in absolute monarchy, the kind we had 500 years ago. Peter Todd, who became active around May 2012 – nearly at the same time as Matt Corallo, a former Blockstream employee – is a History of Arts graduate.
The three probably led what some believe was a hijacking of the bitcoin project with the aim of completely transforming the protocol from peer to peer into peer to bitbanks, or as they now call them to centralized hubs.

You mean it seems really serious - I find quite crazy but well.
Why do we need smaller blocks, it works at the moment and the technical progress makes it always easier. 
Why should the block size become even smaller, I really do not understand the reasons!?!?
Bitcoin is decentralized at the moment enough or not? The real centralization takes place with the miners and not with the nodes.
I would like to use Bitcoin and not be forced into the Lightningchains.
I find it really a pity that you make bitcoin so unuseable for small people, that was formerly not so. For this reason I have also sold my btc and can not really advise anyone to go long term in bitcoin. I feel Bitcoin will be go down like the first Internet companies and will be replaced by a better one.
Do these statistics look any healthy? They would gladly go up but they can not, as a cover (1mb-2mb) sits on it.
Imagine, this 1 mb limit would not give it, as in the original intended. To the moon but not so, where a cover is on it.
