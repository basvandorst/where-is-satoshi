They missed one...

It wouldn't have had the same effect. The whole idea was to confuse people

1. Bigger blocks, but they are still 10 minute blocks. Confirmation time is the same (except when miners were gaming the broken Bitcoin Cash difficulty, when new blocks were discovered every few minutes*)
2. The Bitcoin mempool cleared weeks ago, in part due to lightning network going online, the price of transaction has also gone down
3. Litecoin is a not a "shitcoin" at all, it often implements the Bitcoin roadmap much faster than Bitcoin does. It has segwit, atomic swaps, and 2.5 min blocks... And with an active and talented dev team who recently moved to further reduce transaction fees.. Litecoin absolutely *trounces* Bcash in almost every possible way...
Not sure what you're smoking buddy...

If Bitcoin Cash wins, it will signal to others that all you need as a success business model is to hype a fork.
Litecoin was a thing long before Bcash, and not only is it significantly different, it accomplishes more (faster blocks, segwit etc). The key difference is the name and the pumpty dumpty hype-train.
Roger knows it, and is why he is so testy when it get's truncated to Bcash. Bcash does not have the same effect (fooling/confusing people) as "Bitcoin Cash".

Myself as someone who personally deals with the banks and merchant services those fees are always at the front of my mind as it affects my bottom line and pretty much everyone just ignores them for some reason... Main reason I don't understand people who complain about tx fees, completely ignoring the 1.2-5% they spend on pretty much every fiat purchase they have ever made with a card. Fiat has monstrous "tx", they just hide it better...

After talking about it some more, a friend sent me the abc article from 2015 (posted in this thread)... It's all of them...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:17:22
The consumer is 100% paying 100% of all of those fees, 100% of the time. The store pays for their merchant service and card fees, and respond by adding 2% (or more) to the price of everything in their store. I assure you, if I could replace the current system with a lightning equivalent, the price of everything in the store would drop by at least that much to be more competitive. I personally offer a discount if my clients settle their accounts with litecoin.

My thoughts exactly... I would have sold at $100.
But as they say, "nobody ever lost money by taking a profit"

Old but also interesting: 
I spoke with this guy last night who “worked in the financial sector”. He basically said they consider crypto as "the enemy"
I said he wouldn’t be able to hold that opinion for much longer ��
This is the uber of banking…
I liked bitcoin before… now I fucking love it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:52:14
The crypto gods heard of your stupid plan and immediately sent the price downward

10 points for an amazing machine, -1000 for the camera work... what the heck happened...
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:04:01
Agreed, now drop back down to $2 and I'll accumulate all of it!
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:52:56
What I don't understand is why they don't give back the coins themselves? Returning it to fiat is unnecessary
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:53:58
A bitcoin is as good as a midichlorian to a blind bat, say no more say no more!

It is going to $100k... just not right now...
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:53:22
So give back whatever they have, distributed evenly... If they lost 20% of the total coins, give back the balance -20%
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:58:39
Just do the right thing by the community...
You made a billion dollars last year, you can bring down your fees a little...
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:21:17
This is great but... do they have segwit and cheap send fees from the consumer wallet yet?...
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:48:02
Pretty sure you can buy an Aston Martin now with litecoin (if memory serves). Not sure if the Italians *ahem*, excuse me I almost forgot, _Germans_ (Audi)... are on board yet...

I don't know why it is constantly surprising hearing good, thoughtful things, coming from the mouths of senators and politicians...
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:59:59
In that case it's simply a hilarious, hilarious joke
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:11:31
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:00:47
Bcash apostles don't have segwit either
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:08:16
Great idea, and it would remove a huge psychological barrier of owning a fraction of a thing, you are most right about that.
When I think about what would create a new ATH, this would be part of it...

The Lightning Network is a "second layer" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain (most commonly Bitcoin). It enables instant transactions between participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments - wikipedia
Roger Ver is an asshat that continues to attack Bitcoin with half assed attempts at forking it. These attempts include "Bitcoin Unlimited", "Bitcoin 2x", and "Bitcoin Cash". Names are intentionally misleading. He owns bitcoin.com and the  twitter and uses them to spam his agenda. He is against segwit so his version of bitcoin doesn't have it. Segwit is required to work with Lightning.
I don't know about this screenshot, it could be doctored, but if it's not then RogerVer is running a Lightning node but has no friends and nobody want's to connect with him, such is his reputation amongst the crytpo community.

Fair enough, I didn't know that thanks. What I now don't understand is why I'm getting downvoted...

TA doesn't work... but you can move the charts if you have enough capital... Try it yourself with a few hundred dollars and a coin with low enough volume...

Good for you man :)

Rich people are literally painting stories on the charts with this unregulated market... Their story goes "uh oh, looks like it might be coming back up!" *everyone buys in* "just kidding!"... Repeat...
