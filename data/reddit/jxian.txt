Do people actually use 'SJW cuck' unironically? The only place I've ever seen that is @_date: 2019-03-04 08:38:52
I'm not sure what you're trying to say? 
I realize the apple subreddit is the most embarassing, and I do actually own an S9. Please don't judge, we all make mistakes.
Edit: Why are you cherry picking from my comment history anyway? Don't forget and @_date: 2019-03-04 06:04:25
I'm not trying to be a troll, or an 'SJW'. I just felt (in my opinion) his original comment about older generations was kinda gatekeepy. I'm not gonna starve from anything, haha

Man, don't take this so seriously. I'm just stating an opinion and you seem to be getting bent out of shape over it. This'll be my last reply, I really think you should be less defensive and knee-jerky over stuff. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:29:56
Gatekeeping is like "only older generations will understand this"
You should check through the subreddit before you reply, boss. What you said is literally most of r/gatekeeping
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:38:25
You're probably not wrong
@_date: 2019-03-04 01:34:49
Yeah I was gonna say r/gatekeeping
My little cousin is 11 and doodles this shit all the time

Lol, I didn't say you said it, I was giving an example. "You older generations will know" implied that younger generations won't understand or won't know what you're talking about. 
You seem to be out of touch with a lot of things, not just younger generations.
Just browse through the subreddit, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's funny to read through some of the posts, regardless of whether or not yours fits there.

Man, I'm not twisting anything or changing any definitions. If you check our the sub, there's plenty of posts from people about older generations understanding something younger generations don't, and stuff of the sort. I've been responding to you, but you seem to just be downvoting me so I figured I'd stop. Cheers

I don't really think that applies here.
