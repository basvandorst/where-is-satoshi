I'm going to be pissed if bitcoin goes up by the time Circle finishes reviewing my transaction.

My Circle transaction has been "pending review" the past 1.5 hours even though they took the money out of my bank account.  And they only gave me a $300 limit.
Bought with Coinbase and my transaction was verified and went through within minutes with a $10,000 limit.

I really hope so... All mine says is "Amount: $300"  If the amount was set at purchase wouldn't it also show the amount of bitcoin?
Where's the option to convert dollars into bitcoin? Does that happen automatically?

Bitcoin dropping! Hopefully my Circle order didn't go through, lol.
No I didn't. I went to "add money" not "send" so there was no send field. Don't you have to first do "add money"? This is in reference to the iOS app.
Edit: I see how this works now. After I "add" the dollars to my account, I have the option to "convert" into bitcoin and then I can "send" to my wallet. I tried to convert right now and it said "we can't convert your currency while a deposit or withdrawal is pending." Now I'm hoping bitcoin drops more. :)

True. But it locked in my conversion rate at purchase. The only problem is that I can't sell the bitcoin or use them for now. But I was purchasing them for a medium-long term investment so I don't need to use/sell the bitcoin.

Circle sucks. They took my money and said the transaction is "pending review." Why the fuck are you taking my money and then saying it's pending review?
Use Coinbase.

Aaaaaaaand down goes bitcoin.  This shit is volatile. I get exhausted watching my stocks 6.5 hours a day when volatility is high. I don't know how I'm going to deal with bitcoin's constant 24 hour volatility.

Circle ended up denying my $300 purchase about 24 hours later (without explanation) and returning the money to my bank account. Good riddance. I'll stick to Coinbase.
