If they were helping bch it is probably just because of the high amount they would have received for free. Then at some point they will just dump them all and go back to fully supporting Bitcoin. This will be the same for other sketchy Bitcoin based companies, at some point they will all just crash bch and it will lower a lot in ranks.

It's already online for testnet and works great, just a while to wait before the switch to mainnet and everyone should be using this. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:27:26
I have tried testnet which works perfectly and now I'm reading mainnet is running so it's just a matter of time for it to spread a bit and you will see it in action.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:07:47
Where is that news posted? Surely fake..

Have you heard of an ancient tortoise shell that was one of the first forms of payment?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:04:13
Dcash again
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:01:43
Ditch cash sounds quite good.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:45:13
These types of figures will go to main net soon though so don't worry. Most of these node probably have projects that will use main net in the works also. Even if not it gives lightning network developers more support when making projects and more and more will begin to run on the main net when ready.

Stop talking to idiots telling you a load of garbage dude.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:54:47
You make it sound like all merchants have rejected everything like PayPal and credit card payments in exchange for some crappy alt like crash. Payments online tend to be about making money from customers which is why this will do really well regardless of how centralised people want to make it seem.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:44:58
Well for dapps then remember they were originally planning on making Ether as a chain for Bitcoin so just like lightning network perhaps there will be a bitcoin token and dapps layer. 
Personally I think lightning could be like the new PayPal and we might see it used everywhere, when I looked at the github it seemed to have a onion layer also so privacy coins might not get used as much if that was good enough to keep people happy. Also we might see the return of Bitcoin faucets everywhere now with low fees haha.

That's what people building financial services around lightning will do, you won't need to know anything technical to use them. This is just an explanation for everyone that cares about how the tech works.

A dodgey guy who doesn't mind making money from other with scams I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:24:21
Won't be soon with lightning network and Bitcoin is going to become the future of digital payments. Soon you will just buy directly to lightning without big fees anymore so the crash crowd won't have much to talk about. I agree it has been annoying with high fees but quick Micro payments are about to make a big return to Bitcoin now I think.

This seems to be the way the attacks get triggered with cash as unfortunately they are using this to an advantage. In the end what i said below will happen and cash will just lower down the charts.

Everyone needs to get them investigated for fraud with this market manipulation. Take screenshots etc to have multiple proofs from different people etc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:27
I would call it cbase due to the friendships they have.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:48:57
Do you have a Github source etc for these? It would be great to take a look and then code my own lightning network projects.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:37:19
Here is proof: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:13:13
Because cbase is a scam and they must have met ver for some behind closed door handshakes, everyone should should avoid them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:16
Can't wait for that, then lightning zaps them and takes out cash for good. Hopefully the CNBC crew loose a load of money trying to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:36
Lol no way, there will be some insane buy orders on the way. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:35
They probably want to flip to btc when the price is right unless they are an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:50
Lightning network will make it a bit like PayPal but far better. The problem is the fact cryptocurrency is unstable right now but that will get better with time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:16
Can't wait until people flip back to btc and alts then crash it, bcash is getting annoying if you are not always day trading then find it is being pumped and all holds are dipping when you check market cap etc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:08:40
They should always get called "cbase" now, if they are even around for much longer. They were part of the attack on Bitcoin and scam cash price increase along with cnbc. The company won't be un-aware of things either with sketchy staff members like they claim and will probably try to get the guy that cleans the floors to get arrested when everyone actually in on the scam goes free.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:43:18
Thanks slush and also for Trezor, keep holding guys.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:29:51
Yes but probably only if this maintains or to quick sell to fiat. They are a whale and want to manipulate the cryptocurrency market.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:16:22
No it looks like Roger Ver went in on Ethereum. No doubt due to a big lack of faith in Bitcoin Cash and just keeping lots for the pump and dump started by Korea whales. Clearly not going to hold once the pumpers go back into Bitcoin, he is gambling on Ether being top now since he went in on it which means he lacks faith in Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:34:24
Nice graphic but not sure why it even matters to be honest, it is mining based etc for all cryptocurrencies there will be whales and people highly involved. Roger ver would be in control of cash etc in terms of whales and he has clearly dumped to ether and the rest to hold for another later. Its just like holders of the most coins for any other coins also.
Mining wise couldn't Jihan Wu or John mcafee etc just mine any other alt instead if they wanted or already are also? They are different because they have gradually built up the coins held rather than being the developers they worked towards being where they are right now. Glad they are supporting BTC to be honest, good for Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:21:24
Great point, these forks give the perfect opportunity for people to pump and dump and since the whales get free money that they want to add more value to. That is the main reason why so many whales have taken part with cash.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:17:27
Dips equal buy walls
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:34:56
Roger Ver went in on Ethereum, he lacks faith in Cash. Whales cashing out on the pump and dump should start coming back into Bitcoin and miners going into cash should switch back to BTC once the big pump and dump finishes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:56:26
Well if they want back in on number one at least they have to buy in higher later if they cash out to fiat. It will put more drive into improving btc. The whales will go back to bitcoin though of course. 
I wonder if ver had been talking to ether and korea planning to put ether to number one and make loads of profit from it a long time ago.

If anything it gets rid of spam adverts and fake ico sales which give cryptocurrency a bad reputation. As long as they don't block cryptocurrency communities on Facebook and search results in Google then it doesn't make much difference really. 
They will still list legit businesses which take cryptocurrency as payments and the world is now aware of them more and more as time passes.
