It is proof of burn. Throughout January people burned bitcoin to obtain xcp (the currency of counterparty). No more xcp were/will ever be created after this time. However, counterparty is built on the bitcoin blockchain, so xcp are sent and received on normal bitcoin addresses.

Haha possibly the dumbest thing I have ever heard

Can you not get buyers to pay via bank transfer? I usually do this and it works well. You have less of a delay for the price to fluctuate and means you don't have to go and meet people either.

Hey guys...the value is well over 3x what it was 24 hours ago
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:16:05
Maybe people don't really understand that yet.

I got one of these late december 2013, for 4.15 bitcoins I think...made back around 3.5 coins and sold it in February as the difficulty had gone up so much it was barely making anything by then. Do you get anything out of these any more?

It costs 0.5 xcp to create a new asset. This is burned and destroyed forever. So it is a deflationary currency. I think.

I posted 4 months ago about this guy investing in bitpay and got downvoted to shit

If you're interested in trading bitcoin for gold on the counterparty decentralised exchange, try out  They work with Agora and Diamond state depository.

I don't think you understand, the burn was not done so that bitcoins become worth more. Proof of burn is a way to distribute xcp (counterparty tokens) fairly. This only occurred once, for one month, with a tiny amount of bitcoins in the grand scheme of things. Consequently, there is now a protocol that can be used for a whole range of decentralised applications with huge potential benefits. Did you even read the article?

Thanks, yeah was thinking about giving this a read. I might try it out, learning about some applications could be a good follow up to the technical detail of 'mastering bitcoin'.

Hi yes as mentioned I'm half way through reading this at the moment

No problem. 'The Internet of Money' is a good one for beginners or just as a good source of high level information. It's a collection of Andreas Antonopoulos' talks that have been cleaned up a bit. Not very technical, but definitely a solid intro.

The cheapest way is to buy on an exchange like bitstamp or Kraken that allow you to deposit euros. However, if you send money directly from a UK bank you will be charged fees for an international bank transfer and given a poor exchange rate. This ends up adding quite the premium (~3%). Here's how you can get around this:
1) Download Revolut App and set up account - They offer spot price on exchange rates from GBP to EUR. Top up Revolut account with GBP and exchange to EUR. Do this on a weekday and there are no fees.
2) Download Fire app and set up/verify account. Fire will give you both a GBP and EUR account once fully verified (requires 3 documents (e.g. bank statement and ID) and about 2 days). Send EUR from Revolut to your Fire EUR account.
3) You can then deposit EUR to an exchange such as bitstamp or Kraken directly from your Fire EUR account. I think Bitstamp charges 0.05% and Kraken if free. It might be possible to send directly from Revolut to the exchange, but heard of a few people having their accounts frozen for trying that. Using Fire as well is tried and tested method.
This allows you to get a good exchange rate and avoid fees. However, if you are only buying a small amount (e.g. £100), I wouldn't bother with all this as you're only saving a few pounds. But definitely worth it for larger purchases.

Yeah don't see why not. Haven't tried other exchanges, but pretty sure this method can be used to deposit to any exchange that accepts euros.

Great Idea and happy St Patrick's day!

I know, I'm very optimistic for bitcoin but like any rational person should, I acknowledge it is a risky investment. It just makes logical sense to realise gains, especially when they are that big. You're right that emotions: greed in particular, are the problem.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:05:03
I couldn't agree more. I think a good way to look at it is to imagine how you would feel if bitcoin went to 0 and you lost everything you could have had (which is a possibility). If you even cash out 10% of your total that still multiplies your original investment by nearly 10x (roughly).
Personally, I would sell at least 1/3. But no-one should tell you how to spend your money so good luck!
