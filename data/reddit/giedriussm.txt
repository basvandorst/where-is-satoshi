I can make educated predictions without pretending I know something for sure (have a crystal ball). Hope it helps.

I know nothing for certain just like anyone else here, disregarding all the fancy TA.
My point - a dip following a bounce back after a significant correction is something to be expected. You can watch the current price movement with caution, sure. However, to me this is perfectly normal and I would be surprised if this market just went from 420 billion to &gt;800 billion without any temporary move downwards in the meantime. 
Will it test the previous lows again? No one knows. My guess, the market will not go below 500 billion. I apply similar projections to Bitcoin in particular as well. But I'm not trying to pretend I have a crystal ball.

You did not expect it will rebound in one jump, did you? We had a correction and it started building its way up after the lowest point. Now we will undergo a couple of minor (~10%) dips on our way to the pre-correction levels. This is one of those dips.

At the moment, it's 3,000 vs 1,300 (scale out on the order list to see the better totals). 
I wonder where are they going to put 1,700 (and counting) BCH after the trading starts.
You shall not pass the $4,330.

Do not care. I knew it won't stay. Just proves my point. And if it wasn't removed, my other expectation would be downvoting. So either way, it was acceptable to me at the time of writing. 
Have a nice day.

+5 BCH also that you didn't even mention. Incredible. Glad for him!

It is safe, at least it is not a scam exchange. Cannot comment on their security level, never heard about them getting hacked or smth. so far. 
Am using it for a couple of years now as fiat gateway. Main drawbacks - high fees, deposits take a day to arrive, very few coins available, limited functionality.

If it recovers from where it is rn, then it's a higher low and possibly more of a symmetrical triangle than a descending wedge. In that case I'd expect a break out to the upside first half of September.
Going to 9300-9400 and rebounding from there to me would confirm the wedge case.
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:32:48
At this point it is hard to make any call. It just moved from $10600 to 10200 on a high volume and is currently close to the bottom trend line of the symmetrical triangle, which is at around 10000-10100.
It could have enough momentum to break through it, in which case it could go to 9500 and confirm, once again, a descending wedge, which is an alternative TA setup many traders watch for. This would change the perspective from positive (symmetrical triangle being a continuation of the previous upwards trend) to negative (descending wedge potentially breaking out downwards below 9000).
So unless there is confirmation of the next big move (significant change in price further away from the current bottom trend line and on high volume for confidence), we cannot really make a strong call and it's just gambling.

Bitcoin is superior to both fiat and gold (and silver). And is in a very different stage of its lifecycle as an asset. Many new use cases are yet to be discovered, ecosystem is being built around it with no peak in sight. Thus, the price driving factors are not really the same.
Gold and silver will be partially replaced by Bitcoin as a store of value. BTC price will diverge from both fiat and gold and will outperform them in the nearest decades. Gold will lose part of its relevance as a hedge because of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will first work as alternative hedge instrument to gold and one day overtake gold as the primary one.

Assuming you're talking about price analysis, I like:  
\- Data Dash:  [  
\- Kevin Svenson:  [
But don't blindly follow any of them. And many just seek for attention with radical price calls and strong titles, but actually know very little and don't care about your investment performance at all.

It might, but we never know.
A couple of price movement option I'm considering at the moment based on TA:  
a) recovering from current levels and forming a symmetrical triangle with a breakout upwards first half of September  
b) forming a descending wedge with wedge bottom at $9500, breakout further down second half of September  
c) moving downwards in a descending channel with the next lower low at $8300  
d) forming a descending broadening wedge with the next lower low at $7500
I don't expect it to go below $7500.  
In order for a) or b) to stand true, the price should recover from $9,7-9,4k. That's why I'm DCAing at these levels. If they won't hold, I'll consider adding at $8300 and/or $7500.
Again, that's just how I see it, not pretending to know anything.

It went down \~20% from its recent high. I would consider this point to DCA. Just no "all in" nonsense.  
Just a personal opinion.

China must have decentralized and democratic foundation. And cryptos are gonna give it to them. Communist Chinese government knows that and is trying to fight it.

Sad to see your only/primary motivation to be part of the EU is financial support. EU is so much more than that. And all of us should seek to one day aid and support others, not to be funded the entire time.
