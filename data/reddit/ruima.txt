There is zero reporting in Chinese media that Huobi is insolvent, no chatter on this at all in the community. Given their new capital raise, highly doubtful that this would be true anyway.  It's a bit scary the amount of (deliberate and malicious) rumor-mongering going on.

Translation of and analysis by actual Chinese people / thought leaders on Bitcoin in China. 
I also thought the Bloomberg and some other news source headlines were irresponsible at worst, incomplete at best.

thanks for submitting this. i helped with the research and must say we queried most of the most respected members of the bitcoin community in china, all of whom were actually happy to be on the record as they didn't see it as a controversial topic at all. there were even a few who didn't get to be included as it got to be too long. as for the payment company rumors going on right now, that's still ongoing, and if you read the article, is actually already anticipated by some members of the community and not inconsistent with the spirit of the notice.

Also for those who are interested in what those rumors are you can click on my name and see my comments on the other threads. 
Additionally, for a far more detailed and critical post (very long and in Chinese) on the Dec 5th statement requiring way more knowledge of Chinese culture and politics (and which we didn't include/translate because it was a lot of commentary and critique versus objective interpretation) this is a great post -

The equivalent of "tweet" in China is the weibo (microblog,  is the original with several other competitors) which is 140 Chinese Unicode characters which can express this just fine.

This was the rumor, which I also posted on my Twitter ( and broke on Chinese media as well (6:28 PM).
However, please note that as of RIGHT NOW, it is STILL UNSUBSTANTIATED. The Chinese article further goes to say that the original weibo post as well as all of the forwards (ie retweets) have been deleted (by the users themselves, presumably) and that the truth of it is thus impossible to verify. In a weibo post, OKCoin (leading exchange) did say that there was a meeting of third party payment providers, but said that they were awaiting conclusions, and once again, as of now, has not actually released any news.

Post re: payment meeting: 
But for those of you who are dying of curiosity, here is what the rumor / deleted tweet actually said:
The Payment and Settlement Division of the Central Bank of China asked in the morning of Dec. 16 to speak with major payment providers, and Deputy Director General Jinhuang Zhou, for the purposes of preventing money laundering and consumer protection, assessed the risks related to Bitcoin and requested that: prohibit banks and payment companies from providing payment and clearing services to Bitcoin, Litecoin, and similar trading platforms.  For companies already providing services, they should cease providing such services.  For existing deposits, cash withdrawals can be made by Spring Festival (Chinese New Year in 2014 is January 31).  No companies shall provide any such new payment services.
