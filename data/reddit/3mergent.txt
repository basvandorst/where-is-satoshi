I see, my bad. Didn't catch that first time around.

I mean, he showed you one facet of his beliefs because that's what the discussion centered around from the getgo. I wouldn't claim he's disillusioned, just cognizant of the world we live in and not swayed by arguments usually canned by the government that benefits most from their proponents. 
Crypto is neither necessary nor sufficient for revolutionary liberation of the human race, but it is a damn good start.

All fine reasons to enter the market no doubt. Some of those reasons I share with you. 
I wouldn't call it an argument either. Just a friendly discussions of differences. Hopefully we all walk away learning something from it.

I got hard reading that. Excellent post.

Lots of reasons. You can get access to others' money because you've shown you can at least manage it well enough to have a million. You can leverage debt at multiples of your million. You can get access to investment opportunities that are blocked by net worth minimums. The list goes on.

I just took your advice because you did not explicitly make it clear in every one of your posts that you are not a lawyer. Now I'm out the money it took to counter-sue.
Expect to be served by end of the week.

Message sent. I'm looking to buy a Linux laptop (possibly more than one) and would really like to use Bitcoin.
Anybody know of System76 competitors?

Fair enough, then. From that perspective, it's pretty effective.

I think she's doing a great experiment with this project. And giving decent publicity as well.
But for someone who is effectively trying to live on a currency in its infancy, she's doing a terrible job at it. She seemingly knows nothing about it, and has clearly done very little research.

No, it's exactly the same criticisms Bitcoiners use against fiat. It's completely the wrong way to go about things. Closed-source, central issuance, non-equitable distribution, etc.
It's not shit because it's different from Bitcoin - it's shit because it's precisely the same as fiat.

Can't tell if serious...
