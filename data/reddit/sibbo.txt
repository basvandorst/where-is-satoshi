How do I add a comment to the transaction?
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:33:18
Yeah, and the only content is a complete ripoff.

So I need an account there? Or is it possible to do so that it gets saved in the blockchain?

Thanks for the answer. Do I get a warning from bitcoin-qt if I need to do the backup again?
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:17:56
That's cool
I hope that GUI gets implemented soon.

Well, I just got the mail from the support.

That's what I got today. And before I send this request, bitcoin directed to information about 1/8 of a dollar.






























known as cryptocurrency, not as special fraction of a dollar.

Gave feedback.

Is there a client that supports all those fancy transaction types? bitcoin-qt seems not to.
