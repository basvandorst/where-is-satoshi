not sure why people keep repeating this. bitcoin can absolutely be worth EXACTLY what it is today
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:12:13
can i see the math behind that?
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:42:45
There is no federal death penalty

I cant believe how irrational people (such as OP) are.  If the bitcoin price is declining and you dont sell (and rebuy when lower) then you are basically giving away BTC for free.  Doesnt matter how much you believe in its success, or think the price will be XXX in X years. When something is declining in value smart people sell it, its really that simple.

Very legit.  I have used them several times without issue.
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:26:40
Do you know this as a fact or just wildly speculating?
@_date: 2014-08-22 21:32:57
Great question, I will also point out that there is no mention of this policy on their website: 
Also, the customer is not informed that a gift card will be issued then they request an RMA
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:20:48
I say go for it, the potential upside is huge.  This idea of "dont invest more than you can lose" is cliche non-sense. If you continually do your homework and make smart investments then youll always come out on top.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:50:47
Maybe true, but that still doesnt mean you shouldnt sell today.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:25:47
haha cheers mate

1. You can decrypt BIP38 wallets running bitaddress.org on an offline computer.
2. Also if you tested the encryption by importing a BIP38, yes you would compromise SOME level of security but youre still better off than using non-encrypted wallets. Someone would have to take physical possession of your paper wallet AND hack your phone.
3. As far as storing your BIP38 passphrase, i think an encrypted flash drive is a good bet.  An encrypted file on google drive or something is alright too.

Therefore, i should be okay with being lied to? And its not true that this is standard practice, many companies have great service.  Chat with an amazon rep online lately!?

Cool.  I believe this bag belongs to you...
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:04:01
you are 100% missing the point
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:28:02
nope. wrong again. but judging from your post posts not sure why anyone is surprised. This IS the bottom.  Buy now kids and thank me later.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:15:48
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:22:27
I never requested a BTC refund.  I would be 100% okay with a refund in USD.  Sorry if there was confusion about that point.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:52:06
Sell now or cry later!!!
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:32:32
haha, cool story bro.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:04:25
this is pathetic 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:35:46
Youre a funny little guy
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:24:58
How do you know, were you looking over my shoulder.  That message is apparently a new addition and was not there when i checked out.
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:29:08
Of course nobody knows "100%" if something will go up or down, but if you're smart you can make an educated prediction and be right more times than you are wrong. That 99% statistic is ridiculous. Look at the BTC trend...downward since Jan.  Doesnt take a genius to predict the trend.
I know holding "feels" like its neutral risk, but youre actually losing big in a bear market.
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:19:47
Does anyone know the limits/fees?
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:05:24
thanks for the money!
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:16:04
Why would you think i hate it? It made me 6 figs. I love it too.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:54:34
The guy is a scammer and gambling addict 
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:22:06
Haha, calm down dude. That message was not displayed when I made my purchase.  
@_date: 2014-08-23 00:49:16
I really dont think asking a company to deliver on a promise is being "whiny".  Perhaps I'm wrong.  
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:23:42
Bitcoin will be truly successful when it out competes other payment methods on an even playing field.
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:07:49
Fees are much higher! Coinbase/circle are ~1% where as trucoin was ~9% when i purchased.
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:18:10
First personal attacks only make yourself look foolish.  Second, my problem is not at all with the service rep, but with the several supervisors I spoke to who refused to correct their mistake.  Mistakes happen, I understand that. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:30:06
How long ago did you request?
@_date: 2014-07-12 14:48:44
Not if youre smart about it.  The key is knowing the sweat spot for reselling the hardware.  For example I purchased a bunch of used Antminer S1s, mined for a couple months, and sold for &gt;85% of what I paid.  The profit is always in reselling the hardware at the right time.
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:52:48
By that logic no one should ever trade stocks
@_date: 2014-11-04 03:27:21
Just used your service. The overall cost after the posted exchange rate and the "processing fee" was around 9% above bitstamp rate. Most bitcoiners will see that markup as outrageous price gouging.!
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:27:15
Sell sell sell!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:55:17
Wild card bitches!!!!!
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:41:55
Their bitcoin return policy is not stated on their site
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:20:46
Purchased a few K when btc was ~$10 sold at the top
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:57:27
bitfury data center...google it
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:42:55
I do expect an employ whos primary job is to answer customers questions to understand basic return policies.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:23:40
becuase the price is crashing. BTC is finally exposed as a huge scam.  Just wanted to thank everyone.
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:13:39
We need to hold all representatives of a company accountable regardless of their wage level.  If newegg cant keep their reps informed then why do they even have this chat service in the first place.
Bottom line is a made a decision to return an item based on the information I received from a rep (should i have called the CEO?).  I feel its reasonable to feel deceived.
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:16:20
Wrong man. Here are the exact numbers
Begging to end total costs at 20:12 EST
Coinbase: 1 btc is $339.36 (1.09% above bitstamp)
Trucoin: 1 btc is $366.67 (9.16% above bitstamp)
Bitstamp: 1 btc is $335.89

Bitcoin mining contracts through ebay are a great way to get started.  And you can use your credit card!
@_date: 2014-10-11 16:46:03
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:23:12
Would be up way more if you sold 10 months ago...funny huh
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:51:35
A little over 9% above bitstamp price.  Yikes!!! What a rip.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:07:25
Mining contracts on ebay are a great way to get started, and you can even use your credit card.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:22:28
i hope you see the irony of your statement.
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:09:13
Understand that newegg uses bitpay and instantly exchanges BTC for USD. It reasons that they could issue the refund in USD and not lose a cent. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:22:56
Im sure that would make you feel better...
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:03:55
what is cost averaging? 
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:16:57
Making a mistake is one thing.  Refusing to fix it is another.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:07:37
by that logic you should buy stock in every failing company.  
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:55:47
not really.  I use my CC and my bills get paid same day with zero fees.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:57:38
So glad i sold everything when it was at $600
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:00:07
will r/bitcoin help this man buy drugs...stay tuned
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:10:11
no it is.  its the currency of the future!
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:46:09
Perfectly sums up r/bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:41:03
Thats not what syntax means.
