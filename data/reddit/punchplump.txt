Putting all your eggs in one basket is generally really stupid ofcourse, but in the case of Bitcoin if you can handle the 300% volatility swings it's much better than gold in the long run (better risk-reward than gold). You can also use bitreserve.org to have your Bitcoins stored as Dollars and be imume to volatility (but also imume to profits)!

You can't safely store private keys on a phone. And when having signed with an offline private key once on that phone, that private key is compromised.

Yeah that looked promising indeed, but it doesn't look like that supports printing and such.
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:55:29
I use  for that, but be careful since it's Alpha.

It looks like Zbar isn't working anymore...

Without independed auditing a hardware wallet is useless, right?
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:32:31
Bitcoin, Counterparty, Maidsafe and Etherium are going to change the world. Usually everything that allows us to trade between that and Bitcoin helps Bitcoin positively.

I estimate that a company can still sell this profitably for under $200 (in a few years under $100). A device like this supports both your whole (potentially many multi-million Dollar) capital and spending wallet so it's worth it i imagine!

It could be that we already are in the first correction in 5 years contrary to what people think (most technical people think we have 1 more move up coming before the correction of the past 5 years starts).
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:43:25
Yup we know that for a few years now but the general public are sheep just following the herd and never try to research anything themselves or take any risk. So i bet this will take 2 or 3 more years when it should be done in 1.
@_date: 2014-12-14 06:07:56
Both good suggestions, i'll look into it.  
  
thanks a lot!
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:41:11
I don't think there's a hardware wallet yet that solves all of our problems, is there? :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:45:00
I don't use Armory because my understanding is that you need the blockchain on your PC to be able to send the transaction.  
  
But you are right that i might as well switch to that in the future to get rid of having to rely on Electrum servers.

We need a huge improvement in user interfaces, user experience and marketing in the Bitcoin/decentralized web/internet 2.0 space.
@_date: 2014-12-14 09:55:28
Sounds amazing, i hope it's easy and fast when they are done implementing it!
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:15:55
What trade offs are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:46:04
Keep in mind that Bitcoin is quite hard to understand, for example Changetip isn't using Bitcoin. Only when you Withdraw from Changetip you are using Bitcoin again.

QR scanning seems more secure to me.
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:26:52
Hmm so basicly the only problem with Android wallets is that we need an extra device to sign offline and i guess that is easily solvable with NFC devices like a key card for the second key of a multisig address?
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:22:11
It's just an extra layer of security that i haven't seen before either but makes sense to me.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:25:28
Look back in 5-10 years when Bitcoin is almost as stable as the Dollar or Euro. We are in the early adopters phase, only after the final phase can volatility be normal.
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:46:22
You can make a website with a Bitcoin address, you can use Counterparty, Mastercoin protocol, NXT or Swarm or a centralized platform like Kickstarter.
And yeah we really really really need to reach 100's of millions of people to see a 1 hour presentation of Andreas Antonopoulos or whoever to inform them properly and correct all misunderstandings about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:49:59
You expose your private key to your phone, this makes your cold storage a hot storage after scanning a private key.
@_date: 2014-12-14 09:36:22
Oh through audio cables? That sounds super secure. I thought you meant from speakers to microphone or something.
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:59:39
Does it work with proof of burn or something? And how does it differ from colored coins?
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:49:35
Is btcjam.com what u mean?
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:45:50
In that case u only setup the multisig and leave it at home and use it to securely send funds to your phone.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:24:19
You can be 100% paranoid though :p
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:20:09
If you have the discipline go for a Bitcoin and hold it for a few years. You will likely be amazed what it will be worth when you look at your investment in a couple of years.  
&amp;nbsp;  
P.S.: are you aware that you can buy Bitcoins in 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:50:47
Guys, what about through HDMI? Anyone ever tried this? Is that even secure?  
&amp;nbsp;  
And what about the serial (COM) port? Is that secure enough?
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:03:20
Investing in the Bitcoin currency is a hell of a lot better (1000's of times) than investing in a lottery!
People WILL buy Bitcoins in the next years, but we are still in the early adopters phase so that's why the general people aren't even close to buyin Bitcoins yet.
If you DO buyin now though, you will be 10-100x (or more) richer in the future ;)
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:40:45
They will try to screw us in every way possible, don't worry :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:04:29
Ok, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:04:05
You can download bitaddress.org from [here]( (does support BIP38 encryption) and type in your private key in the wallet details tab on a **permanently offline computer**.  
 
Signing a transaction you also need to do on a permanently offline device. I think Electrum and Armory are currently the best wallets to do that with. It is recommended to generate your private keys (or seed) with those wallets then though.

This is exactly why 95%+ of the people lose money trading, not our problem.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:46:30
I think the address is a compressed key to make it shorter. For specifics ask Google ;)
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:33:51
Even if we shoot for a couple of % of the world economy using Bitcoin we are already talking about a price of $100,000+ easy per full Bitcoin unit.

For starters help that person with installing a phone wallet and then send some Satoshi's. Also mention all the main advantages of a cryptocurrency (full control over your money, global, almost zero fee's, limited supply, irreversability, no transaction limit, etc.) and 2.0 features like decentralized voting, identification, exchanging, lending, smart contracts, cloud storage, micropayments and DNS.
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:43:41
NO :)
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:45:42
uhhh greed? :)
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:54:17
At least 2% of the world economy i would consider a success for Bitcoin. Ideally 10-20%.
