Even if mining is a zero sum game, this guy isn't mining himself. He's renting out the space as a colo. As long as people pay him enough to cover the costs and make a profit, it doesn't matter how much actually gets mined or what the coins are worth.

I love how you go from "hire an engineer" to "don't trust engineers".
Given that this building is in the US, is being used for commercial purposes, and they have insurance, they almost certainly had building permits issued and inspections out the wazoo from the power company and fire department.
The power company just won't run 13kV lines capable of delivering over a megawatt of power to someone without making sure they can handle it without setting themselves on fire.

Nonsensical positive posts like this are worse than the nonsensical troll posts and comments that plague At least the trolls get downvoted, but this guy gets tons of upvotes for his ridiculous, meaningless, substanceless rants.
I don't know if americanpegasus is trolling or not, but he's been making posts like this in and for YEARS about pennystocks and other shitty investments.

It doesn't matter how many there are. If they don't like you and catch you using one, you are the one that gets in trouble, not the app's author.
