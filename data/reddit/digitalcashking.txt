I’d prefer the 1000% thx. 500% just doesn’t get me hard anymore.

The only reason it could possibly hurt is if you put too much in. Seriously, if you put an equal amount of fiat into gold and it dropped by 1% you’d feel the same way. Crypto does 10-20% swings on the regular. Get out or buckle up.

This is called the square peg in round hole condition. If it’s a third party anything it’s a trusted system and therefore untrustworthy.

I almost did back in December. Ended up putting a bunch of cash I had saved up instead. I could have easily afforded the loan amount but im so anti interest payments I couldn’t pull the trigger. Obviously hindsight is 20/20 but I didn’t get to where I am by making irresponsible financial decisions.

Whoever is on the other side is obviously just fishing for anything you’ll give them. I don’t personally know what but really? Free bitcoin from some stranger on the internet? You really had the idea they had good intentions? 
Not to bust your ass but SERIOUSLY? This is the crap that give crypto a bad name.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:52:55
Can you easily manage the debt and have a way to deal with it if you lose a job or your car shits the bed? If no, sell. If yes, hodl. Personally i fucking hate any type of debt even my mortgage at 2.77% so I’d sell and pay it off.

I’d like to see that too but the reality is, after such a drop, 90% of the ppl here would be too chicken shit to buy into it. Just last December it was 3200 and I highly doubt many ppl from here bought in.  I did, and now I can laugh at all the “bought at 10k, I’m so fucking smart” ppl.

If I put the money I’ve spent on booze over the last 4 years into bitcoin instead I’d be mortgage free, retired and have a maid strictly for dusting my balls and doing my wife’s hair. Now I have to do her hair and she begrudgingly dusts my balls if I get her drunk enough. Such is life.

If you invest money you don’t need,  it essentially becomes play money. I’m a decent poker player so I’m used to making bets that may or may not win. 3k btc looked like a solid play.

Facebooks Libra is a stable coin and quite separate from the broader crypto sphere. In what possible way is pumping BTC benefiting Facebook or Libra? The news may be affecting the price but to say its Facebook pumping it is ridiculous and dare I say it, retarded.

As someone who bought sub 1k and never sold, I fill my bowl of ramen in hodl tears. Jk, didn’t and wouldn’t sell at 20k. I believe my grandchildren will have a shrine to me at some point. I did call the 3k bottom though and added.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:20:06
To be a true crypto investor you must wait until it peaks before you buy. Buy high sell low that’s how we bitcoiners go!

This is the 3rd time I’ve seen 10k bitcoin. So far it’s been 66.66667% good news.

The only ppl hating 11k btc are the ones who fomo’d in during a large pump. As a sub 1k-3k, I’m perfectly happy at 11k.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:27:49
I wasn’t 100% sure but the next bottom was 1600 so even if I was wrong it’s still pretty good odds that I’d be right.

Customer is the wrong word here but just because it costs me $12k to create something is no guarantee anybody will purchase it. If price doesn’t increase, many miners will stop and the difficulty will decrease making it cheaper to mine for the survivors. In the most basic sense.
