Thats a lie.  This is not a random picture.

Ask him to predict what it will be in 2 weeks
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:52:38
Only?  That's crazy
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:07:41
 maybe one day people start buying stuff with it instead of just using it as an investment
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:22:03
Yeah, any system that forces you into a transaction without exposing all of the costs before the transaction is no bueno.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:13:51
It would add value to the price and reduce the extreme volatility. If it's only a purely speculative device then the price will vary wildly.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:12:58
The same thing as a check manufacturers. A way to pay for products. The value is in being government neutral but people actually have to use it for its advantage to have value.

Makes no sense because Visa implies a credit limit which varies per person
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:11:13
I agree but we need real solutions.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:00:51
 And that's why I like my Visa card. If a transaction is incorrect I can dispute it and reverse the charges. Bitcoin really leaves you hanging out to dry
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:05:40
You absolutely did. I had a day laborer digging a ditch on my property you said he had Bitcoin and was going to make a ton of money off it. Just like the lottery. Same mentality.
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:23:29
 nicely done I wish there was some place in my town that took Bitcoin. The whole idea of investing in it is what's killing it and I would love to see it being used much more
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:23:56
It seems to be shutting itself down pretty well on its own by dropping in price
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:12:20
Did they mention that people need to use it as currency and not just hold onto it like a Penthouse magazine ?
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:36:14
Another investor.  Does anyone buy stuff with it?
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:20:08
The Panic hold happens in the stock and bond market also when people are not confident of fundamentals of the investment they purchased.  It indicates that you bought the wrong financial instrument. It's critical to understand the risk of every instrument you buy so that when it has volatility it is understandable.  Panic holds most often happen in Investments equivalent to  gambling
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:32:03
Bitcoin is not an investment.  Its gambling.  If you want to learn about investing try bogleheads.

He's just too old to try or want to understand its strengths and weaknesses.  He even says so as does Charlie Munger.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:39:23
 don't be silly. Of course I understand it. It's a get-rich-quick scheme. I buy $50,000 worth of bitcoin today and I'll be worth 20 million next year. Woohoo I'm going to be rich I'm going to be rich I'm going to be rich rich rich
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:10:19
 that is absolutely certain, unless it's not
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:06:21
Might as well buy lottery tickets
