Do you use Bitcoin for daily errands and purchases you make during the day? 
How has Bitcoin made your life better? 
If you could change 3 aspects of Bitcoin today, what would they be? 
Thanks Gavin !! Much respect to you and your family for supporting Bitcoin development :)

Love the video as well! You just earned yourself a like, favorite, and loyal subscriber. Check out my idea over here:
It's a commercial for Bitcoin that I am looking to get crowdfunded over on kickstarter to get aired on national television !
Would be ecstatic if you gave us permission to use this video for our Kickstarter campaign / video. This is just the type of humor we are looking for !
I will be donating some Bitcoin regardless though for your amazing time and effort on producing this AMAZING animation. Please PM if you want to join the kickstarter campaign as well. You could be a great asset. We are open sourcing our operations as much we can and are trying to collaborate with as many prominent figures in the reddit community as possible.

Any idea what's up with the "daily drip" app? No idea how I got it

LOVE the idea of a force field kind of effect when the bankers try to interfere with a Bitcoin transaction. Definitely will incorporate this somehow. Thanks CHRISKODD :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:50:43
I like where you're going with this. Anyone have something to add to this? 
Keep it up Redditors! 
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:39:11
Love the open-sourced nature of this project. Check out what I've got stirring up here on reddit also:
The first open-sourced Bitcoin commercial + kickstarter campaign to get it to air on national television.
Thanks for all your contributions to the Bitcoin community. Your legal advice will be closely followed for my future projects as well.

I really wouldn't be surprised if marketing teams from all these ASIC companies are downvoting and commenting negatively on this post and other complaints on reddit. They're already censoring their forums to hell anyways 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:47:07
3. No profits here sir. These are ad-free videos intended to support our community ;)
I like where you're going with this but remember that we don't want to support shady transactions (anonymous prepaid cards) nor do I intend on making this a publicity stunt for Circle.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:24:34
nice social engineering !! Feel bad for those who actually store their bitcoin on such software.

My spin off: 
Cut to the front yard of a suburban home. An attractive girl in her 20s or 30s appoaches the mailbox and recovers what is seen in a close up shot to be a credit card statement. Cut to a wide shot of the front door where she is seen for a brief second slamming the door.
Cut to a one-second close up shot of her putting her keys down on a table, inside the home, by the front door. Cut to a close up shot of coffee being poured into a coffee cup from a coffee maker, the protagonist grabs the steaming hot mug and the camera follows the mug in motion as though it is attached to it (simple 2d, position, and rotational motion tracking and scaling). Cut to wide angle shot where the girl is scene with an expression of shock, joy, and excitement. Cut to a close up of the statement where we see that her boyfriend had purchased a very expensive diamond ring. Cut to the previous wide angle shot where we see the girls happy and ecstatic reaction as she appears to read further down the list. Cut to previous close up of the statement but this time rack focusing further down the list, we see charges for a new apartment, a couples massage, makeup, sushi, and other charges from restuarants. Cut to the previous wide angle shot where we see the protagonist quite confused and then slowly transitioning into a somewhat angry/ jaw-dropping expression of shock. During this entire skit we leave christmas decorations and ornaments around as well as possibly play Christmas related music. 
Cut and creatively transition to a scene where the boyfriend and girlfriend are sitting on a love sofa surrounded by family and friends huddling around the Christmas tree and standing around talking to each other. There is a fireplace lit in the background as well as numerous Christmas ornaments everywhere. Cut to dynamic shot where the camera is seen sliding backwards away from the subjects. The boyfriend is seen with his arm around his girlfriend. His girlfriend has an unwrapped present on her lap. She looks up at her boyfriend, smiles, and asks, "So when am I getting my other gifts?"
Boyfriend: "What other gifts?"
Girlfriend: "Ohhhh I don't knowwww. Maybe a massage, an apartment, or perhaps a ring?"
Boyfriend:"Oh sure I'll give you a massage babe (begins to turn her around to massage her neck/shoulders). But a ring? Not sure what you- (suddenly cuts off)"
- Girlfriend stands up with a stern look in her face staring deep into his eyes, she seems very angry. She takes a step away in disgust.
Boyfriend: "Oh crap"
Girlfriend proceeds to chuck an entire glass full of egg nog right at her boyfriends face. (Optional: This is seen in slow motion for a brief 2 seconds and then gradually within 20 frames returns to normal time where) We see a wide shot of the boyfriends' face covered in egg nog (on the left side of the frame) and two rows of attached 3d text falls from above, onto the ground, saying, "Should have used Bitcoin"(on the right side of the frame). A deep-voiced narrator repeats those words as they fall to the ground with simulated dynamics and shadows created in Cinema 4d.
Cue in a white faded-in background, a 3d logo quickly rotates into place and scales up from just a few pixels, the logo transitions into our familiar 2d bitcoin logo, a tagline of some sort slides in from the side of the frame including the words, "Pseudonymous, Instant, Secure, and Reliable" (Please help me come up with a better tagline. I think mine could use some work.) 
I'm pretty tired right now I'll adjust this idea here and there some more tomorrow. But for now, I'm finishing up a second reddit post about turning this idea into a more of a crowd-sourced/ open-sourced project. I'll explain more tomorrow morning. Be sure to check out my follow up post on tomorrow morning! It will include some VERY big news... I promise :)

Honestly I think that Bitcoin needs its own marketing team. Check out my idea over here:

I purchased a miner on January 12 of this year and have requested a refund over 8 weeks ago. I have yet to receive a check in the mail and wait anxiously for them to make things right with their customers. If I could be of any help please let me know. I would love to see Cointerra go down. They are as corrupt if not worse, than BFL. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:18:30
Producing this in such a way would be an interesting feat and accomplishment. You are absolutely correct that creative content produced by committee is rarely good. But, if we can strategically plan this out together with a few authoritative forces leading the way, we can create what would be the equivalent of an open-sourced marketing directive. I'm not suggesting building a channel, project, or website for everyone to spam their own creative content. This can be something where people around the world can contribute in any possible way. Whether it be actors, screenplay writers, camera operators, or already established film production groups with all the equipment we need to make this happen, we can utilize production resources and talents offered from all parts of the world to collaborate on marketing Bitcoin with unilateral support from the community.
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:07:29
Interesting.. I'm actually considering a visit to San Jose within the next few weeks anyways. Would be fun to meet up with them and collaborate on this project. Can you get me in contact with them?
Love their site by the way.

"For things you'd be happy to see on your statement, there's credit cards. For stuff you don't, there's Bitcoin"
HAHAHAH, I like that slogan !
Perhaps there's a husband who recently purchased porn, sex toys, or something embarrassing like that, and his kids or wife grabs hold of his paypal or credit card statement. Then there's a scenario in which his wife or kids approach him asking about it. He then reacts in some humorous way and in comes that slogan. I like where this is going. Can someone  elaborate on an interesting idea based on this slogan?
Thanks Binlargin :D

I called this place I think and they said  5% which really isn't bad..
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:24:46
Haha I love it! Totally something that I'd be able to accomplish. Let's see what else people come up with. I would definitely spend a week working on this though.
@_date: 2014-10-01 23:25:54
Thanks you kind sir !
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:21:40
Great minds think alike. I already had this written down haha. Thanks for your contribution though !

Exactly :D
So far this is my favorite idea. Keep it up Reddit !!
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:57:10
That is gold. Thanks Didicito. This was my main concern.
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:17:35
I LOVE this idea. We will work on making this happen without a doubt. I already have numerous web developers and start-ups contacting me about developing something very similar to this.

I like this a lot. These bankers would be the same 3 actors and would stand between the customer and cashier. They would grab the wad of cash slip off a few bills for themselves, laugh while looking at each other in a humorous manner. Then cut to various other scenarios like you mentioned. I really do like this idea a lot. Can someone else add to this?
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:38:34
This is what I have in mind. Will be getting to work on this with a team of contributors this week. It seems as though I'm dropping out of college for the semester to get to work on this project !
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:12:04
Haha, and I thought I was special... I got mine today as well. Deposited it today and should find out if it clears tmrw. Wouldn't be surprised to see it bounce!

I'm making a commercial type of video advocating the many benefits of using Bitcoin and to promote Bitcoin. I want to make this a project stemming from the support and collaboration of Reddit. I'm not trying to profit from any of this at all, this is a collaborative effort to help promote Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:35:08
I'm trying not to promote third-parties very much in this commercial. I want this to be centered around Bitcoin and not so much the applications or companies built around it. It's a good commercial but just not what I had in mind. Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:40:32
No way am I letting this opportunity pass! I'm dropping what I'm doing right now and completely dedicating my time and efforts to this project. Stay tuned to what tomorrow's post brings to the table. I'm sure we will all be very ecstatic :D
@_date: 2014-10-01 18:04:28
HAHA, thanks buddy :)

" Cut to a scene with FBI and swat chasing a hooded man down an alley and they are getting closer until he makes a sharp turn into a crowded place and everyone's wearing a hoodie in the open market.
FBI stop and sigh and mummble we lost him... Bitcoin "The people's bail out." "
I really like that part a lot! Let's think of alternative slogans and possibly a sequence of events that leads up to the chase. Keep in mind I do not want to advocate opposition to law enforcement in any way. But I do like the idea of someone blending into a huge crowd of other Bitcoin users. Gives it a feeling of decentralization. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 08:28:27
Wow. Great explanation. We need to raise awareness of what Bitcoin is, how it works, and get the world to finally realize it's potential. Perhaps running tv commercials would be the optimal way to reach a wide audience.
I had an idea I posted here on reddit recently that hit the top post of the day here on our subreddit two days in a row. An open-sourced Bitcoin commercial project. Where we can use crowdfunding to fund a steady stream of Bitcoin commercials to air on national television. I'm working really hard on making this a reality and am in contact with some of the worlds biggest 3d vfx production houses and movie / tv producers all willing to contribute to this project.
Let me know what you guys think:
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:25:50
wow... 
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:11:01
my apologies
@_date: 2014-10-03 10:15:42
Ugh, what a disappointment. No biggie though. I've got the media contacts to make this happen anyways. Thanks for your input :)
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:39:45
Totally have to agree with you This would be the optimal  route if we wanted to make this project a success. I originally envisioned this project being set forth in just this same manner but was concerned about the community seeing this as a way for me to obtain free Bitcoin. I want everyone to experience full transparency and to have the ability to contribute to this project in a very meaningful way. By following your input, I will begin by posting discussions and a timeline/ directive/ synopsis regarding the start-up of this project on the freedcamp project page.
I did not want to post a bitcoin address of mine for donations at first, but if anyone would like to contribute to this project, feel free to send Bitcoin to:
The address is dedicated to this project and I can even send over all the donations to a multi-sig wallet in the future, where community appointed project leads can decide in conjunction with feedback from Reddit users, where our funds should be spent. I promise not to use any of the coins for purposes beyond the benefit of this project and also vow to describe where each and every coin will be spent to allow for full transparency of donation funds. 
I'd graciously accept personal donations in compensation for my time and efforts to my personal Bitcoin wallet at:
I am willing to drop what I'm doing with my life right now and commit to this project full-time for the next few months. However, do not feel obligated to send me Bitcoin. The thrill and experience of creating such a massive film production is well worth my time and allowing me to lead this project is quite a generous compensation in and of itself. I really do appreciate your input and will be following your suggestions very closely :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:13:36
thank you :)
None of these business's are operating by any ethical means whatsoever. All of them lack proper customer support as well as timely delivery of purchased goods, refunds, or replacement devices. Their warranties are all a joke and only cover a very short time frame in which you're practically guaranteed to be SOL after a few weeks of running the machines non-stop. All because they "test" these machines out 24/7 for months before actually shipping them to customers. With countless reports of dust and signs of wear and tear on these devices, this is no longer some conspiracy or false accusation. It's the honest truth. Furthermore, BFL is most certainly not the first company to mine on customers' machines. Cointerra built massive facilities in Texas to accommodate their business model way ahead of production. They purposely built facilities to cool and house their mining machines which they in turn sent over to their enraged customers. 
And btw, in order to receive my refund from Cointerra, I had to do the following:
- Obtain the emails of every single Cointerra employee including upper management
- Spam them emails every 2 or 3 days for 6 months
- Mail actual letters to their headquarters over a dozen times
- Obtain phone contact info for all their upper management including the CEO, CTO, VP of Operations, their lawyer Sunny Kalara, and their VP of Enterprise Software
- Call and leave voicemails every 2 or 3 days to all of upper mgmt as listed above
- And then I even had a buddy of mine who lived in Texas visit their HQ to ask them questions (ended up not letting him into the building)
 
And then to top it all off, the check they finally mailed to me was bounced!!
I had to wait another 3 weeks for a proper check that would not bounce.
Who in the right mind would want to deal with scumbags like them...

This is not some publicity stunt to obtain free bitcoin. This is a collaborative effort to join filmmaking forces from all around the world to produce some amazing content. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:23:00
Most certaintly. A voting process can be implemented to make this happen.
I do not want crowdsourcing to be the primary proponent in this initiative. It will serve as a very reliable and useful asset to allow a method by which the community can contribute.
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:58:18
Good point. We could include that in a sequence of events highlighting the hassles of using modern day finances. Would definitely include this someway.

Thanks a lot! Very helpful resource. I am speaking to complete newcomers to the currency so this seems extremely beneficial.
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:46:07
Very good idea actually. Can someone come up with a skit based on the premise of security? This is honestly Bitcoin's  benefit in my opinion. Cryptographically secure transactions without third-party trust.
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:19:29
This is an idea in the works already. Definitely going to make that happen.
Thanks for your suggestion!
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:31:56
Risky business... would you at least use some form of a professional escrow service?
@_date: 2014-10-01 14:01:59
We can end this by going back to each of the original shots. The same characters are portrayed in the future wearing different clothes and seen using Bitcoin as their preferred currency for trading at the local marketplace, buying a goat, buying a cup of coffee, and much more. During this whole video we havea narrator reciting a single word or phrase describing each scenario. Thanks for your suggestions and :D

I'm just waiting for the day when the Bitcoin developers find a way to circumvent this madness or for the FTC to step in. They already targeted BFL and it's only a matter of time until they take their operations to every other mining company.
It's like a gold rush our here with only the top 1% reeking in our mining profits. Just because these corupt execs and investors hear Bitcoin can easily be stashed and laundered doesn't meant that the FTC can't up their investigative tactics and take these scumbags down.
I'm sure Satoshi would be very disappointed
