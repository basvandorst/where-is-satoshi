do you have any data or source to support what you are saying? that wallets listed on Bitcoin.org have lower risk of bugs and backdoors.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:45:36
its not inevitable. you are naive.

should the socialist government provide them with water to live?

its good as it implies the digital asset is even more scarce than the 21,000,000 hard cap.

this is a dumb post. regardless of the monthly change, Bitcoin is still undervalued.
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:41:13
dude dont ask that guy... anyone who thinks that they know that Bitcoin will replace the dollar is talking out of their ass and is full of shit.
it could happen yea but that guy honestly has no idea...
he is guessing
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:51:21
I would love to see you explain how Bitcoin was undervalued at the price of $18,000 back in 2017...
this should be good.

did u buy it directly from the manufacturer?
if a 3rd party handled it could have been hacked prior to your receiving the item.
that said, i am unfamiliar with that error messagw.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:42:52
needs to be able to earn interest without giving up ownership of your coins. no 3rd party reliance

literally no one who isnt stupid af is in despair about Bitcoin right now. its the best performing asset of 2019 its up 300% just this year.
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:39:23
its decentralized so no “individuals” can take over 51% of the network. 
and the supply of Bitcoin is hard coded at 21 million. there is no “shortage” of supply in the traditional macroeconomic sense of the word. 
one US Dollar is only worth .000084 Bitcoin 
the supply of Bitcoin is meant to follow the same supply curve as a precious metal.
as time goes on it becomes more difficult to extract and with decreasing growth in the supply of Bitcoin the price will rise. that is the point of bitcoin, to be a store of value. increasing the supply would serve no benefit.

Seriously dude. If you cant see the sarcasm of the this post, you shouldn’t be browsing the Internet.  Stick to being a bootlicker and save your dignity. Due not be a retard...

you are simply uninformed if you dont think Quantum Computing can be used to unmask every single private key before Bitcoin makes changes to the code to make the protocol quantum resistant.
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:41:50
ohh now you start backtracking when faced with the facts :DDD
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:24:21
yes those will all be recovered when someone uses quantum computing to break the 256 bit encryption that protects the private keys.
only the Bitcoin that is moved to new quantum resistant wallets will be safe once quantum computers are functioning.
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:16:47
a bank cannot block a bitcoin transfer...
banks are not involved in the transfer of bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:20:14
and those coins are not lost forever.
they will all be recovered. every single one.
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:09:54
im just implying that if the price goes up and continues to follow the Stock to Flow ratio
as plotted on a chart over time, then it will be hard for normal people to accumulate a lot of this scarce digital asset since it will be so expensive.
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:30:58
quantum computing does exist.
you are astonishingly uninformed...
and patently wrong when you implied that private Bitcoin keys are quantum resistant.
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:28:39
dont lie...
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:19:55
its an indisputable fact that 256 bit encryption is used to protect the Private keys of ALL Bitcoin.
This is a fundamental property of the Bitcoin Protocol since all transactions are publicly posted to the blockchain and visible to everyone.
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:04:13
good luck friend. 
your $50 or .006 Bitcoin may hard for a person making less than $75,000 per year to accumulate in their entire lifetime if the price continues to follow the stock to flow ratio.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:00:00
im out. im pulling my bitcoin and other crypto from Coinbase. yesterday was Bullshit.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:40:52
thats impossible...
simply put, the worst, by its very definition is the most bad that it can get. 
so when you return to Coindesk it cannot be a worse experience than when you had previously visited and had the ‘worst’ experience.
the very meaning of the word ‘worst’ implies that it cannot get any worse, only better.
hope this helps!!
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:10:41
sell your body in exchange for Bitcoin.
then you will increase for sure!!

@_date: 2019-09-01 23:21:57
you are conflating two separate things. I am talking about the supply and demand of Bitcoin and Bitcoin only.
I am not talking about “crypto alternatives.”
Yes demand for Bitcoin will continue to rise.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:05:08
uh oh...
@_date: 2019-09-01 12:28:41
its a simple matter of supply and demand. 
if demand remains the same and the growth of supply is decreased then the price will rise.
