You bought the majority of your position over 10,000k ?
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:18:22
You sound like the 589 xrp people
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:30:22
Missed out on that 2018 bear market?
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:33:16
Umm the code is open source...
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:20:00
Amazing story bro
@_date: 2019-07-24 13:55:45
What is this nonsense from? You 92750 people sound just like the 589 xrp people.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:01:18
$1000 in 4 min
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:17:57
Where are all the "tHiS Is FoREaL tHE LAsT tIME BTC WiLL dRoP BeLOw 10k AgaIn" people...
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:04:26
10k for good, heard that about 4 times now since the bear market ended
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:02:24
I'll take some of them BlakeBitcoins
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:50:26
I'm confused, if the dollar is worth a nickle what are we based on? A actual nickle is nothing then?
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:31:02
So we pay more just to have it given back. Makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:56:53
I will agree with you on the fiat dollar tanking.
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:20:28
Universal basic income would promote laziness and tank the economy.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:09:13
So we should get rid of tax deductions from everyone?
@_date: 2019-08-15 22:01:27
Tree fiddy
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:26:29
Yea been in since summer 2017 but had to sell a lot in December to make up for getting laid off. Working on building the stack back again.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:28:11
What is happening in the tip department today?
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:43:12
Everytime lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:43:12
Per month Haha, and that's if he does partial population. 2018 had the pop around 327 million. That would be over 3 trillion per year.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:12:01
Do the math on how much it would cost to give everyone $1000 a month...
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:41:33
Lol its wild, I dunno where he thinks that kinda money will come from.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:45:33
Are you not the same as them? Calling out predictions...
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:55:18
Havening did nothing for LTC
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:51:48
Intelligent reply
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:50:04
Hold it
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:12:25
Where did you bring it from?
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:26:59
Same thing happened to me back in November, at least you didnt have to sell at $4000
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:53:40
Stoked my 9500 buy order got filled barley in the middle of the night.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:27:49
Yea because nobody is stopping you from creating your own company and doing the same. Just because you are not doing they should not be allowed, that's dumb.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:57:24
They paid all other tax. I don't pay federal either because I have enough deductions via my business and other things.
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:39:32
Gapejelly going ham per usual
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:51:55
Amazon does pay taxes though.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:21:02
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:15:32
Anybody can not pay federal taxes via deductions. Welcome to capitalism and America.
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:58:42
Heard this before...
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:14:38
Old AF
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:00:46
Can you transfer BTC out of cash app to a wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:06:36
Right on thanks
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:42:44
I dont have 10k lol. Paycheck to paycheck
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:41:00
Just had my baby girl today and BTC heading towards 9k. What a fucking good day.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:52:32
Discounted? It was under 10k a few days ago...
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:52:00
I used to hear this same thing years ago. "Moon" is subjective AF.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:24:21
Was it mathematically impossible for Litecoin? Nothing happened there and the math still happened.
@_date: 2019-12-07 03:01:38
I am guessing small miners at halving have a huge neg OPEX.  They are fucked at halving.  Dead.  And they have no capital reserves.
Not like the larger miners.
Would this create more centralization?
@_date: 2019-06-14 02:51:59
He did not help. We need more fiat in circulation to inflate and kill fiat faster.
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:43:45
Unpopular Opinion - 
Bitcoin halving in May 2020 won’t do anything to the price.  It will be a non-event.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:34:49
Umm the other day it was all over every big news outlet. Google news was showing at least 5 of the top 10 news outlets covering it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:40:29
Heard this before
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:58:52
I'd consider 6500 a nice sale but to each their own.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:32:42
 Cool story you are so badass...
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:39:57
8200 is a sale?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:05:02
Sold 95% of my crypto just before xmas after buying in summer 2017. Got laid off from work and out of necessity had to sell. RIP.
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:16:28
Big leap there lol most of reddit doesn't live in the now, because as far as 200,000 goes buying in at 20,000 was also an amazing sale....
