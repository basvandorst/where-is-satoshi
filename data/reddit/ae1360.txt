No, Bitcoin is a hindrance to mainstream adoption, not QR codes which are everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:46:36
That ain't the issue though. Issue is I needed some BTC quick, bought it and sent it. 
And nothing. No customer support either.

Is the BS with Coinbase the reason why I have a transaction that hasn't even hit the blockchain yet going on 20 hours?

You're not 75. Retired and spamming for localbitcoins....lol. This reminds me of that one guy posting back in in 2013 who said he was 80 something. Tell you what....show proof you're 75 and I'll buy you a bottle of scotch.

It baffles me that people thought they could convert it to fiat and not pay taxes. IRS says you need to now but it isn't any different. 
Just like PayPal up until 2 years ago but with USD....coinbase and others won't be reporting your income. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:02:29
Anyone remember that post where the kid pretended to be some 80 year old man talking about bitcoin? 
I feel another one coming.

Well, Buffet does understand the business model but not the prices on things. To him, the next big thing can swoop in and crush something in tech in a short matter of time. That is why you would never see him paying something like 19 billion for something like WhatsApp or whatever FB paid.
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:27:29
I don't know the details but I would blame the Brazilian government on that most likely. After all they have something like a 75% or some insane amount import tax.
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:48:11
As somebody who is very familiar with booking...this is also the easiest way for a sportsbook to rip you off. Bettings lines are basically an exchange. 
I think it is very promising and have looked into it but I think you would be safer using a real book that is regulated. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:25:20
Well, I used to like it until I was an agent for a bit myself. I realized you only lose, majority people do. Very few do win. The ones who do, get blackballed. It makes a normal shitty game exciting, but you start to lose your interest and love for games then too.
Maybe not your thing but I HIGHLY reccomend this book called 'Smart Money':
It is a true story about a the author who didn't bet at all really either and got paired up with a gambler (forgot how at the start) but it is obviously Billy Walters. Walters is a legend and banned basically in every casino sportsbook. It was a huge deal a year or 2 ago when 60 Minutes was able to actually get an interview with Walters. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:58:00
Yeah, that post is gone now and the admin (i assume) said the BTCCHINA acct is confirmed by e-mail.

"Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies. And if they insist on trying to time their participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."
You could easily say a lot of the people on these subreddit are simply greedy.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:07:55
Exactly. I mean, people don't realize how many people up until 2011 run eBay businesses or did a lot of business through PayPal on the side and just simply did not file that income on their taxes. Now they have a form for it and PayPal must comply, a 1099-K is what it is. It is actually nice for compliant people because everything is already done for me. 
Honestly with Bitcoin...I don't think they IRS will truly care that much. Report what you spent and what you gained for the year on it basically and they won't bother you. Or don't at all. Pretty much anyone in the country can get fucked if they get audited so unless you're a big baller it won't matter.

PR stuff or not do you really not believe the guy lives at his own home?!
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:11:09
All banning online gambling did was push money out of the US. It also gives a lot of money to the off shore pay-per-head shops. One guy in my state runs his PPH shop where he is bringing in millions easily, all in cash only. He has a website, runs off credit (you pay your agent weekly) and the agent pays him. The guy then pays the PPH company a set $ per player that wagered that week, $15-$20 per, but in his case probably way less.
Bottom line is, guy runs a better deal now than a normal online book and there is no money going to the state on it. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:36:25
Oh believe me man, it isn't hard to find the guy if you live in Omaha. 
It's a nice house he bought for 31k in like 1950. Worth a lot more now but if you look a the houses around it, all about the same.
He may be a PR guy a lot lately but he hasn't moved. He is a regular guy. Also, he doesn't wash his hands when he pisses so if you try to take a long time washing your hands when you bump into him so you can say hi, uh..good luck. lol.

I'm saying alipay and tencent (I think that is the name) are a bigger deal than bitcoin and the banks are fucking them right now in the same way. Yet people on reddit think this is 100% fake. I see no reason to think at this point that they won't do it. Why fuck their own businesses for the same stuff and not bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:22:07
Makes sense in that way, I agree. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:16:40
What is great is I like bitcoin but don't carry any right now. I have full accounts at numerous exchanges, etc...but just subscribe to this subreddit in the meantime to get news of things now and then.
Instead, all I get is this retarded shit. People that clearly don't know how the real world works and people upvoting that shit. Of course you pay the fucking ATM fee because you know what? that fucking machine somebody else owns doesn't have any other fucking reason to give you cash right now. Why the fuck would they do it for free? Oh you earned it yourself? well go get it from your own fucking bank. This is why people laugh at bitcoin. This fucking retarded shit.

Is it though? It is a brand name I guess but it is in its infancy. He bought into Coke in 2009, well over 100 years after they were founded and Coke has been a brand name with a power times 100000000000 since like 1930. (exaggeration but you get my point).

Yup, it was a bad analogy on my part. My way of thinking was just the idea that WhatsApp if it attempted to become more profitable in a way that inconvenienced users would quickly be replaced by the next big thing. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:33:05
I know, it is big, especially for somebody who wants to run a local book...and also for depositing into regulated books. I could then use a book like Pinnacle in the US if they were to take BTC and convert it to dollars for me, then withdraw me in BTC again. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:35:46
Pretty sure they halted them.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:39:52
Yeah....I am saying there has to be a reason they single out Brazil. PayPal wants money but not to push a market out. Brazil also was one of the last they added.
Sorta Brazilian. Getting a Brazilian passport in a few weeks. Buying a new iPhone or two before I leave the US.
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:00:01
I mean that if a book is accepting bitcoin, they should be a licensed book still. Otherwise you're basically dealing with your local bookie except when he rips you off you won't be able to find him. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:24:18
No I understand the benefits of bitcoin, but the coins are the coins. If you deposit cash into a bank, they do not limit you like this. If something existed with bitcoins where you could deposit coins that may or may not be there until a few days but spend them (like a check), you would see the same thing. However, there isn't...bitcoin transactions are essentially no different than handing cash in person to somebody, they now have the cash, know they have it, and you have your goods or whatever.
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:50:46
Limited amount of coins to be had, scarcity then. Sorry I'd explain better but on phone. Basically though it has value because the more people use it, the more it is spread. If only 100 people cared for bitcoin and it had use only between them, it would be worth dick.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:02:30
Naw, trying mint a currency to compete with the dollar in the US is a problem.
I don't know the economic details in China but I've been lead to believe they are near a crisis and thus forcing people to use the state run bank.

Right as I saw the post...I thought what a great way to earn money. You could easily make the fake ID and then take a photo of it.

Examples of two places charging, not the credit card. But fair, that is an advantage, is it worth it for the common person to go through the hoops to get to that point to save 45 cents though? Not with the community that tells you how dumb you are for getting robbed for putting the 'currency of the future' on a Windows PC that was turned off. 


Bank transfer, something we aren't even on the topic of. Not credit card or bank card. You're comparing a bank transfer, why not talk about the advantage of a plane over a train? You use runbox, the majority of the world uses e-mail you're not paying for by the way. 


Yup, you definitely can, and as I said...bitcoin has a usefulness and a place. Until the issues are addressed though, the majority of the world will rather pay for a bank wire. Personally, I'd just use PayPal. 
Either way, bottom line with all of this....bitcoin needs better and easier solutions to security that don't involve somebody needing to read an entire book and hope to god they don't fuck up apparently, and until then the advantages don't entice the common consumer enough to care to use it. The effort it takes to acquire it just isn't worth it to them when they can just pay with their CC or bank card. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 17:01:26
Nope, they don't. Which is why I used my Amex instead. I'm comparing it because I am pointing out there there is no reason for somebody to use bitcoin other than their own personal beliefs IMO.
I'm also comparing it because Bitcoin is used primarily for online transactions, a spot where your options when checking out are VISA/Mastercard/Amex or....Bitcoin. Now, why do I want to use bitcoin in that situation? And why is it worth it for the consumer to jump through the hoops to get bitcoin and learn it, when they can just use their Amex right there? And let's not forget that somebody new to it all better not make a tiny mistake while learning it to try and make a purchase otherwise it is "sorry for your loss but you should have been smart about it". 
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:36:24
How is it cheaper to use bitcoin for you? There is no charge for me to use my credit card. There is only charge for the debt on it if you don't pay for it. 
How is it faster for you? The credit card transaction can be done instantly without the need to get confirmations. 
I have ~8 credit cards, not a single one of them charges me an annual fee. Nor do my banks for my bank cards. 
Credit cards and bank cards may drive up prices, but unless the retailer is keeping their bitcoin in bitcoin, they'll pay either way most likely. 
Bitcoin has a place and a usefulness, but until things like what happened here start being addressed by the community with answers other than "Well tough shit" and things are made substantially easier for the general public to acquire and secure, they will not grow much more.

@_date: 2015-05-09 15:47:54
It isn't that hard for me, but I know all the hoops I had to jump through to get some and it just isn't worth it...plus that attitude about it definitely doesn't help it. Until there is a benefit that is enough to overcome that, or the barrier of entry is lowered, it isn't worth it. 
The thing is, every time that something like this happens it is never the problem with bitcoin but with the user. He should have done this, should have done that, in addition to everything else they gotta do. Why do I want to use bitcoin over my American Express? Does bitcoin reimburse me for fraud? Does bitcoin give me an additional year on my warranty for purchases? Is bitcoin accepted basically everywhere? If I leave my Amex on my desk at home and leave for a month long vacation, only to come home and find that I was robbed but they only took the card and charged $6000, do they tell me to fuck off because it is my fault it wasn't in a safe wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:15:22
Man this subreddit....
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:02:43
Lord....what the fuck else is he supposed to do? Buy a trezor or whatever? This sort of shit is why bitcoin won't work in the long run. Not just that this happens, but the users who compare what happened to him to getting mugged with $6000 cash on you and expecting the bank to reimburse them? No, this is like his bank getting robbed and him not being reimbursed. Bitcoin, be your own bank. Don't worry, it is safe, you just need to study and learn up 1000 different things...and that is just to secure it. Fuck, having your computer off doesn't even help this guy. Not to mention the hoops you gotta jump through just to buy it...and if you don't think there are you're in denial. None of these things helps it and gives it any reason why people should use it other than to buy drugs. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:23:15
Oh, well then I don't know. I would guess it is because like it or not, it isn't as convenient right now for business to use Bitcoin. Offering it for free isn't worth it to them, but they already got it implemented so why remove it. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:19:16
Maybe it is to counter balance the volatility of it.
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:48:35

Good luck reversing a charge at a casino. Additionally, it's bitcoin. It's not cash and off the record. Believe it or not, they prefer to keep some things off the books still.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:55:12
Took me a few reads on that, but exactly. No point for basically 99% of the population there. Not to mention the screwy tax laws that the casino won't like dealing with, thus why nobody there knows how to do it.

Once again, the convenience of bitcoin. Even if the site had a good cert (assuming thats the problem) the fact that you need a website for it to find a cup of coffee is annoying. Just go buy a cup. It is simple.

@_date: 2013-06-07 15:37:17
I am not as well versed in Bitcoin as many on here are, I just was trying to illustrate that scumbags will take advantage of it once it catches on and unlike PayPal...Bitcoin isn't a corporation that can be held liable. That is why PayPal covers their ass.
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:35:26
Haha yeah why don't you send him money.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:35:19
Yeah but bitcoin is big enough now that they are better off not being associated with the drug trade for the majority of their price.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:45:02
That 20 minutes for BTC will be a bad thing if BTC is to get to mainstream status. A lot more scumbags will be using BTC to scam people then. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:58:19
Just saying...PayPal is the way they are because they are trying to protect the consumer. They end up causing problems because of that though. If BTC becomes mainstream, the people who want to use it to scam people will show up and will take advantage of that. Just like bums who write bad checks. Easier to solve that problem though: Don't take checks. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:07:41
Slander? That's rich. People like you are why so many laugh at this subreddit.

@_date: 2013-06-07 16:16:30
You'd be surprised....when debit/credit cards get cloned the number  thing they do is go to Wal-Mart and then later get like $30 of food at McDonalds. Haven't had it happen to me but seems to be a trend for others, hah. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:30:51
Ding ding ding, we have a winner. Businesses are free to do as they choose, and that includes this case. They have no incentive to help somebody who is clearly pushing another payment option. It sucks but that is the way it is. Sure PayPal is getting a cut then, but what if they don't handle all of these small fish early and just ignore them....then it will hurt them later.
It isn't like you'll see Reddit taking advertising money from a rival startup site.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:36:38
Yeah, they definitely aren't being put up to this by the guy who took the photo. He says he has kids in a past post. Crossposts it to pics for more traffic.
