Why would 1/4 of the world want their money held up in this shit system.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:58:10
The whole ‘believe in the tech’ is just nonsense late adopters repeat. Just over a month ago it was a ‘decentralized currency’, now all of the sudden it’s a ‘store of value’.... there’s no way you can seriously say you believe in the tech when the goalposts move so quickly and so drastically.

Not arguing that, didn’t say that. Dude basically said bitcoin is more revolutionary than the internet which is retarded. Given the choice between either bitcoin or nearly any other form of tech and bitcoin loses...

-Internet or bitcoin

I wouldn’t. Our elite class is scum, there is no denying it... but at least under their system we have the world we live in today. It’s far, far, far from ideal but the majority of us at least live to an acceptable standard.
... but if power was to be usurped by the computer geeks and early adopters backing bitcoin then the world might as well go to hell. What have these people given us...? Nothing. The community of bitcoin is built up of people looking to buy their way out of their responsibilities to society by backing an imaginary coin... there is no way the world will be better off with these people in power. It’d be like if a child became responsible for managing their family’s finance - there would be 5 hours of fun followed by a lifetime of despair... only in the case of bitcoin it’d be the whole world left in ruin and not just one household.
If the world is to improve it needs people to come together to reclaim and rebuild our societies through hard work and sacrifice at base levels.... things will never get better if the solution is a lazy workaround like bitcoin.

Yeah at this point there’s no logical reason why bitcoin should exist anymore as it’s just become a more expensive, less safe and slower version of a bank that has an exceptionally negative impact on the environment, a lot of tax issues and the potential to be regulated into the ground... and yet no one cares because they are theoretically making free money ��‍♂️

Without gold you wouldn’t have been able to make this post... without bitcoin you wouldn’t have had to.
... seriously though while I can agree hold mining causes a strain on our environment it’s not a completely unnecessary strain like that created by bitcoin. With what it’s become we don’t need bitcoin at all, and if you’re to ask any sane person in the world if they’d give up their country’s access to electricity for bitcoin the answer would be no.... there’s so many better things that power could be used for

I think when it finally crashes it wont die entirely... since it’s the first it’ll still find value as a novelty coin and at lower demand it’s utility as a medium of trade will return so I can still see it as being worth $1-2k in the right circles.

I’m talking about the guys who come by asking for help after they hear about bitcoin’s price surge and remember they have 80 of them on an old harddrive. These guys walked away winners because they really didn’t give a shit... if they cared about the tech enough to keep up with it they would have likely sold much earlier like most did.
Meanwhile the hodl army is checking the price every 30 minutes, investing their pocket money while praying for a $1M coin to make their late entry worthwhile. “Oh yeah I like believe in the tech you guys”...

Well there obviously has to be some success stories as for people to buy at $11k someone has to be selling... but ultimately I doubt there has been very many average joes turned millionaires.
Most people just got into bitcoin this year so at best they could have made 10x their money, which would meaning a starting investment of $100k to hit that first million.... and I doubt many non-millionaires would have had that kind of capital to risk at that time.

I’m not an advocate of bch either but I will say if bch has been the official route of bitcoin then I wouldn’t be so hardline against it as bch is at least usable (for the time being and in theory).

@_date: 2017-12-09 14:19:16
That’s a lie. If everyone tried to cash out it means there wouldn’t be enough demand, the price would plummet and almost everyone would walk away with nothing at all. Bitcoin has zero cash reserves beyond what people are willing to pay on the day.
In this sort of scenario I can imagine bitcoin would drop back down to less then a hundred, but then the regained utility from the lack of interest would see grow and stabilize at a more realistic value of like $1k
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:03:15

Without beer we might not have whiskey (I’m guessing?) but that doesn’t mean you have to drink or support beer if it’s not to your taste.

There’s no need to keep something beyond it’s usefulness just because it came first...

It would actually be a good thing as right now the fate of all cryptos is deeply entwined with that of btc... if popularity could shift from btc to an alt then it would help legitimize the crypto market as a less risky investment... but if btc remains the most popular and one day collapses it’ll set crypto back a few years as the now aware masses won’t want to be fooled twice

lol you do realize all you people who got in this year are the ones paying for the early adopters dreams right? It took a 2000% rise from $1k-$20k for just some of them to get a free, not so great car out of the deal... are you confident you are going to get enough suckers to buy btc to fulfill your dreams too? Are you sure you’re going to see that 2000% rise you need from $20k a coin to $400k?? Or is it more likely to crash and take your money with it...?
Good luck ��
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:22:12
Yeah and because the majority interest is only in bitcoin to make money then the moment the growth slows or stops so will the interest. If it weren’t for all the pumping this year I feel like the bubble should have burst at $5k back down to below $1k where it was at least a viable currency for illicit trade ��

Actually I find it hard to believe anyone with a technical background and reasonable level of intelligence could get behind bitcoin. There’s no point to coding anything that doesn’t have some sort of functional, real world application so while blockchain is an amazing idea in theory it’s current level of utility in crypto’s like bitcoin is... kind of shit.

Besides, in the real world most people don’t generate their own electricity, they source it from the grid at a price... so that guaranteed income will be coming out of your wages and into the hands of the power companies.... but I mean at least you’ll be able to pay your extreme bills in bitcoin, right?

Hardly anyone’s got rich off bitcoin yet outside of super early investors, those running exchanges and mining ops, Ponzi schemers, those in the drug trade, already wealthy traders, etc.
At best most you’ll see here have a theoretical 10x on their early investment which won’t be a lot, which is why they are ‘hodling’ and hoping for a $100k-$1m coin which will never happen.
Sure some will walk away with money (I know of an ordinary guy who’s currently making $100k/week after going all in on a bitcoin Ponzi) but the majority will be stuck in the same grind as you

I guess you’re missing that it wasn’t $14k until recently and you had to drop $3k on the unit... so I guess it’s not such a bad investment right now as you’d only need bitcoin to survive a month and a half to cover your costs,and then anything beyond that is free money.

The advice contained within is simply to step back and look at how good you have it rather then to dwell on the things you do not. Modern culture has bred self-entitlement so deep in people that they create their own misery without even considering the fact they don’t even deserve what they have right now.
Ironically if modern man was more humble he’d be driven to approach life in positive ways that would both enrich and reward him far beyond what he has now... but instead we fucked up somewhere and created millenials ��

You could have invested your time into becoming the world’s greatest painter... maybe you could have been a champion boxer... or perhaps you could have worked harder and became a billionaire entrepreneur... hell, maybe you could have just settled on being a better person and husband... but instead you regret not investing a chunk of money into something that could have produced a bit more money.
Just like me, just like everyone else, you have made a million good decisions and a million regrettable ones... but if the one you regret the most was that you missed out on free money then I can promise you the money wouldn’t help.
Instead of focusing on a regret you can’t change perhaps focus on those that you can, you’re life will be richer for it

I agree with it being the ‘first global bubble’. In my own unpopular opinion I refer to bitcoin/crypto as being a decentralized scam platform where there are many angles for scammers to become wealthy and shirk responsibility.
For example you have exchanges making a killing in fees and manipulating the market, miners wasting enormous amounts of energy to produce nothing and charging for the priveledge, Ponzi schemes built off the success of the bitcoin name, businesses identifying with crypto to falsely prop up their stock value, forkers tweaking the same shit and promising a world of difference, etc, etc.... all the way down to base level where millenial kid is dragging his grandma into it under the false pretense he’s doing her the favour.
There’s just so many angles crypto is allowing a whole lot of nothing to become a whole lot of money for all the wrong people.... and at the end of the day when things collapse most of the biggest players will be able to shrug there shoulders and say “you shouldn’t of invested more than you could afford” ����‍♂️

@_date: 2017-12-18 13:59:06
it’s ironic because just like the internet, crypto will become a data mining/control method of the state. You can be sure once it’s adopted by governments it’ll mean not only will they know exactly where every single dollar goes, but crypto will make it possible for them to dictate what your individual income can be spent on. It’ll start with welfare restrictions and spread from there... by chasing theoretical riches now the dumb monkeys are sealing their own fate.

@_date: 2017-12-05 15:24:04

There was nothing controversial about Trump being elected - the fact that both he and Hillary were the primary candidates to lead a country of 320+ million people should have been evidence enough that first world politics is nothing but a sideshow.
More realistic factors are that tptb are continuing to increase the wealth gap making it harder for your average citizen to accumulate wealth + the millenial generation have had entitlement and laziness bred into them since birth so they are desperately looking for that get rich/zero effort option their baby boomer parents had... and bitcoin currently looks like the best and only option for that

@_date: 2017-11-22 04:12:56
I can see that to a degree... but in reality it’s rarely the case. To my knowledge electricity was widely panned but it didn’t take the world dying off for it to see massive adoption - it’s uses sold itself. If a tech requires its skeptics and critics to die out to prevail then I don’t think that says much for scientific truth
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:45:19
I can concede to not fully understanding the tech, but your statement is ridiculous... obviously miners are profiting from their use of electricity just like every business in existence; but the only reason anyone does anything is for quality of life. Just because people are making money right now has nothing to do with long term sustainability.

I’d assume government regulation would be different region to region - some might stand to gain from it, some might see it as a threat and ban it or some might just regulate it so it works alongside their current system.
Ultimately though I think most major governments just serve the banks and will enforce whatever best suits them if the banks can’t control bitcoin/crypto themselves
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:40:55
He’s not wrong though... there’s nothing backing bitcoin beyond those investing in it - why do you think even bitcoin’s strongest supporters warn not to invest more than you are willing to lose?

Don’t you do the same? I mean bitcoin is just another corrupt system that favors early and able adopters but you’re fine with the thought of making a profit from it at the expense of those who come later, yet here you are complaining about others doing the same thing...

Well the corrupt financial system is the only thing that separates the rich from the poor... and one of bitcoin’s ‘proposed’ selling points is that it’s able to side-step that corruption... so naturally class warfare is going to come into the conversation/equation

That quote reads like “rather then let the evidence speak for itself, educate the next generation to believe what you want them to as they don’t know any different”... basically the most anti-science quote ever ��

I don’t think you can compare... the internet expanded and evolved as it found further application... whereas bitcoin has basically failed at its intended purpose so it’s adopted a new one... and bitcoin is bitcoin, it can’t really evolve without becoming an altcoin so ��‍♂️
... but the tweet is right, the hodl mentality is what keeps this thing growing

lmao whatever man... all I’m saying is it’s hypocrisy. Whining about what the bch crew are doing is no different to a late adopter whining about you... you gave them the power and wealth to do so when you bought in.

Thank you

No it’s quite the opposite; I always assume technology will advance and change the way we live - but new technology often makes older tech redundant. I don’t see new power technology making bitcoin more viable when the same power tech could benefit future cryptos with wildly lower power requirements in the exact same way... so I’m partial to believe power requirements might be one of the major factors that make bitcoin redundant...

When actual fraud happens though you can say bye bye to your money...

The only factual untruths I see are that it can’t be debased or confiscated - like seriously? Bitcoin has lost it’s total value before (maybe you weren’t around for mount gox?) and like anything else I can be confiscated just like any other possession. Those two statements are straight up fiction.
On top of that bitcoin is already a corrupted medium - proven by the fact everyone here is here to get wealthy. Why should an early investor be any better of than those who come later? Bitcoin is just fiat in a different wrapper, and a desperate attempt for wealth to shift into the hands of those who deserve it even less than the current holders. Nothing about bitcoin even slightly represents an equal, balanced or even stable store of value... I know you’re probably also a millenial so it’s not entirely your fault, but you need to learn just because you say something it isn’t true, and those feelings of entitlement that lead you to believe this nonsense were instilled in you by the money masters of yesterday... bitcoin isn’t even close to what you think it is

Many treat it as if this is a good thing, increasing the value of the remaining coins... personally though I feel like it’s just another reason why blockchain isn’t a great or reliable store of value

They’ve had like 30 years and they couldn’t even get renewable energy sorted out to save our doomed earth as global warming wipes us out in the next decade (or whatever the hell their ever-changing prediction is)... why is it going to make an appearance now just so magic internet money can be a viable thing?
... and even if a fantastic renewable energy generation solution popped into existence it’d still make more logical sense to ditch bitcoin for another/future crypto that requires less energy to process...

But what if they have/will flood it with cash and create constant instability, or ban or criminalize its use or ownership, shut down crypto mines or provide a better alternative? All these things are easily achievable and can define its value overnight...
... but anyways I wasn’t referring to the value of cash when I said that, I was talking about the security of investment... storing cash under your mattress is a crazy risk but still safer than bitcoin’s physical and digital storage means - the coin may last forever but it’s worthless if you lose access to it

If you go now and a correction happens you’ll feel like crap until it rises again... but if you don’t buy now and it continues to go up you’ll feel like an idiot for not investing sooner...
... so either decide for yourself orrrrr just put a regular  % of your total investment in one week at a time
