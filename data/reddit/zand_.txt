Anyone else aggravated by seeing these posts every day? BTC has had market dominance for several weeks already, this is old news. Besides, cryptocurrency is not a competition. I don't understand the "sports team" mentality so many of you seem to have, we should be wanting the entire space to thrive.

Below is a link to the guide I used. It’s very thorough and should provide you with all the info needed. 
If you do run into any snags, I found bitcointalk.org to be a great resource with lots of knowledgeable people. Below is a link to one of the threads I created, feel free to piggyback onto that if you have additional questions. 
Also figured I'd include a link to the blockstream store. They have some cool stickers that can only be purchased through lightning and I found it to be a fun incentivizer.

Hey, also had a question along those same lines. I'm in the process of following Stadicus' RasberryPi LN node guide and wondering if this BTCPay server accomplishes the same thing? The guide I'm referring to is in the link below.

I'm looking to move some BCC off of Mycelium wallet and onto Bittrex or Kraken. Would I just send the BCC as if I'm sending BTC but to the exchange generated BCC address?
@_date: 2018-10-26 03:29:55
Did you follow the same Stadicus guide? Which sync are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:24:46
No I haven’t 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:14:30
I'm not sure. According to this Mycelium user manual, the 12 seed backup *is* your private key
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:23:42
Great thank you, going to try that when I get home :)
@_date: 2018-10-26 01:25:18
Not really, this was my first time using both Linux and the Raspberry Pi. It would definitely help to have some technical knowhow but the guide does a good job of explaining each step
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:04:56
Nice thank you. This was helpful except now I'm having a problem restoring my old BTC wallet on the electronic cash app with the Mycelium backup seed. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, I tried doing the following...
File &gt; New/Restore &gt; Create new wallet (wallet_1) &gt; Standard wallet &gt; Use public or private keys &gt; Entered 12 word Mycelium backup seed but won't let me hit next...
Any help would be much appreciated.

This is why I think it's unlikely the SEC will approve a BTC ETF (not that I care) anytime in the near future. Market manipulation, one of their chief concerns, is just too easy when you have sites like BitMex offering 100x leverage on future contracts and low liquidity on the spot markets.

It’s definitely a gamble. To be honest, I might be the wrong person to ask. Mining has been more of a hobby for me and great way of supporting the decentralization of Bitcoin. From a profitability standpoint, I figure I could mine these for a few months then sell on eBay (probably for above retail, especially since I got the preorder discount). If you look at S9’s on eBay they sell anywhere between $2,700 and $4,000 depending on if it’s in hand or preorder. That’s more than double Bitmain’s retail price

Not actually a good thing. According to this research Malaysia has one of the shortest average heights of any country (approx, 5’ 2”)

How did this guy not realize sooner? Has he been living under a rock? Bitcoin's rising price has been mentioned on almost every news outlet at least once
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:15:49
I’m not trying to raise any alarms was simply pointing something out.
On a side note, if you look at the 6 month time frame of the total mempool size you’ll see we hit a peak sometime yesterday

Yes, just ordered 5x of them plus 5x PSU for around .947 BTC

$30 a day doesn’t include electricity. The difficulty will definitely go up but so will the price of Bitcoin (no guarantee on that but seems likely)

Meaning I hope someone from either camp (BCH or BSV) is not plotting some type of attack on the network. Each parties have a large amount of SHA256 hashpower. Litecoin is irrelevant, it uses a totally different hash algorithm.
