No reason in particular. I just don't see why today should be more eventful than any other day. I don't expect that there will be any large market movements.

Bitcoin is probably the most stable (least volatile) non-tethered cryptocurrency as it has a large market cap and it is widely distributed. The larger the market cap and the more distributed a cryptocurrency is (which comes with age) the less volatile it should become.

So far... Though I doubt today will be very eventful.

This is just pure bs propaganda.

The daily trading volume is usually a percentage of the market cap for that currency. Currencies that have a smaller percentage of daily traded funds tend to be less volatile.
To get a rough estimate of how often a particular currency is traded in average (for that day) you divide the market cap by the daily traded volume.
Bitcoin markep cap: 112.840 bn
Daily traded volume: 3.209bn
112.840 / 3.209 = 35.16
So Bitcoin is traded in average once every 35.16 days (today's average). That does not seem unreasonable does it?

I don't think you would be able to find statistics on that. A lot of volume would be from day traders, algorithmic traders, high frequency traders, and whales.

I think it would be better if people just learnt how to identify scams. If someone is asking for you to send funds first for a 'giveaway' it is a obviously a scam. Just like the 'double your money' scams.
I've seen these posts that impersonate other accounts several times on twitter. Maybe twitter just needs to get better spam filtering?

If BTC reached $250k that would mean it's market cap would approximately be worth $5.25 trillion USD assuming all 21 million coins are in circulation (there is less). If Bitcoin continues it's current growth rate I think it will reach that price in or before 2022.

They are not cutting you off. They are just preventing you from buying crypto with a credit card which is perfectly reasonable.

To be fair I was super tired when I posted that comment. So yes, at the time there was a slight lack of reading comprehension.
@_date: 2018-11-04 00:47:19
Well I hope you feel a little better knowing Bitcoin will most likely reach another all-time high. It's just a matter of being patient and waiting.

For Australia, crpto-to-crpto trades are considered a taxable capital gains event. I legally get around this by trading as a business so whenever I buy crypto with fiat it is considered an expense and when I sell crypto for fiat I count it as income. I'm not familiar with how cryptocurrency is taxed in the US but if something similar could be used that would be good.
Taxing crypto-to-crypto trades does not make any logical sense as the cryptocurrency you use to buy other cryptocurrency also moves in price. Calculating profit on those trades leads to an incorrect calculation which leads to unfair taxation.

As usual the people they get to provide information about a topic provide incorrect information. A Bitcoin is not created by finding "a larger rare number bigger then any of the Bitcoin out there" and scarcity is not enforced by "cpu time".

This should have a seizure warning. Stupid lighting effects.

It's satire mate.
Edit: I can't read.

To those who don't realise, this video is satire.

Some constructive feedback:
The game looks overly complicated and it is difficult to understand how the game actually works. Consider simplifying it and making the rules clearer.
What happens to the safety deposit box if it does not open?
The website states that the maximum time a game can run is 24 hours but then later states that the price of the keys doubles each hour after the hard deadline. Those statements contradict each other.
Also consider removing key bonuses for how much someone invests. That allows players with a larger capital an advantage and makes the game more like and ICO or gambling rather than a game for fun. I know your are trying to get people to buy more keys but that is just an annoying system.

Let me save your 7 minutes of your life. You can (according to the video) get "free" electricity but getting 15 other people to "sign up" I assume for electricity (and other services)
It's a pyramid scheme. An extremely dodgy business model that relies on generating income from desperate people trying to earn money (the majority of which actually lose money).

Not even going to watch the video but I highly doubt it. Just look a Bitcoin graph and set it to logarithmic. $2500 is highly unlikely.
