You're incorrect. Mining is the process of confirming transactions. All miners try to confirm them as fast as possible. Thise that do, get a lottery chance at winning a bitcoin. Imagine playing the lotto every 10 mins. It's like that. You have bad odds of winning still. Small miners will create groups called pools, and the will pool resources to mine together. If someone wins in that pool, they all share the bitcoin. This makes winning the lotto a normal ocurrance, but of course you get paid a fraction.

You sound like some kid that is completely ignorant about the technology. You're bashing it like a 12 year old who hates math because they "don't get it" despite never doing any math homework. I can't wait to hear you tell me all the math you know about merkle trees and sharding... so smart...

It's part FOMO and part fear of bitcoin taking over fiat.

I assume a chunk of that is reserves for various countries who would benefit from a collapse in fiat. Would be unwise to not hold a position at this point.

Sucky part is that govs will adopt blockchain, and poltics will become smart contracts that can't change. We are building the new world, and it's gonna be one hell of a fight.
