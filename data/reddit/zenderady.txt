Seems we have different opinions on economy. USD has 240 years of history. There was a global economy before that as well. I found a lot of interest in studying the history of currencies after I found about bitcoin. And usually history repeats itself.

How does the military stop the usd from hyperinflating?
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:38:15
You are wrong. When usd hyperinflates and no one uses it, btc will reach maturity and you will be able to use it/spend it at its real value.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:49:09
Thats exactly why I think usd will hyperinflate. Its based on fake economics and price manipulation. There are just so many countries they can invade. Seems you agree with war and attacking inocent people.

You are confused.
1. The port 8333 is open and I do get incoming connections.
2. You are telling me I should trust the blockchain explorer website. I do not wish to do that. I want to check it myself in the history that is on my full node. There MUST be a command line where I insert the tx id and it tells me what block contains it... number of confirmations etc.

Storing bitcoins on your mind is actually centralization. You trust a human to remember them! And we all know centralization is bad. Store your bitcoins in such a way that even your relatives can get it if you dissapear. Think positive!

Buy a ledger nano S or a Trezor. I like ledger. Watch some youtube reviews to see which one you like!
When you open the device you will be given 24 words. Those you have to store in a secret place as it's a way to recover your wallet. If someone else gets them, they will get your money.
On these devices you can set a passphrase.. which is a secret long word you choose to create a new hidden wallet. if you forget the passphrase or lose the paper you write it on you can not retrieve the hidden wallet. Youtube is your friend.

That is if you tell them you have a secondary wallet encrypted by the passphrase. If you shout arround how much bitcoin you have.  They will know you are lying if your main wallet has just 0.1 btc. Keep it for yourself your btc holdings.

If you hold your bitcoins in multisig wallet where you HAVE to have your parents sign a certain transaction as well, the person who kidnaps you just can not steal your money. Similar if you are using secret passphrase.

Thank you for the reply! I am a bit amazed that the mantra of bitcoin is "don't trust, verify", and "your keys, your bitcoin" but it's actually so hard to verify transactions from a hardware wallet.

I always go for segwit. The future transactions will cost less.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:48:42
I upvoted! I love future scenarios. Do you get inspiration from anywhere? sources? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:35:49
This sounds like a workaround! Thank you for the tip and I WILL look into this. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:29:06
This should be way more user friendly if we want the masses to verify their own transactions. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:23:48
Thank you for your answer. Can you tell me where I can find all the command lines explained?
