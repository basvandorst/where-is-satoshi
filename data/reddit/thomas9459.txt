This was a great idea! Haven't had fun like this in weeks. :)
Anyways, here are my attempts:

In that case, there is a "vulnerability" that if someone gets a hold of your private key, they can spend your Bitcoins.
This is just as much a vulnerabiliy as transaction malleability: it is an issue of how well the user understands how the network opperates than it is a flaw in the protocal itself.

Yes, but keep in mind that there is a large bonus for submitting a block in order to deter this kind of attack.

If the coins in your wallet came directly from Coinbase, and then go directly from your wallet to purchase something, a government agency could simply ask Coinbase to provide your personal data, and they have proof that you bought that service. If the coins are mixed, then they can't show that you owned those bitcoins.

It's better to find bugs in testing than in live code. It's kind of a shame though, I would've won the bet. ;-)

Hey, sorry for the late reply, but no, I've never received a refund, although I can see that the coins moved from the [address that I deposited into](

Okay! I've made my bet!

Since everyone is going Japan, I'll go Colombia.

This is actually a really interesting situation: unless you give your password/private keys to someone (a spouse, attorney, etc.), then the coins are lost, which is effectively the same as distributing them equally to everyone who owns bitcoins.

To a certain extent. Mixing services try to give you back completely different Bitcoins than what you put in, whereas exchanges make no such effort, so it is possible to get the same coins back out. You can use taint analysis on blockchain.info to see if you recieved the same coins back.

Any update on the situation? The website still shows that no bets have been placed.

What about once contracts get implemented? Then, the entire encounter between a client and webserver could be sent in one transaction without either party needing to trust the other.

This blatently disregards that websites actually need money to operate. Pay per page would allow users to pay for visiting the website using Bitcoins rather than paying by viewing ads.
