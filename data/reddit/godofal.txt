Then there really isnt any reason to do an AMA. There's a reason those rules are established. There is another reason that's not specific to AMA's but to this one: how can we know that you're not just someone with a lot of bitcoins/looking to buy a lot of bitcoins trying to influence the market? (granted, it'd be a pretty bad way to go about it, but it's possible)
If you don't want to verify with the public, verify with the mods. That way your identity is protected while we still know you're telling the truth because a trusted third party has vouched for you.

The way i see it is they are like tokens in an arcade or something like that. You buy tokens from a central machine so you can play games without having to get the exact change every time.
Similarly in games you often purchase an in-game currency with dollars. That way they don't have to display dollar values next to ingame purchases. Your dollar is still worth a dollar, but instead of a dollar it's 100 platinum coins. Also your dollar isn't directly owned by you anymore, but owned by the game owner, who promises to give you a dollars worth of ingame content.

I understand perfectly, you don't seem to get my point. What happens when all those people who think that bitcoin is basically a better paypal/applepay lose their bitcoins? They become bitter against bitcoin and will never use it again, plus they'l probably tell other people that it sucks as well.
We need good marketing that's also accurate if we want to accomplish something long-term. With your approach we'l get a lot of users fast but we might lose them just as quickly and end up in a much worse position than we are currently.

I think it's pretty clear why a silkroad would pay back the money it's lost and an MTgox wouldnt.
People aren't (as) afraid of the officials because you can either avoid punishment by hiring a good lawyer or just going to a different country. Even if you don't get away with it, you "just" spend a couple of years in jail.
If you however mess with bigshot drugdealers you won't be able to hire a lawyer to help you out, running from them will probably make things worse. Best case scenario you just get your legs and ribs broken, more likely you end up dead.

The difference between Applepay and bitcoin is that Apple is responsible for failures, if their servers get hacked and your account emtpied they will have to reimburse you. With bitcoin, the user is responsible: you have an unprotected wallet.dat on an unsecure computer? Say goodbye to your bitcoins!
Bitcoin is a completely different thing than Applepay and paypal and not a competitor to either. Bitcoin is like the USD and euro. It's a currency, not a payment processor.

You can lose bitcoins by virusses, social engineering, re-using passwords, losing a paper wallet/uploading a picture of a paper wallet, uploading your wallet.dat to the wrong site, sending coins to the wrong adress, sending coins to scammers, losing money in exchange hacks, and much more.

that is only a valid argument if bitcoin failed completely; as in it gets destroyed without any hope of revival
that is not the case, nor is there any indication that that will be the case
also, GPU's that have been mining arent worth as much anymore because they have been worn out, and they are a couple generations behind, you'd be lucky if you would get 1/5th of the price you paid for a GPU back

you're just quoting the amount of money spent on ASIC's without any consideration for the money spent in GPU before ASIC's
the first avalon asic's were delivered around february, as far as i know those were the first asics "in the wild" right?
so by looking at a complete [computing chart]( we see that around that time the computing speed was fairly steady at just over 20 000 gigahash
lets take the HD5870 as a standard, wich was about 150~200 dollars each doing about 400Mhash/s
that means you'd need about 50 thousand HD5870's  to get to 20k Ghash/second, wich equals to about 7.5m to 10m $ in GPU's alone
with those GPU's you'd need motherboards, CPU's, ram, PSU and HDD's, ofcourse you don't need anything special so lets take about 250 (150 for the PSU, wich is fairly conservative) dollar for a set like that
asuming 4 cards per set, thats 12 500 sets, another 3.1m
and ofcourse, FPGA's were around for a while too, and they cost more in terms of $/hash but thats pretty impossible to put into the equation
so at a minimum, to get the most efficient way at the lowest prices without considering electricity (4 GPU's on a 250 dollar set without factoring in extra cooling, FPGA's or other random stuff hobbyists like to do, and its all calculated at the EOL time for GPU's) it would cost about 13 million dollars to reach that 20k Ghash/second
thats a very conservative estimate; i wouldnt be surprised if the total GPU investment is closer to the 50 mil than the 10mil
so bottom line: investment is *at least* the same amount, if not *significantly* lower and is *not* a reason for people to go "i need money back right now so il sell what i have ASAP"
also, that wouldnt make sense, because we would see a steady decline rather than an abrupt downwards shift because of *alot* of coins hitting the market suddenly
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:04:26
you're missing the point
im not saying USD isnt valuable, im saying that BTC has the same properties and the same reason its valuable: because people agreed together that it is
it doesnt matter that USD is supported by more official channels (government) or that BTC is supported by a bunch of regular people on a basis of supply/demand
the reason USD and BTC are valuable is simply because people agreed to it. and in thát way, USD does *not* have any magical/special properties that BTC does not
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:20:55
i think it depends what the opening bids are
if you (the seller) would start it at 10dollar for a box (without specs in description) and it subsequently gets blown out of proportion (going to 500 dollar) because alot of people can't read...
in that situation, i'd say its required for the buyer to pay up; they made a mistake, they weren't led astray by the seller with ridiculous prices or specs in description or whatever
but i guess we won't know what really happens in these situations as noone seems to be able to provide any cases :P

people always seem to forget that more mining power doesnt mean more coins
coins will *always* come in at the same pace; a block every 10 minutes (currently a block is 25BTC) even though alot more hashing power gets added to the network
sure, theres a bit of a delay when the speed goes higher incredibly fast and the difficutly hasnt adjusted yet, but that delay is negligible
@_date: 2013-06-13 12:33:33
thats not a magical property, thats a result of people making it a standard
the notes themselves are simple paper, it does not have something that makes them valuable
the only thing that makes it valuable is that the people máde it valuable, wether by common usage, laws or simple supply/demand, it doesnt matter: the péople, not the product itself, made it valuable
and massively deciding that something without value is actually valuable, while rare, is not magic by a longshot

im saying that mankind made the dollar valuable, paper (wood) isnt rare or hard to process so naturally it isnt valuable
same with gold; its not needed in big quantities for anything besides "ooh shiny"

im not saying that USD is worthless, i'm saying it has nothing that BTC cannot match

one of the largest drawbacks i can see is that as soon as something like this gets big (and seeing as how this would be the "ultimate" way to protect large amount of coins, it could) it wouldnt be long before someone writes a virus specifically for stuff like this
the only way i see this working is if you keep it secret and to yourself; if you manage to get a wallet working on a commodore 64 or whatever, dont spread the information around
if noone knows about it, noone will know how to steal them
its kinda selfish, but the only way to keep your own coins completely secure
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:26:55
great idea, but the main problem i foresee is "bounty hunters" having to go through endless lists of bounties to check if they can fulfill any of them
maybe add filters, wich might have to go pretty deep (movies, books and music filters arent enough; you'd have to go per genre) so that you can quickly filter stuff out that you know you dont have/can provide
good luck on it though, seems like a pretty interesting project
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:28:03
as i understand it, the network isnt actually faster than those supercomputers. its only faster for the purpose of BTC mining; in other computing tasks the BTC network is useless.
i'd be willing to bet if there was accurate data, i dont think anyone knows the total power consumption of paypal for instance. its also pretty much impossible to get the actual power consumption for the BTC network; you'd have to calculate how much power it would take to set up a similar network. but you would never be able to calculate how much power the current networkd uses because it doesnt use a single type of miner.
i've found [this video]( which claims that the BTC network uses 15MW and paypal uses 16MW. he uses averages and guesstimates, not factual numbers to come to that conclusion. never mind the fact that its quite dated (from april)
if you are able to find factual numbers about both the paypal infrastructure (servers, employee power consumption IE office heating personal computer usage etc.) and the bitcoin network and prove without a doubt that bitcoin uses more power than paypal, i'd be willing to send you $10 in BTC, because i do not believe for a second that this is actually the case

i would love to know what kind of wonder GPU's you have bought and used to mine for *years* with that are still worth 75% of their original value, because you would have done something that the entire community seem to have missed
you state no timeframe, nothing about intensity; temperature, usage per day, etc.
it doesnt matter that you bought 2 HD7970's yesterday, mined with them and can sell them tóday for 75% of its value, because thats not how the network worked; the community did this for years, and even a brand new unused GPU from 2 years back wouldn't sell for even 50% of its original value
and your second argument assumes that the difficulty will keep rising regardless of BTC value or electricity costs; that is not true
ASIC's are a huge improvement over GPU's in terms of speed and efficiency, that all adds up in a way that could make the difficulty 100x what its currently *without* the electricity costing more than it generates in bitcoin
do the math before you make claims, not only for your own arguments but for  counterarguments too; you make claims about investment costs for ASIC's being higher than GPU, wich isnt true as i pointed out, and now you make claims about difficulty outweighing electricity costs in a matter of months without anything to back it up

what is much and wat is little? its all relative. i can buy everything i want with BTC, even if sometimes you have to go through services like gyft. to me, thats more than enough


why would you convert BTC to dollars? theres no reason to do that unless you see BTC as an investment rather than a 


there are some people who are getting paid, not many but a few. i wouldnt say this is somethign that needs to happen for BTC to be succesfull either


no it's not, if it truly were useless then noone would ever buy/use a gift card from a shop, or buy an itunes card or similar. there are plenty of occasions where you'd rather have BTC than $, € or whatever


people always say that, and perhaps it's true, but the value of a BTC doesnt matter in the slightest. 1 BTC could be worth $0.01 and the usability wouldnt be diminished *at all*. every vendor would still be able to accept BTC for their products


its semi-anonymous: if you know what you're doing its completely anonymous. don't do your homework and theres a chance you could be tracked


thats the same argument people made against credit cards and pin cards, against phones and probably even against cars. it wasnt valid back then and it isnt now: people will learn


sure, its a bit easier to get away with scams and trust will be the most valuable commodity there is. butt there are a lot of ways to protect yourself


i'd wager (ha!) that if you'd look at the USD that most of the "traffic" is similarly focussed on porn and gambling, nothing new nor negative


now this is last one is the reason i started to write this comment. BTC is probably a thousand times less enviromentally impactful than any other (physical) currency.
consider the amount of energy wasted to mine ore, refine it into metal, produce coins out of those metals in such a fashion that its hard to replicate them, distribute those coins evenly across the nation.
then consider the costs of chopping wood, making paper for bills. again in such a way that its really hard to duplicate them, and again distribution
consider the electricity wasted for the servers that keep track of bank accounts, credit card balances. every single ATM is eating electricity like crazy
**i would be willing to bet that paypal alone uses more power than all the bitcoin miners combined, and paypal is *miniscule* compared to how big the USD is.**

you guys are seriously moving away from MT.gox just because they couldnt handle the load?
have you any idea how explosively bitcoin is growing? have you kept track of the charts?
in case you didnt: bitcoins just [skyrocketed]( from ~10 dollars to over 266 dollars in about 3 months
thats a 2660% increase! in THREE MONTHS!
imagine how many people are needed to achieve something like that
i think we can safely assume that during those 3 months, the bitcoin community saw a similar rise in its ranks
MT.gox was constantly backlogged on their verification; most of the time with more than 10 000 people on the waiting list
they simply got *alot* more visitors, users and traders
thats *alot* more bandwidth, something they obviously couldnt handle
noone expected this much growth in this short a time, so who can expect MT.gox to have predicted this and get enough servers/bandwidth béfore the growth
MT.gox is the most well-known exchange, it's no surprise that they were hit way harder by the growth than competitors
bitcoin grew too rapidly for exchanges to keep up with, with lag as an inevitable result (not to mention this explosive growth had to see a correction anyway)
edit, addition:
consider that massive growth the same as a reddit DDOS of love
when a small site gets linked on reddit, that post then reaches the frontpage, that site gets DDOS'd to death by all the redditors on the frontpage. doesnt mean that that site is badly designed, it just isnt designed to handle that much load

@_date: 2013-04-14 22:24:47
i think its safe to say that bitcoin is green
when you say that bitcoin takes so much energy to be created, you must do the same for traditional currencies like euro/dollar
the coins for these currencies must be mined (metal), transported, refined, transported, made into actual coins, transported ágain for distribution, and then continue eating energy (a bit at least) by weighing down cars and public transport during their circulation
the bank notes take up alot of resources to be made, too: trees need to be cut down, transported, made into special paper with watermarks and distributed. at the end of their life, they need to be destroyed (wich is a pretty big operation)
and i'l bet that banks spends a compareable if not larger amount of energy on their servers as bitcoin on mining
all things considered, if bitcoin grew to be as large as USD or the euro, it could cost *alot* less energy than them, making them green

i agree, its not perfect currently
however if services like these exist and are able to make a profit, it shouldn't take too long for the shops to just bypass the services and take the profits for themselves by incorporating BTC into their own systems
personally i don't really care for being able to use BTC to buy my daily groceries, a car or even a house. i see BTC as the perfect "online" currency for online transactions such as software (games, office packets, etc.) in-game transactions (XP boosters, items etc) or even writing code as a free lancer for some company on the other side of the world

while what you wrote is all true, that is *not* a magical property of USD. that is something we, mankind, decided: people decided that USD needs to be accepted everywhere in the US
we can do the same with BTC, the fact that its not as widespread as USD does *not* mean its not the same basic principle
you are misreading what i'm writing here: my point isnt that BTC or USD is more valuable than the other, or easier to use, or in what point whatsoever superior to one another. my point is that in basic principle BTC and USD are equal: both are completely worthless if people did not suddenly go "hey, this is handy! lets make it valuable"

i doubt that
lets look at the ASIC's that are currently "available"
all of them have been pre-ordered for pretty hefty amounts for months before they actually arrived. this means that whoever buys them doesnt nééd the money straight away, because a delivery time of several months is to be expected
sure, there will be some people with ASIC miners that will sell off whatever they get right away, but that isnt different from GPU miners; there will always be people thinking "hey, i can sell right now for money" and others going "lets hoard the coins, they could rise in value"
the fact is that new technology or more hashing speed does not, on average, mean that there will be either more people selling coins or people selling more coins.
ASIC miners were GPU miners; the people, the psychology, hasn't changed. the investments hasnt changed. the timetable of breaking even hasnt changed. the ónly thing that has changed is the computing power, and that is an irrelevant factor
