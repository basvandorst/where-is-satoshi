Personally, I haven't liked your organizations attitude to bitcoin anyhow so I really don't think we need you.  
I'd worry more about wikipedia becoming a thing of the past than bitcoin.  You can't even edit a page now with real content because you have corporate trolls preventing it.

I responded 5 times because I felt passionate about it NOT because I'm not calm.  Go fuck yourself dick.  As far as donating to Wikipedia.  You're a god damn liar.  You're not donating because you want it to be converted to dollars, you're donating bitcoin because you want bitcoin to get the exposure.
It's a symbiotic relationship we're looking for.  Wikipedia shouldn't just be a parasite on bitcoin.

You're simply going to have to ask yourself, is this thing going to take off.  Why convert all of it?  Don't.  Bitcoin is not just another payment option.  If you keep some, in 2-3 years it may be worth a LOT more.  
I'd say put a very, small donation page somewhere, perhaps separate from the main donation page. Then, over time, if you feel it is really catching on and hitting a critical mass, put it alongside the other options.
Start small and just hedge your bets.

Blood pressure never went up there buddy.  I'm just not the type to beg.  If the guy doesn't want into bitcoin...his loss.
However, I will have to say I generally don't like wikipedia.  I use to but it's overrun by corporate interests now.

I agree.  The mods here should delete negative bitcoin messages.  Not if the intent is to help give a direction of course but just general negativity.  
No one should be able to come here and tell us that bitcoin sucks.

He may think I'm simply being nasty with this idea but I'm not.  Wikipedia could be the first to do this.  Imagine how many donations they'd get for THAT.  
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:49:00
You're lying about your motives.  I KNOW more about bitcoin than you'll ever learn son.  I've mined for a few years and actually written some interfaces myself.  
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:32:12
I think that is absurd.  If it hurts Wikipedia to hold onto 1 or 2 BTC then you guys are going under anyhow.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:20:34
You're a god damned liar.  Why donate with bitcoin then dick.  Just send cash directly.  Do you get paid in bitcoin?  I fucking doubt it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:30:40
I'm asking you seriously to go fuck yourself because you're a lying troll.  You can't even keep up with what you've said.  Go contradict yourself somewhere else.   Maybe you can suck Jimmy's dick some more if you ask real nice.

Yep...time to put the past in the past.  You're not going to get new bitcoin converts with by hanging on to this albatross.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:39:22
Truth is, I've read about folks considering creating a type of blockchain based encyclopedia anyhow.  THAT is what you better worry about and start researching.  It almost seems you're here more today just to troll. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:16:23
At least your mother loves you.  Even idiots deserve love.  I'm sorry you can't understand how you continually contradicted yourself and that you are a complete liar.  
Good luck trolling and stumbling through life.  
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:59:03
You JUST SAID YOU WANTED HIM TO CONVERT IT TO FIAT.   That's not using it as a currency dumb ass.   Jesus do you even know when you're contradicting yourself.
If I send you 100 USD, do you have to convert that.  NO because it's already a currency.  If you want him to use it as a currency then he shouldn't be converting shit unless the donation comes from another country and you don't seem French to me--even though you should have surrendered already.
He's just using btc to siphon from the bitcoin community so he had better help us if we're helping him.
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:48:22
Everyone is in the investment business.  Period.  Hedging your bets by holding onto 10 bitcoins or less would do NOTHING to hurt wikipedia.  You're simply wrong.

The Federal Reserve is a group of private central banks. They essentially create money to pay for various government securities. They create this money out of thin air. Poof...here's your money. They can also create money in other various ways by controlling the interest rates banks can borrow money at (poof...here's your money) and the reserve to deposit ratios banks must follow (fractional reserve mojo). They are also involved in various other "quantitative easing" schemes that essentially amount to creating new money for banks including themselves. I would go further and wager that when you are the "lender of last resort" and aren't audited, you're likely creating money for lots of things people don't know about and better not ask about. The rabbit hole goes much deeper when you understand the whole basis for fractional reserve banking which basically means banks only have to hold a fraction of money in "reserve" or at the actual bank based on deposits that are made. They can actually lend out more than they have when new deposits are made. Now, if you control this system or are a large bank that creates money upon new deposits, how are you going to loan that money out? I know what I'm going to do, I'm going to create policies that make it perfectly legal for me to loan large amounts of money out to friends and family. Essentially those involved in the money creation process can enrich themselves while devaluing the dollar for everyone else. Nice little scheme isn't it? If you are a Keynesian and believe in economic stimulation and spending/borrowing your way out of recessions then that's fine. I say we stop letting a few bankers decide who gets the new money but rather give it to all Americans equally.

The way I see it, you are afraid to pick a side.  Either you're going to help us or you're not.  Either we're going to help you or we're not.  
I'd be careful saying btc won't be around for a while.  You won't get many donations that way.
