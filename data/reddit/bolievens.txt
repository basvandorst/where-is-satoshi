which means you would be getting taxed twice on the purchase, sales tax and capital gains which makes it dumb as fuck to buy a cup of coffee with your bitcoin

@_date: 2017-08-13 06:13:49
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:50:53
That's terrible advice
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:32:14
im not a tax accountant but from what i understand you only pay capital gains tax when you use your bitcoin to purchase a good or service or turning it into income aka making it dollars again, moving the coin wallet to wallet should have no tax implications.

use one of the market tracking apps on your phone and set up an alert at the price you would sell at
