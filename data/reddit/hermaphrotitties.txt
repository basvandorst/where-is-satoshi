There is a finite supply of suckers.

The value of Bitcoin is explicitly stated in terms of how much fiat you can exchange for it. In every utilitarian test bitcoin fails compared to fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:03:55
None of this is valuable to society, nor does it give the bitcoin a value aside from how much fiat people are willing to give you for it.

You do understand that pyramid schemes are an excellent way to make a lot of money until they run out of suckers?

With what? Pointed insults?
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:02:47
How so?
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:08:23
Insults are the last resort of someone who is incapable of debate.

Huh, it's almost like fiat is a superior form of indexing debt.

You've lost 0, you've lost 129 bitcoins... you are delusional.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:52:25
Saying you lost 0, then immediately say you lost 129 bitcoins is a contradiction. Because now you claim to be up money does not change the fact that at one point you lost coins.

This is satire
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:59:29
Claims to have been robbed of bitcoin while also claiming it is impossible to be robbed of bitcoin... is this Schroedingers satire?

Beans have intrinsic value because you can eat them.

The beans still have an intrinsic value as a proportion of the total amount of food available. The need for food will never be 0 and the amount of food will never be infinite.

Vanguard is the gold standard.

Beans still have intrinsic value because you will get hungry despite any of those scenarios.

In finance, intrinsic value refers to the value of a company, stock, currency or product determined through fundamental analysis without reference to its market value.
