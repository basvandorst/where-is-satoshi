I won't pretend to know all the ins and outs of what goes on in the personal lives of foundation members, but this resignation, according to the *stated* reasoning, is unfounded. 
2 of 3 reasons were for individuals "engaging in alleged" activities. 
You can't engage in alleged activities. Apparently this member has come to his conclusions of the activities mentioned. If that's the case, he should be man enough to come out and say they have *actually* engaged in those activities.

Your CEO won't read that email.  Here's my suggestion: 
"Just following up on our discussion the other day about bitcoin. Our company is ideally suited to benefit from bitcoin. Here's why
"1) We will reach new customers
2) We assume no exchange rate volatility
3) Bitcoin transactions have zero fees
4) Integrating bitcoin is fast and easy
"I'd be happy to discuss the above items in person if you have any questions.
He can't resist that simple pitch, and he'll want you to back up your claims through further discussion. When you are in person don't wander out into technological weeds. Limit your discussion to the 4 bullets and have a phone number to a BitPay or Coinbase employee ready to call then and there. They'll do the rest.

This appears to be indicating leading returns, i.e. on a given date on the plot the returns show returns for the **upcoming** period (12 month, 24 month, cum). 
This means that the most recent 12/24 month period(s) does not really show 12/24-month return line(s) anymore, it's a (t-x)-month return line where t=the end date and x=a given date. 
Look at the plot from the right side (most recent) and ask yourself, was the price higher or lower 12 and 24 months ago. The answer is that it was lower then, so if you are expecting to see the *past* 12-month return from that date you would expect it to be in positive territory, but the plot shows it in negative territory because it is showing leading returns. 
Can you make the same plot but for trailing returns? It seems to me to be more intuitive and useful that way. 
Thanks!

Simple answer: 
Long term health &gt; short term stability. 
Analogy: 
Being exposed to real world bacteria/sickness helps build immune systems. This is far better than pampering a child his whole life and never exposing him to outside threats and vulnerability. Let them play, get dirty, have freedom in the real world and they'll develop robust healthy immune systems over the long term. 
Conclusion: 
Bitcoin is anti fragile; it gets stronger *because of* short term dislocations and exposure.

I like the idea but only if we couple it with an increased usage of satoshis; use satoshis for general daily transactions. 
Bits (with an s) will be analogous to dollars (with an s). Satoshis will be analogous to cents. 
The difference will be that while a dollar has 100 cents. A bit will have 10^8 satoshis, which makes use of the number 8, which "bit" has a history of representing. 
Edit: how do you make the carrot sign show up?  I wrote 10 carrot (raised to the) 8 and it shows up as 108.

- Bitcoin is a protocol. 
- The bitcoin protocol enables secure transfer of digital assets
- The first and most prominent digital assets exchanged via the bitcoin protocol is digital currency
- Bitcoin's currency is transferred peer to peer through a decentralized network of users
- Being a protocol, bitcoin is politically neutral, yet it is disruptive because it competes with state and banking monetary systems
- Bitcoin transactions are recorded as a public ledger of asset transfers, verified through bitcoin's central innovation, the blockchain
- Bitcoin's blockchain technology can be used to validate any digital asset, currency is simply the most prominent application. Because:

Thank you for the reply. I'm mainly concerned about their access to my phone (which I have grandfathered Coinbase and blockchain apps on as well, both capable of sending/spending Bitcoin).  I just wanted to test this wallet out to evaluate advantages over the other two. I wouldn't put much bitcoin in it. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 04:34:46
Yep. BitWallet is great too. Those two are my favorites, followed by CoinPocket, Coinbase, Blockchain, GreenAddress, Pheeva, WalletPlus, and Hive (which would be nicer if it didn't take so long to log in). 
Did I miss any? I used to use Coinpunk too but I heard something about it not being supported anymore so I moved the bitcoin I had there elsewhere. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:26:17
Thanks for that explanation. Can you give a concrete example of a transaction (or more specifically an actual use case) that the Coinprism/OA protocol can't do?  
My understanding is that you can in fact issue a single unit coin/ticket/share/etc. I think you are correct that the issuer can then issue more of that asset at any time, but a) that would be public knowledge since its on the blockchain and easily discoverable and b) the distribution of new assets goes to existing holders at the proportion that they already hold, so no there's no net benefit to issuing more assets other than having more units (kind of like going from bitcoin to bits). 
Just looking for a better understanding. Thanks for your time.

From all my searching online it seems you can't change the default iOS wallet when clicking on bitcoin: uri links. People just say everywhere that you have to uninstall the apps. I did that with Coinplug and the next wallet to open was the Circle app, which I haven't signed up for. I don't want to keep deleting wallet apps until I get to my preferred one (BitWallet or breadwallet) so I guess I'm out of luck? :/

I just got hired to drive for Lyft. So far I've given about 50 lifts in 5 days. I have lots of ideas of things I can do to integrate bitcoin into the experience. 
1) I like to just talk to people about bitcoin during the drive. 
2) I'm planning on getting a bunch of paper wallets with 1,000 and 10,000 bits of preloaded bitcoin to just give to cool people. 
3) If people are really interested I can sell them bitcoin on the spot that they can pay for through the in-app Lyft tip system. 
4) I'll post my QR code in the passenger and rear seats as a way to start bitcoin conversations.

What gives bitcoin value: 
1) The goods and services it can buy now (its immediate utility). This is bitcoin's **currency** value proposition. 
2) The goods services it is anticipated to buy in the future (its speculative utility). This is bitcoin's **money** value proposition.
The greater the current and anticipated future goods and services available through bitcoin, the higher the exchange rate (price) will be against competing currencies/monies.  That simple.

While I agree with your optimism regarding the long term potential and timeless virtues of bitcoin, I recoil at your smug insensitivity. 
You assume that everyone who sells bitcoin for pennies on the dollar was a greedy get rich quicker to begin with and is selling out of fear and abandonment. 
What you fail to consider is that many of us who are afraid the sky is falling are the very ones who are the biggest believers and who have the most skin in the game. 
Bitcoin's most stalwart proponents have dedicated themselves 100% to its use as a currency, and that requires that you cut ties with fiat currency. 
So yes, if you are a popcorn-eating sideliner who is simply watching from afar without skin in the game, and without the balls to get his hands dirty jump starting this new currency then feel free to criticize the man in the ring. 
I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful, but these are trying times for bitcoin's most dedicated proponents, and I for one salute those of you are fully  invested for the right reasons and are suffering losses.

This is not true in my experience. I send transactions without the fee regularly and I've never had one not go through or even be delayed. 
Frankly, fee is the wrong word.  Miner donation or miner request would be more appropriate. Fees are costs that are *pulled* from your account. Anything you *push* (donate, give, etc.) really can't be called a fee.  I think we call it that because it's a short one syllable, three letter word. That's all.

Yes, but you'd love to buy $1,000 worth and the next year it's worth $10,000. 
By the way, both scenarios have substantial historical precedent. Quick 50% crashes have not been uncommon, but each year has shown a roughly 10x return. 
My recommendation: look into the non-monetary benefits of bitcoin (ending war, etc.) and you have the right motive to be a long term believer. Nobody knows, but I think there's a really good chance that the monetary benefits will be enormous as well.

I hope you are right, but a lower case b is not on the list of likely candidates in the article. 
My vote is for moving to the following:
**ISO code**: XBT
**Colloquial name**: bits
**Symbol**: lower case b with line through it like Breadwallet has adopted. 
This way we can keep the uppercase B (with two lines) to represent BTC and call them bitcoins for expensive stuff. As a side note, when we use the plural bitcoin**s** we are illustrating units. When we say bitcoin (without an s) we are talking about the protocol or unitless version of the asset like how one says "I need some water" 
I will be pushing for this.

I recommend staring at a bitcoin order book (like Bitstamp) for a while. That will help it make sense. 
Basically, when someone wants to sell their coin they have to *ask* for a lower price than the next best (lowest) seller(s) on the exchange. When a previously reluctant buyer sees the lower offer and buys that bitcoin, it has been purchased at a lower price; they have mutually pushed the price down. 
When on the other hand a new person wants to buy bitcoin, they have to *bid* a higher price than the next best (highest) buyer(s) on the exchange. When a previously reluctant seller sees the higher bid and sells that bitcoin, it has been purchased at a higher price; they have mutually pushed the price up.

The point is that state-run "regulation" is no regulation at all. Regulation = regular, predictable, reliable, steady.  State agencies and agents are anything but that. 
The best regulation is that provided by the immutable laws (math, physics, etc) and where that's not possible then the free market is the next best alternative. 
Same basic idea surrounding regulation goes for protection, charity, and everything else the state claims to provide. Glad to see your open mindedness. That deserves an upvote.

A bit will equal 100 satoshis? Is that what they are proposing? I thought they were just proposing changing the terminology so that 1 bitcoin would then equal 1 bit (just drop the "coin"). I figured this was being proposed to differentiate the unit bitcoin from the network bitcoin.

Basically what I'm trying to do is have a site where: 
a) users can log in quickly and anonymously 
b) users can get paid in bitcoin for various services they perform.
c) users can spend on the site for various things. 
I don't want to code/develop my own integrated wallet where I have security responsibility. I want an easy login for users to swallow without having to develop username and password management. I also want a wallet-as-a-service where all the trust and security is outsourced, while maintaining the functionality expressed above. 
It seems to me that a log in with a pubic address as a username and private key as a password kind of approach would do the trick, but it's still foggy in my own mind, trying to explore possibilities.

Can you expound on that? I'm not a miner but if I were in the pool (presumably for financial reasons) I would just monitor the operators to make sure nothing was fishy. 
If something were fishy, I, and many other honest, non-malicious miners, could simply move at that point. 
You really do need 51% of the entire network (100% of a 51% pool) to be dishonest.

Will it have the functionality of the old app (wallet access)?  
Right now Blockchain is one of two iOS apps I know of with the ability to send and receive Bitcoin (I have the old Coinbase app too, the un-neutered one before Apple banned it). 
If it won't have the wallet features  the last thing you want to do is let Apple update your app automatically. I'd turn the auto update off if that's the case.

**Moral of the story**: 
A: If you are a minor with a 1+ month time horizon you should (in terms of comparative variance) be okay with mining in a &lt;0.1% pool (49% monthly exchange rate variance is off the pool chart on the low end)
B: If you are a minor with a 1 day time horizon you should (in terms of comparative variance) be okay with mining in a ~25% pool (2.2% daily exchange rate variance is between the 25% and 50% pools, much closer to 25%). 
**Alternative interpretation** (including savings preference): 
If you are a miner who has a 1+ month time horizon (which is typical), and you hold X BTC in savings, you should (in terms of comparative monthly variance) be comfortable mining X/30 BTC/day in a ~2% pool. 
**Logic**: 
Monthly BTC exchange rate variance = 49%, which falls between the daily mining return variance pools of 0.8% and 3.0%, call it ~2%.

Thanks. It does indeed. Basically I'm learning that wallets have to support the feature, which limits my market drastically. 
I want people to be able to come to my site, log in with a pubic address as a username, private key as a password kind of approach. The site will pay this user for various things (hence the need for a public address) and charge the user for other certain things (which would require their private key). 
I would open source the front end so that people could verify the security of requesting their private key (when spending on the site). 
Basically what I'm trying to do is have a site where: 
a) users can log in quickly and anonymously 
b) users can get paid in bitcoin for various services they perform.
c) users can spend some of what they earn on the site itself. 
I don't want to code/develop my own integrated wallet where I have security responsibility. I want a wallet-as-a-service where all the trust and security is outsourced, while maintaining the functionality expressed above.

Why not instead link to some development from DarkWallet or OpenBazaar or someone who is actually building tools based on bitcoin's core values of privacy, individual empowerment, and commerce within the bitcoin economy rather than this service which sacrifices your privacy and legitimizes the status quo fiscal and economic systems.

Very simply, price may not matter, but *change in price over time* does. 
If you are holding bitcoin that you bought at an earlier date, you care what the price is today, relative to then. If you bought today, and don't plan on spending until a later date, you care what the price will be a that later date.

Good suggestion. I suppose most wallets and exchanges do it that way (off chain) anyway (e.g. coinbase, changetip, etc). I was initially concerned that people wouldn't want to trust off chain transactions. 
I'm interested in the sign in approach you suggested. Can you tell me more about how that could work? I wouldn't  want to require users to give me the private key. 
I really just want to use someone else's service (if it exists) so I don't have to develop the wallet and transfer features. Like a 'wallet powered by x' service that can move people's bitcoin around when the user requests.

Blast! Guess I'll have to just tip you then. 1 pat-on-the-back @_date: 2014-09-20 20:16:36
We can start by calling it bitcoin instead of bitcoin**s**. 
Using "bitcoins" implies that bitcoin is a count noun (like cars), which leads people to believe you buy discrete numbers of them. Using "bitcoin" implies that it is a mass noun (like water), which helps people understand that they can buy custom amounts of it. 
With that said, bitcoin actually is discrete but not in units of BTC, rather in units of Satoshis.
So if people insist on using a plural discrete count noun formulation then use Satoshis, otherwise, call it bitcoin.

We're on the same page. I just don't think everyone else is. Fortunately this news will prompt new people to buy bitcoin solely because of the increased merchant acceptance, ultimately pushing price up, but that takes time.

EDIT: tldr: merchant adoption will cause downward price pressure until it's easier and/or more beneficial to (re)obtain bitcoin than it is to obtain/use fiat. We're not there yet. The barrier to obtaining bitcoin is too high and the perceived benefits have not yet been internalized, particularly for new users. 
You make a good observation. The issue is timing. The market is not static. The big question is who **initiates** the trade and subsequent market movement? 
Let's consider two potential scenarios preceding a Dish transaction. 
a) The Dish customer already owns bitcoin. 
b) The Dish customer has to buy bitcoin first, before making the transaction. 
Which is more likely for the first chunk of transactions? My underlying assumption is that most of the initial transactions will be current owners of bitcoin who want to spend some, for the 'cool factor' and the 'ease factor'.  In this case the bitcoin is transferred to Dish and dish **initiates** a sell order, pushing the price down. 
Over time we will hopefully see more of scenario b), people who don't actually own bitcoin yet, who are prompted to buy because of the ability to spend on goods and services. 
But what will motivate *new* people to go through the trouble of obtaining bitcoin to transact in it when their fiat is doing that task much more easily? 
I submit three items: 1. It has to become easier to obtain bitcoin. 2. People must see the value of holding their savings in bitcoin (seeing bitcoin's investment potential or at least being insulated from value declines through hedging, etc). 3. Merchants must offer discounts for bitcoin transactions. 
Until we see progress in these three items, bitcoin merchant adoption will cause downward pressure. Fortunately we are seeing progress there, but it's not keeping up with merchant adoption.

Fair enough, but I have grander visions of bitcoin being more than simply a payment network for fiat currencies. Bitcoiners need to internalize the immensely larger potential that bitcoin offers as a store of value as compared to bitcoin as a payment processor. For the full potential to come to fruition funds must be held/saved/stored in bitcoin itself, not converted. As soon as that happens you will see bitcoin's true killer app, a store of value. Nobody is concerned with volatility when volitity is up and to the right.

You are both correct to some degree. I bought bitcoin at $800+. But I also bought some at $40. My weighted average is besides the point. 
My point is, if you discovered bitcoin when it was $1200 and for ethical reasons (not greedy speculation) decided to support this thing 100% you would be really hurting right now. And some really good-hearted people are. You don't get to decide people's motives or abilities. Personally I'm trying to fund a bitcoin project, because I believe in it from a moral/ethical standpoint, and now after having sunk a lot into the project I am faced with potentially having to cut losses and abandon the project. It's disheartening because I want bitcoin to succeed and now I may not be able to do my part.

It's not that simple. Not all sellers are weak hands, that's my point. Please stop the arrogant and condescending ignorance.

I installed BitWallet several weeks ago when it first came out, but was leery of it asking for my blockchain.info credentials, so I didn't give them.

You are making a value judgement on my intentions.  I believe my comment was: 
1) Informative - I gave valuable feedback to the merchant.
2) Polite - I said please.
3) True/Objective - This is in fact how I feel personally.  
If a merchant is serious about accepting bitcoin and they have a spot for their accepted payment forms I feel they should add bitcoin.  Simple as that.  I did not speak for the community as a whole, I simply spoke my feelings.  A savvy merchant will appreciate this feedback just as much as "Nice!", which granted is also valuable feedback.

And yet other merchants to target 0.1 confirmations.

Running a qt exe does seem clunky, and it would limit my market to desktop users running qt. 
Has nobody developed a bitcoin-signing-as-a-service and/or wallet-as-a-service for this kind of thing? Seems pretty useful. Instead of running a local qt exe you send a request to CloudSign (made up) which performs and returns the signature for local verification. Then it could also provide the wallet-as-a-service function as well.

Update: 
I just tried again to get the app to "build" a wallet. I let it "build" for over an hour, and I finally gave up / aborted the process. 
The app hangs on a page that says: "Building wallet. This will take some time. Don't go away. We promise it's working". 
My question and concern is not whether "it's working", but rather, what it's working on. 
At best it's an app that tried to work, and failed, more likely it seems to me at this point it's an app that's working to steal info from your phone to try to break into other Bitcoin apps or perform other malicious acts. 
I'm deleting this app, and until I hear a convincing reply/explanation from Pheeva, I'm recommending that everyone stop using it and/or not install it in the first place.

The services in this space are getting cozier and cozier with state regulators (touting themselves as the "legal" way to buy bitcoin mere hours after the SEC announcements) and large corporate interests (offering login only through Facebook, Google, etc). 
I can't help but think these guys fully support (and likely bought and paid for) the financial hitmen of the SEC. The battle lines being drawn in the financial and economic sectors are becoming clearer and clearer, and these guys are, in my opinion, on the wrong side of that line.

You are part of the problem if you are so naive to think governments aren't and won't be fiercely opposed to bitcoin. This is in fact a cold war, and if you are not against the state you are not for bitcoin.

Stop downvoting this. He is correct. Bitcoin's ONLY hope as a store of value is if it gains traction as a currency, and that does NOT mean getting merchants to accept USD through the bitcoin payment network. 
It means getting merchants to accept bitcoin natively and pay their suppliers in bitcoin (and that those suppliers hold and only pay their suppliers in bitcoin, and so forth). 
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:09:13
I can't emphasize this enough:
Bitcoin's killer app has already been discovered, it just needs to be harnessed and embraced. 
**Bitcoin's killer app is...a store of value**
We need to find out a way to educate and incentivize each other to keep our savings in bitcoin. Seriously. The measly 3% bitcoin saves in transaction fees pales in comparison to the potential benefits of keeping our savings in bitcoin. 
Think about how production efficiency grows over time with innovation and technology improvements - the ever decreasing raw inputs (time, energy, and matter) required to yield given outputs (final products). Then think about how much that should drive prices down over time if the money supply were fixed, which bitcoin is now for all intents and purposes. 
The best thing we can do is encourage and incentivize bitcoiners to keep their savings in bitcoin, and not sell out. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:23:17
Great. Looking forward to your progress. Your project helps the bitcoin price by getting bitcoin into the hands of savers, rather than out of their hands. Hopefully people will choose to keep a good portion in bitcoin, which is the whole purpose of your project I gather.

This is the best illustration I've found as well.  Watch it as many times as you need, until it really sinks in.  If that doesn't work, read The Creature from Jekyll Island, and then watch it again. 
I heard somewhere that Mike is making the next episode on bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. That would be awesome.

I also posted to my Twitter and Facebook accounts, with this description: 
"5 years ago today was the first recorded and widely publicized real world transaction made with bitcoin. Two pizzas were purchased for 10,000 bitcoin. That event triggered the first price signal for bitcoin. 
Today that same amount of bitcoin can buy you over 250,000 pizzas.
In celebration of the new bitcoin economy, and bitcoin's phenomenal subsequent  performance as a store (or rather increase) of value we decided to get some pizza at the Pie Hole, arguably Salt Lake City's best pizza joint, made only better by the fact that they also accept the worlds best form of money.

I can see your point, but for me I'd like the sign in tied to a bitcoin address specifically so that bitcoin (the currency) can be tied to the user.

Andreas' conceptual evolution:
 
1) Bitcoin is money
2) Bitcoin is communication
3) Bitcoin is a content type
4) Bitcoin is...existence? Life itself? 
I love Andreas. Just wondering where the next level of abstraction will take us.
Edit: Just watched it. I'm on board with step 3, ready for step 4 :D  Great presentation!

So happy to see Robocoin with such a small market share. 
Wish there were more privacy-oriented ATMs available, but I get that the current situation is about as good as we can do with our messed up legal systems. 
And I also want to commend coinatmradar for this fantastic service. Outstanding work.

Edit {
Thanks for the responses. BitWallet dev team, it might be a good time to open source the code and/or defend/explain your software, considering all these valid critiques currently just a few lines from the top of this subreddit.  I love the design and functionality of the wallet, but security is clearly lacking. 
I've been a fan of bread wallet for a long time. I always recommend it for beginners. 
That said, I also think the community undervalues bitWallet for iOS. It is also HD, and has many more features for advanced users like r/bitcoiners.  
Am I missing something? Why no love for bitWallet? 
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:59:27
I think security and simplicity is the biggest selling feature of breadwallet. 
I'm really hoping that you build out more features (you can hide them under the hood and still maintain a sleek easy look). 
Namable accounts and addresses is the feature I'm looking for the most, it's the only reason I still use BitWallet (which I have security concerns about) for some things. 
Regardless I'm so grateful for the excellent product you've put out. Thank you!

Is this real life? The mental gymnastics required to believe these arguments is astounding. 
In any war (like a currency war) the first victim is truth. We are clearly in a war, as truth is so long dead that it can barely be remembered. 
Common sense tells you the simple truth. In a society with any degree of technological advancements, the currency of such an economy must not only retain purchasing power, but should appreciate to be considered good. 
How this man can argue, presumably with a straight face, that "good money" should *decrease* in value over time...I can only conclude that he is not in fact a man, but rather a mindless robot spewing lies from the propagandists who programmed him.

I woke up today to see this announcement, as well as a Facebook message from a friend I made while I was in Turkey a few years ago. 
The message was about her Indiegogo project to raise money for an upcoming choir tour.
I met her, her family, and many other singers and their families while on a choir tour of my own, where we were invited from the USA to participate in one of their festivals. 
The families of the local Turkish choir members hosted us in their own homes, prepared and served delicious meals for us, took care of our transportation and overall, treated us like royalty. 
We were complete strangers, with just one thing in common, a love for music. I will never forget the hospitality and care they showed to us. 
I've been excited about the potential bitcoin has in erasing the political and economic borders that divide us. I wish we were closer to that goal, and that my friends in Turkey had posted a bitcoin address instead. 
At this point, even with the service in the original post, I hesitate to ask them to set something up to receive a bitcoin donation, despite my desire to see bitcoin adoption increase. I've been around in the space for quite a while, and I've done more than my share of evangelizing. Some people get excited, but unfortunately most still don't understand, and don't see the vision, and I don't like to be pushy. 
Not sure what my point is with all this. I guess I just wanted to express my appreciation for good people around the world, and my hope that someday sooner than later bitcoin will be ubiquitous. We're getting closer.

"Friend's and family" seems better. "Anything else" says it's not one of those other things, but you can plausibly say that any payment was for a "friend".
