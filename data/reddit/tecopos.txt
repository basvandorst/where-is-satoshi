Interesting. Let's see if it's better than Bitcoin Ticker.
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:19:43
No, because the prize money has to go somewhere, and it wouldn't be for Satoshi. We would risk having it end up at the Bitcoin foundation!
Otherwise, yes, obviously, just give him the damn prize!!! I can't see anyone who deserves it more than him
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:23:36
No point in running XT for now :)
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:09:40
yes, down again
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:55:40
Since they're tips, the transaction probably consists of many, very small inputs, which always need a big fee to get processed. That's probably why it's asking you for such a big fee. As for fee control, you can't control it in breadwallet.

can't seem to find the Bitcoin option. Do they have an address? it would be easier if they just put an address on their website...
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:48:13
just reset it
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:28:27
At least they have more than what they had before being chosen!
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:11:19
Growing pains phase!
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:46:00
There is no "max" button, you just input the whole balance you have...
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:58:18
Seems to be fixed, and no binaries were changed
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:50:54
This wallet is awesome and it looks great! Keep up the good work :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:43:45
Breadwallet abd BitSpotty are must have's. Zeroblock, Coinbits and CoinFeed are also cool
@_date: 2014-07-18 11:11:25
US Government insistently wants to create regulation for something that is almost impossible to regulate. You guys fear what you don't know/can't control. That's why you create regulation. We don't need it, we are doing fine without being regulated. You just want to destroy Bitcoin, because you don't know anything about it.
People who come here aren't looking for regulation, they're searching the exact opposite, and are willing to take the risks inherent to crypto's.

As far as I know, Mycelium depends on their servers, so isn't breadwallet more secure as it uses SPV?
Anyways, I'll probably try this soon. Meanwhile, breadwallet is still my main wallet
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:35:00
That is not Mike Hearn's node. Mike's node is this one 
Anyways, just checked the node on the OP again. It's now gone(?)
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:48:36
One more point for breadwallet! It's the best for people starting with Bitcoin (and also good for more advanced users)
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:14:11
4 hours to sync ... amazing! this is enough to be amazing!
@_date: 2014-12-01 21:36:21
Never trust online sources to store large sums/savings. Always have cold wallets for this. That being said, breadwallet is awesome and amazing for small amounts/daily spendings
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:47:11
lol, such stealthyness you've got there. Nobody would donate even if it was legit.
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:58:29
so many tabs! Also, dat video... nice! And chromium, cool :)
Oh wait... This is about full blocks? Sorry I was distracted posting elsewhere that I'm supporting 20mb blocks.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:50:10
For people who had funds there: do you still have them? Can you withdraw them?
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:08:31
Breadwallet! Simply awesome. bitWallet looks good too, especially if you have a Touch ID enabled device
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:00:56
Well, if you're willing to send the file, I'm also willing to give it a shot. Please send me when you can :)
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:50:07
I'm also interested. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:59:29
Came here to post this... Yeah, hello indeed, massive warning sign.
@_date: 2014-09-15 23:33:32
It's about time they add Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:23:16
damn, here we go. Now there's gonna be rage
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:26:00
How do you VNC into a cold storage?
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:11:22
either that or manipulators taking advantage of that :P
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:37:34
Thanks for all your replies! Giving us quite a disturbing insight on Mt Gox...
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:30:32
YES! LET ME VENT TO! DO IT!!!
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:58:51
Not really getting how this is calculated... As said before, Bitcoin has 100% uptime. Is there any known moment in history where the hashrate was 0?
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:15:02
awesome! now let's just wait for that iOS update that allows 3rd party complications...
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:29:41
So there was NO cold storage at the time you worked there? I'm seriously shocked by some stuff I'm reading here, this is far worse than I thought.
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:16:50
yeah, you can send .11 BTC my way please, thanks :D
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:22:20
Upvoting because warning about "famous spamfilter update" is well documented in the post!
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:49:15
BTCX? I have BTC/USD
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:45:03
No, but I would pay x BTC/year for that.
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:49:19
first one is already done. anyone knows the answer?
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:20:01
You say I can buy my latte with secure truly instant confirmation, so I assumed that 1 confirmation in your system was somewhat more secure than 1 confirmation on the blockchain... I think my head is kind of stuck, and you're seeing way ahead, but for now I just can't seem to find any advantage in your system. Don't take it as a destructive comment, I'm just not very knowledgeable! :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 15:45:29
No luck with pywallet?
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:04:46
not getting any clues on my email... also, any proof of funds?
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:49:03
I'm getting a bit confused about this by checking OP's post history, so this has apparently been going for quite some time (almost a year? 1 month?).
Any winners yet? The first email clue has been widely known apparently. Also, haven't seen any proof of funds. Can anyone clarify if we're losing our time or not?
@_date: 2015-09-14 22:29:17
besides vout, there is also phez, i think it's missing
@_date: 2015-04-06 11:57:25
If he only accesses yyy private key, he will only have access to funds on y
@_date: 2015-09-15 00:09:10
 pretty much no users, but still there
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:57:11
Link expired. Was the download clean? Anyone managed to get it?
This makes us think what will happen to our Bitcoins in case something happens to us... Important to have backup measures.
@_date: 2015-09-15 23:02:06
No, because they're not using a blockchain. But this is irrelevant: Apple is a patent troll, so let's just ignore 50... no, 60... no, maybe something like 90% of their patents, lol
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:09:34
Wise advice, passwords could be weak
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:16:06
Yes, but aren't Mycelium nodes more easily targeted than random SPV breadwallet connections? I am saying something completely wrong?
As for avaliability, yeah, I get your point :)
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:25:33
Well, as far as I know from the current bter situation, that's not an issue, it's default. because (sorry to say) your balance is indeed 0. Yours and everyone else's
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:01:21
Which one would be cheaper for someone already in control of several (something like 500+) nodes?
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:00:06
No... But Mycelium on Android has, so there's a high probability that this comes to iOS too, I guess. If it does I'll maybe switch from breadwallet. But just maybe, Mycelium is still a wallet dependent on 3rd parties. breadwallet depends only on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:03:25
Your project soudns cool... But how does this extend current security measures? :)
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:57:11
waiting for local trader. maybe it will make me switch from breadwallet...
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:00:29
Uh... targeted by someone who wants to withhold transactions like oleganza said. With... Bitcoin targeting things? haha, I'm not sure. Maybe a DoS, or selectively rejecting transactions from their memory pools, thus not relaying them?
@_date: 2015-02-14 14:17:53
motto of the story: use Mycelium on Android and breadwallet on iOS :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:07:10
Go for breadwallet. And come on... Update the damn phone, lol
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:02:50
Bitcoin Core 0.10 already supports Watch-Only addresses... And I think Armory does too, you should check out both options
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:47:01
so what was the answer, after all ?
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:56:37
Well, there aren't "non legit" Bitcoins... Just withdraw them to your control :) It's not safe on an exchange...
You can cash them out on many exchanges, just choose one that suits you best...
And nice find :) Also, be sure to search about paper wallets!
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:04:06
damn, this is pretty hard without any clues, there are quite a bit of posts there...
