Huge Internet Archive thank you!   Not only did you help us, showed the benevolent side of the crypto community, you also demonstrated a selfless process for giving away a large fortune.   (fundraising costs often costs 40% of what is raised, both from direct solicitation but also through the big foundations).  
I my opinion the charities you picked were as good or better than what I have seen foundations with huge staffs, strategic advisors, and Process.
Thank you for inspiring the angels in all of us.  The world needs more Pines!

Im not too afraid of that.   What I am psyched about is keeping bitcoins in circulation rather than just an "investment".   We got the sushi place to take bitcoins, and would like to see more of it.     
So putting bitcoins into the hands of Archive staff seemed like a good idea, and we were fortunate to get a match so other's donations would still go towards servers and such, but the match would go  back into circulation.

We got our local Sushi place to accept bitcoins, and then we showed up and bought lunch.   repeatedly.
Another is we set up an honor-based atm at our work to move bitcoin back and forth  (this is the Internet Archive)
And we just distributed 0.27BTC to all employees as end-of-year gift, and they will go out and spend it in all sorts of odd ways.
Lastly, if you see a "bitcoin accepted" sign, buy something.   If someone accepts it for donations, donate something, anything.
We are having fun, and that is a way to get it to live.

Thank you!    The Archive very much appreciates the support.    A donor matched all the btc we got in Dec, and these were given to the employees.   Now 60 employees have  0.27BTC to spend.      The Archive seems to be one of the few that keep bitcoin donations as bitcoin.    Now we are spreading them so they are spent.
Thank you.

The most damning graph showing how credit unions are being systematically forced out of business is this:      200-300 shut each year, only 1-2 are allowed to start.

Wow, congrats! Reminds me of the guy in Sweden who did the same.

that is true.   if you want a receipt, you should use the bitpay link rather than the vanity address.

when I bought sushi earlier I used the blockchain.info iphone app on a *nonjailbroken* phone.  it works really well.  I set up the account/wallet with a web browser, but you can do it throught the phone.  I keep most of my coins on my bitcoin-qt wallet on my computer and transfer a couple coins at a time to the blockchain wallet.

1115 Clement St, San Francisco 94118.   A really good bento box for $8.  I eat there most days of the week.

I'll be there.  If folks want to buy internetarchive swag for bitcoin (next door) and tour we can arrange.

Thank you for acknowledging that.   the Internet Credit Union has been under major fire by the regulators because of our support for bitcoin, but we have gotten that one through.
We are trying.   -brewster   Chairman, Internet Credit Union

The Internet Archive has about 350BTC at this point, mostly from 2011.     We have been paying employees with it, and buying lots of sushi (next door), and have an honor-based ATM at the library.    We want to find more things to do with it that are in the spirit of keeping the currency circulating (not cashing it out).  onwards!

We have bitpay so that if people want a reciept for tax reasons.   But most people donate straight to us using our new vanity address.      
thank you-- we can really use it for the machines.    we are also getting a 3-to-1 match this year.

I just added both the Sake Zone and the Internet Archive's bitcoin converter box:   to that site.  thank you for the recommendation.

Thank you for the support!   we are getting a bunch of bitcoin donations.  I looked to find out why, and it is the reddit community.      
We do need the funds.   Moore's law has not dropped the price of disks for the last 2 years-- we need support to keep up.

Roman has tried.  as I understand it, they are through the people they could find.    there is a whole process to get it back, however, given the regulatory pressure.  this might have been the issue with EU.
Boy is it a mess, but our interaction with Roman has been good.
