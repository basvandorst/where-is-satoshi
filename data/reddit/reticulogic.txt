Bitcoin is money.  Just like other money, you can spend it, trade it, earn it, lose it and earn interest on it.  Unlike some other money, no person, government or organization is allowed to create, print or mine any more than the 21 million Bitcoin ceiling.  Many people see value in this inflation resistant, secure and open currency and that's why companies and smartphones are looking at Bitcoin as the future of currency.
Feel free to edit, although I really like the first sentence.

Horrifically true dates like the one where she went on a date with a guy who met her at Applebees and lifted his right hand with his left as he made a half grin and she smiled in horror knowing there was something very wrong.  Dating profiles should really mention paralysis.

Nice work, this deal looks to good to pass up
"You send 0.05 bitcoins to the shared Bitcoin address that will be created when I accept your purchase request. 2. Once I verify the bitcoins are in our address, I will deposit $400 into your bank account (U.S. only)."

I just signed up.  The sign up page confused me for a bit since it appears they want you to input specific dates you are paid, but I am paid on alternating Wednesdays.  I clicked the support chat and was immediately connected with someone who said I could enter any String.  Wow, immediately connected right to a developer.  "String" :-)
I'll start with a tiny amount in my next couple checks to see how it goes.

Pretty easy to setup on coinbase.  
1. Go to Coinbase  
2. In the merchant area create a page (not a button)  
3. In the create page section, add some details about the item for sale and a URL that Coinbase returns the user to after they submit payment.  
4. Add the generated code to your web page  
5.  Do a quick test to make sure it all works  
6.  KaBoom!  accepting Bitcoins and not getting gouged by a book re-seller.

I'm totally good with them making a profit.  Perhaps it would be better to itemize the exchange rate vs the surcharges on top of the exchange rate.  When I look at Coinbase, they are very upfront with their fees.

*"establish and run a digital money wiring service based on SMS,* **regulated by the Central Bank of Greece**."
Well that line couldn't get much further from the philosophy of bitcoin.

You are correct in your assessment that I am not a market guru although I did expect a resolved transaction to push the daily high up to that price.    Aside from that, I am really just pointing out a trend I am seeing where I previously got favorable exchange rates with Bitwage but now I only see rates above the high price for the day.

If no business accepted dollars, I doubt they would have much value to you and me.  The adoption of a currency just might impact its price.  Maybe.

Are markets created and shares traded in truthcoin or bitcoin?
    
* If truthcoin, then it would be nice if you distributed x number of truthcoin to users every month so they can create and/or take shares in markets.  Granted this will devalue the coin a bit every month against the value of bitcoin but would increase the user activity in the markets.  It could also spread the interest beyond the "gambling / risk taking personality type".
* If bitcoin, then allow using truthcoin and go back to the first bullet.  :-)
* When creating a market, add an option to record the outcome in factom after final verification.  This option could cost a little extra.
