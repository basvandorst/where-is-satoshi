This is what r/bitcoin has become..

This is most likely true. I had an intense conversation via twitter with multiple accounts that seemed to be all connected to one person.   and there was another one.. Dudes were talking in Latin at certain points which raised a red flag to me.. Also the guy  joker posted a link to a thread on bitcoin talk which advertised a private key cracker for sale (which we all know is bullshit and can't be done) and I believe this person (or people) are part of some organization which has a vested interest in seeing the demise of crypto

all open markets are foward looking.. large traders of btc know that the measures draghi laid out this morning were not coming as a surprise, so to say that a tiny price move in btc came as a result of ECB meeting is just foolish... all fiat fx traders knew NRIR were coming conisdering we've been in a ZIR environment since 2008... ABS and LTRO measures arent a surprise either.... seems more likely that paypal and ebay news could be more of a driver than anything else...

lmfao yeah i guess when you bankrupt the bank of england and take it over based on a lie that had to do with the outcome of a napoleonic war a few bad loans means you go bankrupt... so stupid..

you obviously dont know your history very well... i suggest you actually read before making retarded comments.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:13:54
Well there are vanity addresses, but on twitter have seen many of them get hacked.. so i wouldnt go that route.. and if someone doesnt want to use bitcoin or altcoins due to the fact that the wallet addys are "non-sexy" then that person can take the longest walk on the shortest pier... just my .02

this coming from the former head puppet of the Rothschild financial regime.... how can anyone take anything this man says seriously? he force fed banks liquidity when they dint need it and created an environment where markets are hostage to cheap lending rates and increasingly opaque central bank language. he created a world where the open market can be hijacked by assholes who have ASIC-like super computers with super fast direct connections to the exchanges and can front run the S.I.P before us humans have a chance to react to any important piece of news. tbh he can go back to collecting his $250k in fiat for a speech he gives to a room full of lambs and leave the crypto world alone.

this is so awesome - ive been working on a project for a year and a half and ive always been intrigued by etherum since i first read about it when vitalik buterin left bitcoin magazine to go full time on it. im sold now completely.

im jewish you idiot!!!! the rothschild family was never bankrupted. you're just a peon with little knowledge of financial history
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:37:38
i unequivocally second this.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:00:25
this is all common knowledge... fail to see the point you are trying to make, considering they have many businesses that are STILL around today. evelyn de rothschild is only one of the richest men in the world (based on what he actually shows on paper) and was a top adviser to queen elizabeth the second. so just stop now.

as someone who was robbed by scam artists in the PFGBest bankruptcy (google it) I can assure you, this is no scam.. but what would life be without naysayers? :)
