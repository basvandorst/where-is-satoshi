Now I want more.

I don't have many issues with my bank or credit card company, but they do make some decisions on my behalf. Especially PayPal. If I want to buy counterfeit Nikes from the Russian Mafia or some high-class Dutch erotica, I know I'm taking a risk. I don't need a financial nanny.

Accidental millionaires are generally good about putting that money back into circulation.

Maybe when it hits bottom he--or a close friend--buys a few coins.

Honestly, I almost fell for that the first time I went to buy crypto. Something looked fishy, and "Bitcoin Cash" didn't quite ring right, so I did an extra moment of research.

I bought 50 coins, and they gave me $15.

I was going to, but then I saw someone badmouthing the wallet solution I was considering, so I decided I needed to learn more before making a move.

Wait, you mean there aren't physical coins inside my phone?

As a noob who has a few hundred on coinbase, I've been finding it quite frustrating. I hear, "Get off coinbase and get on X." Then I read, "X sucks,move to Y." "Y is a ripoff. Z is the way to go."

I'm very irresponsible.

It should be Champagne. For when the coin is bull, we must celebrate, and when it is bear, we will have our Champagne to console us.
