Hold it. In 10 years you could buy an island for it.

Now it's your word versus their.
That's why decentralised exchanges exist.

Look at the recent version of the client - 0.13.2. Basically we are in beta. Changes are acceptable, especially such useful ones. Better do it now than when bitcoin hits 1 trillion dollar cap. 
Transaction fees are already insane, 100x bigger than ethereum offers.

Isn't it already there? mega.nz

Just make block size unlimited.

Forget about mining, it's a scam.
If your calculations are right, your expected value would be 0.4 cents a day. And you're buying a $20 router for $60, wasting $40. I'm not even talking about extra energy costs.
Better buy 0.044 bitcoins for these $40.

If I were paid as much as they are, I would work with even more enthusiasm.

They could simply increase the block size limit instead of wasting the donators' money for another year of their useless "work". 
I wonder how much they're paid for doing nothing but bullshitting to the people.

The only entity to always profit from trading is the exchange.

"Low fees" And then I lol'd.

Only if sha256 is broken. Then the attacker could acquire huge mining power for nothing.
Or if elliptic curves are vulnerable / have backdoors. Then it would be possible to calculate the private key of any wallet.
