Yeah. I tried to send $100 the other day to a friend whose shit was falling apart and they needed $ for a cheap motel room for a night. 
The fee for WU was $12. I filled out a lot of web forms and gave them a credit card # and it was declined. There's plenty of credit available, no explanation why it was declined.
So I tried Moneygram. Also $12. First transaction looked like it worked, waited 3 hours, then it declined. Called customer service, they said "maybe try again." I tried again. It worked - almost 7 hours after I started. The person who needed a motel room ended up spending the night (awake) in 7-11 and the Western Union office waiting for the funds.
Fuck those guys.

Setting up TLS/SSL with a StartSSL cert is free and doesn't take a lot of time.

Detweiler thought pretty much everyone other than John Gilmore was Tim May. He eventually melted down and disappeared.

I made 9 loans; 5 were repaid on time, 2 are late 1-30 days with no payments, 2 are late 31-120 days with no payments.

Yes. The service may have improved, but the borrowers who took the money and ran away have more than eaten up the profits I made on the borrowers who repaid their loans.

Receiving BTC is just the first step - either it needs to be converted to local currency, or the receiver needs to find something interesting to spend it on.
Actually receiving the payment is easy - deciding to accept payment in BTC, and putting together the conceptual/practical framework for doing it is *not* easy. 
Just try paying for something with BTC at a vendor who hasn't chosen to accept it yet and see how easy it is (not!).

Early 90's, really. You also might enjoy reading about David Chaum's cryptographic work. 
Many of the usual suspects for Satoshi were cypherpunks; the article fails to mention Nick Szabo who was an early list participant.

Bank transfers aren't instant, unless you and the transferee happen to be using the same bank and the transfer takes place entirely within that bank's books. Wire transfers can happen within minutes (or hours), ACH transfers are usually at least overnight.

If the recent price stability is caused by usability problems, how would you explain the volatility previously experienced? It's not like the usability has been slowly increasing, then it peaked, then it crashed . . .

It is meaningless marketing bullshit.
