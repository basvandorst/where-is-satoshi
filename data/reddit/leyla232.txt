Actually, it's not Bitcoin, it's the Ethereum start up crowd. This article really proves some of my hesitations towards those Eth start ups, great presentation, little follow through.

Coinbase made a billion in fees in 2017, why is it so outrageous that Bitfinex has 2 billion? Whenever someone wires money to Bitfinex they credit it in tethers. Other big exchanges like Kraken, Polo, Bittrex also buy tether.

"[Update 05.01.18, 16:10 Uhr] New message from Visa: The license agreement will be terminated due to the continuous non-compliance with the visa rules. It is clear that this is not a visa move against cryptocurrencies, but the alleged misconduct of a single issuing bank. Nonetheless, with so many customers, it has a global impact on hundreds of thousands of customers."

They didn't shut down Bitcoin cards, they set down Wavecrest. Or are there any other news?

Some believe Hal Finney (and/or Nick Szabo) were Satoshi. There are some quite conclusive clues: Hal's neighbours name was Satoshi Nakamoto (which is quite a rare name), he was the first to receive Bitcoin from Satoshi. etc...   
There is this very good article from forbes:   
It comes to the conclusion that Hal is not Satoshi but I don't find that fully convincing. Not saying it was him but chances are it was.

But these contracts are not settled in BTC, they are just dollar bets and do not directly relate with the BTC market. Since supply is not that high, it will be hard to effectively short, no?

First, this is from March, 2016, second, he expresses that he has doubts that Segwit is the proper scaling solution (it's not, it's a stepping stone towards LN) but in the meantime Segwit has been implemented, and it's irresponsible to stubbornly stick to his doubts because Segwit has been implemented and it's important that he does all he can to support BTC scaling as far as possible, otherwise he is (perhaps unwillingly) acting as a Bcash agent.  
I'm guessing that they are reluctant to transfer all their BTC to Segwit addresses because of the transaction costs (but that is just a guess). A blocksize increase would have spared them those costs.

LN actually needs a blocksize increase, so fees will reduce again (also hopefully Segwit will be further implemented). The reason, they are not increasing blocksize now is that it would set a wrong precedent.

A friend of mine sent a transaction without any fee but it didn't cancel because it kept getting rebroadcasted, after about a month it was picked up and got confirmed, so it eventually went through.

Nope, only the weak hands will sell but even many newbies are aware of the volatility and welcome the chance to buy cheaper. Only recently, when it dropped from 19K to 13K a couple of new investors I know personally and I actually expected them to panic but instead they bought more. It's been a pattern throughout the year that when there is a drop instantly lot of buyer jump in and rise the price back up.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:32:09
In some way, it can't because anonymous transactions in BTC will be optional whereas in XMR they are mandatory which gives it a clear advantage in this domain. I think they complement each other very well!

It started trading the same day the bitcoin.com cto (I think) declared to stop supporting btc, the same day bch started its next attack, the same day of the btc difficulty adjustment, the same day bitmain throws its next antminer batch on the market. Plus they had announced it for 2018 and quite a few people where in the know. That all reeks of insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:19:15
In the way I propose even more would be bought, because what your  holding your holding anyway, but that money which you use for daily spendings would also go into it but only partially move out and that at a slow rate.

Bitcoin doesnt have to be able to scale to a few more users, it has to be able to scale to the entire world population. No other crypto has a solution for that. Bitcoin (and XMR) have by far the best developers and they will come up with the best solutions. Meanwhile there are plenty of other options to buy your coffee.

The point is that the rising of block size is a short term solution and will constantly have to be repeated, Lightning Network will be a long term solution. Bitcoin doesn't have to be ready now, it has to be ready for the future.

There are fees but they are the usual credit card fees which the vendor has to pay. TenX is horrible as a crypto (at least I don't see any merit in holding the token) but great as a product. They give you the rate from the exchange (Poloniex) without any fees.

Yeah, true, but the other question is if we will still see this big declines. Even now, when the price only goes down by 10% or 20% so many buyers jump in that the price goes up immediately.

If all people were to sell their gold at once the price would also collapse, no? Lots of gold was purchased for 30$ or 300$, so the the value of all the gold in the world is also not the amount of money that was put into it.

Quote from another thread:
“Based upon my opinion as a lawyer (not giving legal advice), and someone who has overseen corporate compliance audits for major corporations in conjunction with top accounting firms, I just want to point out (like I said awhile ago when the Tether stuff restarted) that the lack of release of the audit reports on Tether were probably due to two factors (and not an empty Tether bank account):
1) Ongoing audit. The auditor wouldn't allow a release of the report/preliminary findings because it hadn't finished the audit. They can see the cash in the accounts, but likely wanted to audit way more (e.g., other pairs and also relevant POEs to make sure no other fraud was occuring). This is standard practice, and gets super frustrating--no audit is ever done when you want it to be. This is also why Friedman dumped them--Tether tried to leak a preliminary report that showed the USD in the accounts w/out the audit being completed. Probably also got spooked by the CFTC review and went into auditing overdrive.
2) Ongoing regulatory investigation. I thought that Bitfinex was likely under investigation by the CFTC or SEC weeks ago. This explains why they simply couldn't release an audit report or documentation of their accounts. They have to comply with the investigation, and their lawyers are telling them to sit still and don't do anything that could be construed as interference (leaking financial stability information to the public definitely could result in enhanced charges/penalties if the CFTC finds some other compliance issue).
So, IMO, Tether is likely solvent but the CFTC is digging deeper. You can bet if they had an empty Tether bank account, the CFTC would have shut down this shitshow back in December.”

@_date: 2017-10-15 06:33:24
True, but I think if people get scared out and the price drops to 3500 (for example) that there are now a lot of people with a lot of money who would buy up up so much and the price would immediately rise again. This has probably been happening during the last month.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:11:29
So the Futures did not affect the price? And the decline of the price starting with the launch of the futures is a coincidence?
