This subreddit has 165K subscribers. has 8.6 million subscribers. 
Even if you take IT, has 99K subscribers. 616K subscribers. 
And these are people who are already on reddit. If you take everyone who is a programmer, the gap will be even more. 
So yes, two in 200 seems about right.

There is a proposed solution called the "lightning network" that is built on top of blockchain that can allow millions of transactions per day, or even per hour.

For pc wallet,  use Electrum. 
Install it in a linux virtual machine, whose hard disk is encrypted. 
Never type the seed that's created anywhere. Remember it or write it down, and never share it with anyone (or you lose all coins). 
Don't keep bitcoins in exchanges. Cause exchanges can fail etc.

I don't think the miners care about fee. Proof lies in fact that there are miners who often create empty blocks. 
The block reward is 12.5 btc. Whereas total fees in any block are often less than 1 btc. So fees are a small portion of the profit received by miners.

download electrum. Google it. 
Install it.
Create a new wallet. 
It will generate 13 unique english words, called the "seed". note down this seed and don't forget it. It uniquely identifies your wallet. 
Now you will have a wallet, which will have addresses. 
Use one of those addresses to recieve bitcoin.

Electrum on computer is also a good option. It can be as safe as anything if you only use it to receive the coins.
