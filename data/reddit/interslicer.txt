why do i have to trust hundreds of thousands of people? i have the same number of bitcoins no matter what anyone says or does. i literally dont have to trust anyone.
and 2008 wasnt shitty randomly it was shitty because financial institutions pushed for deregulation and then did shitty things. the whole system is corrupted and no meaningful changes happened in the wake of 2008 to stop it from happening again. its not paranoia man, it happens around the world all the time, its currently happening in multiple countries and it last happened in the US less than 10 years ago. feel free to disagree but you're being pretty dismissive for someone trying to understand our motivations.

i appreciate the gains, but i will keep my money in crypto where it is even if it werent going up. crypto provides a means to opt out of the current financial system. i dont agree with the system, i dont trust the banks, i dont trust the regulatory bodies, i dont trust politicians who are elected on the backs of campaign contributions by the groups mentioned above. 
i have traditional investments also because im not fucking crazy, but i wont be trading my bitcoin for more index funds; not now- not ever. and i think its likely ill be doing the reverse
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:40:44
i do.
2008 wasnt that long ago. corporations sacrifice morality in the name of profit and are cheered for it, and the ones supposed to be standing up for the people are bought and paid for by special interests. ask someone in Greece, or Venezuela, or India, etc how it feels when those in charge of the financial system change the rules. i guess its alright since it hasnt happened to you? im sure it could *never* happen to you...
bitcoin has no one in charge, the rules cant be changed by a minority, it has no walls, no requirements, and the only one i have to trust to use it is me. and you think im the crazy one?

1) when you set up the ledger you will create a seed (24 words) that can recover your wallet. how you store this seed will determine how resistant to things like fire you are. (there are many options from safety deposit boxes to metal engravings) the keys on the wallet and the backup seed are the only way to control that bitcoin. if both are lost, so are the coins. 
2) paper wallets can be secure but keep in mind that you have print the paper wallets so that is an opportunity for people to gain access to the private key (a hardware wallet doesnt ever expose this) if you are careful there are ways to generate these keys on an offline computer, but you have to look into it more seriously to really gain the security advantage. if its a big name exchange i would probably just wait until the hardware wallet comes in before transferring, but thats just me.

this is very much not the same level of security that a ledger or trezor would give you.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:37:17
-the cold storage phone is kept offline except for installing the app
-trezor/ledger have no OS (or rather a firmware only OS) which presents a much smaller attack surface
-ios is not open source, therefore there is no way to verify the security of the private keys, nor can you verify that other connection methods are truly disabled without modifying the hardware of the phone
-theres no way to ensure the software is untampered with such as with the signed firmware of hardware wallets
ultimately its a device with far more software, numerous connection abilities, and no OS or firmware verification. sure its probably better than a hot wallet, but trezor and ledger are purpose built specifically to minimize the ability to circumvent the security. no reason this app cant succeed, just probably not accurate to compare a smart phone + app to a hardware wallet even if you set it to be "offline"

you say local bitcoins has a premium on the price, but those are just people selling bitcoins. that *is* the price of bitcoin if you want to avoid exchanges.
exchanges both have to comply with "know your customer" laws, and due to the immutability of bitcoin transactions, gradually increasing limits protects them from various types of fraud.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:49:54
wow you called a $1300 price increase in 4 months after a $2000 increase in the last 30 days.
its a blind guess, and conservative at that. what value does this "prediction" have?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:23:20
sure i could buy more than i need, and a hacksaw.. but now i have several plates worth of steel for $20-30, a punch set for $20, a hacksaw for $10 and a hammer for $5. which gives me a total of $55 instead of $80, but i have to keep a punch set, a hammer, a hacksaw, and spare steel plate around.
obviously if you have access to all the tools you can save money and if you have access to a machine shop and some spare metal you probably dont need to spend money at all. 
for the rest of us, cryptosteel is an elegant, secure, reusable all in one solution for $25 more. ill take that.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:34:55
dust are very small (in value) bitcoin transactions. because they're so small, and because transaction fees are dependent on the number of transactions you have to add up to equal the final amount and not their value, when the transaction fee is high enough they cost more to add on to a transaction than they are worth.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:07:51
that would be a misunderstanding of how bitcoin works. coins are never actually "in" your wallet, your wallet is nothing more than a GUI for displaying and creating transactions. and there is no way to interact with transactions without interacting with the block chain. you could consolidate your own transactions by sending all your BTC to yourself (thus turning many transactions into a single incoming one) but in order to do this you would have to pay the transaction fee thats limiting in the first place.
this transaction limit and related fees was a primary factor in the bitcoin/bitcoin cash contention and fork, and neither side has really resolved it.
future projects such as the Lightning Network and other "second layer" or "off chain" solution may allow for nearly or entirely free transactions at tremendous volume, but they are not implemented yet and wouldnt resolve the dust thats already around (so far as i know)
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:33:26
well a similarly sized 304 stainless steel plate will probably run you $10-20 , an a-z punch set is ~$20. cryptosteel is $80 but also includes numbers so if your seed is just letters you could probably punch 3-6 plates before cryptosteel is more economic. if you need a set of numbered punches also you might only get 2-4 plates before cryptosteel is cheaper. (assuming you already own a hammer)
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:26:38
first off, you dont need to use an exchange. you can buy and sell bitcoin directly from people, and market places exist for this already.
secondly you can buy goods and services directly with bitcoin, and the longer its around the more places support this

its not a tax, you're paying the miners to have your transaction included in the next block. in order to spend, say, 1 BTC, you have to demonstrate that you have received 1 BTC from previous transactions. a bitcoin transaction has to include a list of previous transactions equaling at least the amount you're spending. the more transactions it takes to equal the final amount the bigger a space you need in the block to fit the whole message and since the space is limited, the more it costs. 
if you received 1 BTC in a single transaction you would have a much smaller transaction fee than if you had to reference 1000 different .001 BTC transactions in order to spend the full amount.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:45:15
dollar cost averaging is buying the same dollar value in multiple increments. barring insider trading, since theres no way to predict the future of a market (seriously. people with literally billions of dollars have been trying for ever) no matter when you buy you wont know how the market will react. by buying in multiple smaller increments you lessen your risk at the cost of potentially lessening your gains if the market never dips.
essentially every time you buy its part of your average, right? buy all at once, that price is your average. buy over time and you add them up and divide. no matter how large the spikes are in bitcoins chart, when you zoom out the average line is much less volatile. in this way you trend with the market but lose the volatility. the more spread out the payments, the more the peaks and valleys cancel each other out.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:04:43
100 every monday is $1000 spread out over 10 weeks. that is spread out for them, and will still be pretty averaged out. even if it dropped to 0 one day (obviously wont) it would still be 90% average. everyone has a different budget too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:35
the complex math miners solve isnt complex in the sense that its some new theoretical math problem that has real world uses. the math they're doing is "hard" because you essentially have to brute force the answer (ie try every possible number until the answer is right) so its *computationally* hard.
this math doesnt benefit the world by advancing mathematics, but by spending a bunch of extra work on this brute force math problem for every block, an attacker in the future would have to redo all that work for every block newer than the one they wanted to change, which would require more computer power than there currently is. so it makes bitcoin more secure

if you're restoring trezor from a seed it wont have a PIN with it, you'd have to make a new PIN. you would also have to enable passphrase if you had it enabled originally. once enabled, you then use the new pin you set up when restoring, and the original passphrase if you had one before. if you didnt have a passphrase before than your coins should have shown up when you restored from the seed with no passphrase.

people are invariably bad at predicting the future even 10 years out. no one has any idea what 100 years will look like.
that being said bitcoin is a living system, and if computing power rises to the point that it threatens the security of bitcoin, bitcoin would just adopt stronger cryptography. how such a change might impact lost accounts is also obviously unpredictable.

im not sure but i think that may be the only way with gdax, but gdax and coinbase are the same account, so in a pinch you could buy through coinbase the slow way (also has slightly higher fees than gdax i think)

its only lost if you sell. your btc balance isnt changing.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:53:42
if you're trying to buy to hodl rather than to trade when you buy with coinbase it takes ~5 days for the ach transfer to clear, but the price is locked in when you click purchase, so as long as you dont want to flip it and sell again within 5 days you can buy that way without leaving assets on the exchange.

why do you assume the ones posting are the ones with no bitcoin?
there may be 300k subs but theres rarely more than a few hundred votes/comments.
also just to play devils advocate,people keep coins on exchanges which wont have separate addresses even though they may have more than 1.5 btc, and not everyone lives in america, and $50 could mean a lot to someone.
why are you judging how emotional other people should be when you dont know them?
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:47:23
so most exchanges have a receiving address that you can send bitcoin to. the problem is that the send address is shared across the hot wallet. normally if someone sent me bitcoin and i wanted to send it back i could just send it back to the address that it came from. you cant do that with an exchange, but a refund could be sent back to your unique receive address (this is sometimes asked for as a return address)
to avoid that problem i recommend using a software wallet in the middle so you send from exchange to your wallet then use wallet to purchase and send back any extra or returned funds to the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:35:22
same answer. if there was a way to know the price would have already adjusted.
if you're asking the bitcoin sub whether you should get into bitcoin you're going to get a yes. dont mistake optimism for prescience. learn about it, make your own call, and dont invest more than you can lose.

yeah that is a problem, however if you use a wallet that supports custom fees you can get away with a much cheaper transaction, and especially so if you are willing for that transaction to take a few hours.
[here]( is a site you can use to see how different fees associate with different delay lengths. usually exchanges have much higher fees than you actually need, and in a lot of cases if you take out enough for 3-4 transactions at a time you could actually save money as the fees from wallet to shop are lower.  might be worth playing around with once or twice and see how it actually compares for you.

@_date: 2018-12-17 19:12:48
i dont really see this as a good argument. 
no matter what currency you use you have to pay for an equivalent value when you buy something. so if you buy a banana you could spend either $1, or $1 worth of btc. if you spend the btc then you lose out on gains you could have had if the value of btc goes up (adoption and deflation), and if you spend dollars then you dont have to worry about the value of the dollar going down (inflation).
but this only matters if you have your wealth in both currencies already. if you have 100% btc, spending $1's worth gets you the same banana at the same % loss of total net worth as it would if you had 100% dollars and spent $1.
if you did have your net worth in all btc, then the remaining wealth would increase if the value of btc increased. if you had all dollars it would decrease with inflation. so which would you rather have 100% of your net worth in?
if your only argument for using dollars is that its losing its value faster anyway, why hold dollars at all?

from what i understand: not directly. you can measure the amount of addresses (accounts) but people can have hundreds if they wanted to. you can measure the transaction volume, but again not really the same.
you could get closer by knowing the number of users on the top exchanges, but not sure if that info is public, and it still wont be accurate.

i think credit/debit is pretty much instant. much lower limits on coinbase though, like only a few hundred dollars max
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:20:35
well for starters identity theft is not nearly as valuable as bitcoin theft. theres a reason stolen identity info is sold in huge chunks (10k+ people worth at a time).
secondly whats stopping anyone from stealing your identity? think of how many companies have access to your address, payment info, id, phone number, etc etc. any one of them could be hacked, or compromised from the inside, and you already give your id to (i assume) all kinds of people from the cashier at the liquor store/pharmacy, to financial institutions. 
the exchanges use IDs to *improve* security. because of these rules its harder for someone who has, for instance, your bank info to steal sizable amounts of money and turn it into bitcoin.
so in a sense, yes you are giving them more personal information, but the fact that they require that information makes it harder to be impersonated. and since that info is all over the place anyway, i dont see the harm.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:46:55
this is standard when paying with a bank account (rather than preloaded usd account or credit card). bank transfers just take that long. itll show up in your bank a day or two before it shows up on coinbase which should be by the date they say.
previously if you had your coin instantly you must have been paying with the usd wallet (which you load from a bank account and it takes just as long, but once loaded can spend instantly) or a credit card. (i think i remember something about a way to use a credit card as a backup so you get the coins before the bank transfer comes in, havent done this one personally)
but the price is set when you clicked buy, so the transaction is coming, you just cant sell right away
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:58:31
electrum is a wallet client that works on mac and is widely respected. i would make a new wallet with electrum which will prompt you to write down a recovery seed (string of words). then transfer the coin from your current wallet to the new electrum one. then when you wipe your computer you can redownload electrum and use the recovery seed to restore the wallet.

i dont know of many places where you can get a previous account completely wiped from the company's servers for any type of online account.

i cant speak to gemini, but i can tell you that if all your crypto is on an exchange thats not good. as the saying goes if you dont own the private key you dont own the coins.
what you should do is look into a better option for storing your coins under your own control. (google these: mobile wallet/desktop wallet, offline wallet, paper wallet, hardware wallet)
then what you're really doing would just be signing up for a new account on a new exchange, (which can still be used for buying and selling, just dont keep the coins on them long term. ie buy then transfer to your own wallet, and transfer back to sell)
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:13:22
1) confirmations can take a while. the lower the transaction fee (generally) the longer it takes. i wouldnt worry for a while.
2)i believe its standard practice for them to generate a new rec. address once the last one is used
3)you'd have to share it to ever have anyone send you coins. the rec address is the only thing you should share.
give it a bit and it should confirm. if it never does the sender can (sometimes, if enabled) up the fee and resend, or eventually if it never confirms i think it drops off and a new transaction can be made. (not 100% clear on this part)

as someone waiting on a backordered cryptosteel, i dont think you'd have any trouble selling this kit.
however, while i like the aesthetic i dont see the utility of that case. the plate is already fireproof and i dont think that material is (correct me if im wrong). is it just for physical protection? 14 hex screws seems a bit excessive to me, but can i at least suggest torx? stripped bolts are a pain in the ass.
i think you could add some utility to this case by adding an easier way to open it (like a hinge and 1 or 2 screws to seal it), maybe making it out of metal so it has similar resistant properties as the plate inside, or maybe add other features like room for multiple plates inside held down with clips or magnets. hell you could even add a small grove and an o-ring to the current design and make it that much more protected from the environment.

yeah bitcoin is, but not exchanges. most exchanges require a lot more than just a user name/email/phone number.
either way i wouldnt believe that a "deleted" account actually removes info for good. im sure some services actually do delete things, but generally speaking, how could you ever actually be sure?
