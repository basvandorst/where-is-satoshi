They are a stock exchange company that does not charge fees on stock trading. It is basically easy trading for this new generation of investors. Commission free stocks. Whereas Coinbase charges fees.

What’s great about Robinhood is that is is free commission free trading. It also make it very easy to buy and trade stocks within the app. A plus with this app is that when you use a referral link and if you refer more people they give you and that friend a free stock worth up to 500$. So let me know if you want a referral link. ��DM me

There is no one reason. Anybody else’s guess is as good as yours. No has a definitive answer.

Been learning a lot about electronic health records and how they have progressed since the early 2000s but we still have ways to go. I’m all for one single medical record that can be used by multiple hospitals, healthcare providers, etc. Similar to Universal Healthcare, a universal medical record will cut down on costs, errors, and streamline a lot of the problems in the healthcare industry today.

Does anyone think it'll go down again? At least one more time.. Down to maybe 6000, or 7000? I missed buying that dip last week!

How much did they give away?
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:05:57
Probably an ignorant conservative

Like Andreas says, “Things that make the world a smaller place: nativism, nationalism, tribalism, and class structure”. Patriotism is just like nationalism. No your country is not better than the other ones out there. Thousands of countries out there and its ignorant and foolish to think yours is somehow better when they all have the same problems and are all corrupt. Being atheist has taught and shown me that anything that groups people together and makes a group of people think they are superior to others, has a negative effect on society.
