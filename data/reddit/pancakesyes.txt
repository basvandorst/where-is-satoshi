Just like how the dollar is worthless because you can make your own currency.

Exchanges charge separate fees. They generally make their money with offchain transactions which aren’t subjected to miners’ fees. 
You should probably avoid name calling and writing opinionated comments when you don’t know what you’re talking about.

Go look at a logarithmic chart of Bitcoin’s price.

It doesn’t work like that at all...

It’s like Blockbuster telling their employees they can’t use Netflix.

This. They’re giving him shit for not pulling out at exactly the right time, but they never got in at all. 
If you’d bought and held Bitcoin at almost any time in the last 9 years, you’d have made a profit. But they didn’t, so the second the price corrects at all, out come the “I told you so’s.” They’re using mental gymnastics to justify missing one of the biggest opportunities of their lifetimes.

Yep, and unlike the dollar, Bitcoin is decentralized, permissionless, and has a fixed supply. I think he would benefit from a couple hours listening to Andreas.

The  handle has been compromised by a scammer. We should report it accordingly. It’s embarrassing that Twitter hasn’t done anything about it yet.

Past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance, but if you look at a logarithmic chart of Bitcoin, $100k looks really really close.

Forks are fine, and even good,  but you need a large majority consensus ahead of time. If you don’t have majority support ahead of the fork, you’re just another altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:43:52
It is the best at imitating Bitcoin's brand, and I would say its supporters have done a fair job of convincing/confusing people about this.
The problem is that you really need to have well over 50% support at the time of fork in order to claim that you're the original coin. BCH was way off in this regard, and as such will never be Bitcoin. I'm in favor of larger blocks, but there needs to be consensus ahead of time. The fork should have been called off when it was clear that the vast majority wouldn't adopt it.

So... what price did you sell at? ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:34:26
I panic sold my BCH once GDAX finally let me withdraw it to another exchange. So far that turns out to have been a smart decision.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:10:53
And Dogecoin can process a lot more transactions per second than BCH. If value is solely derived from block size, there are hundreds of better altcoins than BCH.

Nice try, NSA!

It wouldn't surprise me at all if we moved back up to the line, or even hit $1M. However.... McAfee is a scammer who's views on this are completely worthless.

Pick one.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:58:00
Better increase the block size to accommodate all that demand.

You currently need a 3rd party to support subscriptions with the US dollar too. Systems like Visa/Mastercard and Paypal are built around the US dollar to support these subscriptions.
Bitcoin is no different, and wallet apps or web services like Coinbase can easily be built around it. To say Bitcoin is broken because subscriptions aren't built into it is analogous to saying the cash in your leather wallet is also somehow broken.
@_date: 2016-03-29 10:41:33
It would be really trivial to add a feature to a wallet which automatically repeats a payment every month. (no 3rd party needed beyond the wallet's developer) It would be slightly trickier to create a standard for connecting subscription-based websites with this feature. 
For all I know, it already exists. A quick Google shows that it was discussed in 2010 (topic  on Bitcoin talk:

Yep. This policy shows a lack of basic understanding of finance. If they're actually taking this route, they should have made it very clear to lenders *way* in advance.

Coinbase is the intermediary. This is really not much different than if you'd paid with a credit card. Though the multi-billion dollar credit card companies undoubtedly have more experience with customer service. Coinbase *should* be getting in touch with Expedia and issuing a refund.

If you borrow 100 shares of stock and it splits 2:1, you don't only owe money on half the stock. You'd have to buy back the full (now 200 shares) that you borrowed.

It's not disloyal. Mine what is profitable, and then convert it to the currency that you want to hold.
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:31:35
Not only can they not defend it, but they’ll be forced to dump their huge bag of BCH. The price and mining profitability will plummet, so yeah I also expect a 51% attack. This will likely kill BCH.

Understandable for an 87 year old. Though he's got good people under him.

Historically speaking, when people start saying shit like this, it’s time to buy.

The banking system has barely experienced any innovation for decades. This is contributing to their resistance to change. 
While Bitcoin is a threat to banks, the banks that embrace it first will have a big advantage over those who don’t.

Unlikely because whoever’s behind it would have been smart enough to send multiple Rogers. (One for the explosives trafficking, one for the Mt Gox scam, one for the BCash scam, etc)

It makes a lot of sense. Higher volatility and higher returns are correlated. That’s why stocks outperform bonds.

I was responding to the request to prove that a least a couple thousand people a day were jumping into Bitcoin. There are plenty of better metrics for tracking actual usage, such as transactions per day. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:20:48
In August, Coinbase said they had around 50,000 people a day signing up. That's just Coinbase. Globally would be way higher than couple thousand people a day.
