Pitch to me a reasonable scenario in which bitcoin can be shown to impede the rights of women?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:03:34
Okay buddy.

He just admitted he has three months experience.
 "Coming from a finance background".....
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:04:16
Yeah this means very little as a response. If they came out and gave a speech on btc it would be news. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:31:41
Yeah sorry that really makes no sense. I don't believe that could ever happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:25:46
So how long are we gonna have to wait around for this?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:43:20
Oh so youre not "in the industry"?  Hmm. 
Im irrelevant because I havent spent THREE MONTHS thinking about flow trading. Guess what, if its a hobby and youve been doing it less than a quarter of a year it isnt your "background". Stop parading around like a condescending expert.

Cant read something that isnt there genius. You never said 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:57:21
What a bizarre claim to make though...
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:07:55
Never could have figured that out otherwise. 
Lmao. As if hitler was a civil engineer designing these things and not just a figurehead for dozens or hundreds of workers. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:04:52
This is just the last place I expected too see something like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:20:35
This better be a joke. Holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:29:33
M&amp;A has next to nothing to do with finance. Where do u get off?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:14
I havent looked into it but its possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:34:57
Guys he posts on Lets all get our knees dirty. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:16:52
Mergers and acquisitions is not finance as much as youd apparently like it to be.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:05:21
Howd it go?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:56:22
I cant believe people are upvoting this insane shit. You people really are delusional. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:21:43
How is anger over control of bitcoin by the government going to be lessened by misogyny?  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:18
Lmfao. As if a dip after these highs wasnt to be expected. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:12:41
Whats the value of a right teste?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:14
These people are insane. Its not gonna rise and rise forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:50
We hit major highs. It has to even out. Happens in every market. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:45:29
Ding dong ding.  Itll prob drop to 8000 or 9000 and even out.
