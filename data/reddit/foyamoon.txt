The time scale starts at 1 September 2009, the genesis block was mined on January 3. So about a year of development was done before the start of the video. YOu can read more about Martii here:

type a \ before the \#
Like this: \
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:18:38
3 doesnt mean it's a Segwit adress. It simply means that when generating the adress instead of hashing a public key, you hash is a script.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:50:00
Blocks with no transactions (except the coinbase) isnt *that* unusual.

wtf kind of title is that? OP, have you read any of his books or are you blindly buying the "Soros is the anti-christ"-argument because of some video you saw on youtube?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:57:54
Why would you blindly believe that someone else made LTC and handed it over to Charlie? Do you believe everything you read online? Charlie was around very early and made Fairbrix and contributed to other projects before launching LTC. Since the launch of LTC he has done *alot* of work for both BTC and LTC.

What makes it not a cryptocurrancy?
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:30:06
I would give it 3 months.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:40:15
Also from Sweden and I've have heard alot about this. Have you been living under a rock the last year?
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:07:26
Yet you aren't aware of the incredible benefits Bitcoin provides to people in countries like Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Venezuela?
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:17:10
Can we stop upvoting these now?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:03:53
Source it wont use a blockchain? Of course it would use cryptography lol..
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:09:35
Yeah lol that one was bad. The definition of FIAT is that it isnt backed by anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:34:40
You must be new

Nice! My grandpa sent me the same text!

SN would get both it in economics and computer science if he was a public figure.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:21:00
tbh ge does have a pretty good understanding of how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:53:32


Well there are actually some diffuculties with scaling a DAG. Its not as easy as one might think.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:08:53
I would guess they will be traded against a stablecoin instead of USD or BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:40:25
If people wouldn't have used it back then we wouldn't be here today
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:01:49
No, we will switch you using satoshis, just like some are using mBTC (1/1000 BTC) right now.
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:41:18
Damn thats a lot of shitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:45:04
Back in the spring people talked about maybe,* maybe* BTC would reach $3,000 by the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:32:40
Good on you! I would have done the same thing if I could.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:07:54
Yeah, people tend to think that no progress is being made at all in traditional banking and finance. I have no doubt that in a few years internationall payments in FIAT will be pretty much instant and with very low fees. Crypto still have some unique and amazing aspects though that centralized systems will never have.

Hal wasnt Satoshi... Get over it
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:24:45
Keep your keys on an USB or other device not connected to the internet. Use MEW (a bitt odd that he didnt mention a bitcoin wallet).
Buy BTC/ETH on coinbase.
Send crypto to wallet so you get forked coins.
Transfer BTC to Binance if you want other coins not listed on coinbase.
Thats pretty much it
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:37:50
Ever heard of something called development?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:02:22
Why the hell would he do that?

@_date: 2018-08-15 04:20:24
Ever heard of something called gold? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:21:36
Doesnt really prove he is satoshi though. It just proves he has access to the keys.

Wow nice. Downloaded OB1 when it was released but havent used it much. Going to have another look now
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:59:05

No they will not. Why would you posts something like that without knowing what you are talking about? 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:00:43
Yeah, no.
@_date: 2018-08-18 06:56:15
I didn't think of it that way but you are absolutely right 
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:01:45
That can only speculated upon.

Do whatever you feel like. No one knows what the price of bitcoin will be in a week, a month, year or 10 years.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:24:44
You will buy from the person with the lowest price not the highest lol

To be technically correct "kek" actually comes from Starcraft and was implemented in WoW.
Its origin is the Korean onomatopoeia ㅋㅋㅋ, in which ㅋ stands for the "k" sound, koreans laughting at international competitiors would write "kekeke" instead of "hahaha"

You are not calling some random "bastard". You are calling the same broker you call 50 times a day with orders on stocks/derivates/etc., just with the added option to place an order om BTC. It might not be a good fit for someone like you or me but for people with alot of money and not alot of time it would be very convenient.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:41:14


Uhh, it doesn't work that way
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:15:42
Alot of orders are done over the phone. Calling your broker and telling them to "Buy 10k BTC for 5500$" is way quicker than doing it yourself. Time is money my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:07:30

@_date: 2019-12-11 18:21:23
You got the 90% figure mixed up. Commercial banks have a reserve requirement of 10%. I.e they can lend out 10x the money they have. Real, hard money that enters the economy.

Why is just the west of Norway marked red in the second image? 
@_date: 2017-04-16 07:03:48
My bad, looked like it was marked on my mobile screen, guess it just have very detailed borders with a thick line
@_date: 2019-04-28 10:54:01
Just put some other color behind the logos

Yeah that is his point.. He isnt pro-fiat, he is pro-gold.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:58:57
I find it very, *very* unlikely that Satoshi would be the sender of those emails.
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:54:25
An actual copy is worth about a 0.5-1 million USD.

Nope, it's been delayed until the next HF.

@_date: 2018-03-28 18:04:10
Finally someone who actually know a thing or two on the subject
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:48:19
No this is something different. In order to prove Satoshi had not mined blocks in secret before the blockchain was launched a timestamp was included in the genesis block. The timestamp was the headline of The Times that day.
Similar timestamps was done on other chains as well, for example in Litecoins genesis block the following is included: 
"NY Times 05/Oct/2011 Steve Jobs, Apple’s Visionary, Dies at 56"
Also the "Pizza Guy" (Laszlo Hanyecz) didn't get coins from Satoshi, he was one of the first to figure out how to mine with his GPU and got *alot* of coins that way.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:59:47
Iota? lmao
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:03:09
Miners can put whatever (up to 100bytes) in the coinbase. This is how it was done. I.e you need to mine the block. There are some other methods anyone can use but they are rather complicated AFAIK
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:24:18
No it isnt. The avatar Im using here on reddit is the original logo 
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:02:51
Thats how academic papers are written. Satoshi didnt use "we" in his posts on the forum or in emails
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:33:30
Lol no way. Sure he is importat, but comparing him to Satoshi is just ignorant.
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:20:05
Well that's a bit of a stretch
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:01:31
He might be thinking of:

@_date: 2018-03-28 19:33:29
It would be incredibly stupid to go through all that trouble for years keeping your identity a mystery but then just ignore all of that and send the first tx to yourself.
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:58:47

@_date: 2019-01-01 16:21:40
A couple of days left
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:48:41
But then he threw all that away by sending the first tx to himself? Makes no sense. Of course Hal wasnt Satoshi..
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:50:46
Thats actually a pretty interesting theory!
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:18:58
The pizza guy/owner didnt recieve any bitcoins. Jercos responded to Laszlos request on bitcointalk and got the 10k BTC and ordered him 2 pizzas. 
Here is the tx btw: 
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:59:35
Uh, it is taxable though
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:15:37
Yeah, no. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 05:24:59
"nobody understood what it was", yeah no that wasn't the reason
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:38:26
No problemo. I got it explained to me by a redditor years ago, glad to return the favor.
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:06:38
You believe Stephen faked his ALS?
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:55:42
Ok, I get what you are saying. I just wanted to point out that Hal still wrote on the forums back then so bringing up the fact that he had ALS as an argument as to why Satoshi stopped writing doesnt really make alot of sense to me. But you could be right, I know just as little as anyone else.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:43:00

Came on indeed
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:01:43
OP? I guess you mean He did not imply that at all, but you seemed to imply that if Hal was Satoshis then the lack of post from 2010-2014 could be because of Hals ALS. I don't see how this makes any sense as Hal still wrote on the forums those years.
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:00:31

Ouch, my bad, wrote that in a hurry. The stack of 10k BTC was $400.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:10:07
He still coded
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:38:05
Agreed, people who claim Hal was Satoshi have not done their research and just go along with it because Hal passed away

@_date: 2018-02-13 18:34:14
...That wouldnt solve the problem at all
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:38:39


Might cause some problems with AML laws to accept LN payments since it's not possible to know who the sender is.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:27:45
Sure they could ban bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:44:53
Satoshi didnt claim bitcoin to be untraceable, the whole inovation is built on being able to trace everything
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:44:53
No problem.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:12:31


No, all tx are visable on the blockchain.

I also believe Nick is SN but that argument isnt a very strong one. Adam Back used "mint" in Hashcash but I belive "mine" was used prior to Bitcoin to describe new tokens awarded in a PoW project. I could be wrong though.

@_date: 2018-04-11 05:12:00
This is just plain dumb. No one should "trust" Satoshi Nakamoto or anyone else in the space for that matter. The whole point of blockchain is to *remove trust*. Otherwise we would just use a database and trust the operator.

@_date: 2018-04-08 08:32:29
At that time you couldn't run a node and not mine. The two was synonymous

So who do you have to trust when sending and recieving Bitcoin?

Hmm, a bunch of rich people with lots of cryptocurrancies living in a remote town. I wonder why they woud want to keep a low profile.
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:47:21
This makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:09:26
If you are familiar with the Bitcoin whitepaper you would know Satoshis take on 51% attacks:
"The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."
Also not sure why you got all mad at me from my previous comment, when you were the one with the snarky duckduckgo reply.
