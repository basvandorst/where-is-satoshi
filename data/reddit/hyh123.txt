Well, if you by that you mean use off-grid, unused power to mine BTC then Chinese are already doing it, all the mining farm in China a huge and located in a remote place, like inner Mongolia or somewhere near Tibet, maybe not with solar power though.

I'm not sure how safe your work is, so I have mixed feeling about Coinbase vs. Your own wallet here. Since bitcoin is like cash, it could happen that someone tries to rob all your coins if they know you own those. Putting the coins on Coinbase will make it unlikely to happen, but they might close your account for arbitrary regulatory reason.

Chinese bitcoiner in US here. Actually the concern is more on the US side (IRS on tax, FBI on money laundering etc.), on the Chinese side I have only minimal concern. The Chinese exchanges have almost no KYC requirements while almost all possible US-based exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Campbx) do. 
One option is sell bitcoin for cash on localbitcoins.com, but I never tried that.

Actually most exchange ask for verify (...At least when you want to WITHDRAW. This is tricky as you can easily put money in, and then have your money trapped in those exchange without having waiting in queue for verification.)

Just read the [Protocol specification]( and the details about address is [here](
[Here]( is some code that goes from public_key to an address. (I also have code from private key to public key, if you need it.)
Bitcoin used ECDSA, the curve is [secp256k1]( this is used in every transaction, where the sender will sign it, and the network will verify it.
(You may be also interest in brain wallet, which has nothing to do with how bitcoin works, but helps people to memorize an address.)

You got it wrong. From public key to private key is the 2^256 challenge, and to find a private key whose Hash 160 is a given one is the 2^160 challenge. If a hacker try to brute force, matching the hash 160 is way easier.

Actually some of these BTCs are even older than I thought.
Now the code can see Last_In, Last_Out, we get more information.
E.g. The address with Hash-160 `12d5a845f2b212ce0c3bd65a4035881d9219090e` was last touched on 2012-10-23 03:33:21, however, the last transaction out was on 2010-07-24 23:35:23. It could happen that the private key to these 31,000 BTC is lost after this.
(Anyone can transfer BTC into that address, but only one people can get money out of it. 
If these money moved, expect exchange rate drop.)

BTC-e has only 0.2% fee. But it is hard to get money into it.

Maybe you should wait. 
I tracked the total number BTC from addresses that are seen since March 13th. 
It was abuot 3.7 million a few days ago, now it is 4.8 million. 
(i.e. some old BTC has moved in these few days.) 
If all those BTC are about to turn into cash, the price will definitely drop.

    divm() # replace all inverse_mod stuff with that. And delete its def.
Edit: e.g. 
    ( ( other.__y - self.__y ) * \
          numbertheory.inverse_mod( other.__x - self.__x, p ) ) % p
Can be replaced by
    gmpy.divm(other.__y - self.__y , other.__x - self.__x, p)

Do you know Hasse's estimate? If p is a prime and E is a curve over F_p, then |E(F_p) - p - 1| is at most 2 times sqrt(p). In other word if p is 256 bits the number of points on E will also have 256 bits, and their difference is at most 128 + 1 bits.
So for large p you always have a lot of points.

The trade was fine, but I'm talking about funds missing when using the escrow service. Basically I sent BTC to an address localbitcoins.com assigns to me and will "release" it when I meet the guy. Now there are problem when I sent to the website.
Why even this got downvoted? WTF... 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:10:25
Wow, thanks for doing that.
I hope there is such a way too. 
What do you mean by displaying addresses in a tamper-proof way?
(The address was saying "Foundation One Ya'an Earthquake donation" in Chinese for a while, then I can only see "????????????", seems like blockchain.info doesn't handle unicode well...)

Campbx is kind of quick. But you'd move money into Dwolla first.
No quick solution unless you are willing to do Bitinstant with 4% fee.

Be really careful. Some of them could as well be scammers. E.g. for one of them, if they got 250k BTC via an IPO and then they could do nothing and pay dividend using what they got for 4 years.
EDIT: It's BTCGarden, and they wanted to get 160k BTC. If they use the BTC they get to pay dividends at the rate of ASICMiner, they can do it for 4.33 years.
EDIT again: BTCGarden is actually working, what I mean is they overvalued their share in their IPO.

One slow way is get money into [Dwolla]( (takes 2 days to verify your account, then 6 days to deposit), and then trade on [Campbx]( The rate is almost flat, only costs 25 cents to get into Campbx. Once you get Bitcoins you can choose to trade anywhere. (Or you can send Money Orders to Campbx, for which USPS charge you about 1%, no charge on Campbx.)

I don't think so.
The largest address has only 111k in it.

Sell your BTC-e USD to someone who want to fund their btc-e account, at a better rate (e.g. sell 1 btc-e USD for 1.02-1.05 USD cash). That's how Chinese btc-e users deal with it.

I understand, but you see, even an exchange with smaller volume can double the max TPS of MtGox. MtGox must hired some really bad programmer (or had really bad code left by earlier programmers.)

I'm surprised by the TPS of BTCChina. Plus they have a 9000 volume today, that's roughly 10% of MtGox.

So you just buy it, and not trade it? Shouldn't be too hard for you to save it.
You can generate an address and send money to that address, with private key kept somewhere. Only later when you need the coins you import that into your wallet.

MtGox must be laugh out hard.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:29:45
Addresses can be reused by user. So it MUST BE specific.
You underestimated the possible number of addresses: there are 2^160 of them. More than 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 of them.

Good point.
Do you think slow injection like the production rate 
= 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/n + ... ≈ O(log n) (which goes to ∞ slowly)
will be better for the economy?
I think no random formula will do the job, instead the amount of currency should be proportional to the number of (real) transactions in the system, with some award to early adapters.

I'm glad to hear that. I was thinking the problem might be on your database.
One suggestion on web app user interface: Make sure one can see the depth table, place/confirm an order on the same page. (Currently it takes several pages, if one page down one has to start again. ---- For people who don't know how to use your API they have to trade very slowly.)
Do you have other plan to increase the volume of trading on Campbx?

Actually Campbx is usually a lot slower than Mt. Gox and it has no hope to handle a 10% volume of Mt. Gox. It is slow to go from page to page on that website. I quit using the website a while ago, but their API is just as slow.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:53:16
I just started using them. But their volume is incredibly small, (like 3000 BTC per day, compared with Mt.Gox's 300k-500k per day) and sometimes the website is slow.
So for user with small amount (~$500) to invest they are OK, but otherwise people may prefer MtGox.
Edit: if those numbers are unclear, then think about this: 
their whole day volume is dwarfed by the 5-min volume of MtGox.

Small business are BIG for bitcoin:
People who work for "salary" usually have no way to get paid by BTC, unless their company is really really cool with BTC. But Owners of small businesses: You are the hero!
Try not only accept bitcoin, but also spend them, use them to order things you need for production. :-)

It's always like this. To put cash in you usually have to wait 7 days or accept a 4% price. Try to see if any of your friend want to sell, that might be the fastest way.

I think one reason is if the group is not cyclic or it's order is not a prime number it's hard to find a generator for it. Also the other comment, saying passing the parameter around will leads to long digital signature makes sense to me.

They are just a website selling and buying bitcoin.
You cannot even see other's order. And you cannot ask or bid. 
How can this be an exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:44:18
Very unlikely. Honestly people have tried. There are address with more than 80k BTC in it, so if your vanitygen happen to collide with that address, just give me 50 and celebrate.
Chances are, when you generate an address with 80k BTC in it, earth won't exist anymore, assuming you have several clusters instead of an average Desktop PC for that job.

I'd say no... I have about ≤ 200$ + ≤ 1 BTC there, and I have some 0.01 bid and ask. I can still see orders go through though. The price seem to follow other exchange though (I mean, instead of having its own weight).
If you read you can still see some people with at least $15k there (they seem to care about the daily ceiling of verified account, $15k.)
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:09:26
To OP: Take all your saving, buy at $300, that's a 10x return!
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:28:32
The market cap is problematic. It is calculated by 
(# of coins mined) * (Current exchange rate),
But even a 2000 BTC sell order will change the exchange rate dramatically.
It appear to me that to assure people to use BTC, BTC has to be more stable than USD, which is kind of unlikely. (It IS more stable than money in a Cyprus bank though.)

Replied there.
* Easy deposit/withdraw fiat.
* Simple UI that allow quick submission. (for people who don't use the API)
* well documented API.
* Complete data, candle-chart, history, etc.
* Client-side trade.
* Lots of coins to buy (quantity and variety).
* Lots of possible way to trade (short, stop-loss, etc.)
And... VOLUME!!!
There only reason people stay with MtGox is the sheer volume there, it dwarfs almost all other exchange. 
There are some OK one with small volume out there.

It does. Unless the higher fee really gives an instant access to your money in the exchange, it doesn't worth it.

I know. But if sellers also needs anonymity (so they are willing to sell at a lower price) that should bring the price to normal range.

Good idea. Do you run  Looks nice. 
Which bitcoin company should he contact if he want to adapt bitcoin payment? (We are in SF Bay Area, East Bay.)

block 231210 got some serious luck. A block with only 1 transaction (i.e. 25 BTC to miner)...

Are you on windows? I'm on a mac. Don't know what's going on though.

What price do you want to pay?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:45:08
I have similar feeling. We should not worship BTC, but use it as a test of the concept of cryptocurrency. (I read about the procotol specification, and I know something about Elliptic curves) 
Current design seems good after 4 years. But the exchanges are poorly designed. And the only think I worry about BTC is that the group behind Satoshi may not know enough about economics.

I think he meant when 1 BTC = $230...

China? I speak Chinese and keep an eye on the Chinese internet, but I haven't found any trace like that. Can you be more specific on the velocity picking up?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:15:10
I should they that's the only thing I worried about, not a conclusion at all. I believe cryptocurrencies have a future, but in 2140, when about all BTC are mined, I don't know what will happen.
(You may argue that the amount of gold is also finite, but gold can still be mined after 3000 years.)

Really? I cancelled another order and it says bitcoins will be credited to my wallet on bitmit.

What do you mean by the current market price?
You should post it here and lock for, say 30min.

See this: 
I don't want to explain too much. But every line is about 50 days.
The first line,


means 


the line with 294 means 50th-100th day, etc.
325 corresponds to the most recent 50 days.
(The precise span of each line is 48.5451852 day, don't ask me why.)

No. Bitinstant and Dwolla are different thing. Dwolla has nothing to do with bitcoin, just some exchange accept Dwolla easily. Bitinstant is the thing that allows you do deposit at CVS with a 3-4% fee, and fund arrive within 1 hr.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:53:12
Really?! That's bad...
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:22:07
I see.
What's the difference between bitstamp and mtgox? If it is expensive on bitstamp why don't people just buy it on mtgox?
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:59:35
Yeah, most of those are last seen either in 2011 or 2009.

Don't be too excited though.

One more thing, even the private keys are deleted, with sufficient computing power one can still brute force it. (but in that case nobody's coins will be secure.)
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:07:47
Actually I don't.

I'm already charged 0.14 USD for that order. The fee's are all listed on the right-most column.

There are 2^160 = 1.46*10^48 possible address.
On the other hand, if every body on earth have one trillion addresses, that's only 7 * 10^21 addresses.
Conclusion: No worry.
@_date: 2013-06-28 09:09:32
That's very interesting. So are they adding this to the protocol?
I need to read about the tree structure though. Can you say more about it?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:32:16
That's a really nice question.
I think the answer is "anchor". Well, not an anchor like gold, but the anchor lies in people's work. If someone want to be paid in BTC with a constant price (instead of doing math, thinking in terms of exchange rate), then we have a better chance to get a stable currency this way.
E.g. If I work for someone and I charge 10BTC firm. Then I'm part of the anchor. That 10BTC could be 1 cent, or 10000USD, but that's not the point. The point is my work will be only measured in BTC.

They are.

I think it is your own setting.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:24:58
I like the 2nd one.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:44:06
True. Normal people won't work for it like this.
But there are some work which is easy to duplicate. e.g. software. If I write some software I sell it steadily at $15 or 0.15 BTC, then I'm supporting BTC. Certainly people won't use BTC when 1BTC is ≥ $100, but when 1 BTC ≤ $100 then people will use it. (Think of this as a buy order at $100, which will help the price to be stable at $100... only if tons of people are doing this.)

Buy high, sell low, like a pro.

So trading mostly depends on "fresh money" into MtGox? 
What about those people whose money is already at MtGox? Why are they not trading? I'm really curious...
@_date: 2013-07-01 20:04:52
Partly true. Chinese here. I have friends buy BTC from me, they want hundreds daily while I cannot provide that many. They need BTC for BTC stocks, e.g. ASICMINER, a Chinese company, has it's BTC share soared to 4 BTC/share.

Kind of. Good to hear your story.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:19:58
Very nice arguments. I had similar problem. But I got money through Dwolla, and used Coinbase. (Only bought 0.48 from Coinbase, as BTC is never available on that site, but managed to sell twice on them.)
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:38:18
I see what you are saying, but sorry for being picky: 
for x = 3, x^3 + 7 is NOT a square mod p. ;-)
Actually I even have a further question, why don't we just use a random EC each time (random but of course avoid some obviously weak ones)?
