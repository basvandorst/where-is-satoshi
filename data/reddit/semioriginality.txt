Thus far? Sold off at 700 so I'm up 2% after a rebuy at 530 and 480
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:20:47
Yep. Im kinda new, (mined BTC 1 year ago for a few weeks with friends) and am now into trading and such. All of these points are valid.

1.8 bitcoins is bad, but it isn't 100 BTC

Don't you dare lump BTC into Anarchism. I don't agree with you at all.

This is inflation non? Inflation is defined as a set amount of currency having less purchasing power

Frankly bitcoin is beyond silly antics like that. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:03:09
And now its back up to 430. Funny, how these market things work

We will have the last laugh. If it eats dick and goes to $5 dollars than whatever, a lot of us are out 200-300 dollars. If it goes to even 100,000 dollars than we will be quite ecstatic. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:43:03
BTC price is pure Supply and Demand baby. We don't get to choose

All we know is from previous BTC crashes, it will go up. If you can afford to lose the 2k, definitely stay in. But it is entirely possible, and not improbable for BTC to never recover. Risk vs Reward baby
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:26:41
I missed the bandwagon and jumped on one of the china snafus. Bought in at 570, ain't even mad. And I have been buying all the way down this slope. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:04:15
We will see who has the last laugh. This could be the last true low point ever, and BTC might go up to 50,000 dollars. Or it could go to a dollar. I don't care either way, I am along for the ride!
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:26:29
Yeah all of these comments have abnormal amounts of downvote. Could be why the content is pretty old here
EDIT: Yep instant downvote. Or it could be some cock with WAY too much time on his hands

@_date: 2014-03-30 17:25:21
Also, it seems to have stabilized at least a little at 450. Interesting. And the buy sell depth has equalized a little

I have my chase credit card as a back up payment on coinbase. Should I take it off?
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:39:19
If you are building a rig, go mine vertcoin and convert to BTC on prelude.io. You WILL NOT make money any other way
Also, say you buy a 780 or Titan or AMD equivalent. You will get about 500-600 kh/s, and assuming 10 cents to the KWH, you will take 3 years of mining to pay off your rig. So you wont make money, as the difficulty will go up

What about multibit? is it fine?

Haha or a high school senior in my case. I figure I'll fuck up now with 200 bucks instead of 20,000 in 10 years. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:15:40
Massive Sell Wall at 400 dollars because its a nice round number. You get a lot of walls at 400, 425, 450 and such. This means we won't see a price increase for a while, as there are plenty of BTC being sold for 400 bucks
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:14:50

Shit man. I hate to be that guy, but bitcoins should be less than 3% of your money

I think that its somewhat bubbled, but more importantly, its too wild to be a functional currency.
