jesus... wtf is "decentralized with central hubs"??? I swear I have to take a break from reddit or risk suffering a stroke.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:24:37


Pretty spot on. Everyone is manually opening a channel to buy a sticker or a vpn subscription.
BTW the only time a network containing a hub is centralized is if that network contains exactly one hub and everyone else is connected to it  LN in it's current state is literally a decentralized network.

1. State nothing but the obvious
2. Make wild assumptions about network topology and use
3. Provide a total of 0 actual attack vectors (granted this is hard to provide without sounding like a nutter... given the current lack of observable axiomatic truths about LN)
4. ???
5. Karma

Maybe but 


isn't one of them, because the "locked balance" variable contains attacker and defenders funds. If an attacker broadcasts a previous state the defender can take all channel funds. BTW LN doesn't make sense unless onchain tx fee &lt;&lt; channel funds. Debating other scenarios is similar to arguing about how a 747 is terrible at transporting people over a highway because of bridges and other obstacles.

No people are uncomfortable because of how cringe worthy and fake his reaction was. Name one thing he has done for those children ever since he struck oil.
The dogecoin community has done more than Ver has ever done for anyone in his entire life. Ver spends his resources on astroturfing, shitcoin pumping and jet-setting with other charlatans. 
His end goal is his own profit and he has deluded himself into believing that through his prosperity and actions, those poor children will benefit too.
Something, something, trickle down, etc.

AKAssassinDTF is referring to parents learning about what the other consoles are because the wii introduced the entire family demographic to consoles. 
Unless you came from dogecoin or some Onecoin/Bitconnect/Bcash scam, Bitcoin was your entryway into crypto. Bitcoin is the Nintendo of crypto and as long as it produces games such as Super Mario Odyssey it doesn't have to be the biggest to remain awesome.

Thanks for your insightful contribution.




emphasis mine.
The only thing in this entire book I could even remotely misconstrue as client/server are the leader election algorithms. You can become an expert at anything given enough time. But outside of reddit I wouldn't bother arguing over Bitcoin with someone who has no grasp of the fundamentals taught for the last 22 years. Not because I'm a snob about the knowledge I gained. But because Bitcoin means a lot to me and I wish everyone involved in the space would bother educating themselves. It would give us all a higher common ground from which to argue from. The alternative is rbtc.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:45:19


Sounds about right.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:04:22


Distributed algorithms are algorithms at that are distributed. Whether they run on the same hardware and share memory, on homogeneous SOC communicating over a BUS or LAN/WAN doesn't matter. The Bitcoin reference client implements a distributed algorithm that ensures consensus of the Bitcoin blockchain. You can tell it's a distributed algorithm because each full node by itself fulfills no useful function. Only when networked with other instances of the same program does any utility emerge. (Yes, including mining nodes makes it a heterogeneous system.  Pools make it even more complex)  
So either we're just talking past each other because of differing definitions or you've spent to much time with specific technical aspects that can cause one to miss the forest for the trees.

If you really want to know and understand the basics read:
Then find a book on cryptography. Something with the keywords public/private key encryption, ECDSA, AES, Diffie-Hellman. Also don't skip the theoretical part of your lectures. Computational complexity theory will contribute a great deal to developing a good knowledge base.


You'll probably come across many languages in the future. Each language is a tool suited for solving a specific problem. Start with what ever you find interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:41:21
That was just some rbtc sock puppet with the usual m.o. of redefining reality to suit their agenda. Bitcoin core is a fork of Bitcoin. Bcash is the real Bitcoin. A decentralized graph is a graph with centralized hubs. Only a complete graph is a good "decentralized" graph, because entropy... etc. mind blowing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:36:27


Meh, it puts us somewhat on the same page. The Bitcoin protocol at its core is still a solution to distributed consensus. Understanding the problem of consensus in distributed algorithms as per Lynch gives insight to how using PoW redefines certain parameters and offers a conditional solution. Sure if you want to know how Bitcoin works read Andreas' book and familiarize yourself with the reference client. If you want a base on which to extrapolate tough -axiomatically not deductible due to complexity- decisions (aka. by means of wisdom), it really helps to learn a little more than what is necessary.

I babble. There's no way to keep an eye on it, so I choose to stick with things I can observe.
Let btc.com have 80% of the hashrate. After all the assumption we want to make is that they are a heterogeneous pool of miners, all sharing the same incentives to play by the rules. The pool misbehaves everyone loses money. They are hacked, things might temporarily be disrupted. The pool behaves, we're all happy. If you consider btc.com one entity, one miner, he is easier to observe. If he starts obfuscating his malfeasance by posing as 20 different pools nothing can stop him and you will be none the wiser. Complaining about a pools hashrate is begging for a feel good solution that does little to solve any of the systemic problems we might have with mining centralization.

Tor allows you to accept incoming connections without exposing your IP. That is 1 reason. Therefore your 2nd statement is false.

Crackable within 0.1sec. The checksum won’t be valid. Simply run a 1 line script to find the shifts with functioning checksum. Writing down a password protected key, encrypted with your pets name (bip38), is litteraly a million times more secure and a whole lot easier. We can appreciate the effort though.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:14:03
It would take 0 effort to detect a shift considering addresses have static parts. Personally I wouldn’t bother with these, or any simple cyphers at all. Just write down a plain WIF key.

I value fiat less therefore I rid myself of it. I value bitcoin more therefore I seek to accumulate it. What good does it do to spend and replace? Most merchants "accept" bitcoin through payment processors like Bitpay. In effect you're not doing anything but shoving fees up middle mens ***es.

When I use Tor only my VPN and the server I connect to know that I use Tor. When I use Bitcoin with open ports I might as well take a megaphone to times square and tell people that I use Bitcoin and where I live. Proper use of Tor requires regular and extensive use. If all you are starting Tor for, is to visit site xyz, you might as well not use Tor. 
You should realize that there is a difference between what you believe to be good enough and what utility differing privacy enhancing measures objectively have.

I don't care much for hard facts on mining distribution. Being in touch with reality gives me a pretty good idea of the current and future state of affairs. Once miners start screwing with the network my full node will let me know that Bitcoin is worthless. That's the only fact relevant to me. I hope that day never comes, but I'm not foolish enough not to expect it. I just think it's farcical to complain on reddit about x having y% of the hashrate. All Jihan needs to do is set up yet another mining "pool" and pretend he doesn't control it. At least hashrate will appear distributed...

And making gigantic errors.
The original BIP148 UASF implementation changed 3 lines of code. It was utterly broken until Luke fixed it.
S2X failed to actually increase the blocksize. Fixed by a core dev again.
Bitcoin abc has its EDA disaster.
BU was a buggy hell and fortunately we will never see how broken its EC concept is.

I own bitcoin. I know that I own bitcoin because my node, which participates on Bitcoin's distributed network consisting of tens of thousands of peers, tells me so. I know for a fact there are more than enough ideologues out there who share my conviction. 
Aside from a minuscule fraction of dissidents, who have yet to prove that they are able to actually deliver functioning software, virtually all knowledgeable contributors to Bitcoin share a mindset similar to mine.
Without us there is no Bitcoin for we are Bitcoin and I don't see it going away any time soon.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:43:53


Sounds simple to me. No one is claiming it's risk free. You have to rely on what ever shred of wisdom you have with regards to the issue at hand. 
If the opposition consists of a fool that selectively quotes "Satoshi's vision" and constantly cries about "censorship", a charlatan that rambles something about a chain of signatures, and some clown acting either irrationally or has a hidden agenda? The gun is probably not loaded.
Is the change you're proposing S2X? If you can't tell THAT gun is loaded you deserve to blow your brains out :P

From the perspective of the software I run BIP148 implemented SW. The same mechanism will reject blocks with invalid consensus rules. 
Back door agreements might stirr up social media and cause disruption but they have virtually no effect on the long term outlook for Bitcoin. 
Unlike BCH with its EDA, Bitcoin's incentives have proven time and time agian to simply function. S2X is just another opportunity to shift some bitcoin from those who don't get it to those who do.
