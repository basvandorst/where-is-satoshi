I've seen that subreddit. It appears to be an echo chamber of angry gamers upset that video games are becoming more inclusive and that its not just a boys club anymore. They say that its somehow all about "ethics in game journalism" yet the targets of gamergate's seemingly endless rage are:
1) A female indie developer who supposedly slept with a journalist to get favorable coverage for her free game (It turned out he never reviewed her game, btw)
2) A female feminist critic that put out some Kickstarter-funded videos exploring tropes in video games
3) A female journalist that wrote an article celebrating that video games are now mainstream enough that the "gamer" label makes no more sense than calling someone a "movie watcher" or a "music listener" or a "book reader".
Meanwhile, gamergate is ignoring the very real ethics problems in the game industry, namely big AAA billion-dollar video game publisher's cozy relationship with big review sites like IGN and Gamespot, and the ability those publishers have to influence reviews by granting or withholding early access to unreleased games that reviewers need to do their jobs. Not to mention straight-up payola.
At some point, you need to ask yourself what's more likely:
That every major news outlet and every major game review website has gone on record condemning gamergate because they're involved in a vast conspiracy (somehow created by "social justice warriors", I guess?)
Or that every major news outlet and every major game review website has gone on record condemning gamergate because its a toxic cause that resulted in 3 months of harassment directed at lot of women.
Occam and his razor would like a few words with gamergate.

Psst GamerGate is absolutely *toxic*.  A quick Google search will tell you all you need to know.

Wasn't a comeback, it was an honest question. You butted into a conversation you weren't part of, proceeded to ask a series of questions and then answered them all yourself. Weird, but okay.
By all means, continue though. Pretty sure that kiwikku and I are finished our conversation, and I for one I won't interrupt your internal debate. Have at it.

Are you...are you having a conversation with yourself?

 Lol! Busted... well done.

Can you provide some examples? Because I don't see a lot of harassment directed at the gamergate crowd myself, but I *do* see quite a lot of [colorful tweets like these]( coming *from* gamergate.


How do you not see that donating to a feminist charity *after* you've taken a lot of heat in the media for harassing women is completely transparent? Its called "providing cover", and it's much more convincing if you do it *before* the action you're trying to cover up.
Also, its funny how everyone involved in gamergate takes credit for those charitable donations but when it comes to taking the blame for the harassment that has been carried out under the gamergate name the excuse is always "gamergate is just a hashtag! Anyone can use it! We're not responsible for what trolls do!"  You guys want all the credit for good things, and none of the responsibility for bad things. That's...not how life works.


Oh you mean  The astroturfing campaign to try to convince the world that gamergate is filled with women, minorities and the LGBT crowd?  The hashtag that totally-not-ironically is being used as a shield for gamergate?


**[Projection]( pro·jec·tion - */prəˈjekSH(ə)n/*
*Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against unpleasant impulses by denying their existence in themselves, while attributing them to others.[1] For example, a person who is rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude.*

Well met, brother. Go easy on that block of cheese before your next date.

Last time I checked we had a $6.1B budget surplus, the 6th largest economy in the world, record low unemployment (4.4%), and the biggest streak of job growth since WWII. But tell me more about my bankrupt state.

Is there a financial instrument to short Bitcoin?
