People dig gold out of the ground. (Which is one reason gold standard is stupid - why would you want your currency to be priced by the mining industry?)

Why "obviously"? USD moves in a narrow band.

LOL. You invested in  "currency" that a million others can xerox. Nothing special about bitcoin, dude.

But the underlying technology is not patented. It's free to copy by anyone. So how does one really invest in it?

Luckily, the bureaucrats are keeping an eye on it.

I like how you guys are slowly evolving an intuition about what makes a currency a currency..

Chinese regulators are banning coin exchanges. Don't count on the Chinese to rescue you.

Bitcoin isn't a good or functional currency. Speculative bubble mentality ("always a bigger fool") was always the only reason to buy. You're just patting yourself on the back on finding the bigger idiot.

The absence of regulation is not "support," you statist.

It's actually pretty simple: credit card companies don't want people to buy bitcoins on leverage (ie, on the credit card companies' dime), because credit card companies don't want the bitcoin bubble to spread to their balance sheets.
And kudos to them for realizing that risk, and preventing it. (Let's remember why 1929 stock market was so terrible: people bought stocks using bank loans, and couldn't pay the loans back when stock market prices crashed, leading to bank failures).

[Link](  Xinhua &amp; Bank of China both reliable sources on this.
 
And it makes complete sense for China to do this: they're quietly panicking about their financial system as it is. (Highly indebted, complex, leveraged, underregulated shadow-banking.)

lol "correction"
This is the ponzi scheme exploding

The technology is easily copyable. That makes bitcoin, as an individual implementation, *less* valuable, not more.
