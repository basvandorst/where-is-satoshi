This is why something like Ethereum will exist alongside Bitcoin.
What are your thoughts on Rootstock? If implemented as intended, do you think Bitcoin's chain would have a greater chance of adoption by institutions?

there was a time when bitcoin was touted as an enabler of true micropayment channels, and it was a feature many were excited about.
furthermore, while it's true satoshi saw the state of bitcoin at that time to unsuitable for micropayments, he entertained the possibility of the feature being enabled via several mechanisms, such as decreased bandwidth and storage costs in the future. 
so i find that AlaricI's question is valid. we have a distributed, trustless system of payments that is meant to be frictionless between individuals. why not include micropayments?

LOL a way of speech characteristic of a condescending kid who thinks he's always right
i never claimed that a lack of micropayments would make bitcoin less valuable and you seem to generally fail to see the point of others
anyway i read the whitepaper and quoted satoshi in my last comment (which you so conveniently avoided) to make the point that even the creator whom you regard so highly didn't see the tech as some sort of ironclad platform unable to accommodate new features desired by its users. 
successful software/protocol has the ability to improve itself
oh, and don't delude yourself into thinking you're in any meaningful position to build that Mack truck of yours.

how would one grab from an address knowing its private key?
