It is unlikely that coinbase will be hacked. That being said, it is the general recommendation of the community to move coins to a private wallet where you control the keys. Mycelium or Electrum are both good. 
Also keep in mind that if you had coin in coinbase on Aug 1st, they still owe you 0.05 BCH as well. If you move it to a wallet you might lose any chance to redeem that, although honestly I don't think BCH will even be around in January and 0.05 BCH might be worth like a nickle.

The protocol needs to be modified. It's not hard. If it is susceptible to attacks, identify the weakness, create a workaround and patch it. No different than any other protocol / software. Make it resistant to these attacks. We always knew it would come under fierce attack from large business interests and even state level actors. 
Don't whine. Identify the issue &amp; fix it. Preferably in a way that locks out the shitheads who are trying to destroy bitcoin by hijacking &amp; hard forking any time somebody wants to make a tiny little change.

Hopefully, but already the quantum effect is making electrons jump logic gates and produce bad data. You can use error correcting code to mitigate it but my hopes are dim for a 3nm process or 1nm.

If you could somehow divide the blockchain into even smaller, more manageable pieces (like a self reinforcing error-checking dna helix), you could run it as part of a wallet software, a phone app, a windows app, like seti or folding distributed computing projects. Miners would no longer be needed and all transactions would be 100% free, and fast (maybe beer money for the devs, definitely code that in somehow). I vote for 64kb/128kb/256kb blocks.
On top of that, ms sql databases running in full recovery mode keep a ledger called a transaction log that is very similar to the block chain. BUT, when they hit a "checkpoint", the data is flushed to the disk and all data that was stored previously in the transaction log is discarded and only the data since the last checkpoint is retained. Why do we still have the coffee that satoshi bought 10 years ago in the blockchain? 
When I balance my checkbook, I don't go back to the day I opened my account and start from the $25 deposit to open the account and work my way forward to yesterday. It's unnecessary and cumbersome. In 15 years it will take a 50 TB storage device and a 10GB internet connection and 1 year to sync a full node. Lets say that we could add code to git rid of anything more than 3 years old and do a checkpoint every x blocks. When that block hits, all the nodes sync, snip off the old shit and continue on. 
If you just absolutely had to know everything everybody bought ever, you could have two node types, an active node and a history node. Active nodes could run the checkpointed version and full node would only retain the data that was snipped for historical purposes and in the event of a corruption or some other issue, to cryptographically verify the entire blockchain from block zero onward.
Faster, more lightweight, zero fees, using cpu power/electricity that millions of users already have idle on their pcs 99% of the time. That's something that would compete with visa, and decentralized to the point where it is impervious to attack from the big block crowd.
I'm sure those who are financially invested in the old model would prefer to keep making fees, but nobody could compete with transactions that confirm in seconds with zero fees and 100% distributed/decentralized.
Bigblockers, if you really wanna stab the old bitcoin in the heart, this is how you do it. Of course you won't be able to make yourself a billionaire this way, but that wasn't ever the point, *was it?*

Obviously you don't. If you did, you would know why the fees are high. BCH has stolen a lot of hash power from BTC by gaming the protocol and implementing a custom Emergency Difficulty Adjustment which makes it more profitable to mine shitcash every once in a while. This causes loads of miners to switch back and forth, causing oscillations in the network hashing power between shitcash&lt;-&gt;btc. Transactions are stacking up because of this denial of service attack and fees required to process transactions are also higher as a result. 
Thus, fees are high, and transaction times are high, not because of any fault with BTC (as you imply) but because of a massive coordinated attack on the BTC network by the bigblock crowd and their retarded little altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:21:03
If you transfer from coinbase to bittrex then yes this happens over the blockchain. Another option is to use whatever currency has the lowest fees that both exchanges support. 
Convert to LTC on coinbase and send it to your LTC wallet on Bitttrex -&gt; Convert back to BTC. Fees might eat you up but...

This is something else exciting for me. I am working on expending my bot to take advantage of the disparity in relative price between BTC, LTC, ETH and XMR and more planned for the future. It makes sense to leave a position that is overbought to one that is oversold, and the more currency pairs I track, the easier it will be to find a smoking deal. Like warren buffet, looking for *value*. Like walking down an upward escalator, always buying the cheapest available coin. 
For example, during the gold rush to bitcoin a few weeks ago, both eth and ltc took huge hits (oversold) and were down almost 50% for the month and BTC was at an all time high (overbought) and likely to auto-correct..
If I could have automatically swapped for the coin that took the biggest hit(probably eth), I could have cashed out my BTC for something like ETH, and I could have ridden the wave its currently on for even greater profit (eth is now up almost 50% since then).

Uh this is a silly statement. Bitcoin can be killed. They managed to wipe out 50% of the network hash rate with one hard fork. A couple more of these and everything will be flopping and oscillating all over the place. Combined with a bug in the next fork that opens up a double spend vulnerability or something, and bitcoin could be replaced by ETH or LTC overnight. 
There is a war going on, and the  rule in any war is that if you underestimate your enemy, you have already lost. 
This sense of pompous invulnerability leads to complacency when urgency and vigilance is necessary to win. Ask Pablo Guzman, or Napoleon or Hitler. The history books are filled with men who thought they were invincible and were proven wrong in the worst possible way.

The CIA is helping american oil companies by toppling the country using "freedom fighters/terrorists/hired henchmen". They do so by first squeezing the country economically, locking them out of free markets, refusing to loan them money, calling in all old debts, forcing prices higher through 'economic sanctions' to hurt the population and finally hiring "protestors" to riot in the streets. Remember mr. photogenic rebel in the helicopter?
They do this so that when it finally collapses, they can install a friendly dictator who will hand over the keys to the rigs, the pumping facilities, the refineries, the oil tankers and the shipping terminals over to Exxon-Mobile, Shell Oil and Goldman Sachs bank.
In return, the people of Venezuela get to work for slave wages in a destroyed country that will take decades to recover producing oil/gasoline for American SUVs at cut rate prices. This is a classic Economic Hit Job courtesy of the CIA (using our tax dollars) and the Corporations and the elite 1%. To add insult to injury, Goldman Sachs bank will loan them $200 billion to rebuild the country they helped destroy at 11% interest.

Kraken at the moment, although since they have had sketchy service lately (performance related) I haven't been actively trading. They are working on getting their site tuned better for performance and I will definitely be back tho.
Right now I just do BTC/USD but soon will add ETH, LTC, XMR support, so i can run 4 bots that trade all four pairs stand alone and possible trade back and forth against different cryptos (sell high, buy low) based on their relative strength against each other. 
For example I own btc but if its overbought and ltc is down 30%, I buy ltc with my btc and wait for another crypto to drop hard, then buy the next cheapest one.
 
Also considering adding Dash and Ripple.

eventually you reach a point where nobody ever mines bch, no matter how many EDAs they do, because the price has dropped too low relative to BTC to make it worth it, and it screeches to a halt with a wet sounding plop. 
You can already see it in the bch chart. People are figuring this out and hedging their bets. The crowd is dwindling.

I'm sure they had to act quick, based on some of the heated angry threads I've seen lately they are most likely hemorrhaging customers/cash, so obviously it's something they want to get a handle on quickly.
I see it as a positive turn of events, hopefully they can implement this and some other short term performance hacks, get it running fast and then build out that infrastructure and deploy some leaner code. As long as the slope of decline in their assets/holdings/reserves/customer base hasn't reached absolutely catastrophic shit-the-bed levels, they should be able to pull back on the stick, level out and earn back the trust of their customers.
I really like Kraken, and any time an exchange goes tits up, a bunch of small traders and exchange employees lose it all and I don't want to see that happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:06:09
Then I guess it really boils down to whether or not the fees involved are more or less than the ~0.2% fee the exchange charges to do the swap to USD and vice versa. As it is now, a .2% fee at $4238 means the price has to move $8.48 to cover the fee.   
0.4% means the price has to move ~$17 to cover fees (and this is with a $0.00 bid/ask spread)

@_date: 2017-08-29 09:11:58
Ok i will play. But the thing is, it doesn't matter. They might have actually greylisted it because I talked about the other, shitty altcoin. 
If they did, I support their decision, because the brigading from the other sub with shills, astroturfers and just overall low-information dipshits had gotten so wildly out of control that drastic measures needed to be taken.
I suggested to the mods that we institute a 24 hour auto-ban on anybody who speaks the name that shall not be spoken, along with any mention of Ver, Wu, or Jeff. This is about Bitcoin^^TM, not a discussion of shitty alts and counterfeit copies.
Excommunicate them as apostates, I say.
Bitcoin is the last chance we have to dislodge the existing power structures of the world from their cozy perches. It's the only currency ever created that wasn't created by a King, or a central government. Many thousands of people have devoted large parts of their lives and all of their wealth to see it succeed. 
Many people have their whole life savings in Bitcoin, because they have an idea that they may finally experience the prosperity that economic wage-slavery has intentionally denied them for their entire lives. Bitcoin Trash is just the latest attempt to hijack &amp; destroy this beautiful, disruptive technology, along with all of the other corporate-funded attempts (XT, Unlimited, S2X). 
Any attack on Bitcoin is an attack on all of these good people, the common men and women, on behalf of the corporate interests who want to see all cryptocurrencies crash and burn in favor of Fiat. The endless wars, regime changes, pestilence and poverty that we see worldwide only exists because continuous economic growth is necessary to maintain the wealth of the 1%, whose fiat currency loses 4% of it's value every year.
People who try to attack bitcoin shouldn't be laughed at, trolled or made fun of for being the feckless weasels they are, they should be permanently excommunicated from the hive.

Assuming you mean *how much has been converted to bitcoin*, closest guess would be its current market cap, around ~$57 Billion and even that number is probably off by an order of magnitude or more.. Anything else is a wild, most-likely-very-incorrect guess, and being blindfolded and punching random numbers into a calculator will give you an equally reasonable answer.. Some people bought it when it was $1.00. Others bought it at $4,300. Some mine for 'free' coins. Others exchange alt coins for BTC at various exchange rates. There is no way to tell conclusively...

Thats a great idea. Variable participation in the blockchain, with a pre set minimum number of months, weeks, blocks, whatever.

The bigblockers have successfully offloaded their shares of BCH during the pump and dump a few days ago so expect it to continue its death spiral. 
If you hold BTC, then it will split in two and you will own BTC + "Bitcoin Unlimited XT Segwit2x Cash" or whatever they plan to call it. It will follow the same pattern as BCH, will pop on day one, then drop to almost zero, then get mysteriously revived so the big blockers can pump and dump their shares and get rich in the process and then it will also fall into a death spiral. 
Rinse, lather and repeat.

But they are like people who believe politics is a real thing. Once they lock in, they are on a suicide run and nothing you say will ever change their minds, until their imaginary bullshit alt coin goes to $0.00 and only then will they accept the hard truth.

As I said before, Bitcoin Cash and all of its ancestors and scion is about hijacking bitcoin and centralizing the mining network. Period. End of discussion. The same way XT was, the same way BU was, and the same way Segwit2x is.
If there is a problem with Bitcoin, the solution lies within the core group of developers that maintain the code and develop new features. Not a forcible hijack by the Chinese military and you-know-who. Want to fix bitcoin? Learn how to code &amp; join the core group. Don't attack it from the outside with paid shills and PR companies.
The code that was Bitcoin Unlimited had three buffer overflow exploits in 80 lines of code. They do shoddy work and that's dangerous. Every hard fork opens the possibility of a critical vulnerability being introduced that allows for double spending attacks or something even worse.

The CIA is helping american oil companies by toppling the country using "freedom fighters/terrorists/hired henchmen". They do so by first squeezing the country economically, locking them out of free markets, refusing to loan them money, calling in all old debts, forcing prices higher through 'economic sanctions' to hurt the population and finally hiring "protestors" to riot in the streets. Remember mr. photogenic rebel in the helicopter?
They do this so that when it finally collapses, they can install a friendly dictator who will hand over the keys to the rigs, the pumping facilities, the refineries, the oil tankers and the shipping terminals over to Exxon-Mobile, Shell Oil and Goldman Sachs bank.
In return, the people of Venezuela get to work for slave wages in a destroyed country that will take decades to recover producing oil/gasoline for American SUVs at cut rate prices. This is a classic Economic Hit Job courtesy of the CIA (using our tax dollars) and the Corporations and the elite 1%.
To add insult to injury, Goldman Sachs bank will loan them $200 billion to rebuild the country they helped destroy at 11% interest.

I think bcash and s2x are state level attacks on bitcoin through draining the mining pool. Look at how the ~~dumbfucks~~ *guys* at r/btc are screwing with the actual, non-counterfeit bitcoin hash rate. They steal the miners by gaming the difficulty, and we get weirdness, delays, high fees on the legitimate chain. User dissatisfaction (amplified with a bunch of fake "FEES!!1!" posts) leads to more abandonment of BTC for bcash and the cycle worsens.
**It's not about block size, or the mem pool or the fees or asicboost or any of the FUD they throw. Bitcoin was *operating normally* before the fork. It's about *destroying bitcoin*, and when bitcoin crashes and burns, all other altcoins go with it.**
If our network is this fucked up from one hard fork, what happens in 2 months? And whats to say Roger and his buddies don't have 8 more planned after that? After all, shitcash is just another in a long line of hijack &amp; centralization attempts (Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and now Bitcoin Cash and next up Bitcoin S2X?)
They can regulate the exchanges, but only american ones, and we would figure out a way around it. They could make bitcoin usage illegal, but that would only apply to american/europeans. They need bitcoin to crash and burn, but also to *make it look like it was a bad idea all along.* The only way to do that is a catastrophic failure, such as *chain death spiral.*  
How? Co-opting some of the [main]( [players]( through threats, [blackmail]( or bribes, getting them to [turn on their former passion]( running a [massive propaganda campaign]( hiring a troll army to disseminate FUD, and causing [hard fork]( after [hard fork](*****

BCH has stolen a lot of hash power from BTC by gaming the protocol and implementing a custom Emergency Difficulty Adjustment which makes it more profitable to mine shitcash every once in a while. This causes loads of miners to switch back and forth, causing oscillations in the network hashing power between shitcash&lt;-&gt;btc. 
Transactions are stacking up because of this denial of service attack and fees required to process transactions are also higher as a result.
Thus, fees are high, and transaction times are high, not because of any fault with BTC (as you imply) but because of a massive coordinated attack on the BTC network by the bigblock crowd and their retarded little altcoin.

The blocksize debate is bullshit. A distraction. Its an excuse perpetuated through propaganda and paid trolls and PR astroturfing to justify the existence of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin 2X, Bitcoin 3x (planned), etc.

As soon as you click buy in coinbase, it locks in the current price. Assuming you have linked your bank account... 
It takes up to a week to show up in your wallet, but you have already purchased the coin when you hit "confirm". Hope this helps.

Oh shit, you just reminded me that I signed up for an account with these guys like 6 months ago. Haven't heard back yet either. I wonder if I have been verified yet?

Bernie rolled over and spread his ass cheeks at the slightest hint of pressure. He was the ugly wingman that was gonna get hillary laid. But she managed to fuck that up too, and I am glad because she desperately wanted war with Russia which would have inevitably went nuclear &amp; MAD. The military was primed and ready, neocons &amp; warhawks were all lubed up and slow jacking in 1st gear, the war machine was spinning up to full speed, propaganda pumping at 1500 watts from every speaker in town and then trump went and shit in her corn flakes and we all have to wait four more years for a very profitable WWIII.
We are less safe than we imagine. I wish more people cared.

Even more laughable the concept that the feds wouldn't immediately murder him if they discovered his identity (and they might have already considering his mysterious disappearance) They did it to Gaddafi for even suggesting using something besides the US Dollar to sell oil. And Assad (or at least they tried). If you are a threat to the USD they will kill you dead in a quick ass hurry, even if you are president of another country....

In all honesty this seems reasonable to me, if it helps provide a better user experience. My only gripe would be stop-loss and take-profit, which are very very commonly used order types. Without stop losses, its difficult to cover your ass in margin trades.

ssssh we are trying to propagandize here dude. Don't inject reality or simple logic into my well planned smear campaign.
