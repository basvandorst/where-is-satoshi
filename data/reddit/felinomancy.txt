The "unique situation" is the Grexit, ***not*** corruption. It's unprecedented, to be kicked out of the Eurozone, and having to re-establish the drachma.
Tell me: in your Bitcoin world, will corruption cease to exist?


Not really. The Euro is still a very strong currency. The Grexit - if it happens - happens due to corruption, not because they use the Euro. If Bitcoin is the currency of Europe and successive Greek governments pulled the same shit, we'll be looking at Grexit 2.0

I'm not seeing Mastercard or Visa logos there; how many merchants would be willing to accept this?
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:07:01


Most of the existing merchants *in the world*, right now, do not take Bitcoin simply because saving 3% is pointless when there's no demand for it. And there is no demand for it because Bitcoin is still not seen as a valid currency by most people.
And of course, that's not the point - I wasn't talking about merchants. I'm talking about the consumers. Why would they - we - switch to Bitcoin? Absent good reasons, we won't - and merchants, likewise, wouldn't bother offering to use it, due to lack of demand.


How many times have we heard of the various bitcoin wallets going bonkers? Until Bitcoin is as easy to use as swiping a card - and just as, or even more secure at the same time - it will always be a very niche currency.

If BTC does not make it as a currency, then it will not be a store of value. Why would anyone want it, if it can no longer fulfill its original purpose?
Even though no country now uses gold for currency, it still has its uses in making jewelry and electronics. If BTC is no longer used for currency, why value would it have? Scarcity is not the sole determinator - after all, those giant stone heads on Easter Island is scarce, no one's suggesting we should use them as a store of value.

First of all, Greece having economic problems != the rest of Europe having economic problems on the same level. The problem is unique to Greece due to government corruption and mismanagement of funds.
Second, why are you guys cheering for it? If the entirety of Europe *do* have financial problems the way Greeks do, have you not thought of the people being affected by it? Hell, if there are massive riots, governments crumbling, etc., do you guys think *you* will be physically safe? 
When the Zimbabwean dollar is removed from circulation, they don't use Bitcoin. They use the USD. Same logic here will apply to Europe and elsewhere. Rather than indulge in these masturbatory fantasies, why not try to establish a regular, non-illegal marketplace that fully uses Bitcoin (i.e., not "use Bitcoin to convert to USD") first? Can't expect to take over a country's economy when it doesn't even work on a smaller scale.

Hi OP, Malaysian here. I don't understand why you don't just open an account with the local bank.

2. I've never used Bitcoin to buy their products; I just noticed that it's an option in the check out page.

What are you talking about? Barter economies does not use any currency at all. 
As an aside, even if they decide to ditch the Euro (why?), the USD would be a better choice. As I asked earlier, what advantage would Bitcoin have over the Euro or USD? You said it is "most likely to increase in value"; what is the reason for this confidence? It could just as likely decrease in value.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:04:38


Sorry, but from my opinion, this is irrelevant.
Maybe it's good for the merchant, but what's the use when no *consumer* would want to use Bitcoin? Tell an average Joe (or Jane) that they have to use a devilishly complicated contraption that offers no safety features such as chargebacks, and see how far that will go.
Capitalism works on supply and demand; if there is no demand to use Bitcoin, why would anyone take it up? For the moment, there is no advantage in using Bitcoin for commercial transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:00:05


Such as?


Credit and debit cards have been around for a long time now. And I'm not sure about the US or Europe, but in my country (Malaysia), some companies like AirAsia and Domino's Pizza would allow you to pay using online banking, directly from your bank account.
And in regards to many transfer, for most people, the concern is getting the money safely, rather than instantaneously. WU has branches all over the place, so it's easy for anyone to get cash once sent. "Instant money transfer" is useless when you can't spend the money, and BTC is hardly the predominant currency anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:05:50


Well yeah, because you haven't said why. 
The problem an average Greek has right now is that the banks are shut down, so they don't have access to their own money. Bitcoin cannot solve that problem, because Bitcoin is not widely used - if at all - in Greece.
Suppose a Greek Bitcoiner wants to exchange his BTC for Euros - he can, but he still can't get to his Euros (see "banks shut down", above). Or, suppose he wants to exchange his BTC for a meal - won't work, since no restaurant accept BTC, and they're not going to start now. And you can't tell them to do so now; try telling them, "hey, would you use a virtual currency that is not backed by anyone, and value can fluctuate up and down under seemingly random reasons?".

Interesting. Let's approach this rationally.
First, I assume that this is your goal: have Bitcoin replace fiat currency as the currency that everyone uses. 
In order for that to happen, you will need to explain how Bitcoin is an improvement to the status quo. And bearing in mind that given the objective, said improvement must be relevant to most of the populace. Most people don't care whether the money is fiat or specie-based; only that it's managed carefully.

What country are you from? I find it hard to believe that there's a country with such primitive banking system.
I'm from Malaysia, and let me tell you we're not exactly the most advanced country in the world. We're not even a *developed* country (still in "developing" stage). But for bank transfers, all I need is the account number and recipient's name. These details can be saved in the banking website (so you don't have to keep re-typing it), and the transfer itself takes one day **maximum**; in fact, for a slightly higher fee (RM1, as opposed to RM0.20), I can make the transfer instantaneous. 
Not only that, the SMS code is there as a safeguard; in case someone has your online banking ID and password, it's the last line of defense to prevent people from emptying your bank account. And some banks in my country offers the use of a physical token (think Blizzard's battle.net authenticator) as an alternative.
Contrasting with Bitcoin, I don't think downloading the wallet software/buying a custom hardware one is as easy or as secure as you made it to be; and as for "instantly", don't you have to wait for the transaction to be confirmed?

If the world is burning, I doubt "establishing a new reserve currency" would be my first priority. I'd worry about surviving first.


How? All of those countries, except Italy, has their own currency. Why would they stop using it? Why wouldn't they switch to other existing reserve currencies - or just use the currency of the country they're doing business with - rather than using Bitcoin?

Go to and observe the arguments they have about forking, block size, etc. Now imagine how even more horrible it would be if we take it to a global level.


Because there are people *right now* who has hundreds, or even thousands of Bitcoins. Why would I join a system where my cow farmers would be at their mercy? I don't want them, on adoption of BTC as my country's currency, to be able to come in, buy all the good property, and potentially disrupt my country's economy.

A one-off problem (not sure why **3** banks would be involved though) means nothing other than fulfilling the adage of "sometimes, things can go wrong, doesn't mean it will always go wrong". 
Remember the recent kerfuffle where the blockchain suffer gross performance issues due to the stress tests? I would say that would indicate that Bitcoin would be more vulnerable than the "1950s era Rube Goldberg interbank payments system".
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:16:06
First, they can't switch to Bitcoin. The slow transaction speed alone would make it unpalatable to most; if they're going off the Euro, they would probably re-create the Drachma, or use USD like Zimbabwe does.
Defaulting on the debts would ensure that no one would lend money to Greece again. Economically, they'll suffer from crippling inflation like Argentina or the Weimar Republic.
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:16:29


A system without controls would be abused by *everyone*. That's why people *hate* anarchy. 
That said, capital controls are horrible, I agree, but it also affects the very few. If your country is suffering so much that it has capital controls, I think "I need to move this big pile of money elsewhere" is the least of your problems.
I heard that BTC can be finely divided (e.g., having 1 mili- or microBTC, for example), but I don't think most people would want to use it. That means giving the current BTC users now disproportionately massive amount of power. If a country wants digital currency, they would more likely create a new one from scratch, then just peg it so that 1 New Digital Currency = x Old Currency

But the early adopters - which is to say, you guys - would have massive amounts of purchasing power. If I am my country's leader, why would I give you that power to begin with? Why would I expose my businessmen, farmers, etc. to the weakness of having their products massively undervalued?
The options are:
a. I let the goods in my country be massively undervalued compared to Bitcoin, e.g., 1 cow = 10 miliBTC, which would make them miserable, and me dead.
b. you guys agree to a massive redistribution scheme to level the playing field, which won't happen, or
c. I get together with the other countries to forcibly confiscate your Bitcoins, which also won't happen.
It's a lose-lose situation all around, which means I would be better of creating my own digital currency.

You cannot opt into "banking and finance" by taking a loan, then decide to unilaterally opt out when it comes to uphold your end of the bargain.
If banks start using bitcoin and offers you student loan in bitcoins, you still have to pay them back. The currency in question - whether it's fiat, bitcoin or cowrie shells - are irrelevant.
Likewise, there's no moral argument; if the system is rigged, **you shouldn't take out a loan with them**. Doing so is implicit acceptance of the system. If you have any principles, you should've not do any business with them, not "I'll be part of your system, but then I'm gonna bail as soon as it's my turn to uphold my part of the deal".

I don't know why you would refer to the current money as "monopoly money", but why would you automatically think everyone would use Bitcoin instead of the other established currencies? Zimbabweans use the USD when their local currency was deactivated, not Bitcoin.


All fiat currencies are backed by their respective governments, it's not "nothing". 


So does "regular money" which has a wide array of uses; which brings my point: how is Bitcoin more useful than said regular money? If I have a million dollars in USD, why would it be in my best self-interest to convert it to Bitcoin?

The point in paying the loan is to uphold your end of the bargain. 
You can argue that tertiary education is a human right, or that educational loans should be low/no interest (I would agree), but as it is, the point of paying back your loan is because you have entered a legal agreement to do so.
Anything else - "they just printed money" - is fluff. Whether they transferred fiat to your bank account, give you gold ingots or Bitcoin, a loan is given with the expectation that it is paid back.

"There's no place for me" is your problem, not the State's. If your freedom is so cheap that a mere inconvenience is enough to make you sell it, then perhaps it's not so important after all? After all, you are living with, and deriving benefit from, the "criminal organization" and yet you can't summon the courage to find your fortune elsewhere.


Except that the community you live in is not about *you*. Why would the State be rendered unimportant just because you think you can live by yourself? And if that is really true, again, put your money where your mouth is. 
People can't just barge in and squat in your house because if they do, you can take the necessary measures, and such measures will be backed by the State. Your employers can't cheat you out of your wages, the restaurants can't serve you rat disguised as chicken, and you don't have to build your own road if you need to travel elsewhere. And yes, all those things have an element of coercion, but I think "forcing people to play fair" would be a *justified* one.

Wars predate fiat currency. Hell, wars predate *currency*.

Try to approach things constructively.
For example, rather than say "no fees", explain why the fees are unreasonable - or better yet, how you can get the same features (ease-of-use, consumer protection, etc.) but without paying any fees. Just saying "no fees", without any context, is useless - technically, I can eat for free by dumpster diving instead of paying the guy at the restaurant, but I part with my money because paying gives me lots of advantages over going through other people's trash like a racoon.
I don't understand the anonymous part, though - my credit card or bank transfer purchases are known only to me, the bank and the merchant.

No, I "believe in" fiat currency (a.k.a., using it, and accept it as payment) because everyone else does. Consensus reality is the term I prefer to use.
Money is only accepted as such if it's either tangibly valuable, or if it's backed by an entity that everyone agrees is powerful enough to enforce its value. For the former, that's gold, silver and other commodities. For the latter, it's fiat currency. 
Bitcoin is neither. It's "backed by math", sure, but who is this "math"? How will this "math" enforce the  value of Bitcoin? If I want to pay with Bitcoin but my grocery store would not accept it, will "math" intervene?
One problem with Bitcoiners is that instead of working their way up, they want to shoot straight to the summit. Life don't work that way; Bitcoiner's Santa is the belief that their Chosen Currency would somehow overthrow the status quo.

Yes, and?
Even if someone managed to obtain my credit card and CCV numbers, I have two more layers of security: one, my bank will call me if there are transactions that are suspicious (e.g., buying things I don't normally buy, or at odd hours, etc.).
And two, even if said transaction passes the normal behavioural checks, my bank will always send me an SMS notifying me that a transaction has been charged on my card, so if it's unauthorized, I can always immediately have it investigated.
And on the off-chance that both checks fail, I can claim my money bank by claiming a fraudulent transaction. Fraud protection is a thing.

I've never heard of anyone robbing a store, or blowing his entire pension, on Twinkies addiction.
But another aspect of gambling laws is to protect the *consumer*. Licensed casinos *are* audited to ensure that the devices used are "fair"; both to protect the people playing, and the owners against accusation of rigged games.
