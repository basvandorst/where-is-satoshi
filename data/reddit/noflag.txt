Journalists won't and shouldn't do that
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:55:01
seriously? that's stupid. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:30:32
probably not, you shouldn't have a side if you're a real journalist
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:41:16
IMHO Tor is a bad option for anything other than anonymous clearnet access. Darknet services are vastly better suited by I2P. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:30:42
yes, exactly.

Orchid isn't actively developed
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:40:26
I wouldn't consider it safe. Sidenote: Orchid works in I2P! I wish it was better maintained. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:29:02
I2P would be better, since this is P2P and Tor discourages P2P usage. I2P also doesn't need a proxy, it can be used natively via a large variety of client protocols. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:22:49
well, no shit. but it's against basic journalistic ethics. they teach that in journalism 101. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:17:19
that would be the coolest thing ever
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:04:03
you got a problem with private property?
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:03:04
It literally has nothing to do with justice. Start a freer clone. If your policies are better the market will decide.
@_date: 2016-03-26 01:49:05
hahaha yeah i figured. i'm happy to be responded to by such an, ahem, well-known member of the bitcoin community
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:31:50
except reddit is mostly open source and it's trivial to start a clone. state-enforced laws are different than private property. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:42:35
You people have been whining about "censorship" for years and it's never enough for a schism. Just break off already. Or is it too much actual effort? Don't let the door hit ya where the Good Lord split ya.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:43:35
they have outproxies but there's like 2, 3 of them. Its mostly a hack and not meant for major use. 
it has a lot of innovative features, much better than tor in many ways. it supports UDP, hostnames, P2P, Biittorrent, etc. Tor doesn't like P2P. The community is great and working hard on being awesome.
I'm an early adopter, I think the only reason Tor is more popular is more media coverage. 
IMHO Tor should abandon "hidden services" which are hacked in and barely developed, leave it to I2P, and I2P should continue how it is.

I don't think it's that centralized. P2Pool is becoming a good alternative to the centralized pools, there are a ton of ways to exchange, and third-party clients are available and more are coming. Multibit and Armor (sp?) are good ones to try. 
@_date: 2012-11-02 20:11:09
I used the official client, the transaction id was: 24f49504f2f011b0359adfef8a72dff9e50b3daf54709f0297260bb2e558b366

What do you mean by "new printing"? The limit is hard coded into the client. It can be changed easily, if there is a good reason. I believe namecoin can issue unlimited coins.

could i live there if i worked there? are there other local co-ops?
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:34:52
i was under the impression that they could just keep anything they wanted

They lose control over trademarks they don't use. Coke, for example, has to actively defend itself from trademark abuse because if it didn't, "coke" as a colloquial term would be up for grabs by anyone. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 07:17:23
why are you even here?

I'm just comforted by the idea that somewhere out there, Captain Ron is tricking some family into making him their captain. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:21:32
it would be nicer if it used primecoin or something else with useful calculations
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:30:54
Thank you, I can now sleep well at night. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:02:42

@_date: 2013-06-24 00:37:01
they could have copied the unencrypted wallet and deleted the original

What's with the downvotes? They make a good point. You can't have freedom without security (to be secure in your possessions and information) or security without freedom (having the social/political/technological ability to enforce your own security).

They're also working on a direct implementation with the blockchain api
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:39:28
true, but how do you deal with blackmailers without government intervention?
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:21:23
I think things like bitcoin should be developed primarily over darknets.

Isn't SIP a Skype killer? There's already tons of clients. Just most people don't use them
@_date: 2013-09-14 01:56:12
we also need to build a society that reduced the social pressures that lead to violent or deviant behavior. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 07:21:59
I bet you're an MRA. You'd fit in with them, at least.

More fast food please. 
Your selection seems to be the same, or almost the same, as Gyft. Why should we use your service?
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:42:46
Are there any local police brutality/abuse groups? You should publicize this far and wide. Maybe have a protest. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 20:04:05
i see they made a pidgin plugin version recently, actually. i remember always hearing bad things about it
@_date: 2013-02-16 03:40:13
It existed. Witcoin. Closed, though. I think there was drama.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:36:07
this is why i, as a non-capitalist anarchist, love it so much
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:19:47
He could just but one on silk... Oh....

big deal it was his idea to post it

Are contractors currently expected to report their own earnings? This isn't any different as far as I can tell. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:03:07
Keeping their savings safe is the last thing on their minds?
@_date: 2013-08-15 06:28:58
Not really. More customers helps.
@_date: 2013-01-23 18:50:01
Oh yeah I'm sure /s
@_date: 2013-03-16 19:48:05
You could probably create a non profit or a trust or something, you'd be stupid not to. Call it the  Jhzanto Nature Reserve.
@_date: 2013-05-14 06:21:45
and the problem is?
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:56:27
There sure as hell should be!
@_date: 2013-06-08 20:36:37

@_date: 2013-10-11 15:54:09
They have a Firefox addon so you can do it all client side
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:11:10
@_date: 2013-06-08 23:39:05
i believed i did, but i think i may be mistaken. i'm still looking it up. we really need a good darknet search engine 
@_date: 2013-05-14 07:25:18
Yeah, it's really very sad. I'm just glad he's not being upvoted by some brigade. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 19:38:16
I assume your employer would report your earnings
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:19:10
