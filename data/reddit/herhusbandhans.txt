Nonsense. Half the time the whole interface is configured to obfuscate the reality of what you are purchasing. If the customer has mistakenly payed for something they didn't want, then the onus is on the supplier to make what is being paid for more explicit. Or at least take responsibility and refund.

It's an on-ramp.  Until recently it's been very difficult/awkward to buy btc in UK even with KYC identification, now I can do it in seconds on my phone (and I'll bet the banks begin to close less accounts from now on when people cash out).  Sure, it's important to point out we're still way off the blockchain bank-free super-dream, but this is significant for sure and I think Circle deserves some credit for succeeding where others have failed.

Honestly Erik, I've enjoyed your agent provocateur act until now and found it a fairly well-balanced and necessary catalyst for helping some of us on the fringes to understand what's going on, but this post (and your disingenuous claim to be unbiased) says more about you than the block-size debate.  Did you not politely ask Core to a) denounce censorship and b) assure the community that, if needed, an increase will be made?
Isn't that, more-or-less what Core has done? When you take thinly veiled analogous swipes like 'stubborn hold on the group' I wonder who is at the keyboard now.  Is it the intelligent adult diplomat, or the child ego who can't let an argument go?

It's still using the old legacy fiat system. I might invent JunkCoin for my own personal satisfaction, but converting to fiat every time I make a purchase is not using JunkCoin any more than trading.
I think these debit cards are useful only as a novelty, or if you have some specialist reason (eg. getting paid in btc).  I'd love them to be btc--&gt; goods, but alas, I'm generally worse off than selling my btc to fund my fiat account.

Yep, definitely had enough on the account to cover the conversion because it wouldn't let me convert initially, until I covered the overage.  Will message you my ticket now.  
It's not just the delay that's frustrating, it's the way the support staff appear to be shifting responsibility firstly onto other staff and then literally trying to wing it by telling me it had worked when it hadn't.  As BTC_Forever mentions above, this has all the hallmarks of a scam, and I think everyone in the bitcoin community has been had at some point so is (rightfully) super wary of this kind of behavior.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:52:08
The war will continue for as long as bitcoin is censorship free. 2Xers have inadvertently revealed their priorities of profits over decentralization, so we should remain vigilant because they will likely not stop.
Erik's fall from grace is particularly interesting because he was one of the good guys, the innovator, working with the developers and the community rather than against them.
Deciding they were all wrong and that he and a handful of entrepreneurs knew best is interesting from a human psychology perspective.   How could he not see what a ridiculous position that was to take? What are his real motivations here?

You don't consider a hostile (I.e. minus community consensus) fork overly authoritarian? Or something that can be adequately summarised as intense disagreement (I.e. war, battle, fight etc)?
Nobody's getting shot. We're all (mostly) grown-ups.  This was a dispute over the fundamental value of bitcoin.  It's healthy!  But if you publicly pick a side, as Erik did, you will get called out on it.  I don't think that's unfair.

Got burgled last year while asleep. Funnily enough, the two random sheets of paper with all my private keys wedged amongst 1000 other, innocuous sheets of paper, remained untouched. And I wasn't even trying.
@_date: 2018-11-04 01:27:38
The abuse is inexcusable.  I have had an incident however where the atm ate my money and five hours later the guy who owned it turned up with a key.  Turns out the internet at the shopping centre was so bad the connection kept cutting out.
Now, if that shopping centre is charging rent for that machine, as I before they were, then they do share some responsibility (they also said they refuse to keep a key for emergencies - again, I think this is a unfair denial of responsibility if they are profiting from the machine). 
Obviously the people working that day were clueless and in no way to blame. But it did make me think about whether the owners realise that when you're dealing with hundreds of dollars of people's money (and taking a cut), they should at least fill their end of the bargain and make sure any issues are not caused or exacerbated by the premises.
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:39:08
So it's the customer's fault for using the machine in the way it was designed (remember high commission, you're heavily incentivized to bunch transactions into larger units) to be used?  If you feel unsafe that's the fault of the management for putting you in that position.  If it's a liability to deal with then... guess what? that's also the fault of the management for putting you in that position.  Blaming the users is absurd.
@_date: 2018-11-04 13:23:20
This. 
Also I think people forget these ATMs aren't like normal ATMs dealing with small everyday transactions. You lose $30 and probably just get on with your day. Their huge commissions encourage much larger, life changing transactions (just like a bank), so owners can't hide behind 'bitcoin isn't a bank' when they are actively exploiting it's properties to use it like a fiat banker would, whilst then simultaneously hiding behind the poor store workers (such as OP) on the front-line to take all the flak when it goes belly-up.
@_date: 2016-09-29 19:09:17
Besides invisibility, the problem with this kind of enslavement is that it happens to control the money supply. Money being the fuel for most human activity. Thus we have entered into an exploited relationship that will gradually be illuminated by bitcoin(or whatever crypto) because it can simply do things better, and restores your economic freedom. But yes, most people will need a practical, real-life example before they see this on an intuitive level.
Bitcoin isn't ready for the masses yet. Early access granted to those who can already see the benefit.
@_date: 2018-11-04 21:41:05
I can assure you that your 100% estimate is off because that is absolutely what happened in my case.  And just because they aren't making commission per sale they are still profiting from the machine.  Their 'cut' is still factored into the exchange just like Mastercard or Visa or any other ATM.  Not to mention increased footfall into their store.  
Things store owners could do:
1) Ensure and regularly test internet connection.  The ATM owners are paying them for a stable access, it is up to them to ensure the premises are up to scratch.
2) Ensure at least one trained member of staff who has, say, at least some basic technical knowledge (i.e. simple solutions such as resetting the router etc which may fix common issues).
3) Ensure at least one member of staff is fully trained in conflict management.  In an ideal world humans wouldn't kick off having just lost $1000s to an anonymous entity but lets be realistic.
4) Recognise that they have a duty of care to their staff as well, who can and will be occasionally thrown into very hairy situations if management aren't preparing them properly.  
That's just off the top of my head.  The point is they shouldn't just pretend it's not their responsibility in any way.  On that basis you could rent out space on your property for all sorts of scams and say to hell with the repercussions.

I didn't complain and remained courteous the whole time.  The downvotes are hilarious.

I'm not attacking OP, I'm pointing out I'll never use a bitcoin atm again.  And I'm an enthusiast.

Everybody already is keeping their banked currency at home though, it's called a credit card and an online bank account.  I hear what you're saying, there's no insurance against theft or damage.  And we've become used to that comfort blanket over time.

Parliament just voted to replace EU sovereignty will an army of bureaucrats to inscribe their 'interpretation' of EU law.

Simply stating something is the case does not make it so.  ALL context is relevant to forming an opinion (are you familiar with the internets?), and the fact that Craig Wright is making extraordinary claims absolutely brings any prior financial history, proven or otherwise, into play.  Opinion is not formed in a vacuum, this is not a courtroom, you are not a judge or the Chinese government, information is information and it is available to all.
As to the second point, hmm.  He is the one making the claims here.  They have been consistently debunked.  The burden of proof is now on him to prove that he is telling the truth or, otherwise, he is very much guilty (of lying, and looking allot like Nick Clegg, the latter charge being the greater charge imo).
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:15:20
You mean it's inconvenient for your argument to correlate the two. OP's issue is with the *unethical* practices of a faceless corporate entity, he/she is using the pre-existing legal framework in order to redress that discrepancy. You'd think a fellow bitcoiner would be on their side.
You're saying it's their own fault for entrusting said company/regulators. I'm pointing out that it is, at present, literally impossible not to trust 'someone' on the net with your personal data, which means we are left with the only practical solution possible in order to redress malpractice: provincial litigation.

Also, the 'don't give out the info' grows increasingly tenuous as writing style recognition tech grows.
Just because bitcoin is designed to be 'trustless' does not therefore mean we automatically now live on a trustless planet. We're not going to suddenly throw every reasonable law out the window because many of those laws, such as data protection, are the only thing stopping market forces from rinsing every last scrap of marketable data you produce with zero consideration for how 'careful' you thought you were, or any 'human rights' you thought you had.
