Ya, the people that think this was bad need to realize that there is no such thing as bad publicity.  Politicians would kill to be ridiculed on the Colbert Report.

Noob question, but could the blockchain be patched to move the decimal to the right?  Like if more than half of the users decide its a good idea, could the value of one bitcoin be changed to the value of .01 while increasing the # of bitcoins by 100?

Maybe, but it's no different than a stock split

But the overall value wouldn't change, so there shouldnt be any loss of confidence, it wouldnt cause inflation.
