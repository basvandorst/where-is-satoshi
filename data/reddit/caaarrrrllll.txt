That’s kinda scary. I really just wanted it as get rich quick scheme. I might just sell the next time it bumps up.

I barely understand this shit and im buying some on robinhood . crossing my fingers it’ll be a lot of usd  someday. Should I sell it all?

Which cost more than mortgage payments and even the repairs unless you have a total shithole house. You could buy more bitcoin and have a home investment.

Yeah. That’s most people’s situation. It sucks. If you’re not able to then my comment is irrelevant.

To play devils advocate, would you say it’s easier to pay for illegal things with bitcoin? I don’t really understand it very well either tho.

Yes, but the bitcoinian inverse yield flux theory will bring it to $18k within the next 3.5 months almost guaranteed.

Probably already answered somewhere in this sub but o well: I’m just investing a little bit in Robinhood so far. Is anyone using bitcoin for normal purchases anymore? Mostly for illegal things only? Seems like everyone is just trying to time the market and “hodl”ing. If the illegal activities are stopped, won’t it be useless? Is there an ethical issue for investing in it? Is the end game to trade back to fiat money when bitcoins value get super high or do you expect bitcoin to take over the world?

Weird thing about that movie. If the robots wanted the humans to be content with their life as a battery, why didn’t they make them all live a rockstar life with 10 super model girlfriends instead of some boring desk job? Fighting robots in the center of the earth seems more fun than that shit.

Lol. Interesting

Ok zoomer?

Thanks. Do you expect it’s value to be really high one day? If so, Why would you spend it? Spending fiat money online is so easy nowadays, I would just assume bitcoin is only used for illegal or embarrassing  purchases that you don’t want tracked.
