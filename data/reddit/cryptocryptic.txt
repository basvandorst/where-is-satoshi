I got at least 200 of these there already...

That's actually an easy way to make huge money. Create an altcoin, pre-mine it, sell as Bitcoin.

Exactly! It became as if suddenly everybody on was a bcash hodler!

"Reputable" or "well known"? There is a difference...

So I shoud be able to create any altcoin, call it Bitcoin and use the same logo, fool people into buying it, and not be held accountable?

There are lots of ways to fool people into buying something, and they would never see this community in the first place. I was a LocalBitcoins seller for years, and dealt with people directly, and although I never scammed anyone, opportunities to do it were very constant.
I'm not calling for the centralization of Bitcoin, though. My idea was to get the insight from other people here who know more than I do, so your input is appreciated (at least the rational part of it - saying that "core is bunch of nanny stater, gubmint appeasers" just because a random lurker asked a question...).

I don't use SegWit yet because Electrum only supports Bech32 SegWit addresses, which has not even been made official yet...
@_date: 2018-07-16 07:53:42
It's either legacy or bech32

I'm talking about **creating** "P2SH(non-bech32, 3-prefix) segwit" wallets with Electrum, there is no such option.
EDIT: Why the downvotes? There is simply no way to create 3-prefix SegWit wallets on Electrum. Do people just downvote because they "feel" the answer is correct or not? The options available on wallet creation are either 1-prefix or bc1-prefix.

That's great then! Last time I checked, it was hardly supported anywhere else, though.Have things improved?
