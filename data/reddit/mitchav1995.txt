2 things about the Halvening: Historically it's taken several months for the price of bitcoin to react and two, noone really knows for sure why Bitcoin jumps up after. It's not guaranteed gains.

It's obvious that they feel threatened by Bitcoin. If illegal activity is their only card then this just further proves the benefits of Bitcoin. If anything, this kind of response from the US govt only further legitimizes crypto. They're going to fight it tooth and nail.

That's a good theory, but not the whole picture. If that were the whole picture, you'd expect the price to react before the halvening since people know that miners would be holding.

Actually, coinbase has a pretty good setup if you choose to keep it all on their platform. They insure all of the bitcoin they hold online (about 2%). The rest is held in offline storage. The offline storage is ridiculously encrypted and practically hack-proof. The only thing that coinbase is pretty much not protected from is exchange failure. If coinbase went down... I'd be inclined to guess that bitcoin will pretty much fail anyways.

It's slightly inverted yes, not to the point to signify imminent recession imo. But the rate cut will likely turn it around. Remember a recession is defined as two negative gdp quarters in a row. We're still very positive.

2-3 years sounds about right.

This interest rate cut is not the same as others. The interest rate has been practically nothing for 10 years... Artificially low. When they increased the rates last year, they increased it by too large of a margin and have said they were planning to cut it back a bit. Of course we're going to see another recession at some point, but this interest rate cut does not mean the recession is looming.

Pure speculation but I think the current administration is pushing off deals to get closer to the election as a boost for ratings. That, and to put the heat on china. The US isn't quite at the point to where were desperate for a resolution. Chinas economy on the other hand is in a much much worse state. We have all the leverage.

Let's be real, trade deals and tariffs will be resolved by next election.

Yes you're right. An inverted yield curve likely means recession is almost bound to happen, but it could happen in 3 months or 3 years. Basically it just boils down to long term uncertainty.

Don't try to time bitcoin, you'll get burned. Systemic buys are the way to go

We're not in a recession. Do you know what a recession is?

Coinbase is pretty safe as long as you use two-factor authentication. They store 95% of their coins offline in lockboxes around the world, and if in the event someone were to hack coinbase and steal bitcoin, they have insurance that will pay out the coins stolen to the victims. The insurance doesn't cover bitcoin stolen on an individual basis however (ie someone steals your account password).

To be fair, coinbase insures your bitcoin in case of hacking and also it stores 95% of it's coins offline
