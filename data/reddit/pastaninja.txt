I'm going to guess 95% of the guests will either:
* Forget to take it because they're drunk
* Forget to take it because it's easily misplaced on the table.
* Don't care to take it because "WTF is that?"
* Take it but lose it after forgetting about it.
On the other hand, there will probably be that one guy who knows about bitcoins and will make rounds around the tables after the reception ends picking up all the wallets people inevitably left behind.

[No no, we need even *less* regulation! Only with the complete freedom of anyone to start their own exchange will bitcoiners be safe from getting scammed by an exchange!](

Take a look at what's been happening in since the original SilkRoad has shut down. They are your exchanges without any regulation or barrier to entry. And what happens? Almost every single one has been hacked or has been a scam honeypot. Why? Because either they're started by people who have no business starting an exchange site, or because they're started by people wanting to quickly get in, make some cash, and disappear.

Can anyone comment on whether this will make it easier or harder for scammers to run their scams?
I like this from the anonymity viewpoint, but following the blockchain to see where money goes has been useful in identifying scams.

This is where I disagree. Just because my local convenience store is a money laundering operation, doesn't mean that I am involved in their money laundering when I go there to buy a bag of chips and get their dirty cash.

Couple of things that would make you sleep peacefully at night:
1. Following bitcoin trail to a person is fairly hard, and you have lots of options for making it even harder, like transferring them to an exchange and then exchanging with yourself to obfuscate where they're going.
2. Instead of stealing 3 mil from one drug lord who is definitely going to take his revenge on you no matter what, you stole a few thousand from a few thousand people. They're not going to collectively organize to go after you.
3. you can use th emoney you stole for protection

Banks lend out more money than what was deposited - aka [Fractional Reserve Banking]( Banks operate on the idea that all their customers won't want to withdraw all their funds. Bank runs used to happen, but now the Central Bank can prevent banks from going under during a bank run by giving the bank the money it needs. The Central Bank can simply print more money if the inflation of doing so will have less of an economic impact of letting the bank fail. Again, something not possible with bitcoin.
I can see banks dabbling in BTC the same way banks deal with foreign currency right now. But it will never become the central part of their process because it lacks the multiplicity of currency. We need to be able to grow the money supply in line with th growth of the economy.

Exchange it for fiat at one of the exchanges, I bet. Why would they hold?

Like all shitty theories, the further yours goes, the shakier and more nonsensical it gets.


Why would Karpeles have this info? I don't understand what BitCoin or MTGOX has to do with WikiLeaks or Snowden at all. 
How SR was shutdown was plainly shown as well, and it had nothing to do with MTGOX. You're saying that SR vendors/operators used MTGOX to change their bitcoins into fiat, which is plausible, but also that somehow Karpeles knew who these SR guys were? How would he possbly know that? They shutdown SR without needing anything from GOX.


So, he wanted MTGOX to remain running so he could make his seized money back, but he also wanted to let people know that MTGOX had its balls in the hands of the gov't. The two are at odds with each other because if he got the word out, people would abandon GOX, thus making it impossible for him to make the money back. 


NSA: "We have you by the balls, we made a deal, you clearly broke that deal, but we're going to give you a second chance because we're nice like that, and also because you have some information that for some inexplicable reason we have not extracted from you yet." Nice guy NSA. 


Gov't: "Look, we have enough to send you to prison, but you seem like a nice guy, and we're nice guys (you saw how nice NSA was to you just now?), so we'll let you continue operating your business that we believe broke our laws because we don't believe in sending you to prison poor."

? They can't dump if there are no buyers, and evidently there are a lot of people willing to buy BTC if they're doing 15K in sales a day. If this is a one-time dump, I'd see your point, but as a constant stream (and I doubt they hold their BTC for longer than a day anyway) it just increases the liquidity.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:23:37
Thought people couldn't withdraw their coins from MTGOX?

The part of money that serves the banks' business model is the part where they can take one of your dollar, and lend that dollar out to 10 other people. The rest of fees and whatnot is only the icing on the cake. There's a reason why no banks are rushing into BTC, and that's because BTC makes impossible their core business model.

Do you guys not follow the regular financial exchanges at all? Financial exchanges work off of milliseconds; and trading isn't done in secret. When news of interest rate changes are announced, some people make profit because they hear of them milliseconds sooner. Bitcoin exchanges can't even touch that latency. They dig dedicated fiber optic lines to connect to the financial exchanges. Internet latency is fucking years compared to that.
It doesn't matter if your access to a tracker lets you see when selloffs happen. *By then it's wayyyy too late.* 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:29:57
That's not losing track of the bigger picture. The people doing this don't give a fuck about what happens to bitcoin. They just see it as an opportunity for making real money off of naive libertarians.

That would actually be really interesting to witness. The two obvious advantages would be that its legitimacy would be instantly solidifed, and its exposure would instantly hit critical mass. 
You will have thousands (possibly millions) of people starting to mine it immediately upon its announcement. The difficulty would ramp up like crazy. Companies would be in cut-throat competition to be the first to release a better, faster, mining machine. 
From one side, the people who get in early would still be the big winners, but from another side, because the timeframe of when people start mass-mining will be so small, it could mean that the distribution of the coins will be a lot more spread out.
It will be madness during the first month for sure though.

lol. Just lol. 
Bitcoin exchange screws people over because there's no government regulation at all. "Uhhh uhhh it's still the government's fault because if it wasn't for government requiring buying expensive licenses to trade money, then any Joe Shmoe would be able to start their own exchange, and this shit wouldn't happen!"

I think it's poking fun at the recent Target snafu with their point-of-sale system getting hacked and thus losing 40 million credit card accounts.

Likely. If I somehow have some BTC I want to spend, and I can spend them either on drugs, or computer parts (in before "bitcoin can be used to buy other things"), I'm probably going to pick computer parts.
It would be risky for a company to hold with that much volatility in the coin. I just don't see the CFO of Overstock saying that BTC is a good place to park your capital for investment purposes. That kind of financial irresponsibility only occurs in investment banks. ;)

No way? Really?
Unless I'm totally misunderstanding something, it's as simple as transferring the coins to a paper wallet, putting the private address into a safety deposit box at the bank, and then writing the contents of the safety deposit box into your will.

Big bankers are not really subject to the same laws as ordinary people. But even besides my cynicism, it's not hard to see that HSBC's profits are mostly from legal sources with only a fraction being drug money laundering, whereas SR is the inverse of that.
