You have lost your mind.

The same reason if it were put to a vote de redistribute the richest 51% it would happen: it benefits the majority. 
Exchanges are not in charge of the network. 
Miners have more to gain via reboot, as more coins are produced per block and are more valuable due to scarcity. 
How could you possibly imagine this NOT becoming an issue?

You fucking retard.

That unprompted sharing of your bitcoin strategy wasn't strange in this context at all.

Clones of free products sold for 25$ in btc?

@_date: 2013-04-13 22:36:50
Hahahahaha.

Obligatory reminder that Bitcoin is stupid.

No one owns coins, they possess wallet keys. 
Repeat, no one owns bitcoins. 
Now fast forward to the year 2140 with btc valued at 1000 Ultra-American Space dollars. 
All coins are mined and transaction fees are less than .01 btc.  Reduced incentive and increased computing power, mining has long since shifted to being done by relatively few albeit powerful mining pools. 
Then one or more of those mining pools realises they could earn 50,000 UASD per block. 
The end.

He knows. This guy is trying to find some buyers for his coin on this sub.

You could drown an army in you oceanic ignorance. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:39:58
You need help.

What about all the free BTC the exchanges were giving out?  Are these coins contraband or stolen from other users?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:40:59
Isn't this place fascinating?

Reverting to the longer block chain would effectively reverse all charges on the tangent chain.

So if the majority of nodes thinks bitcoin should just be rebooted i can lose all of my bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:49:33
Do you pay your electric bill in btc?

Please find me one country with no currency and widespread access to the internet.

This thread is hardcore intellect gore. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:42:45
Ok fine, but i bet you cant think of three other glaringly obvious reasons that bitcoin is exactly as useful as cash with a larger amount of risk placed on the consumer!
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:26:12
Phd economist. 
Bahahahaha. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:52:52
This is both hilarious and clever.

Solution to bitcoins problems:  behave more like a bank.

 Every hard drive on the planet would have to be wiped out at the same time, as well as any burned disk or tape drive backups that may contain the blockchain.
But this isn't true, only a majority (or plausibly even less) would be needed to disrupt the whole system.  Sure the original ledger could continue on, but then people form the new ledger could sell their duplicate coins on the old ledger to purchase on the new, reducing the equity of the original.
