Why is it ok to have "massively connected central hubs" run by banks? Isn't that a kind of centralization? And if so why is this kind better than having big blocks?

I'd like to add something: it is not possible *yet* to send funds to a wallet/node without an invoice of the recipient. This invoice has an expiry date and can only be used once. 
Maybe I will try creating a reddit bot when withdrawing automatically is possible.

How would you do such a bot?
For example if I would want to tip you: &lt;value in satoshis&gt; then I would get a payment invoice and you would get the coins directly to you Lightning wallet or node? This system would require that the user register the pubkey of their wallets or nodes before they can get tipped. 
Or the bot itself could keep the coins for the users until they withdraw via Lightning or even with a normal Bitcoin address?

The [Samourai]( wallet supports Segwit. But not bech32 yet.

Do you know how the bitcointip bot worked and how it managed not to suck?

How would you force the users to the first type after a specific balance? Maybe not accepting tips at all or annoying them with direct messages periodically?

On testnet you can have a light node with LND and Neutrino. Neutrino will get released for Mainnet soon. Maybe next LND release
