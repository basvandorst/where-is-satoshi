Please read the article you're citing, it states the banks using SWIFT suffered from hacks which stole their SWIFT credentials, not the network itself...

Agreed that it's good advice to never store your wallet online, but there's always exceptions. I personally do have an AES-Twofish encrypted copy stored on dropbox. With a password that's got more entropy than the 256 bits they both take as key.
If you can convince me that that's still a worse idea than having one less backup, I'm all ears. (Disclaimer: cryptographer who actually studied the AES and twofish implentations he used for the file)

It's indeed discretely named and even has a file extension that makes it seem like some random temporary file by a well-known software package that was synced to dropbox before it should've been deleted.
Only actually inspecting the file would reveal that it's seemingly random data.

That's just the thing, they HAVE tried double-spending in the past... 
That alone should be a reason for the entire community to boycott them. The fact that they're around 50% of total hashrate just makes all this exponentially worse.
Previous pools that came close to 50% temporarily closed new registrations, which gave me a lot more confidence in their intentions than the fact that GHASH/CEX haven't tried anything funny in the last couple of days. (As far as we know).

It's in the title: Mobile Vikings. Belgian telecom provider that takes pride in their incredibly cheap prepaid mobile internet.
They're really great, payed this month with bitcoin too. I wonder if I'm getting one of those in the mail as well, very cool.

Seems you're a bit late to the topic, I'm only here because I had the tab still opened in the background.
The big difference with a report about alternate investments is that:
1. Bitcoin has gained huge media attention recently (and several times in the past) for its recent increase in **value in fiat currency**. Nothing more, nothing less. People are money-fetishists. Those alternate investments very likely stayed a niche instead of blowing up like Bitcoin did.
2. Unlike alternate investments that are much less volatile, people who knew you had bitcoins a while back actually change their behaviour once the price is higher. You can't imagine how many people tried giving me financial advice, buying-/selling tips, 'wisdom' in a market they know nothing about and that I've been following for years. More so, I've had people jokingly say I should now buy them their drinks in a bar. But in their eyes you clearly see they're dissapointed when you laugh and ignore that remark.
That's why almost nobody will openly talk about the value of their bitcoins. Your surroundings suddenly change similarly to those who just won the lottery.
*PS. Please don't use a 'the' in front of Bitcoin like a lot of (Belgian) media sources do. It looks awful. Personal opinion.*

Same here. Mother of all observation biases of course, but in the computer science department of KU Leuven there's quite a bit of fuss every time some significant change in the exchange rate takes place. 1000 seems quite low indeed.
