I think it's an MS Exchange feature. At the office we use Outlook and I have the ability to recall sent emails.
Anyone who didn't open email never sees it, those that did open see the attempted recall.

Dumb question; is this a good example of storing your coin in paper wallet(s)?

You *should* see some feedback about Xapo in the near future. I have a wallet there myself...just haven't used it. 
I did sign up for their BTC debit card which is "scheduled" to be released sometime this month. 
Whether they can pull that off or not is another story.

Look what I got today:
Hi Anonymous,
We wanted to provide you with a quick update about the status of your Xapo Debit Card.
Since this is the first true bitcoin debit card that is designed as a seamless extension of your bitcoin wallet, we and our card partner have had a lot of work to do!
Fortunately, we are in the final stages of testing the card, and the first Xapo Debit Cards will be shipped in a few weeks.
The plan for distribution is to ship the cards in batches. If you are not in the first wave of cards, don't worry. We will continue to distribute cards for everyone that has pre-ordered the card.
You don’t need to take any action right now. Prior to shipping your card, we will follow up to confirm your shipping address.
We appreciate your continued support of Xapo and we are working hard not just on the Xapo Debit, but on other innovative products, as well.
For more information regarding the Xapo Debit Card, please visit our FAQ’s.

+1 for CryptoCard. 
Happy customer here.

Mycelium? I have *all* of my wallets tied into it. Coinbase, BlockChain, LBC and even my CryptoCard wallet. I don't have my Electrum wallet on there bc I only use it temporarily, but imagine it would work as well.

I was in meetings all day yesterday and didn't have the opp to watch my on-screen btc price widget every 30 mins like I typically do.
Man, was I in shock when I came home to a sub 500 price point. That shock shortly turned into happiness when I was finally able to buy 3 btc for under $475 in quite sometime now.
Bring on more bloodbaths please. Many thanks to China...I owe ya one ;)

!!!!HAPPY BIRTHDAY WISE FINANCIAL COLLEGE GUY!!!!
I wish I was in college when this whole CryptoCurrency thing blew up. I'm curious if you are one of the few who are wise to BTC...or are you few of many that know about how it works.

Absolutely wait. If you purchased 2 btc at $1k each, most likely you aren't hurting. Selling at this point won't do much unless you are strapped for cash. 
If you're not...ride it out. And I don't mean for the month...I'm talking long term. It will rise again...maybe for a day, a week, a month...and will probably drop too. Wait for that moment to contemplate your next move. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:57:55
Well done! It's unfortunate that a majority of the btc populous (that own a substantial amount of coin) most likely don't follow same protocol. That is an assumption though... 
I personally don't have enough btc (anymore) to be doing so...but when I get back on my btc feet,  I'm going to store my coin more strategically than I have in the past. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:49:00
Wow...that is absurd! 
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:03:32
I would imagine *not* if I'm the only one suggesting it. While I've been in the game for a bit, I've just recently started using Electrum...so I can not confirm nor deny that it will accept the EMK. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:20:07
Wow...this is great news. Horrible for me bc I have an impulsive Newegg buying problem, but great nonetheless.

Satisfied customer here! I purchased two several months back and absolutely love them. I keep one in my wallet just to show it off at the office. 
People without knowledge of BTC, other than what they have seen on the news,  are completely confused as to how I have an aluminum card for my BTC. Most people out of the loop just think it's a virtual concept that is for hobbyists and hackers. 
* note my office is a fortune 100 company with plenty of older folks
Often the confused quickly become intrigued and I've probably had at least 10 BTC skeptics get on the BTC bus. And I cannot lie...it is all due to the fact I carry my all black btc CryptoCard with me. 
I digress...excellent product, great customer service...highly recommended. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:33:05
Hellz no you aren't. As soon as btc dropped to 550, I started buying coins like I was ProTraderJoe. My entire tax return went into btc via Coinbase. This year Uncle Sam's money is not going back into his economy. It's going into the New World Order's economy. Godspeed brother! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:29:34
So you've purchased coin within the past 12 months, and this is the first time they've requested additional verification/proof of income? 
If that's the case, it sounds like they may have been one of the exchanges that were recently subpoenaed. CYA mode. 
*pure speculation*
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:58:49
Amen brother. And buying!

I dontated BTC to them back in July in order to support their efforts and get in early on a beta testing account. Very satisfied with their service! 
My goal is to migrate from Gmail to Protonmail permanantly by the end of the year. A daunting task considering that I have had the same Gmail address since they opened Google Mail beta in 2004. I have so much email just sitting there on Google servers (which is also stored on the NSA servers in Utah) and god knows where else at this point.
Can't wait to nuke that Google account. Protonmail now accepts .com versions of your email as well...so it doesn't stick out as much as the .ch would to some of your contacts.
