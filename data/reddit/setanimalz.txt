Did Zimbabwe give citizens 1k as part of a comprehensive plan? Never in that response did I say it was exactly the right thing and has to happen. But since you are clearly someone who knows an incredible amount, please tell is exactly how to solve this and how you know for sure 100% that this idea could never work.. ty!

I assume they’re going to just hand it out to all of us right guys? Personal checks?!? RIGHT???

30 day extension to exit stage left en route to island in the middle of the sea?

Interesting ty for the info!

Like the way you think sir.

Nope. Certainly not based on a comparison to Petro coin. Lol.

The more that start to do this the better. Those that control the means of production can have a huge effect if they decide to only sell via bitcoin. In this case with art - if great artists require it, more people will learn about it. I’m in music and while difficult to do, working towards being paid out in bitcoin when possible.

Sure but you don’t set the price or decide what money you accept for the new Ford F-150. You can decide whether you want to work for that company. Sorta kinda “means of production.”

Exactly this. Obfuscation.  It’s never about the actual issue at hand.
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:00:40
Lol. Seen that before.

Agreed the more financial crises pop up worldwide, the more alternatives start to make sense. Not sure that’s the best way for it to happen - but maybe it’s just the way it has to be.

Endless “rescue missions” fml...

Guess “control the market from production to sale” would be lil more clear.

Heres what I wish I had done at the start.  Download the Delta Crypto app, start reading and learning about projects.  Enter in values of what you think you would want to invest and when and then spend a few months seeing how it works and how the market moves.  Could even represent the values with very small amounts of money to start.  But I wish I had done that and spent time learning about all the different projects, ways to invest, etc rather than just jumping in straight away with funds.  I eventually learned - but it was scary at first with a size-able initial investment.

Enough that I would feel really terrible if it all went away...  Lol.  I invest in small up and coming projects quite a bit though.  "Shitcoiner" as they say.  But its just what I enjoy.  Some love trading straight up.  Just not my favorite although I do some with BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:16:52
Before the Jan run I was doing just spot buys from coinbase - small amounts too.  TBH if I woulda just stuck with that and upped the amounts more and more probably would have much more.  BUT again - its about what you enjoy in my opinion.  I am one who believes there are folks out there building really interesting new tech.  Lots believe its all a scam.  To each their own.

Missed a crash? Confused it’s up on the year.
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:55:56
Why on earth would this be a good idea? Or we just talking for lolz?
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:54:30
This would be lovely.  Legit curious to see how the 1k idea plays out.  Should be interesting - some smart folks think its not a terrible idea.  We shall see. Guess the scale could change things significantly though.
@_date: 2019-09-15 20:30:25
Read this  then think about what it means to truly control your money. You and only you.

Folks then he represents something he really doesn’t. The Big Con. Go vote.
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:03:27
Is this just a statement or you have some facts/data to back this up?
