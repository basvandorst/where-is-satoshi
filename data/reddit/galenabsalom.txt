Not to mention alot of people will just keep crypto in the banks like they do fiat today.

You come of as a very aggressive and angry person. I think you need some reflection on why this get you so worked up. They are carrying a good argument, you're just coming of as shouting and screaming.

Why do people suddenly seem to refer to bitcoin as bitcoin core? Ive seen it referenced as that on the bitcoin twitter, which obviously is controlled by a bcash fan.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:50:01
Thats not how i read it. Bcash is just a forked alt coin the same as bitcoin diamond, bitcoin clashic, bitcoin gold etc.

I keep about 40 to 50 percent in btc

Well, I just baught lodging and a flight to japan with bitcoin. Crypto probably will stay online mostly, it will take a long while untill any kind of mainstream adoption by physical stores. When that happens it will probably be some other company in the cryptosphere.

BTC is not the only cryptocurrency. Its extremly likely something else will end up as the means of payment, while bitcoin will become more like gold. You buy it and put it under your "bed" for later, basically it will be the entry point to and safest place to store large values on the internet. Bitcoin does not have to become a means of payment, it's enough that one of several of the others become that. Coins that is specifically made to be efficient and cheap to pay with.
Bitcoins current value is trust. People trust that a hacker won't just pry open the blockchain and siphon of money. If your going to store millions in emerging tech this is important.

I hedged my bets and built a mining setup, that will generate me around 3 btc per year. If things crash and burn, at least I will be the owner of 10k usd worth of computer hardware.

I will be selling part of what I make, and I won't be keeping cards for 5 years. I will invest some of the bitcoin into expanding my operation. If I can grow it far enaugh, and the marked stays relatively ok its possible to actually live of if you have enaugh invested. I suspect i will sell and replace with newer better cards around every 1 to 1.5 years. There should be a sweet spot, before the value start dropping off fast.  Gpus do not lose value very fast anymore. It has to be thought of more as a business. Income, return of investment, expenses, power costs etc. It's more profitable than buying if bitcoin stagnate or grow slowly for a while. Lower risk since I can always recover some of the investments through the sale of the equipment.
There is also the hobby factor for a computer engineer like myself. Running a machine with 13 gpus come with its own unique challenges. Going to 25 gpus over black Friday, and that should generate around 1800 usd in bitcoin per month, at an investment of 15000. From a business perspective, that's a pretty good deal. That's another 1800 a month spending money, and I'm aware of the risk but I can chose to convert into usd every month and lower it. I personally chose to gamble on bitcoin succeeding. I can afford to lose the investment, and the upside if bitcoin gets adopted more mainstream is giantic. In 10 years I would regret not investing if bitcoin explodes, more than losing the investment if it crashes. The upside is early retirement, the realistic worst-case downside is losing half my investments in computer equipment.

Nah I mine with a service called nicehash. I mine alt coins but get payed in btc, my earnings depend a lot on how strong alt coins are in relation to btc.
It keep making sense to mine as long as a few factors, like cheap power and modern efficient hardware is in place. Mining in essence is like a business with supply and demand, not to mention running costs. If you have have the the earlier mentioned things, mining is going to be profitable. If it wasn't people with expensive electricity or old equipment would turn it off, and then the miners who stick it out would take a larger piece of the pie making it profitable again.

Around 0.08 usd per kwh, and I've calculated for power costs. But yes, I have very cheap power.
At a stable bitcoin price, power would be maximum 25 percent of my earnings.
My gpus is powered by gravity. Specifically waterfalls and high altitude lakes.

I can't remember ever learning that "communism almost took over the world" and I grew up pretty close to Soviet union and was alive when it fell. That sound like propaganda.
Similar notions I think when Norway, a highly capitalistic society gets called socialist, because of a well functioning welfare system and universal healthcare.

Probably just another pump, it will go back into a slow decline again soon enough is my suspicion.

Gas isn't available through pipes in many places. Most places probably. I don't know a single person who use gas for anything except outdoor cooking sets. I have no clue how to even get gas if i wanted some. And we produce it as a country.

Why? I do not buy the argument "because it always were". It could be replaced, just like gold replaced what was used before it.

Some people will lose so much money in crypto. It's a tech product that people clueless about tech invest in.

I'm fascinated with the fact that people still use cheques in the US. The last time we used that here was in.. the 80s?
And 80 percent increase from the bottom.. in a week isn't fast enough? ;)

Ah did not know. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:04:55
Let it be a lesson. :) Do your research, properly and on your own before investing. Crypto is absolutely packed full of scams.

It's not an opinion it's a statement, it may or may not hold true.

If I were to keep Bitcoin online, Coinbase would be my choice. I refuse to believe anyone is safer. Of course personal cold storage is better..
I heard they keep 98 percent of their funds in cold storage and the rest is insured.

I have read it actually. Does not change the fact that communism did not almost take over the world. Sometimes the anti-comminism sentiment out if the US is at an almost religious fear level. It's pretty obvious there have been a HUGE amount of anti-communism propaganda in the US in the 50s up until the 80s.
This propaganda is probably also to blame for the large resistance to universal healthcare as an example, since it's seen as "socialist". 
There is a completely different narrative in the US, compared to everywhere in the rest of the world I've been when it comes to communism. 
I'm from Norway, so we were very close to the action. Americans tend to view us as socialist. We are not:). Anyways don't have time for a deep philosophical discussion on the merits and downfalls of capitalism right now.

Many people surprisingly. I've met enough people who basically don't follow news what do ever. They are intelligent people, they just don't watch tv and they don't read newspapers. They live completely separate from popular culture and media, usually with the exception of music.

15-16 will probably be more like the absolute max when all btc have been digged out. I would be shocked if millions wasn't lost or forgotten in the early days.
These days people leave a few satoshis in some wallet, eventually they will regret it ;)
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:50:44
That wont really be an option in my opinion. It will be integrated into everything and blockchain will be backbone of all money movement. People may or may not use Bitcoin though, more likely they will use CryptoDollars or CryptoEuro. 
If you chose to use Bitcoin that will be fine aswell. You just swipe your phone and instant convertion will happen to the accepted currency.
Average Joe won't use Bitcoin until it's integrated and user-friendly. When they don't notice the difference between the current system and the new.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:52:26
The max is actually much lower than 21 million if you consider the millions of lost/locked Bitcoin. People who mined thousands when Bitcoin was new and unknown, then just forgot the password or lost the file.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:55:58
It could be five or fifty trillion, but his general sentiment is correct. More value means less volatility. A much more valuable Bitcoin will eventually stabilize and follow the larger economic trends.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:20:40
Yep, that's Bitcoin for you;)

Thats a problem that can be solved.

You don't have to inflate, but you can stop coins from being lost. Better wallets, interfaces and storage solutions.
