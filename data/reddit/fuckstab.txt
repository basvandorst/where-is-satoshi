Generally collective movements are not some voted in governing body but are crowd-sourced or take place on squatted land. That is why it is opt-in, no one forcing to take part but maybe can set an example to others in a different way to operate societies within a boundaries of a capitalist world. Catalunya for example provided a good example of a well functioning anarchist sociliast society during the Franco civil war and all achieved while fighting... The kurds at the moment are practicing a well functioning form of anarchist socialism. Its a shameful and often exploted truth that its often takes war to make people realise the importance of pulling together.

Thanks I'll give that a listen later. Don't understand atm why a society where everyone is just making money out running machines is necessary going to be a good thing. Sounds like it would be massively unequal. The bitcoin mining I get, cos it incetivises a network capable of a whole host of free applications.

What are you talking about non profits don't exist? Collectives and non-profits exist all over the place...

Huh, I'm an anti-statist and believe in the direct-democractic collective worker based collectives. I'm not trying to bend anybody unwillingly to my will, it is opt-in.. Also I advocate polycentric law systems to empower national and local communities to be-spoke design thier own frameworks.

Reducing law enforcement to being a privatised industry is incredibly dangerous. As can be witnessed with the ridiculous situation in the USA. Making punishing crime profitable seems counter productive and will again allow private armies in an anarchist society.. It should be organised at a local level, democratically and transparently, in my opinion... Can use polycentric law as basis.

I worked with a guy who was almost sixty and was forced to take a labouring job on a building site on "back to work" scheme and was given around £20 a week plus food/travel costs, while I earned £1300+ a month doing same job. He was forced to take this our be kicked out of his home and loose his benefits. Needless to stay he did his months of hard labour and they didn't offer to take him on but just hired another "back to work" schemer. Pretty accurately describes a wage-slave I think. And he's far from the worst off... Not sure what world your living in!

Please explain how you can compare yourself to a slave under this system? And remember this is system built in mind of freeing people from being shackled in a wage-slave society...

But your wrong, there is an easy fix today, it is called socialism. Might not benefit you but would have fixed his problems..

Please educate me, that's why I'm posting here. I'm not pretending to be an expert, looking for open dialogue...

Like I said, collective communites are opt-in so your not forced to pay taxes if you don't want to participate, just charged a premium for any rendered services. But out of interest what is your solution for keeping the roads in good condition for everybody? Or do you only care about you? Cos that's the impression I get.

Thats just idiotic rambling. You realise there needs to be rules and methods of punishment for socialists and capitalist societies right? I'm not advocating jail but stating obvious... Regarding tax collection, I don't know best funding methods but collective communities are opt-in, so I guess would just kick you out and require you to pay premium for any services you wish to render.
