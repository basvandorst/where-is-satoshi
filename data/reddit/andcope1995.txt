Credit cards will always be easier to use than Bitcoins however bitcoins are like cash, they should be harder to deal with since you have more anonymity, also I just say look at target and the credit card virus.... That's called real damage nor Mt.  Got going down, it's unstable and volatile wait 5 years

That is the problem people are living above there means since they have a lot of credit.
If there is a million dollars in circulation and I give all that money to one man and tell that man to pay me interest.... It would be impossible for him to pay me back since there isn't that much money in circulation

I would say just buy some

We are supposed to keep track of every dollar we aquire and spend so it is not much different.

People ruin their own lives financially, if they over use there credit card and don't have the money, they get debt... Its pretty simple

It depends if they can purchase there raw resources with Bitcoin, then they could use Bitcoin for there expenses and also accept Bitcoins for revenue.

They do when it is recorded through credit cards and PayPal. Cash is easier to hide and so is Bitcoin.

I don't believe in forcing merchants to use btc but if you go to any small business and ask them if they would be interested in a way to electronicly transferring value, with a very low transaction fee. Almost every single one will be in favor with you most merchants pay fees to CC company ranging from 1 to 7%.

You can easily just use one market. Go to your transactions that you have made using your wallet copy down the dates and amount then you would need to go to the market graph go to the same day and see the price of bitcoins for that day.
