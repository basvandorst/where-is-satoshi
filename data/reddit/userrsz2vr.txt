It’s foolish to stick to 1MB block size for political reasons. Block size should be dynamically adjusted so capacity adjusts per traffic; traffic isn’t simply magically created. SegWit etc are fine too but block size is a core protocol parameter that can also do with fixing.
This whole BCH vs BTC argument is looking very silly for both sides and is hurting the overall crypto market progress.

Coinbase has a $10K limit :(

LN != BTC nor should be a crutch to keep BTC from scaling. Improve BTC *and* let LN or BCH or &lt;whatever&gt; try to fix issues.

What a load of fluff! He doesn’t address the specific question. He talks of _optimizing consumption_ of X Watts of electricity. He doesn’t address why it’s X Watts to begin or how we can reach X/100 Watts.

Your wife is sweet but if you’re in that financial situation, investing in bitcoin isn’t recommended.

Whoever made that meme doesn’t understand that all exchanges are regulated in the US. Please grow up and stop being a child.

No, I like BCH and BTC. Why should one pick sides like it’s a stupid religion?

It stops when balanced with transaction volume and other system tweaks

Those questions matter only if there is any willingness to improve than simply dig heels in due to “but the other guys”. 
If you’re looking for adjustment parameters, you will have to perform system simulations. Just like we do in almost every other system. But if you’re looking to spitball some figures, we could half the difficulty interval, interleave it with blocksize doubling/halfing.  
“Satoshi” was awesome in designing the original system but the system today is a lot more evolved than then. More work is needed but I see more people getting lazy and political than doing productive improvements.

Without losing anonymity, you and billions of people use crypto I/my company architected everyday. But even if that weren’t the case, you are foolishly being distracted away from the core merits of my point into unproductive pettiness. 
Normally I’d ignore but - holidays! Good luck in life

Coinbase said in Sept they’d support BCH by Jan 2018.

Is there s reason you’re trying to make this about me?

I get your message BUT ... we do have the “private key” to dollars. You have everything needed on the dollar to spend it :)
