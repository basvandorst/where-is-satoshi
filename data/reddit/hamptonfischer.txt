check to see if you used a credit card. my friend did the same thing with his debit card and they charged him 15%

price is a comparison between two assets. a backed coin would be tradable for only bitcoin... price fluctuations wouldnt be an issue.
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:51:57
better to not rely on one stable coin
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:51:24
There's no point in buying it with USD, only to transfer between exchanges etc
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:50:12
GUSD would function the same as digital cash - gemini wouldn't be able to restrict it's flow and use only peg to USD
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:52:45
that is probably the biggest concern. I want to make a physical manifestation of bitcoin in some way or another - the problem, of course, is that if it includes private keys, I (or another 3rd party) would have to create them with trust involved - on top of that, there's no way to actually validate the value unless you look at the private key yourself... which again opens up more of a security risk if you plan on passing the coin on to someone else. If I assume all the "trust" and place the value in those extremely difficult to reproduce strips the physical coin can be validated and have confirmed value - providing of course that I am a trusted 3rd party... 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:21:17
probably not, but now you'll be able to move dollars around like crypto and not have to rely on tether... 
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:19:46
its redeemable when you send it back, I wouldnt want coins to be floating around that are "empty"

It's a good idea for micropayments... I'd use it as long as the fiduciary has liquidity and remains backed.

you can, just price the equities and BTC against the same currency

lending fees still at 15%? lower those!

Same thing on apple stocks. I guess they forgot to add the forth decimal place lol only reads 002.00 not 1002.00 haha

Thats a really good point, The ability of the this tech for other means hasn't fully surfaced into the mainstream. A logo that doesn't only represent asset transaction but also the network as a whole would be ideal.

From my understanding it would only come onto blockchain after first transaction with public key. Wallets can be generated offline therefore wouldn't show until a transaction was signed.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:52:37
now intrest rates are going to bump up, making $security even more uncertain..

Andreas M. Antonopoulos said something similar. In the case of that happening, "people would lean to memorize seeds" lol

Yep... depending orbit locations it varies. At some points mars is closer to earth and sometimes the sun can be between earth and mars. Just using 8min as an "average" 
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:06:29
FOOD FOR THOUGHT: If I'm planning a trip to mars, how would I buy MarsCoin while on Earth, and/or if I'm on mars trade my EarthCoin for MarsCoin. How would these alternative currencies function for means of trade.... If that makes sense..:)

It's a conversation for mainstream adoption. bitcoin as a "cash" system is something that many are uncomfortable with as keys can be easily lost or stolen due to hacking. Large banking institutions that hold bitcoin securely in cold storage could send backed bitcoin certificates without having to verify on blockchain and have unlimited transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:45:31
I bought in the 200 range bought in 400 range and buy in the 600 range.... people thought price was inflated when it went from 20 to 80... bitcoin unlike a stock isnt tied to production or or financial bottom line. There's no telling is actually an inflated price.... it's a commodity. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:44:01
fractional reserving isn't necessarily a problem... banks will serve in there best interest to preserve their presence in the case of a bank rush. The problem I see, is that many if not all of these major institutions are backed by the government allowing them to loan (fractionally reserve) more then they normally would without that backing - causing credit build ups or bubbles. Banks don't counterfeit, they simply provide credit with the backing of those who choose to give them in interest free loan (deposits).
@_date: 2016-12-12 05:52:28
Thanks for the response, but if I were to loose the Trezor (hypothetically) and still kept the seeds or vice versa, would I still have access to the funds?
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:53:57
bitcoin as a market cap is still in the 10B range. making it incredibly UNDERVALUED oppose to other commodities/currencies.

Socialists and dems like bitcoin because the current banking system supports corp America and wars and propitiates wealth gap. Theres room for everybody in btc - which raises the value;)

if we knew that was coming again the price would be higher

you wont be getting any bitcoin off the exchange if your concerned with getting your BTC gold if thats what your thinking..
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:55:35
First off, welcome to the community! When it comes to forks every exchange is different. From what I've heard coinbase will give you the forked coin after they received a considerable backlash after they denied their customers bitcoin cash. I wouldnt worry about it too much, the most important thing for you to make sure you suck every penny out of your investment is to get a hardware wallet like keep key and Trezor - and ALWAYS keep your old recovery codes so if there is ever a fork that didn't get mainstream attention you can go back and claim your account if you had a considerable balance at the time of the fork. There's an old saying in bitcoin "your keys your money, not your keys not your money!" 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:52:59
lol theres an app for that
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:49:28

@_date: 2017-07-14 03:59:47
why would anyone wait to buy in?
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:37:04
^ this. Don't try to wait for a dip; you'll wait forever or buy too soon. Not only that, you'll have a "buy in price" stuck in your mind dictating your investment "success" as a distraction. Dollar cost average - buy small amounts every week or so for extended periods of time. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:45:08
where is the Bitcoin Cash that that coinbase receives going to go? It would be interesting to track it....

The private key is glued face first to the back of the QR code you see here which is the public key. The device itself as whole is the cold storage. The private key can only be accessed if you cut off the border - destroying the work
