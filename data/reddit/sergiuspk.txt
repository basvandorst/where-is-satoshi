No, people buying it are doing so because they hope to get back double by this time next year. _No one_ can guarantee that. Charts showing a trend are OK if you are an experienced trader and know the risks.
The fact that it kept rising does not mean it will continue to do so, not because of market mechanics but because people might start to be more cautious.
This drop was due to people needing cash for the holidays. Pretty easy to spend $1000 you did not have a month ago on a brand new TV when all you had to do for it was wait on an investment.
Problem is so many people wanted to sell and so few to buy that the price naturally went down. The fact that it went down so much means people were OK with selling even at 13k down from 19k because they all started from an even smaller investment.
All of this means it is a _very_ unstable investment. Anyone putting money into it because they think it's they way to make it a viable currency is wrong.
This is not a currency and will never be one because for it to become one all the people hoping for a huge return (using it for short term risky investments) would need to stop using it. And the only reason they'd stop would be if trust in it would be destroyed. When that happens it will take down _any_ credibility it ever had or ever hoped to have and the chance of it becoming a currency.
