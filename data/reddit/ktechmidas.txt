Technically you could just type "passwd root" and get two people to enter half the password each, as long as one person doesn't know the other persons half it requires two.

It doesn't, people are finding any reason they can to blame. Chinese New Year is also 16th Feb, more than 3 weeks, so the OP is entirely wrong.

I use them all the time as well, really quick to get money between 3 currencies.

No he was not, BCC (Bitconnect) and BCH (Bitcoin Cash) are very different things. Some exchanges list BCH under a BCC ticker instead.
Bitcoin Cash is just a fork of Bitcoin from a year-long argument over where the consensus was on increasing block size/segwit/LN. Lots of politics between the two, and lots of hate for Roger, but he wasn't the cause of Bitconnect. All crypto is down right now, including BCH.

A lot of trades, trusted and verified with local bitcoins, seems good to me. Just be aware his language is Simplified Chinese according to his profile but his reviews are in English and he's selling in USD so he probably speaks some English anyway.
The price however is a bit high....

It's overpriced but it doesn't cause cancer....

500 BTC in early 2017 would have still been 500k USD, no?
You got massively overcharged for that one, usually it was a few BTC and they'd decrypt it.

He only paid 29 sat/b.... it's possible the transaction will be cancelled in the next week or two.

Just use localbitcoins, make sure the trader you're dealing with has been on the site for a long time and has done a lot of volume and trades with no negative feedback.
Think about it, why would guy doing 100+ bitcoin trades per day throw his reputation away for a tiny bit from a kid? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:37:33
It would be the sender that needs to do that though, right?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:36:55
Uhm... no
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:41:59
Well if it drops from the mempool it means the sender has to send it again with a higher fee, it's unconfirmed and can easily be reversed before then though.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:58:54
Dash doesn't want their crypto confused with all this Bitcoin shit going on right now.

The fees depend on the network... you can pay whatever you want, some wallets will pay it for you/not let you worry about it. If you're putting it into your own wallet you'll be responsible.

I tried to buy pizza for Bitcoin in 2011, there was a small independent pizza shop in my town that were offering 30% off if you bought with BTC.
Bought the BTC but never got the phone app to work properly, so ended up paying in cash and having thousands of BTC. Only heard of it again in 2014... god only knows what happened to that BTC.

Don't do it now, you'll pay $10 in fees. Wait a few days
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:52
Was looking at the TenX card... figured I'd put some BTC in, saw the fees and current backlog and figured "Maybe I can wait a few days.."

OP this is the ticket to send, word for word. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:33:55
Dash has instant send, which is literally an instant transaction... 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:44:09
Do you have the address you sent to at CB or a transaction ID? You can look those up on a Block Explorer and see if it was sent to CB. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:22:31
I'd be worried about paying 20 cents in case it gets stuck in the mempool... how many blocks are you waiting with a 20c fee?!

@_date: 2017-02-15 02:20:24
A lot more, that's my point. Not exactly sure how much but certainly a lot more since I bought into Genesis while BTC was at $300 each.
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:46:25
It did give me return on investment, but only because BTC went up in price. You're correct, it's safer to just buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:42:05
I invested $50.... it's still giving me very small change back, but I think I am one of the lucky ones.

openssl, literally the thing most of the internet runs on. Multiple issues have been found over the past few years.
This is the biggest issue of the last few years, but it was "only" unpatched for two years: 
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:22:29
They've already restricted deposits and withdrawals in BTC, you cannot withdraw or deposit into the Pro account without emailing them (BTCC at least) and then it's one hell of a lengthy process.
God knows what's next, just got to wait for it all to settle down I suppose.
@_date: 2017-02-16 09:36:04
It's actually still quite easy to spot trade, which is what most people will do. You can still deposit BTC and CNY and switch between both without too much hassle.
It's the trading on the Pro exchange that's quite difficult at the moment.
@_date: 2016-03-19 23:18:47
how much do you need to set up shop realisticly? I have an account that has a reasonable volume just because its the best way to get money from my home country to where i am now. I'm thinking I could set up shop in both countries but I don't know how much I will need behind me.
@_date: 2016-03-19 23:07:30
how do they force that?
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:03:53
It's here, I see it. It was probably caught by the spam filter to start with because you're a new user.
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:47:02
Chinese exchanges are very undesirable at the moment due to not knowing if we can withdraw or what other regulations will be put in place by PBOC.

Obligatory:

Because the seller can very easily note down the keypair before sending and wait until a lot of money goes on a card then swipe it?

Take a better look at that attack, it only runs if you pipe it to shell. If you just curl and examine it looks okay. Very clever attack, and I bet there are much more like it that aren't published.

I consider my girlfriend my partner, we okay most big purchases with each other beforehand, she can usually find me something of better value anyway. Most of the money goes towards household stuff, rent, savings, dates, movies etc. 
If I had 5 or 6 figures sitting in a bank account then contracts are probably needed. But the amount we have is enough to get by for the two of us and we work as a team.
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:47:18
For shame on any bitcoin company promoting this type of thing
@_date: 2016-11-05 17:14:53
You could use a selection of traders on localbitcoins, find a few well trusted traders and buy maybe $2000 from each - it will take you an hour or two but at least you can get it all done in a day.
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:37:17
But my point is most people won't, any reseller can easily add some "aftermarket" firmware and no-one would be any the wiser.

Heh, I next heard of Bitcoin when it was $200 per coin. I tore my room apart, family helped. Found 5 USB sticks, none of them had the wallet.
Now I serve as a lesson, for those buying now, keep your damn BTC safe until it goes $1mil!

Due to the fact there are many, many cryptolocker/cryptowall variants - we aren't sure. Do you have the original email headers and site it's sending you to? Is the file something like HELP-DECRYPT.TXT ?

Yeah, that's the bit that I'm stuck with. Where can I buy in China? Once I have BTC I think I can get it to the bank account from there. 
There are a lot of scams in China that I really don't want to fall victim to.

I still like to think he was a middle aged Japanese man, fed up of working long hours that Japan puts on you and wanted to create something that was brilliant like he was told he could when he was younger.
It wasn't the riches he wanted, it was just to show the world that he was more than the system makes him out to be, selling his abilities for a small living and some luxuries.
Once he was happy with the creation he passed it onto others and faded away back to the grind, knowing that he changed the world. And that was all he needed.

"Dip" and "Holy fucking crash" are not the same.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:47:24
Sure, but that's very different to buying a volatile asset. Good for the banks who have put a stop to this, a lot of people jumped on the train in December, and some in the "buy the dip" phase in January. 
A significant amount of them will have paid with credit card because a lot of Americans don't even own a debit card. I bet over the next few months the banks are going to have a lot of people defaulting as we realise this is not a short term dip, and they know it.
