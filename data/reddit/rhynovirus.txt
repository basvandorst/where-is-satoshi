I want to buy Bitcoin but I am terrified of all the horror stories of people losing large amount of money when ordering BTC. I also don't understand how to store my bitcoin safely. Help!

People smart enough to use bitcoin are the same people who can find unlimited free porn online.
Bitcoin needs a major retailer to back it, someone like Amazon.

Is this handled automatically by the blockchain? What would be an inciting event? Also, doesn't this imply that the effective circulating volume of BTC is really unlimited, like any other fiat currency? What would keep some governing body from "Increasing BTC divisibility" like the Fed "Issues new currency" now?

I wonder if there's a way to estimate the amount of orphaned BTC.

Hey Wikipedia, if your mods weren't antisocial bureaucrat nerds who are so invested in their little online cult that normal users can't fix articles that are just plain wrong, maybe you'd get the donations you're after.

Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin that you can avoid things like this? WTF?
I'm sorry this happened to you.

These two things are incompatible.

Because we are in a bubble.

I'm a long time BTC supporter, I'm just not that interested in the computer science aspect of it. I'm grateful when people are actually nice enough to discuss these topics.
