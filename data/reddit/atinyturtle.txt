16.8k AUD. Crazy stuff

No one wants to lose anything. I wouldn't have made any gains if I buy more than I was willing to lose. It's a scary game.

Same things here, couple months of mining for nothing
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:55
1 month in crypto is like 10 years in real life
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:55
It certainly isn't helping my already shit mood..

I was gonna mine but they said something like it would probably take a whole month to mine a BTC. Rip 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:06:07
fair point 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:39
BTC and POWR were my first, feels good man. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:22:41
Insane, that's like 500% gains in a year!! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:30:12
Looked at POWR?

I just reached the same milestone as a student :D 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:05:37
It's over $9000!!

Need job to buy bitcoin m8 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:48:33
It's about to hit $9000AUD. You can probably just add a kangaroo or flip it upside down if you want to cash in early

Unfortunately doesn't seem to promote unbiased information. It can only be gumdrops and rainbows..

RemindMe! 6 months
What regret will I feel? Did I buy too much or too little?
