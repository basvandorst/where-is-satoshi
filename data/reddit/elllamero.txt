You are right, it was 4 weeks ago not 3 weeks ago, anyway my sentence still stands. It's not a 6 week low (And im talking about the price at GDAX)

You don't have to attack bitcoin network to make this dump happen. Bitcoin is a speculative trashcoin which bloomed like hell cause of forks earlier this year, and now got overpumped just to get dumped. Bitcoin can not stand a chance with 10 min blocktime and 1 MB blocks, it's just not enought for a currency. And no you CAN NOT call cryptocurrency a store of value like GOLD, since gold is being used as a jewlery, in electronics while bitcoin beside being a currency is just useless, and the limited amount of them will never make up for it being useless. Peace and love boys.

I wonder why are we calling clugged mempool an "attack", it's just a failure of the coin, and if bitcoin can not be a currency it will share a story of IE as webbrowser, it will just be forgotten :(

It's actually pretty easy, just go to bitcoin/other open source crypto github, press fork in right corner, change some random values (or don't if u are lazy) and then you got a brand new crypto.

Tbh i said it as a joke, but if u can see its kinda simple. Just look at Bitcoin gold as example, they litteraly paid others to help them to make it work, their main dev did nothing, and they are filthy rich because people are going nuts for everything that contains Bitcoin in it's name LUL

You don't seem to be pretty smart boy. Let me ilustrate it to you, if u would have 237m of worthless tether trash right now and and went over to lets say bittrex. And then using less then 10m of those tether trashes u could increase BTC/UDST price there to over 10k tethers per BTC, which would increase marketcap by 2k$ per btc, so by 34bn overall. So if i were you i wouldn't talk about logic, when you arguments makes no sence.

Nah, it's all because less and less people are using it. If you check  you can see for yourself that there is only 180k transactions in last 24h. It was about 350k in december, and bitcoin blockchain couldn't handle more, therefore we had massive fees, long confirmation times. So yeah bitcoin is fast and cheap when amount of transations per 24h halved.
EDIT: Just see for yourself  :)
As you can see, amount of transaction is as low as it was just before bitcoin cash fork. And if you want to find another day with that low amount of transactions it is in March'16. So basicly bitcoin is not going into the right direction which should be adoption :)
