Trying to move funds.  I did a sell using Gemini, it has the proper amount listed in 'account value', but the cash value seems to have disappeared.  Requests for support seemingly go unanswered.
I'm really starting to tire of this nonsense.

Thanks!  I'll give them a try.
Do you use them for your wallet as well?

Actually, I opened several accounts, have debit cards for each, and have two accounts that have very low balances until I need to pay a bill.  In that way, if someone gets the numbers, the most they could usually steal would be less than $25.  I figure I'll just use one of them for purchases.

It’s been more than a year, but no, I wasn’t required to show anything to make the deposits.

I’ve used one in Orlando, and it reads the barcode on your phone, put the cash in and almost instantly it shows in your account.  It’s pretty expensive to do, but to get an account started it can’t be beat!

When I started last year I went to local ATM.  It worked quickly and seamlessly but good LORD!  I paid through the nose for it!

That doesn't bode well for the site!  It's one thing when the site is setting new highs but what will they do when the market faces a free fall?

I was advised (wisely. It appears) to not keep my bitcoin in the same place as I trade.

There's a saying among stockbrokers:  there are two and only two economists who know what the market will do tomorrow, but you shouldn't listen to them...they NEVER agree.

If your account is making it, why not?
Look, if you're paying bills out of your checking account you're guaranteed a loss.  Even with the anemic economy in the US over these last 8-10 years if your checking is free but is paying 0% interest, you're getting creamed even at 1% inflation!  When Bitcoin tips over, either go to cash or ride it out and go back to the checking account to pay bills.

Think of it as a kid walking upstairs tossing a baseball up and down.  Don't watch the baseball...it'll make you crazy.  Watch where the kid is on the flight of stairs.

You know, I initially set up a bit stamp account, but read too many complaints about it.  Maybe time to revisit.

Take away all of the daily sturm und drang and what have you got?  You're left with a system that's brilliant (for lack of a better word!) and ultimately timely.  A system that can't NOT work!  
What I fear however are existential threats like crime (and believe it or not I think it's a minor threat) and government intervention.  
Face it guys...if cryptocurrency ever goes mainstream, the US dollar is in serious jeopardy, along with every major currency around the world.  Do you really see the Fed sitting on its hands watching?  For the moment, just getting set up to buy and store the currency is a major chore to the average Joe and Jill.  But the day that someone starts a call in service to help these people, watch out (any entrepreneurs watching?  Charge a monthly fee, in bitcoin of course, and help ordinary folks navigate the minefield.)!
But to the point, when it starts to look like it's heading somewhat mainstream, state sponsored hacking will begin in earnest.

I'm having problems getting it to work and it is apparently approved in my state.

Do you have personal experience with Gemini?  I've been trying all day to get it up and running.  So far I've heard nothing back from their tech support.  Now I do realize that they're facing heavy demand, but that's specifically what they should have designed their platforms for.

I've signed up for Gemini and am waiting for verification of ID.  At the end of the day if they're as bad as Coinbase, I might have to leave what I've got in my wallet and just wait for some company to come along and get this figured out.  I've been trying to dollar cost average in now when volatility is my friend, but this is getting ridiculous.

Thanks!  
I started to set up with them a couple of months ago, but the verification was the hold up as I recall.  I think it's time to revisit...I've had it with CoinBase problems.  It's almost every time I want to place a buy, and I'm trying to DCA.  As a result, it's the same BS every week!
