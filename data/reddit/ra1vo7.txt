I can relate. I don't have much on bitcoin, just side money that i expect to vanish any moment, and I will not be ruined if it happens. But once it helped me to feed my family for a couple of weeks and pay for gas because there was a hold-up with my salary. Only because I had invested - money just slowly growing.
Keep it up, never surrender. Do your thing and believe in it.

 Could put 100 upvotes. Don't EVER try to operate with YOUR money to a wallet of someone ELSE. I pull off simple "hacks" (well its not a hack, just fooling around) to my friends over my own testing website just for lulz, like ooo hahaha so you logged in from there and there, your password is this and this. Simple, basic coding skills. Html, php, sql and voila. 
Don't. Just don't.

Invest responsibly. Yes, might be 30k, might be 100k. But we all know how expectations vs reality usually turns out. In any case you shouldn't invest more than you are ready to lose. IMO these "what are your thoughts" questions in a lot of cases just don't make any sense. 
Anyways, good luck, buddy and hope to see you on the moon.

Wow. Guys have done their homework.

I usually buy at Kraken.  Most of the time prices were lower there, worked for me. Pretty nice for a FIAT-crypto exchange.

Well... I don't actually think, it's a bad idea. Of course, you'd be better off with a hardware wallet, and now as I understand eith Ledger Nano X it just got way more easier to access your crypto from your phone.
And, for example: when you buy bitcoin in, let's say, Kraken, where it is fairly easy to do, they don't take that much of a fee as Revolut. You buy bitcoin in Revolut, and on that transaction you sprnd like 6 something euros. That means you already have not 200ish, but 194ish euros worth of bitcoin. In Kraken you would have more. 
However: Revolut is less of a hustle. More user friendly. You cannot send your bitcoin to an external wallet, as in Kraken or Binance or Coinbase (btw a good option for you too). Your btc is to always stay in your Revolut.
Just figure out your priorities. I'd definitely put my btc into a Ledger (surprise, surprise, already done) just for the sole purpose of not panic selling everything when there's a minor dip. A bit more security and definitely a lot more discipline.
Hope that helps a bit. Cheers, mate, and a happy new year!!

Get a hardware wallet, like ledger nano s. Too lazy to connect via usb, have to send to exchange, then convert to fiat - just too much of a hustle.
Buy it and leave it there. Adds a bit of discipline.
