Thank you such a helpful reply. I’ve got some work to do now!
I’m interested, for sure. And I’m trying to build a worthy foundation to build upon. 
So, thank you again.

Got it, that is helpful.  But....
How about early days. Say, day 2, when it was nothing. Nothing more than a spec of dirt to the government and only a new topic to the fin tech world...why then was the creator not known?
Just having a hard time getting much time or energy behind something shrouded in so much mystery.

Fuck right off.  Read the post you ass clown.
PS:  oh shit, I didn't see your user name.  Go jump off the nearest bridge you fucking loser.  WOW!

This guy is what prompted my question. The most recent headline grabbing bitcoin article on a guy who turns out to be a hoax.

Why even comment if you’re not going to make any kind of contribution. Fuck off, you useless homely neckbeard.

I’m not looking for the benefits of being the creator. I’m just curious as to why no one really knows who the creator is.

I’m sorry, didn’t mean to come across as having an opinion. I don’t know shit about shit. But ten minutes of poking around and the word “scam” and “hoax” and the most common things that come up for this guy. 
I’d fucking love to hear more.

Na, I gotcha. And I get it. But don’t tell me there isn’t a part of you and everyone else out there, no matter how tiny it might be, that just wants to know. 
Starting to get the impression it was created on a pillar of anonymity. Almost being one of the primary  objectives. 
Alas, I have much to learn. Thanks for your comments!!

I think you might want to do the same. And consider why an inventor of such a thing would want to remain anonymous. 
Such vague responses are no help. But I appreciate your....”input”.

Ugh, the cringe is high. I’m second hand embarrassed for you lol.
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:31:45
Ugh, figured I’d run into this type of answer eventually haha.

Ah, got it. Thank you.
