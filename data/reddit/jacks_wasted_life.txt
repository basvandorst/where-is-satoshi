traceable by whom?

viewing the ledger and electronically tracing transactions are two different things...

If you think that bitcoin will be more difficult to control than cash, you're fucking naive.

Bitcoin is the brainchild of the NSA.

The control of money is the control of people. Monitoring and manipulating people becomes a lot easier if everyone utilized the blockchain instead of cash...

Then I don't want any part of it and I won't be the only one...

Your first sentence is a false equivalency fallacy. Also, cryptographically secure is also bullshit since most people use shitty passwords...even if people used great passwords the NSA (and others) can still crack them in short order... I got really excited when i first started researching bitcoin but then I paused when I learned that the NSA invented the encryption protocol that bitcoin uses and no one has any real tangible evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto is even a real person... it all seems incredibly sketchy.

silly rabbit, senators don't need to understand economics, they've long ago delegated that responsibility to a banking cartel know as the federal reserve.

30, US Navy submarine vet. I worked with encrypted satcom. I go back to school in the spring for electronics engineering.
