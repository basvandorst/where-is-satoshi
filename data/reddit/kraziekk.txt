Is there anyway to know aproximately what will the value of CME´s futures contract at the expiry date? Or even follow if it is trending up or down? Tried looking at their site, there´s a chart for the futures price that basically follows bitcoin´s own chart. Can someone with better knowledge explain how to they get to its final value ($10,900 on Jan 17th in CBOE´s case)?

Noob question, but I found these Indexes on CME´s website: 
Can we use these numbers as guidelines to the direction where the futures market are going?  I read somewhere that in case of a manipulation, the tendency is for both the market price and the futures price to meet somewhere in between, is that correct?  
If not, what do these indexes mean?
