All I see is " Withdrawal: Amount: 1.92594187 BTC"...I'm assuming OP simply put 1 attempt on there as evidence right? Cuz 1.9 BTC o/a 19 June would equal 13K and some change??
But tough lesson nonetheless.

That particular ref you mention "tutoring" is deemed "illegal" as visa/labor requirements are explicitly identified. Crypto at this point isn't. The regulatory officials simply stated that non-Koreans "cannot", but there is no legal basis for this as crypto has not been identified. Having said that, if you have funds (large funds mind you) constantly transferred into your accts, then yes, you'll most likely attract FIU's attention and they'll prob find a way to deny your extension or something similar, but you can't be arrested unless you are breaking the law (as in breaking the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act in some way shape or form).

What kills me is that taxes are due in April... Folks are confused how to calculate them. Turbotax and HnR block are coming up w different numbers. So naturally folks are waiting to see or seek clarification... Got over 2 mos left and media starts painting a bleak picture already.. Gzuz Fn Christ--opher :X

Agreed in her "protection" stance, but her focus in holding everyone but "yourself" responsible is off imho~

They've never "banned" BTC much less any crypto. They simply stopped the ability for folks to Deposit Fiat which they have since allowed starting 30 JAN 2018. Don't know where your question's headed as you can search the various threads on reddit regarding crypto in korea. I must admit, they FUDD'd the hell outta crypto throughout Dec/Jan, but nonetheless, no "ban" ever surfaced. KYC/AML yes~ and they've basically left it to the banks to regulate themselves or else become regulated after the fact.

Soooooooooooo... We all know the gov't came out and stated non-Koreans will not be allowed to utilize the exchanges under the Real Name Identification, but I assume the burden would be either on the exchanges themselves or the banks. At this time, anyone with an active account can still withdraw funds to their Korean bank accounts previously linked. And~~~ a few exchanges still allow deposits (don't ask why.. bc I ain't askin either)... But if push comes to shove, since they've mandated that non-Koreans are not allowed explicitly, the outlook doesn't look pretty for non-Koreans trading here in Korea.
Basically it would be upon the exchanges to either force someone to withdraw and close their accts, or let em do what they want and the banks report you (non-Korean) to the FIU (Korea's Fincen equiv) and once you get caught up, well... no one knows at this point since that hasn't been reported anywhere.

If legally required, or is part of their business practices, yes.. I agree.. It's a private institution so they can make up rules as they go along, but what got me was the "are you a dual citizen" question in this particular case. If one "was" a dual citizen (US/whatevercountryallowsit) why would BoA care in the legal sense?
