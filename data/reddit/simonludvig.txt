It makes sense if you will be selling/spending all of your bitcoin at once. But if you are planing to do multiple transactions in the future it would most likely be favorable to transfer them at the current low rates.

Probably someone wanting to promote Bitcoin. But I guess you have to ask the person handing you it to know why.

Why couldn't we borrow bitcoin?

11,000x1.01^365 = 415,618
This would be really amazing but not a million.

Well that is your answer then. Instead of borrowing fiat we will borrow crypto. Instead of paying our credit card bill with fiat we will pay it with crypto.
Or did I perhaps miss understand you?

I don't know if this is still a thing. The bulls balls are tied up for the bull to feel more pain and be more aggressive. Bull fighting is a horrible thing that should not be allowed.

Sorry but I do not really understand what you menymt by that.
All of your bitcoin are on the blockchain. The wallets are really umjust a way too access them.

Both actually. The most common thing is that you have to wait for someone else to buy it. But some companies actually buy and sell bitcoin. Take in mind that these generally come with a higher fee.

Lately it has been more profitable to spend all that money on bitcoin directly than on a mine. 
When taking in consideration the cost of electricity, the margins become quite small and it will take a long time to brake even, as the miners aren't exactly cheap.
Therefore a lot of people (me included) would say that it is not affordable anymore.

Store them in a wallet where you control the private keys. Electrum is a good alternative for both cellphone and mobile. Mycelium is also a popular option. On the bitcoin website there are a lot of different options where you can easily see the pros and the cons of them all.

If you don't want to store your bitcoin on a software wallet and the hardware wallets are to expensive, you could look in to creating a paper wallet. This would however only be sufficient if you're planing on not actively trading with them, as a cold storage.

You would pay the same amount as you borrowed + intresset. 
The thing is that if crypto would come to a point where it is used as the main currency, it can't be as volatile as it is right now. For example, If I were to buy a pen for one bitcoin and then went back to the store a week later I would expect the pen to still cost one bitcoin.
Some volatility will always be there but just in a much smaller scale. The same thing goes for all currencies. If you compare the dollar to the euro they will have a different value compared to each other depending on the day. The same principal would go for crypto.

Ah I see. In general your phone is less likely to contain viruses which is a good thing. However it can more easily be lost.
I can recommend andreas antonopoulos videos on YouTube, if you are interested about learning more. He has some good videos on securing your bitcoin, as well as about anything bitcoin related.

I've had no trouble with my payouts. They have had some issues the last month that seams to have been fixed.
I do not think there is a way to get your money back. I guess you have to contact costumer service about that. 
A word of advice, google a company before you spend your money with them not afterwards.
