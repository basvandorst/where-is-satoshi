I haven't done any other transactions within either of my wallets until I figured this out. What could go wrong with executing zapwallettxes? I'm just super afraid of losing my btc lol

I haven't but I just figured it out with some help from google. When I try to do that, it says "Transaction not eligible for abandonment (code -5)"
I didn't get anything meaningful when I googled that.

Ok, I think I feel comfortable with what I'm doing now. Thank you for being so patient and helpful!

One of the wallets I was using claimed to cover fees as part of its transaction? Also every time I've sent bitcoin from my core it's asked for a node fee and I've paid it, although I guess I don't specifically remember that happening this time.

I searched on blockchain.info and it returned [this]( to me. I'm a little geeked out sharing my exact tx. Sorry for the paranoia.

I tried abandontransaction, it didn't work. See my other comment in this thread. This is the first I'm hearing of zapwallettxes though, what is?

That's probably the case, I'm no expert. Doesn't that just bounce back to me then? Where does it go? What happens? Did I just lose some bitcoin?

It isn't showing up on that either. It was sent from bitcoin core, but I'm not sure I understand the "abandontransaction" thing. Could you explain how to go about doing that, or link me to a dummy version of how to do so?
