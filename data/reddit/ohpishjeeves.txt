I just ordered some beers from honestbrew.co.uk and paid the coinbase invoice. Coinbase didn't detect the payment even though it had two confirmations within the 10 minute timer. So then it gives a new address. I come back to reddit and find this post! First time using Coinbase and it fails. I've never had this problem with BitPay and I've bought plenty of things through them.

This is great! I'm placing an order soon. I just wish they stocked some trousers for men too.

Why buy games with USD when you could have bought bitcoin instead?

Yes, it's a shame. They told me they've "discontinued for now due to lack of time to maintain and the need to simplify life, as it was getting a bit overwhelming". They said they might reintroduce it in a while.

I bought a Nofan A480 and I haven't had any problems under full load. I have had an issue with the switch on the P-400A PSU, so I'd get an upgraded option on that.

Could you merge this with the spreadsheet linked to on the right-hand side of the bitcoinuk subreddit? You're missing some from there including  who sell clothes for bitcoins.

The missing link(s).

The Chocolate Tree have stopped accepting Bitcoin.

I think they are aware that it wouldn't take much to integrate BitPay into their checkout process, and if enough potential customers asked them for the option, they would do it. They are congenial folk.
Edit: You should ask again in March and be sure to contact their sales person Ellen Brook.
Edit 2: Some context...

No worries. By the way, having received my order, I have to say was delighted with the experience from start to finish. Great job!

I bought a computer from Quiet PC with Bitcoin a couple of months ago.

GBP withdrawals are SWIFT international wire transfers, so they would likely be subject to the same delays as USD. In July I waited over three weeks for a GBP withdrawal to be processed before contacting them and asking them to cancel the withdrawal. They immediately returned the GBP to my wallet. I bought bitcoins and withdrew them instead. Back when all was well I used to get GBP withdrawals processed within a day and received funds within about four days.
