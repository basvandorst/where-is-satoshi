Ps. My Bitcoin core client is fully up to date.

I would if I got it back. Seems my payment is stuck in limbo. I have no bitcoin left! When will it send it back to my bitcoin core wallet?

Thanks, I checked online and nothing has been confirmed. My wallet is synchronised. Do you know what is the cut off time for my transaction to return? Thanks.
Ps. Can I use more than one ! if spread out over a paragraph or is it the !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that annoys you alone???????

Thanks. Transaction only 50 euros. What is FUD?

Thanks, 
I sent from my Bitcoin Core to Electrum. Electrum shows up nothing and my Bitcoin Core shows it has left my wallet and is stuck on zero confirmations. I don't know what sweeping funds means! Have I lost €50 in the bitcoin ether?
