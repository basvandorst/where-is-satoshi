This goes for ALL cash transactions at most bank. Cash deposits are not processed immediately, and until the end of the day in most banks, if you have the receipt you can retract them regardless of weather you hold an account there or not. NEVER release anything for sale the same business day unless you personally deposit the cash. Personally, I wouldn't give anyone my bank account number to begin with. 
CASH DEPOSITS ARE NOT CASH DEPOSITS UNTIL THE END OF EACH BUSINESS DAY. the only exception is if you have a business account and you have made provisions for cash depositing during daily operations.

This is incorrect. In reality the "online" system that shows you balances and transactions is NOT the legal accounting version, rather a parallel and often incorrect version. It used to be fairly common to be able to watch your transactions during the day and order them to your benefit only to find them processed out of order at the end of the day when real accounting reconciling was done. This has been partially made illegal, but the visible banking system you interact with on a web site is NOT the legal reconciled accounting version. Its merely there for your convenience an dis not binding in any way. Until end of day processing and posting of the deposit, it can be redacted. 
This system came about as a way of circumventing branch banking laws. It has persisted because in some cases the laws still exist, and in others the cost of creating the new system that interacts directly is both unwarranted from their view and not to their advantage
