Or traders like me get -500 to -1000% a month, which is why I don't do it. Staying in your lane = max profits

Same here. I didn't necessarily plan it that way but lost my job around the same time and it's worked out that I didn't really need that 401k after all.

Definitely not into crypto for the lambos, but I guess different strokes for different folks.

Good deal for both. Too bad for me I clicked on the link and spent an hour lusting over all these 41 day world tour cruises...maybe if we go to the moon I can go to New Zealand.

I can't express either outrage or disagreement, I just want people to gather their thoughts a bit when it comes to things like this. Unfortunately what we have is a brand new technology that people are still scrambling to grasp. Bitcoin laws and definitions are changing every day plus when the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley and Wall St. comes together you have a bunch of people with the opportunity to get very rich if they act swiftly and smartly. I can't really pass any sort of judgement when fraud is happening at all levels of finance and being swiftly dispatched with fines and low key press releases. I guess all I want is the same justice to be applied in these situations and I'm holding many many many of my thoughts until we see how this all pans out and I hope everyone else will just stay the course. Bitcoin is way more about the community than just the Foundation. I have finally stopped trying to get the world on the same page with Bitcoin and now I just want to see it flourish among those who believe in it, and I think it will.

Totally agree. I think being part of this sub skews the perception but a huge majority of the population still has no idea what Bitcoin is aside from random media mentions.

 Their co-founder Peter Christ (aka Captain Christ) with a very rational and level-headed opinion on law enforcement's role in the war on drugs. Saw this last year and always loved it.

Sorry that the internet police didn't like my explanation of why I thought it would be good for their business model.

But what about when the same Federal Reserve is both the supply and demand (interest rates)?

To me the best thing about Doge is it allows you to play dice games with much less catastrophic results.

Shrem is far from a hero but I have absolutely zero moral judgements on him. I don't see how he's in line for anything more than a small fine and possible probation with the precedent that has been set in many other financial fraud cases involving Wall Street. I just hope the justice system realizes the small scale of a crime that is going to garner a whole shit ton more media attention than some much much much larger cases.

Can someone explain why some payments take much longer to send than others? Most of my activity is depositing on victiv (daily fantasy sports site) through Coinbase and it seems to be near-instant. Right now trying to fuel up my Changetip account for the first time it's been almost 15 mins and the indicator on the app is still grey and doesn't seem to have even started yet.
Could it be the android wallet I'm using or is there another explanation?
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:34:21
Would you say then that currency is a fulfillment system for a ledger? By that sense we've progressed in technology where the fulfillment step is obsolete with a public ledger. Your post definitely triggered some new understanding with me, thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:25:50
Really really really hoping this low price holds til Tues morning when Victiv pays me out for NFL winnings this week.

Looks like Toronto. I live about 2 hours away in the states and this is a little higher than I'd expect to pay here (maybe closer to 0.10-0.12) but definitely not for Toronto - it's a nice but expensive city.

I like the utility of both BTC and LTC, but I think the "buy a coffee" thing can start to be solved by something like this - 
Where a transaction is small enough (lets say under $10) to be worth the risk to get it done quickly vs waiting for all the confs. Like how often are you actually going to get burned by a double spend? and if it happens you're only out a small amount. If I had a coffee shop/restaurant you can reasonably assume that an overwhelming portion of your txes aren't going to be someone trying to defraud you.
I guess when it comes to online microtransactions I could see a much worse problem - like a steam key sale site or something probably would have a much higher risk of fraud but merchants deal with chargebacks ALLLL the time and the delay on those are months sometimes.

I still haven't gotten BTC out of Polo yet but I was wondering...is there any way to change that fee? Right now it's looking good but like 4-5 days ago that fee would get stuck. I didn't really understand how this all worked until I got the mycellium wallet, compared to Jaxx and even coinomi it seems to have way better control over fees.

2 + 2 is 4 - 1 that's 3, quick maths

I just started noticing this a few years ago and I'm pretty convinced it's a regional thing, very prevalent up in upstate NY to the point that I did this for 30 years without noticing what I was even saying

Thanks for this, finally ordered one. Always figured the shipping would be crazy to the US but it's super cheap! Total for the whole order was just over 7 mbtc...I remember when trezors first came out they were like 500 or more.

Do you know if it can sweep electrum seeds or would it have to be sent to a new address on the ledger from the electrum wallet? And if it does sweep, will it grab bch and btg?

I'm in the exact same boat, I have a little over 100 mBTC and 1.5 LTC trapped on a phone with a busted LCD...time to spend some money to make some money

I think the minimum is 0.01 for slush.
Mining isn't for the casual player at this point. I had a good run for a few months on an old crappy video card but those times are over and I feel like you're in the same boat.
There are plenty of calculators online but it sounds like you're probably not keeping up w electricity costs.

I feel like he lost all credibility with the whole "make pretty things" argument. Gold as a metal is still used in many applications but you can argue that there are many more physical metal commodities to hold if you wanted to extract as much value as possible.

For those who can't play the audio, a quick synopsis - US congress primary concern is on the law enforcement/criminal use of bitcoin. Regulation could come in the form similar to current banking laws but most are taking a wait and see approach due to the technology being relatively new and still changing. Then a quick explaination and plug for Bitpay.

In my area I have found a few people with reasonable prices. I originally bought back in April from a college student and met at the campus library. Just saw a couple days ago that a coin shop near my house that deals in gold and silver is now directly dealing with bitcoin...hoping this idea catches on in more areas.

Can't believe all the hassle you're getting from people on here. I think being scam-proof is the mindset here so I can understand why people's first instinct is to look out for you, but I'm happy to see little successes of social media helping spread the reach of BTC - we all need to be ambassadors and do our part.
