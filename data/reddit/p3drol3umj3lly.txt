Any sort of investment is a long term endeavour. Don’t view BTC as a get rich quick scheme. Like any investment it carries risk, and you should always diversify with real stocks, bonds, cash savings and liquid assets.
Additionally most ETF and managed fund investment recommendations are for at least 5+ years. Keep that in mind, as you should probably apply the same logic to BTC.
People who buy BTC in hopes of becoming rich in a week are going to be disappointed. HODL and buy low.

If BTC gets to 100k in 2018 I'll donate $9k to charity

Don’t worry. I bought 0.8 at 3,200 a couple of months back and was worried. Just treat it as a sunk cost and leave it alone for a bit.
Like with any investment, part of the risk is losing all of it. And BTC is one of the more volatile options out there.
Investing is also a long term game. With managed funds and ETFs the recommendation is to keep it for at least 5 years. The same applies to BTC.
And yeah make sure you have a 6 month rainy day fund in liquid assets.

I think since the transaction is not routed through a bank the tax authorities cannot track it. Obviously it’s up to the business to declare non-traceable transactions, but I suspect with cryptos they probably don’t.

They avoid paying VAT which is 20% in most of the EU

When there’s a considerable dip and you have money to invest, then buy.
With investment your capital is at risk. This is not binding financial advice, or financial advice in general.

I transferred £30k from one UK bank to another, took maybe... 30-45 seconds and cost me nothing.
Then again, European banking infrastructure is hella legit. Especially the UK’s, seeing as London is the financial capital of the universe.
