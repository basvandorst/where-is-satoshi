I used them for a while, had a good experience. Then due to a mistake on their part, they shut down my account (  ) and even after it was clear it was an internal mixup on their end, never bother reinstated my account, or apologizing. 
I didn't really lose any money due to it (they forced me to sell my bitcoin, but I could buy it back on coinbase), but it was a bit of a slap in the face, and has made me recommend coinbase over them every time.
I guess my summary would be, they are pretty legitimate but since they don't make any money about you, don't expect them to treat you like a customer either.

Well, I don't have coins anymore -- they quite literally forced me to sell them, and transfer the money to my bank. I repeatedly asked them if I could just transfer the coins out of the system, but they kept refusing.
 Had they just told me they don't want my business, I'd be a bit bummed and consider it their right. But what they did, and how they did it is absolutely enraging.

Yeah, although not a big one. As I told them when they asked why I was buying, I was buying it as a long-term investment. It's almost ironic that they forced me to sell them at a loss.
Although, as long as the price doesn't recover before I get the money and can re-purchase the coins through coinbase, I shouldn't be out of pocket much. And this time I won't make the same mistake of letting them sit online.

I repeatedly asked them if I could just transfer the coins out of the system, but they kept refusing. That was actually the reason I contacted them in the first place, the last ~4 or 5 attempts I made to transfer the bitcoins out had all failed, and they hadn't replied to my support ticket.
On the phone, they told me that because I didn't reply to their email (which I did!) the only thing I could do is sell my bitcoins and transfer the money to the funding account. (or I guess, just walk away from the account).
