I liked Kraken but they had pretty low trade volume.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:33:40
I think I fixed it.

They're better than Gox, at least they opened the site backup for a week to allow trading before shutting it down for several weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:33:03
My thoughts exactly, I thought they had more security than most places. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:39:49
Ooo I've been looking for a site like this.

Now I lay me down to sleep,
I thank Satoshi for being so great,
As I mine while I sleep,
I hope the coins are mine to keep.

Looks like it's time to take a trip to Boston.

Good to know, the site was a bit minimal wasn't sure if it was a scam.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:35:40
Don't say that. It's the only good place i have left to buy coins.

Cryptsy had a security breach? I didn't know. 
Edit because I don't like being compared to an insect that eats shit:And if your talking about the Crypto-Trade.com breach, I'm well aware of that since I'm the one that posted it here.

Good call i forgot what today was, to bad my phone just died and now i cant log on
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:49:14
I agree, I've tried a lot and these guys are the best i've seen.
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:48:27
I got the order numbers, i tried to buy some btc last summer and enterd my info wrong, was given a mtgox coupon code that didn't work, was told i would get a new one, then never received another email from you guys.

I've been trying to do BitInstant-&gt; Bitstamp, and i think there down because i get nothing either.

To my knowledge nobody knows if "he" is a person or a small collective of people.
@_date: 2013-01-27 19:31:32
I credit it to it showing up here yesterday.
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:32:37
I don't have a Capital one account, also i already put the money in Dwolla. Does anybody else still use that or am i a little behind?
@_date: 2013-02-12 15:54:24
Thats a very interesting idea, i dont know much about Satoshi but isn't he dead?
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:36:15
I hate to break it to you but your site is far from flawless, and your customer service is even worse.
@_date: 2013-03-02 16:36:04
Ive been using Bitstamp, the Dwolla Mt.gox combo is just to complicated now. How much are you looking to get?
@_date: 2013-03-10 15:53:10
This looks interesting, ill have to give it a shot.
