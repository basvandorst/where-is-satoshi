Thank you!

Well, 19k sounds like a good trade-off for a little bit of your life-force, if you ask me... lol
I'm glad you're in a better place now then.

Could you explain me how you plan to move your coins from CB to Gemini? I want to do the same
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:44:49
Perfect. Thank you!!

This is so hard to read, but so satisfying to see a team from MIT looking to remediate these issues.

I want to move to Gemini so bad, but it's so relatively complicated compared to Coinbase to set up.

Hi, I'm new to the subreddit. Is there a way for me to get informed on how to start mining efficiently with not a lot of technical knowledge on the subject? I would love to learn more about it

Thank you. I'll be downloading a wallet soon on my PC. Was the process to move them straightfoward? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:44:18
I am interested in knowing as well!

Completely agree with this. Got me thru a class in high-school and still refer it to starting engineering students when I advise them at work.

I know "day-trading" sounds pretty self-explanatory, but what's the logic behind it? Why should or should a person do it? And when does day-trading stops being day-trading?

Can we stop upvoting this?
"redditor for a day" and the article is plagiarized.
