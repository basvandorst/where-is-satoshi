We'll go with  if that's the trade off of allowing easy access.  And be honest about why they don't get a complete conversion of $10 to BTC. It would be a lesson on why Bitcoin provides an important alternative to the current banking system.  We should even provide information on better routes to buy $10 of bitcoin if the goal is maximizing the BTC:USD ratio.

Agreed, it's super confusing.  There should be a way to make it routine to label the terms as business vs protocol, especially among core users to minimize confusion.  The sad reality is that, probably, it'll be the protocol terms that'll need to be appended since the companies have more public recognition.  Either that or actually try to get the lay people to understand what's going on under the hood.. which seems unlikely.

Yup, it's an ideologically driven global economic experiment that's only in its infancy.  No one would disagree that there is a whole lot of volatility in it.  But the way I see it, the volatility is almost entirely emotional.  There is a strong ideologically driven upward force in the background which will eventually minimize the impact of the emotional volatility.
Many people got into Bitcoin without understanding the underlying technology, implications, and how to handle/store their satoshi.  They jumped on because they thought it was a boat they had to be on before they got left behind.  Many of these people got burned hard by various issues from the un-user-friendly fledgling environment, most notably by Mt Gox.  Hopefully we learn from those mistakes and the market introduces better and easier-to-use security solutions.

They did make a **shit ton** of stupid financial mistakes, I won't deny that.  I wish I was more financially aware as a teen to understand the stupidly high risk approach to their business model.  But at the end of the day, as relatively uneducated immigrants from Syria who built their own business and home with their own blood and sweat, all they have left is debt and old age.
They **trusted** the great American financial system and got royally shafted because people up top gamed the housing market creating an emotionally driven financial bubble that my parents got sucked into (their business is in construction).  Somewhere in NYC one of those same executives is having steak and vintage wine with my parents' previous assets while my 18 year old sister applies for financial aid and they count down the days they have left in their home of over 15 years.

You can secure your bitcoins in ways that would essentially be impossible to 'hack'. These methods are more time consuming to learn, but if security of your assets is important, you have options that're better than Fort Knox at your disposal.
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:57:33
No you can't.  You could try and pay other entities to secure your money, but if your trust with them is at all shaky, you could get that money seized.
Let's take two extreme examples of seizure.  Both are in the context of the US being the most financially powerful entity in the world and as such a good test of security.
Iran: A sovereign country with extreme amounts of assets, technology, and willingness/capability to secure its own interests. [ In 2009, the US seized $2 billion of their money that was in citigroup.](  They couldn't secure their assets with 'normal' currency.
Ross Ulbricht: Single US citizen that is being tried as DPR, the entity that started Silk Road.  The site got hacked by the FBI and ~30k BTC which were part of the server escrow system got seized.  [Nonetheless there are another estimated 600K BTC believed to be in DPR's personal wallet which the FBI cannot get a hold of and probably don't even know where they are.](  If Ross is DPR and he took the proper precautions, he still technically has possession of these assets.  You can't do this with 'normal' currency.  
Infact, my original analogy is wrong.  Cryptocurrencies, if used right, can provide *greater* security than what Fort Knox provides.  And you don't have to worry about paying any guards.

You should treat at least a portion of his btc income as an investment decision akin to putting money in an IRA.  Hopefully this is money you don't need in the near future so that the short term isn't of concern.
Bitcoin's current value is still predominantly driven by ideology and perceived potential.  If you don't believe in this potential, you shouldn't be okay with getting paid in it.  To people who believe it's going to be worth a lot more in the future, the current volatility is positive as it keeps the average price low for longer periods allowing you to accumulate more btc.

I'm sure most people would think that way, still worth the effort in my opinion though.  Those wallets are worth ~$1.3 right now, but if things keep looking up, maybe in a few weeks or months they'll be worth $2.  A few people who have the wallets will take note and might act on their curiosity since a piece of paper with magic internet money is going up in value.
At this point most people have a baseline curiosity about Bitcoin, the goal is to make them act on it.  Of course the more they're given the more likely they'll delve into it, but you gotta work with what you got.

Maybe this should be approached as a free app that has in app purchase option for this reason.  User would click "add funds" and be presented with two options, in app for 30% fees or a link to circle/coinbase. The idea is to offer people as easy an entry method  into crytos as possible.  If they opt for the in app option, it essentially becomes a $3 convenience charge.

Agreed.  Since your parents are concerned about identity theft, I'm pretty sure they are reasonable people so you should be able to convince them with knowledge.  Read up on it, talk to them about it frequently, get them informed.

Someone said it below, the main benefit will be tourists' ability to seemlessly move their foreign money into the Japanese market.
Transaction cost needs to be low for this to make sense for small retail purchases ($.60 is too expensive to justify purchase of coffee, fastfood, etc). 
Transaction speed needs to be quick for this to make sense for large purchases (for expensive purchases, retailers will probably want at least a single confirmation on the blockchain before they let customers leave the store).
As it stands the network will struggle to accommodate tourists to Japan.

I don't think satoshi intended to keep the block size stable for the many decades it would take to generate all BTC.
E: If for some reason BTC exists as a heavily used cryptocurrency in 2100+ with a stable 1MB block size, that means we have a highly robust side chain system that's accumulating millions of small transaction charges into large ones to keep the miners incentivized.

There was no dilution of shares, this is the big misunderstanding people have.  The founder put up his own shares for public offering, he did not make new ones and throw them in the mix to dilute the dividend/share.  The value of a share on SD is driven by the dividend payback and that has not been decreased because of new shares.  In essence more money is going to the pubic, than the owner... that's about it.  As for his rationale, I don't know.  Maybe he's trying to get more people invested in BTC since he's clearly in it for the long haul.
The main reason the value has dropped is because a big spender has stopped gambling on SD since early Feb.  He used to drop up to 1000 BTC bets almost daily and alone was nearly doubling profitability of the site.  Now since he's disappeared the projected profits of Feb are below Jan by at least 30-40%.  Despite this though, in fiat money, the profits are about stable given baseline growth (outlier excluded) and the increase in BTC/USD value.

I don't think anyone here would believe that BTC is the end all be all.  It's another stepping stone in finding an ideal medium of exchange.  Currently it's superior to any other form of exchange, and that is being realized by many.  This is the fundamental factor driving up the perceived value of the currency although many can reasonably argue there's probably an element of speculation and bubblyness in there as well.
Something better will eventually come along.  When that happens is the big question.  Most of us though hope and believe that in the short term Bitcoin will be the leader.  Short term in my mind is at least 5-10 years.
