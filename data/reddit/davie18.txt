But they haven't said that absolutely everyone didn't have 2FA enabled. It's misleading the edit you put into the main post...
You shouldn't make people panic more by twisting it.

Easier said than done...
People in the UK and most of Europe has limited options to trade btc and lbc is one of the best options for us to trade online.

I'm being serious though, they had the power to take all of my computers but I managed to show them that I'd been setup when selling on Localbitcoins.

Classic ...upvoting a comment like his. I expected no less. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 11:50:19
That seems reasonable... it just seemed before you were confused as to why you should pay extra to have more than 1 person at a time using it. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:03:57
This is so fucking retarded. What about online banking? Most banks also have a 24/7 hour phone service for emergencies. 
What do you go in a BTC emergency, like when you get goxed and potentially lose $1000s? What phone number do you call then?
This post is so stupid and I'm embarrassed by how many upvotes it has.

You have no idea what you're talking about.

Mod told me on IRC chat that withdrawals have been stopped for now as they don't want to top up their hot wallet until this has been sorted.

Someone on Localbitcoins ended up getting me arrested for selling drugs and money laundering when I was completely innocent. I'd be careful on there.
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:46:46
Don't think so. Basically he sold student study drugs on the open net and then when they wanted to pay with a bank transfer, he would set up a trade on LBTC for say £x the drugs cost, and then the person buying the drugs would pay this £x to the person selling the BTC. Who would then release the equivalent value in BTC to the drug seller. So yeah, I basically got caught up in the middle of that when government services were investigating the site and then when they made an order from there as part of the investigation, my bank details were provided for which they had to pay in to. So I can kind of see why it looked so bad at first from their point of view.

Well if it's making you that bitter you should consider selling... BTC is a high risk investment, regardless of what anyone says. Many people have lost a lot of money with it, but many have made a lot too. I remember selling some BTC at the peak for like over £700 / BTC.... I don't know how the people who bought at that price point must feel. 
Still though, if you hold onto your coins, who knows, they could be worth 10x what they are worth now within 3 years. Yeah might not happen but that's the magic of BTC: it's hard to predict where it'll be in the future.

I'm kinda hoping the price stays stable for at least another 6 months. Just finishing uni now, pretty broke and very little money to invest in BTC. I owned some previously but had to sell to fund other things, but starting a new job in September once I graduate and would be able to invest a decent amount each month. 
It'll be quite irritating if the price starts to significantly by then. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:47:28
I agree with your post, but also I think something like the TV or telephone is quite a good comparison to make with BTC. The reason I think this is because both of those are rather pointless (at least in the beginning for TV, when their only purpose would have been to watch TV shows) if no one else/not enough people are using them. 
The same is for BTC. It'll only be a 'success' once being used by the masses. It's not like other technologies, like say sat nav for example, which works perfectly even if very few other people are using it. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:58:37
It does, there are lots of people selling in £ via bank transfer
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:59:42
I just assumed if you were buying BTC in £ you'd be in the UK.
And it can of course be used for that, but I'm almost sure the vast majority of the trading that happens via LBC will be without ever exchanging in person.
@_date: 2015-04-27 13:43:00
Localbitcoins is just as fast. There might be some risks with selling coins there, but buying I can't think of any risks. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:12:47
Why is that? I've had great experiences using it. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:13:07
Why does it matter if they live close to you or another part of the country if it is via bank transfer to another account in the same country? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 13:45:31


Yeah... don't trust what your bank says. Natwest told me there was no problem at all with using my account for trading BTC, then a while ago I got a letter saying they could no longer provide my banking needs and all my accounts would be closed in 30 days without any chance of appeal or anything. The only reason I can possibly think this was for was my BTC trading, even though they told me before it was fine. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 09:29:41
Possibly way sooner then that's, who knows 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:01:31
Can you expand? Did they recently invest in it which caused it to suddenly spike?
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:33:42
Which is what has enabled them to become as big as they have. Love him or hate him, without the way that Steve Jobs led them in a dictatorship-like manner, they probably wouldn't be where they are today. Dictatorships get shit done.

Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.

It's really not. 99.9% of places don't accept it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:12:37
I might invest £500. Whilst I would be quite annoyed to lose that much money, I would get over it. It's so tempting to invest more because of the potential rewards, but it's not worth the risk in my situation I think. I'm a student with little savings so it's probably best to stay more on the safe side.
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:13:09
3-5 days? Seriously? Any transactions under £5k or so are completely instant 99% of the time in the UK.
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:15:52
I've only ever bought/sold on localbitcoins (being in the UK my options are limited), and I've never had even a slight problem. 90% of the time i have the BTC within 2 mins of sending the money.
Just be smart and only buy off people who have done many transactions with 100% feedback and you should be fine.

Not sure if you were implying that's what I was saying, but of course I'm massivley against running a country that way. A company however should be run however they want to run it as long as they don't break any laws.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:02:54
Yeah fair point. I was just wondering whether it would be an insanely dumb thing to do to invest in it now seeing as it has increased so much recently, it's gotta crash at some point but then again bitcoin is still relatively very young.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:54:46
mtgox, up to £508 now!
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:38:50
I sold on the first say. Made a quick £300. Could have got over £400 if I waited but I'm more than happy with making £300 in the space of a week from a £750 investment. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:34:42
Why couldn't they take a 30% cut with bitcoin?
