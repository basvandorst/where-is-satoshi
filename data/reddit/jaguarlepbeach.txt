Thanks bro
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:22:35
nowhere in that post did I ask for coins bro

I'm scared they may report me for being too young. Another redditor did it in the comments and I only have 1 email address it's my dad's so if that one I'd banned on localbit coins. Com what do I do
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:35:10
no its because they think it's a scam but I know it's not a scam
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:45:00
I'll try but they're trying to convince me it's a scam and showing me these men talking about it being the bubble or some thingv

Haha if I was 35 I'd hopefully have a job why would I be lying though?

Yes thank you friend. I think a nice person who gave me bitcoin without me asking is rare haha maybe I'll buy more when I'm older
