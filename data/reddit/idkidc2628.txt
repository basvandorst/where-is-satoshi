@_date: 2017-12-12 03:04:37
Is it faster for transactions and cashing out?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:03:27
When I purchase the cryptos do I put them in an online wallet where it can't be hacked or?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:05:18
Okay thanks because I been reading about like coinbase etc.. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:25:24

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:30:03

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:51:05

@_date: 2017-12-08 00:35:43
So its worth different in other parts of the world and in different exchanges places where you can buy and sell em kinda like a stock? But ik its not one
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:53:55

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:23:28
Is it too late for me to start mining? and how can i mine not just bitcoin i have 2k to spend for mining and im wanting to buy 1k worth of bitcoin and 1k worth of other cryptocurrencies but how and where do i start where can i buy litecoin ethereum dash monero etc..
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:49
I can still buy like 1000 worth though or do i have to pay full price for one whole bitcoin instead of just owning a bit of one
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:01:48
Do you own cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:39:14
Is this futures?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:54:56
Coinbase.com? Or .org
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:27:42
How do i find them search bitmining bitcoin mining or?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:07:38
Okay nice ill be doing more research. So far just read about how they have a long code or key and you store it on it like a usb flash drive or something like that
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:43
Oh dang, really? Well thanks i will open an account this weekend do you recommend coinbase, gdax or another one. I know a bit about stocks been using a simulator based on real world and a year ago i had 25k now i have 160k+ DASH making me the 2nd most if not the most money so if there are some u dont recommend to noobs i'd still like to know them since coinbase is easy to get and gdax is a step up and then the global exchange you said i can try to apply what ive learned to an advanced exchange. Also you wouldn't happen to know best place where I can buy Dash or other different cryptos?  But definitely will get me BTC any answer is appreciated
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:35:57
It's rare around here in Houston area everyone is going crazy and excited. I just checked my simulator and I am at 200k+ forgot i had bitcoin and bitcoin cash on there i will be opening a bitcoin account and another account i can trade/invest stocks, same ones I have in simulator. Thank you for the help and well happy holidays from Texas! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:28:06
I knew about how it might not be worth it all that much due to how it becomes more difficult to mine when more people are coming into bitcoin i was leaning towards mining online like a website cloud i heard or something like that but thank you so much im waiting till i reach 10 days and 10 or 20 karma points to be able to ask on Ive had Dash on a simulator for a year with other things and ive been up from $25k to 160k but Dash is what has made most of the money so should of used real money lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:53:12
I can't buy with credit card on dgax?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:35:06
Very true. I been doing research on bitcoin lately been using a simulator for stocks they have DASH a cryptocurrency which has made most of my money thats why im more interested on cryptocurrency bc went from 25k to now 160k in a year with otjer stocks (ik BTC is not a stock but will soon be traded as a commodity). Full time college student and work from 4:30pm till 4:30 in the morning I grind man. Slowly im building up on knowledge by asking questions so i wont have to be working so much and finish college and be my own boss. I appreciate your comment keeps me motivated. Goodluck to you 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:04:23
Oh ok because on bitcoin.com website it says you can buy Bitcoin up to .71 so like $9k 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:31
Whg is it different? Im new to BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:03:54
I know right I simply asked how to mine because im interested on mining bitcoin but also other ones and I went to the "right place" but they have rules like a certain amount of karma points and 10 days on reddit to ask 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:32:50
How can I invest or trade. I have 5k extra for things to invest in. I just don't want to only invest in BTC I also like what I hear about monero and other cryptocurfencies. And how can I mine? HELP! I mainly know about stocks and been using a simulator for a year up 156k from 25k and bought DASH cryptocurrency on simulator a year ago which has made most of my money but cryptocurrencies I hear are not stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:29:30
