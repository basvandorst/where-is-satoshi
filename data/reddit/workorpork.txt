Wow, thanks for the lesson. We sure havent thought of that till now. You should write a book.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:27:04
The question is not really meant to attack you.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:34:40
I would rather boycott any company that insists on continuing to do business with bitgo.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:47:52
So youre saying it is also bitgo's fault? Are you going to pursue them in court?
@_date: 2016-08-15 07:10:26
I would say they were your delusions. You think people instantly withdraw the entire content of the hot wallet without any change?
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:13:08
Well its not like he is asking people to make a decision based on only what he wrote.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:09:39
Dramatic much?

@_date: 2016-08-04 10:51:08
Zane I know you cant comment on the actual method of socializing losses and thats why youre not replying to my comments, but I implore you to reconsider mainly hitting margin funding providers (If that is indeed the case). Not only will this destroy bfx's reputation, but it will also probably be criminal. Do not make the mistake of letting people withdraw funds / altcoins / coins before you have a sound method of dealing with losses or before you possibly go into insolvency.
Margin funding providers had USD deposited on your platform, the fact that OTHER users used these USD for buying btc that is now gone does NOT IMPLY that the margin providers should take the hit - the users that were margin long had this exposure, not the funding providers. Please bring up these points with your team.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:12:24
Ok, thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2016-08-12 06:01:14
It went as low as 16ct
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:01:08
im ok with this result

Started a new subreddit where we can coordinate: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:33:26
Swaps have been used to buy btc, that btc is no longer there. So the 40m is a part of the 70 that was stolen
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:24:10
$1, but they do not say when. Could be in 50 years, theoretically.
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:59:02


I disagree. For all intents and purposes, bitfinex pooled all user deposits under its balance sheet. The fact that balances were actually stored in individual addresses is immaterial. I have a claim to a portion of all of BFX's assets.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:58:26
Moved over 32 btc out without a problem.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:03:01
Zane, you yourself said it has not been decided how you will handle losses. SO how can you promise him the possibility to withdraw his usd? If that is true, then you are implying that some customer will face losses in a segregated manner. I do not agree to this and think it is criminal.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:33:50
Honestly if i get 64% back i will be very happy. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:34:28
Good, fuck bitgo.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:32:28
Yeah, I also will be if i get it back. But i still dont like getting scammed.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:52:00
I have hidden 35000usd on bitfinex, but seems like someone already found it.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:49:07
No, also margin funding providers.

@_date: 2016-08-10 14:20:03
Oh yeah? When is the latest the debt will be repaid? What compensation do we get for each year of waiting? Where is it stated that owners will not receive dividends before debt is repaid? The terms currently state that debt will be repaid at some point in the future.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:18:35
Given that we will be able to trade in the bfx tokens for shares, please provide us with some sort of set of financial statements for bfx (balance sheet, cash flows, income statement) for the past 3 years so we can make educated decisions on if we want to convert to shares.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:57:58
As a shareholder, I need to have access to the relevant financial statements no matter what. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:01:31
Wow that sounds quite pessimistic...
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:17:41
All my funds were lent out - where do you see potential for a full recovery?
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:06:48
The swaps are NOT usd holding. The 40 million were used to buy btc. They are in positions. After that btc was bought, the usd could have been withdrawn. So the 40 million in swaps is a subset of the total 200k of btc they had.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:57:11
The way they have handled this up till now is also reassuring. Yes, there was a major fuck up, but I guess that can happen to anyone. I believe their exchange is the best one out there currently and that once margin trading is turned on again, we will be able to get back to business as usual.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:06:23


Fair enough. But I think it is reasonable to infer meaning from your statements, given the current situation and risks stemming from the improper handling of it.
Nevertheless, do not take my comments personally. I appreciate what you are doing and wish you all the best. I am hoping the long awaited update will indeed be published today and that you and your team make the right decisions.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:30:47
No :) So its in your interest to sell at whatever price :) ... so they can esentially buy all their outstanding debt at a huge discount :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:25:17
But dont worry, you can sell it on the open market to bitfinex for over 1% of its value!
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:57:30
Yeah, already tagged him on res. Almost every second idiotic, fud-spreading comment about bfx is from him.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:07:22
Eh, yes i will. All creditors will be equal and they will all take the hit equally, which is the only way it makes sense. It might take longer, but at least bfx will not fuck me over and tell me i 'lost' 63% of my margin funding balance.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:27:38
Bitfinex currently offers a special super low fee of only 36%, get in on it!
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:19:25
Can we get a status update? Whats the eta for bringing the site up? Whats the eta for the announcement?
@_date: 2016-08-14 10:26:51
Hey, seems like you provide great support :) ... Maybe you can answer my simple question:
How is is possible that you co-signed an unauthorized withdrawal of 120k btc? Also, how much will bitgo reimburse its customers after losing their 70 million dollars?

Fuck that.
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:37:39
There is no bitfinex official hotwallet. There is an address to which they send coins from the cold wallet. There are dozens of hot wallet addresses that bfx sends withdrawals from. You are spreading fud and are misinformed about basics of hot and cold wallet management.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:55:49
Good timing.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:55:33
please make sure you provide us with financial statements for bitfinex so that we can make a decision about converting to ifinex shares.
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:59:56
For the n-th time, when are you releasing more info on how losses will be repaid? Stop selectively answering questions and ignoring those that you are not comfortable with. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:11:06


They will buy them back, some time before the year 2087
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:05:34
Spolier alert: many. Btw pls make sure you dont delay my withdrawal 5 days because i just (re) set up my 2fa.
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:42:28
We need more details.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:12:06
Fuck that, the rest of us dont agree.
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:35:43
They dont internally reuse the hotwallet address (just as an initial address for cold storage withdrawal), they generate a new address and use is for change from the transaction. That means that not all outgoing transactions are withdrawals, but at least one is a bitfinex change address that will be used for further withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:59:55
They are bankrupt and need to go into insolvency.
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:58:17
pls stfu already
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:19:29
Go ahead...
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:30:27
This is a good point.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:10:10
36% ;)
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:48:46
When you say later UTC time, what hour is that, approximately? 18:00 utc? 21:00?
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:07:12
What makes you think they will not do these things? I personally think that the fact that they allowed withdrawals is a very good sign. Give them time - Gox is being investigated for YEARS, I have not gotten anything back. They've had like what, 9 days? 
I feel from your posts and your newly created subreddit that you are just trying to spread FUD - whats your agenda?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:29:35
What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:39:03
Are *you* fucking kidding me?
If bitgo's multisig keys were used to sign the outgoing hack transactions, then it is most certainly their fuckup and they should be liable.
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:11:54
ETA on next update? Just want to know if it today EST time or later.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:21:02
I dont think so. they were holding around 200k btc, losts of usd, lots of altcoins. I think it is reasonable that 120k btc is 36% of assets.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:12:56
ffs. What do you do with the usd when you borrow it? you buy btc. So someone gives you his btc that was on the bfx site, you give him the borrowed usd. What does he then do with his usd that he gained by selling you btc? He withdraws it.
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:46:52
Idiotic. Average lending returns on USD were around 20% p.a.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:22:27
A++ comedy, 9/10 would enjoy again. Try repeating this stunt in a few months bro, people here have short memory spans.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:00:02
Thank you, but I've had my share of scam for this year.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:28:35
120k btc has been stole. We know 1 address that bfx controls has 33k btc, then another ~20% state that their balance is in their bitgo wallets. This would indicate a total holding of about 191k btc.
This means that 63% of the btc has been stolen.
(Not trying to spread FUD, just making sense of this all, feel free to question any of the figures I posted)
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:44:06
Where is he asking for your trust?
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:21:27
That is not the correct answer. The correct answer will have concrete dates, information about potential stock conversion or other sources of funding. Concrete steps.
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:11:24
If there is low liquidity they limit insta buys. If you want to market-buy anyway, put in a limit order.

No its not. In a democracy, you dont vote on something fundamental like human rights or whether or not to oppress some minority. These things are set in stone, your opinion doesnt matter. The same goes for the 21mil limit.
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:12:05

Not sure how you could be more wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:00:01
He can buy 10btc now, so he has 2700usd. If he waits for 230, he will buy 11.74btc. When btc is at 5k, he will have 58000usd, while if he goes all in now he will have 50k, a difference of 8k, or about 16%. So to answer your question "are you really going to wish you got them $400 cheaper": Quite possibly yes.
@_date: 2015-07-06 11:58:41
You should say goodbye to those coins and slap yourself for using an exchange that routinely steals from their clients (Google is your friend). Good luck!

Not necessarily true. The top one could have been 22bn, the other two reasonable amounts. The only valid conclusion is that at least one person claimed far more than he is owed.
