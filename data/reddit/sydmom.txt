i don't have much but for me it's hard to leave money at the bank. Especially Most of french bank (I'm from France) are creditor of countrie like Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain... etc.  When you compare their GDP to debt, you'll see their absolute insolvency. Furthermore if you ever make some benefits on crypto, you're imposed more than 60% of tax. Your money at the bank is under government control in league with bank and you don't own nothing.

Bitcoin can be at least a reserve currency in the future or can go to zero. It all depends on which way you forecast it can go. My part, I bet on ''it'll become at least a reserve currency''. Math don't lies compare to what so ever means of exchange Human has made.

I used to own a landromat business. One day bank called me and said i need to deposit 2000 euros right now, if not they'll refuse to pay. I ran down to bank with 2000e cash (cause i had cash business at that time and that was my only solution). And then, they said they can't accept cash so they had to refuse the payment. Finally, thanks to that refusal, i had to pay 20% of penalty to reactive my bank activity.
With that saying, I hate banks and banksters and i thank everyday to bitcoin cause it has given me a freedom of choice.  And now, i don't have to beg to bank for whatsoever reason. I am fron France.

When you create a company, investors get 100% of share at first. Then eventually they can sell certain portion of shares to the public.(IPO)
 If they decide to sell 30%, those handful of share holders have 70% and 30% of share will be distributed to the public. That's also extremely unequally distributed according to your opinion. But the decision is yours to buy some portion over those 30% or not.

If any protesters from any country have pretty organised logistics, that means they have somone like George Soros that support their activity financially. Look at the yellow vest movment in France.

I used to live in Africa, working for the company that wish to import a gold. Our company had met all kind of scam you can imagine. Even if you're lucky enought to find a real gold, you're never sure about the real quality (80% 90%,100%, etc). Besides, in case, the government can legally extort the gold that belongs to you. So i'll let you decide between bitcoin and gold if we enter a recession.

I can say that i'm an old gereration. When a credit card came in my knowledge, at first i was afraid of using it because i'd got used to using cash and trust it more.

Oh i am so glad that your father is smart investor. I told my friend to invest 100$ when btc price was about 6000 and i told some of my friends, it's about the time to get interest in btc. because btc dropped about 70% and I thought it was about the time to take off.  Then i started to worry because it just did'nt go up. OMG I was so anxious not because of my own loss but for my friend's loss. I belivie in btc so the price fluctuation never worrys me that much but not my friends. I promised myself I'll NEVER promote the bitcoin to my close friends or family. Hopely they'll get back their 6000 in a very soon.
