In a century that floor will be worth quite a bit

Boy I invested in Bitcoin back in 2014!
Too bad it was me mining with a crappy laptop and I ended up with .001 BTC. I can't even treat myself to a fancy meal at Outback with that

I hit login. It still requires me to give more information, which is strange, because I supplied my verified driver's license on Coinbase

He’s alive pretty sure, or did he go ripperino?
Edit: Confirmed alive as of [July 11th](

We're not saying apocalypse, we're saying when the electricity is out. And yes, bartering system is valid, but also gold works in a bartering system. It's a luxury good, you just have to find the people who are well off enough to get it.

Why is it that all these recent Twitter posts praising Bitcoin seem to have no fucking clue about basic economics? First the one that was like "Bitcoin survives without electricity" and now this

You can still buy with paper cash, or like, gold.

I assume it was a misspelled SSN, as in "Social Security Number."
Edit: Wrong, SNS standing for "Social Networking Service," as in their other accounts like MySpace.

All currencies are useless no matter what backs them up or what standard. At the end of the day they are pieces of paper that are *likely* to be accepted at places for a good or service, and that is what gives them their value. It's the social contract.

If Bitcoin rose by such an incredible factor, there'd be problems. I'd wager lots of problems. I'm not doubting that it will increase, but a million bucks in only 2 years is such a major increase that significant amounts of inflation or some other form of economic change would have to occur that would overall have a negative effect. I'm not knocking its ability to withstand - I sadly know of that (always HODL kids) but I don't think it'd be worth one million by 2020 _if_ that'd translate to the same one million today in terms of buying power.

Exactly what I said. It's literally an infamous scam email, the "Wealthy Man from Foreign Land" routine, but with bitcoin instead of USD and over Discord instead of email. Nobody should ever fell for this, honestly shouldn't even need attention to be brought to it because it's so obviously a scam.

Using y=ce^kt, k being ln (420)/69, I can deduce that you will have approximately 287.666 repeating BTC.

No offense dude... But you literally fell for the classic scam email with bitcoin instead of national currency. They set it up with some sympathetic cause, promised to pay you back for helping them, make it seem free at first but hit you with a need for you to give money to a site you're not at all familiar with. You should've noped out of there the moment it asked for money from you, yourself, if not sooner.

Good ol December 15th, 2017. How far we’ve come within a year

This fucked with my brain because the orientation of the stamp itself is not the orientation it’d be at to put the stamp on the paper but I just realized it was turned
