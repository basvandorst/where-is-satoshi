if the value of the USD increased 1000% or something ridiculous like bitcoin nobody would buy anything made in america, we'd all lose our jobs to outsourcing &amp; companies would only import goods. conversely, if the USD became worthless then foreign actors would simply buy up all our assets... it's necessary for a stable, functioning (world) economy that the u.s. federal reserve have the power to control inflation &amp; deflation by manipulating the money supply and interest rates.

pretty sure we're a lot more prosperous now lol, the 1800's were riddled with disease and short lifespans, quality of life wasn't great... if you're talking about pure numbers / GDP, yeah the 1890's were a great improvement for USA where they finally became competitive with other countries, many were still better than us, i think we were ranked 4th. nowadays we're  by a longshot - our GDP is nearly double that of the country in 2nd place (china, which is a currency manipulator) and we're 4x higher in GDP than japan which is in 3rd place.

i think the real point of this question involving scarcity revolves around how easily people will have access to bitcoin. scarcity implies that you may not be able to get any, but since bitcoin is infinitely divisible scarcity isn't a real problem - you will always have access to some amount of bitcoin. 
you can't take a dollar bill and rip it up into an infinite amount of pieces all worth the appropriate fraction of a dollar - so if there were a limited supply of dollars and no one was trading them this would be a real problem for people who had none. there is no such problem of scarcity involving bitcoin since instead of printing additional whole dollar bills you can just make more infinite fractions of those bills...

wonder if close acquaintance took huge short positions on bitcoin...

yeah, countries with failing currencies will have a hard time turning their fiat into crypto - guess they should have got in sooner? and honestly, i don't see 1st world countries (where all the money is) failing anytime soon

bitcoin's resilience doesn't come from the tech (which is basically useless), it comes from personal greed. bitcoin can't die because miners, developers, and users are fighting each other for wealth in a system of checks and balances.

bitcoin's significance isn't simply due to it being the "first" in the sense that originality/ authenticity has value to consumers (it does, a little). bitcoin is also more protected against attacks because it has the biggest network/ longest blockchain, which in-turn enhances consumer confidence. people use bitcoin because it's safer, and it's safer because it's more used. everything about bitcoin seems to have these self-fulfilling checks &amp; balances in a way that i'm not sure it can be stopped.

i'd agree with your general sentiment, many people didn't believe personal computers would be as important as they are today. but they solved real problems, doing things much better than existing tech. i don't see how bitcoin is much more useful/ convenient than credit cards, or paypal/ venmo. the level of usefulness of a new tech dictates how quickly it goes mainstream.

isn't new tech supposed to solve a problem, though? how will bitcoin ever be in demand if the majority of people don't need it and don't care? perhaps someday in the future when the global economy collapses and bitcoin is the only escape...

I should have bought bitcoin in 1913, all those dollars I had back then have gone to shit!

i don't understand how that happens, i mean, who's trading bitcoin to venezuelans for their useless currency? i can see if they're somehow able to get bitcoin they'd be better off, but venezuelans have food &amp; goods shortages as well, their problems aren't so easily remedied imo

the drop in 2013 was due to china appearing to ban btc, right? this drop seems more like people taking profits at an arbitrary 10k

may or may not be "financial institutions" but it should be obvious that all sorts of manipulations and fraud would exist in relatively unregulated markets...

if the price going down is good... and the price going up is good... is there anything that would be bad for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:17:05
free transactions or gtfo
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:17:37
will they ban bitcoin or just exchanges/ alt-coins? if this is FUD, how will it impact NEO?

Banks are liable for all purchases you make with them, even with debit cards - too many people probably tried to claim they were victims of identity theft or tried to reverse charges or complained of fraud... The bank can either decide to not protect their customers or simply deny unsafe purchases, they made the correct choice. Anytime Bitcoin crashes a lot of people's lives are ruined and banks are stuck making difficult decisions...
