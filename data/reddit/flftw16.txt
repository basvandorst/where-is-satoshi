Every post I read about LN gets me so fucking pumped. I believe we will see 50k or even 100k bitcoin within 12-24 months as the main reason for alts (cheap tx) dries up and people flood into BTC. Even BCH fans will make a killing by switching back to the mother coin.

You're a major faggot for writing this.
Greed is good. Greed makes the world go round. It's your desire to get a promotion, or start a new enterprise, or invest for a return. Greed is wanting more for yourself. Greed is wanting the BEST LIFE you can possibly have, because THIS IS your life and it's the only one you get, so you want it to be the best it can possibly be.
I'm greedy with my time. I got tired of working shit jobs for minimum wage, and what little money I earned and saved **depreciated** in value year after year. Punished for saving.... Then I learned about bitcoin. Finally an asset I could own and hoard, that would GAIN value, and improve my life in the future.
If you want an altruistic coin buy more Doge and have fun buying ad space on racecars or whatever it is they do. I'm in this for ME and MY family. I couldn't care less about you and yours. I don't wish you ill but I have no patience for people who don't want to claw their way up, or people who virtue signal toward those who do. I'm in this game thanks to my own greed. It's why I refuse to sell. My hold game has been strong and will continue to be. 


If I ever get to the point where I only own 1.5btc it will be because I have lost all hope in the project and cashed out. If that happens you can be sure my greed will have led me to greener pastures or I will have diversified to stocks, bonds, gold, or something else. Honestly, you have given up entirely on bitcoin, you are down to 0.0025 of your original 600 but you are lecturing people about how you believe in bitcoin changing the system. You aren't protesting the monetary system by being 99.9975% in fiat you soap box preacher.

If they became a hub for bitcoin it would increase the use of FB marketplace. They could charge a small fee for anyone buying BTC, they could engage in market manipulation like coinbase did, every time the market got volatile they can manipulate trades, slow them down, reverse them with a delayed delivery policy. There are many, many ways FB could get involved and skim from the top with bitcoin.

You are looking back with rose colored glasses. Many people, myself included, got into crypto because we were tired of being bullied by nation states that restrict capital flow, that print endless paper dollars/yuan/whatever backed by nothing. The only reason crypto became necessary is because fiat is fundamentally broken, the federal reserve is broken, commercial banking is broken, remittance industry is broken. Your average person is fleeced by taxes and fees and inflation. We are treated like fucking cattle and our future is entirely uncertain. Few in my generation will retire at all.
I didn't get into this to play captain save-a-hobo. I don't care about you, your family, or your money problems. I care about MINE. Greed is good. Greed, and the desire to improve one's self, and one's lot in life, leads men to take risks. 


The original plan was to build a parallel system. We can't destroy fiat banking but we can ignore it.

If OP's fictitious uncle's pension was 50k, and he put 25k or half into bitcoin exactly one year ago, he would have purchased 31.72 BTC, which would, at 19k today, be worth ~602,000 USD.

Death by a thousand cuts is real. I'm worried because during a critical moment when hundreds of thousands of people are entering the crypto world they are being exposed to massive levels of toxicity in this community. 
Look at where ETC is compared to ETH. Don't be complacent. BCH has salespeople, shills, conmen, and they are relentlessly attacking bitcoin for their own profit. LN can't come soon enough, until then we are at risk and the attacks will only grow more ferocious. Newcomers don't give a shit about centralization or all the long term problems with BCH, they are just throwing money into whatever looks like it will make a quick profit. The wrong coin could win. Don't be cocky. Mount Everest is covered with the corpses of highly motivated individuals.

Not OP but I will try to explain OP's position... SatoshiDICE is a small online betting platform. They aren't a large retailer like Starbucks, McDonalds, or Walmart. They are just ONE small gambling site, and they alone are using 6% of BCH's block space. So OP's point is that making bigger blocks did not meaningfully scale the coin.

People like wealth and try to acquire it. Doesn't matter if it's gold, dollars, or a magic internet money. Wealth is wealth. If an existential flaw were discovered in bitcoin, do you expect people to go down with the ship out of love for the algorithm? They would sell as quickly as possible and invest in an alt that didn't have the flaw, or into property, or fiat, or gold, or stocks. Everyone *cares* about Bitcoin only so much as it is a tool to conduct free trade, to bypass the banks, and to grow wealthy. The Winklevoss like it for the same reason everyone here likes it.

Well first there would need to be a criminal or civil complaint that would require law enforcement to launch an investigation. If a theft occurred, and if suspects are located, and if there is evidence of a crime, law enforcement and the existing court system can absolutely do fuck-all about it, including fines or prison time for people who stole.
What is the difference if you have fiat in stolen from your house, or fraudulent credit card transactions committed in your name? Can the police do nothing? They try to find who did it, gather evidence, imprison the perpetrators and return what was stolen *if possible*. All of this occurs under a philosophical system that recognizes the concept of private property. Since we don't live in a communist utopia, thievery requires a reaction by law enforcement whether the thing that was stolen was tangible or digital.

Investing in an asset and investing in a company are both driven by greed. No one builds or invests in something to give it away for free. The world runs on people working for their own self-interest. The main impetus to bypass the current banking/financial system is because *they* were too greedy with something that *we* want to control--our own money. Thus greed for ownership of our own money/asset is what has made bitcoin into the phenomenon it is today.

When bitcoin hit an all time high in 2013 and then had a 2 year bear market its value slowly tumbled; it made sense to spend bitcoin as it was seen, at least temporarily, as a depreciating asset.
Now it's rightly seen as something that will gain a lot of value, so people are holding it as much as they can, not spending it. It therefore makes sense to hold it, because the more people want to hold onto it, the more the value will increase. This was a poor time for you to sell. There will only ever be 21m coins and there are billions or at the very least hundreds of millions of people interested in owning a piece. There are 50m USD millionaires in the world, so not even enough coins for every millionaire to own 0.5 BTC. And many coins are owned by early adopters, crypto nerds, and lost forever for various reasons.
Given all of this, I'm amazed anyone, especially a long term holder, would cash out completely. Seems crazy to me. But, at least you locked in your profits. Any time I locked in profits from selling small amounts I wish I didn't have to. I've only sold chunks because I needed the cash flow. Anyway thanks for sharing your perspective.

Years ago I worked at a big box store and some guy I worked with bragged that he was a "stock trader." Yeah right. Even in my teens I owned stock but never deluded myself that I was a "trader." Anyway, this coworker would check his stocks constantly, and often say stuff like "damn, the price is going down, time to sell." He always bought high and sold low. He did trading the exact opposite of how you are supposed to which is probably why he was a bald headed man working customer service at Circuit-fucking-City. Talk about a chump.

Frankly I am surprised so many people in this community were so incredibly stupid and blind about Gox. Months and months ago when I was deciding to get into BTC I researched the exchanges and people were complaining about difficulties withdrawing from Gox. I just had this instinctive feeling that it was a big red flag and I would rather deal with a regulated albeit slow broker (Coinbase) where I can actually get my money back.
We've had so many examples of outright scams. There are so many options out there I just can't fathom why people supported Gox for so long. My guess is that bitcoiners have a herd mentality just as much as fiat-money users do.

I'm pretty sure drones won't be buzzing around 20 feet off the ground. There will probably be a set altitude they are permitted to fly at, something like between 150-250 feet. From a restaurant or warehouse they will launch straight up, then bee line for the target address, then descend straight down near a doorstep. They will be above small houses and are high up enough that they won't be easily heard, but below the minimum altitude for human flown craft (I think 500 ft). I bet they already have it figured out. What takes longer is the gov't probably wants to tax every flight or some stupid shit like that.

At a certain point it become to onerous to move money. And this isn't really fair, because these are 0s and 1s moving through computers. Bitcoin needs to be the value of gold with the functionality of cash, or, really, anything we do online. And it can be, and probably will be, soon.

Look at the about page of coinbase, real names, real pictures, a real brick and mortar address. Compliance. Shirt and tie. Hey maybe it's a scam, but it's less likely to be a scam because they show all of the social indicators of being law abiding, trustworthy people, and they use their real names.

Nice ad hom attack for pointing out the obvious. If someone were exchanging into USD would you not want them to understand the VERY BASIC FACTS about that currency, for example that 100 pennies make 1 dollar?
The Bitcoin market is incredibly volatile and people lose money all the time due to fluctuations but also gaps in security and accidents. If someone is SO in the dark that they don't know literally the first thing about bitcoin they are not ready to exchange it. They may fall victim to their own ignorance while you cheer them on like a lemming. 
What's next, you going to start cheerleading people into buying Ripple? 
Rule  understand before you buy. Buyer beware. Read and educate yourself before you toss your paper around n00bs!

Looks like you are correct. [According to this pyramid]( name calling is just below ad hominem.

No. They are a victim of their own decision to not hire more employees to answer support tickets. They have been like this for years. The fact that tens of thousands of people are *throwing money at them* just means that they have no excuse.

I think you are wrong for linguistic reasons. Satoshi, at three syllables is too long and clunky. Bitcoins at two syllables is good, but this can be shortened to 'bits'. We should call them bits. And what we now call 1 bitcoin should be known as 1 satoshi. Having 1 satoshi would be like having a gold bar. It's a lot of coin.

just call them 'bits'

Weird video. Imagine you walk into a gold store to buy gold and they have sexually suggested music thumping in the background. Doesn't instill confidence to a customer no matter how clean and professional the service is.

Completely false simile. But go ahead and feel smug. Investing money is much more serious than washing dishes, but maybe to a simpleton they appear to have the same complexity. Bitcoin, Ripple, or any of [history's Ponzi scheme examples]( who cares! Don't bother to study and understand FIRST, just throw your money at it! Any amount will do, because one day you'll be RICH!

No I don't, but if he is going to act like Bank of America but with bitcoins I hope he would tell me before hand so I could not waste my time with his bullshit.

I don't understand why. Are you a salesmen making money from transferring BTC or are you some sort of moral police force?
What if they are buying BTC to give to kidnappers that have their daughter in an underground bunker? Are you going to be "harsh" and refuse to sell them your product? I don't see how its any of your business what people do with the BTC.

THANK YOU for making this post. I have been advocating the term 'bits' for months and wanted to make a post but was afraid it would just be ignored and downvoted.

Why does Peter Schiff deserve a debate? He has proven that he doesn't even understand the fundamentals. One can not "debate" something one does not fully understand.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:08:07
I've been telling people to call them bits for months now. Bits is one syllable, four letters. Simple, easy, beautiful.

My account is at coinbase and I am only allowed 10 BTC limit. I ordered 10 just before the price dropped from 125 to 102. Wasn't allowed to order any more until the first order arrives. ffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Bitcoin is a currency and therefore it will be used by the already-rich and powerful to maintain their wealth and power. There is nothing you can do about it and what you want doesn't matter much.

Have used coinbase for months. Always on time and never any issues.

Stories like this scare me. It's a sober reminder of what can happen when you go "all in."
