Holy shit. That is so interesting.
He's also right. I thibk loosely it means that a stockade bitcoin are based on how much someone will market and pay for it. 
It depends on how much you can convince the other guy that it's worth something.
But I would argue that this is true for any currency.... a dollar bill is just a piece of paper with a dead guys portrait on it. But it's easy to convince everyone that it's worth 100 dollars when the entire world will accept it for 100 dollars.
By that same measure.. bitcoin as a currency is gaining so much legitimacy right now. It has sustained extremely high values for a long time and it is scarce, and becoming adopted more and more widely. I'm 2010 it was just a fringe currency used by nerds and criminals/
He's right. But it's not a bad thing for bitcoin

this is sick. I agree, I would get rid of the background numbers not being there.
I am actually going to use this.

Luke,he invited Core. It is honestly pretty bad that no one from Core showed up to this huge important meeting with so many major players from the industry. You can't complain about the agreement they came to after, it would have been much more constructive if you were there. , 
Now can you please give a better reason for not supporting this other than this is a MASF BIP148 which you dont think they will actually do 
 (because you are assuming the worst in everyone).
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:11:48
but how so? Barry said he would find a middle ground last week. THey just had a meeting yesterday and showed the results of it today. is it so secretive?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:01:42
but if i buy it in the US and send it to a wallet in japan? and is it illegal?
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:24:28
how do you think we can make it more transparent? There must be a way.
but for now I am not looking to raise anything, but to make a team and generate a plan.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:06:52


OK i am all for Segwit and a long time lurker on r/bitcoin. Im on all of your sides.
But, this seems like a compromise. 
There was no secrecy, the meeting was yesterday and they are giving the full proposal today, barry said he was going to find a consensus. 
We get Segwit, they get 2MB, what is the big deal. Someone please explain to me
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:08:16
Yeah, except this is a compromise and we get Segwit. Is it so bad? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:01:54
can you please give a reason for not supporting this other than this is a MASF BIP148 which you dont think they will actually do.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:19:19
oh thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:02:22
Honestly. Great point.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:07:13
Honestly, sick perspective-- didn't think of it that way.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:25:03


i think my goal right now is to push this idea and bring people together around it. I dont think any single person can get this done no matter how technically sound/wealthy they are, its just too much for one person and will require a team first. 
I am going to find people to work with me. I have done this before, oftentimes people are very willing to help out and become a part of something they think is important. 
Im definitely not ready to publicly start asking for money yet, who knows how long or short that will take. 
But I think you have a great perspective and I would be very happy if you joined and helped.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:56:57
Oh, didn't know that. 
Still, not a good site. But the post says he wanted "to make the world a more peaceful place,"--- not really.
But I stand corrected.

this is fucking sick. theoretically is there not a discount too given the inflated prices of bitcoin in japan 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:30:38
this isnt some backroom deal. They met literally 2 days ago and we find out now. They publicly announced it too. Are they not allowed to hold meetings to discuss the industry they are in? Did Barry not state he would try to find a middle ground for the last 2 weeks. Did VIABTC not hold that online pool to see if users wanted Segwit.
I think Jihan Wu is super shady -- for sure. But at the same time, this is a step forward. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:58:08
ok well its a process. Obviously core and everyone at that meeting hate eachother. 
This is the beauty of bitcoin. This is how the process works. There's a constant back and forth. I would be curious to see how Core responds. But, they did not act maliciously. 
Truthfully, everyone on this thread has come up with 10 different, sometimes contradictory reasons why this is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:48:33
i believe it..
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:15:27
yeah i agree.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:20:11
Didnt he make a website where you could hire people to murder others? Sorry-- fuck off Ross-- that's fucked up. Downvoted.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:10:52
ok come on, im all for you guys, but lets just meet in the middle, this you get segwit with 2MB. 
I feel like there is no reasonable objection to this request. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:29:03
please enlighten me. perhaps I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:43:21
im sorry for being a rude contentious asshole
 
I think you displayed great class in how you handled this, even though you disagreed with everything you still did this work.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:42:22
Wow, really helpful summary
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:01:11
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:50:53
honestly, as much as bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, you cant escape the reality that there are other major players. The wallets matter. The mining companies matter. The ETFs matter. They are all trying to make bitcoin work and its in no ones interest to have the coin fail.
UASF did its job. This wouldnt have happened without the pressure that UASF imposed. 
Segwit is happening. And the block size is increasing.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:18:07
hahaha, too much effort then.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:40:07
Hi Bearwhale
How would you feel about supporting a crowdfunding campaign to create an affordable ASIC chip for the masses, as a solution to compete against mining centralization, which threatens the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:40:20
I think it has to be decibit.

I think you displayed great class in how you handled this, even though you disagreed with everything you still did this work.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:01:15
its a proposal, they are not shoving this down our throats.
The market will ultimately decide. 
But, I am all for it, though I am cautious given jihan's shady past. But lets not make perfect the enemy of good.
