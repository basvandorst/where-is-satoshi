this crash may also be temporary as some see it as a sale and not a crash. But thats from all my reading - only started buying things in june lol

i got into crypto recently. Way to late, just before this so called dip i bought some bitcoin lol. I bought a few alts before so im ok, but seriously i was always told bitcoin was the one - hoping itll continue to rise but literally everyone else i meet in real-life and now hehe, and most ppl on reddit (outside of r/bitcoin) tell me its a fucking stupid investment. I guess time will tell ....

how do you put those back on coinbase. Or does coinbase mean to say that they will never support it so one would have to find another exchange.

Is this wallet compatible with the fork?
Once i backup my bitcoins on this wallet. how long and when do i send them back to an exchange? I assume coinbase will never support the new coins?  Also, since there will be BTC and BCC private keys duplication, how do I get this double cash when I transfer my money back from this wallet?

do you mean if i hold stuff on coinbase during the aug1 fork i will lose money. But leaving it on there now im not losing money am i?

i have coinbase. Are you suggesting just converting all bitcoin into ETHER? ie transfer my btc to ether? through coinbase?
