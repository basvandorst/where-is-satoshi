Rumor is that Bitcoin is the million dollar coin of the future. News is that it's rapidly losing value. 
So..... sell?
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:50:25
Everything will be alright. Take your 1 coin and keep it. You'll be glad. If you're worried about the orice, just buy some more when you think it's fallen quite a bit. But only buy. Do not sell. 
I lost so much money trading altcoins, spending my btc on dorkweb drurgs, losing it to scammers, etc. 
If I had just bought and held like literally everyone on here recommended, I would have nearly $50K from an investment of only a few thousand. Don't be me. 
Welcome! You own a full bitcoin! Very few people ever will. Enjoy it.

Same as always, more people want to buy than want to sell.

Guilty.

Which means the market cap is actually much lower, considering a large portion of it is lost forever.

I sold it all at $17K and am waiting till $3-4K to start rebuilding my position. 
The pattern is simple: after megapeaks, 2 yearish settling to the last peak price, then a rapid appreciation after halvening. Once you are 10x from base price, sell. 
Next peak will probably be 40-75Kish, I think. But I'm not buying yet.

Enjoy your daytrading.

It's moments like these when I remember how horrible and toxic the bitcoin community is and how much I like taking your money.

Thanks for this amazing insight, Mr Zeitgeist.

The drop started in late summer. It won't bottom out till $4K, but go ahead and buy if you feel stupid and rich. I've been mostly trading stocks for the last six months. It's been just okay, volatility trading isn't really my bag.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:14:55
Sometime next year for the bottom is my guess. The next big bull run will probably begin shortly after the next halvening. And it'll peak at around 5-10x of the last peak. Same as always. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:19:44
The crash after the last super spike eventually hit $200 from 2K, a 90% loss from the peak. Don't see why this one should be any different, $2k is a perfectly reasonable price for BTC.

The investment that is flowing in will never pay off. Prices are dropping too fast. Farms are laying off workers. In parts of Oregon, prices are below $100/oz for top quality herb. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:46:26
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:35:24
All the applications you are talking about are opportunities for commercial scale agriculture. 
The investment is chasing $20/gram. $20/lb is probably in our future. 
The industry has a bright future, it's just not the one that all the big money is after.

Yeah, and all those drugs are illegal, and our current policies hurt the users more than the drug does.
Making drugs illegal doesn't make them go away. Making drugs legal doesn't make them mandatory or even approved of. 
It seems you're more interested in the "message" of the policy than  the outcomes.

No issues here.

Some kinds of centralized networks may have more utility in certain situations. This does not imply that Bitcoin has less utility because it is more decentralized.

Many people refrain from making darknet purchases on weekends due to USPS operating hours. This may help explain the weekend backlog clearing.

I would hedge by cashing out some of your girlfriend holdings in the form of time. Take some profit and see if she hits rock bottom enough to reinitiate soemthing serious.
