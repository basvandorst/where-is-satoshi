...he said with 16 hours left in the day.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:53:20
No, but my ⌘R keys are.

No, there's just a bunch of people trying to use the exchanges right now.  Bittrex has tweeted about it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:43:20
That's not a crash.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:07:06
They've tweeted about it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:35:19
Please don't make fun of morons like me. :(
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:13:30
Yes, once exchanges support it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:38:07
He only had .01 BTC though, which is the minimum trade amount on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:33:33
12:20 UTC, which was about 13 minutes ago.  We need to wait for the next block in the chain.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:30:56
It's down right now, but I was watching 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:06:09
No.  The Bitcoin Cash pool has just not mined since the fork would have happened yet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:32:58
Yeah, for sure.  The message on the site changed here from "NO CHAIN SPLIT DETECTED" to "NO UNPLANNED CHAIN SPLIT DETECTED", that's mostly it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:19:21
Maybe you can sell your fame?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:07:17
Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:26:46
Not normally, I'm not sure why.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:49:51
I believe trades are still happening, but deposits/withdraws are not.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:12:42
Well that's just great, now you've forced me to load more data since I'm watching both versions!
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:49:47
Oh, cool, we're doing this like an exchange.  I'll put up a sell order for 0.00100001 BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:12:20
This was my first time using Gemini, and I purchased $250 USD worth of BTC on there literally the day before the fork.  It's a "pre-credited USD deposit" since I didn't use a wire-transfer, so I'm hoping I'm still properly credited.  I imagine I will be.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:40:30
Ahh, I see now on 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:06:49
I didn't cash in immediately at 12:20 UTC because I wasn't sure if I'd get them, but I now have a BCC wallet on Bittrex with the same about of BTC I have.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:09:35
Just tried to submit this as well, you beat me by 2 minutes. :D  Glad to see we're going to get our BCC!
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:33
Bittrex isn't down.  Their login is just not working due to high demand.  If you're already logged in, the site's working fine.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:45:59
Not yet.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:54:10
Maybe he only had CD-Rs, not CD-RWs.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:22:45
At what point (time of day) on or after August 1st will it be "safe" to move my bitcoins back from my private wallet onto an exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:20:52
I have a blockchain.info wallet too, and I have the same question.  I have my 12 words, which I think means I can get ahold of the private key, so I should be good then, right?
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:54:21
Noob here, what is "ICO"?
**Edit:** is it "initial coin offering"?
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:27:47
Thank you, but I'm interested in the value for an individual exchange rather than an average across exchanges.  Specifically, I'm talking about the "Mid Market Price" seen on GDAX here:

ELI5: How does this benefit you personally, and how does this benefit the world of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:20:09
Interesting idea, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:52:35
New to Bitcoin trading.  Can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:46:23
It's back!
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:12:48
Thanks.  I've heard of arbitrage, but I didn't know if there was more to it.  I guess there are enough bots/systems that people have built that this will keep the exchanges pretty even.
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:35:21
Thanks for the summary!  Your edit was about to be my next question. :D
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:10:39
I'm new to Bitcoin.  Can someone link to an article that can explain what Bitmain is?
