explained at a recent dev meetup that when miners upgraded Core to support segwit, we went something like 8,000 blocks without a single orphan. This isn't due to segwit itself, but due to all the other code improvements added to Core over the past year. Miners just never upgraded until segwit was locked in.

Yeah I hear it! Erik's main criticism of Bitcoin is the wasted energy and he's right, that is the elephant in the room. Although he is a commodity trader and a hard money guy and he doesn't mention how much energy gold mining, oil drilling, paper currency or the current financial system waste. 
He really is into this HashGraph system, so I'll have to research that tomorow :-) it sounds a bit like IOTA conceptually, but hopefully with competent developers I'm not sure how double spending or Sybil attacks are prevented, or really what the point is if it's not a currency. 
Erik also doesn't mention that mining energy does not scale up as the network scales up. As far as I know, the  current hashrate is sufficient to support Bitcoin network growth by orders of magnitude. More users or more transactions does not mean more energy wasted.
And finally you're right, if the value drops then miners will bail out and the security of the blockchain will be more risky. I don't know what to say about that except that again, we have more hash than we need right now and I believe there will always be enough security for a decentralized cryptocurrency, even if it is banned by every country on Earth.
What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:40:40
Hasn't BitPay been using BIP70 forever? I feel like every time I use Breadwallet to buy something on Adafruit it's a BIP70 QR code. When scanning the QR code, Breadwallet displays a "lock" icon followed by invoice information, etc. 
I remember when Gavin introduced BIP70 and the controversy around using SSL certificates, because they are authorized by a central authority, but it's the "current best option" to authenticate payment requests. 
Am I wrong? @_date: 2018-01-09 13:20:30
If the hash rate increases and blocks start getting mined too quickly, the difficulty will increase and require more energy. You're right about that. But consider empty blocks, or ten megabyte blocks. One transaction per second or a thousand -- those factors do NOT affect the difficulty. 
So the energy used by bitcoin miners is independent of the number of users transacting on the system. A higher price might incentivize more people to start mining, but that's a different story. You might also consider that the legacy financial system wastes more energy the more it is used, whereas Bitcoin may only need a certain fixed amount of energy to stay secure forever.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:49:47
Well that's too bad, I used to like Erik when he was a regular guest on the Financial Sense podcast. I even exchanged emails with him about Bitcoin in early 2014...
Of course it's silly to assume that Bitcoin will be the **THE** cryptocurrency when it's really just the first. And I'm glad he acknowledges that blockchains are here to stay -- but this paper is just another *"blockchain: the technology behind Bitcoin"* article. What they seem to miss is that the native token is the built-in incentive that keeps the system decentralized. A blockchain without a cryptocurrency is just a slow, inefficient database. Without proof-of-work (or at least proof-of-stake) you're just trusting some glorified authority. So there's no innovation there. We've had cryptographic signatures for what, 40-50 years? And it takes the invention of Bitcoin for writers like Townsend to suddenly think publicly verifiable transactions are useful? Oh, but without the censorship-resistance or cryptographic reduction of trust of course.
Maybe Bitcoin will one day be outlawed by governments worldwide, and it will be pushed into the black market and dark web. He acknowledges that it can never be killed and he's right. It's user-base could be decimated and it's price slashed but cryptocurrency will *always* be able to accomplish its purpose: censorship-resistant, trustless value transfer with no central point of failure.

Greenaddress does but it's UI is terrible (currently) and relies on a centralized server. 
Bitwallet does but it relies entirely on APIs like blockchain.info
Breadwallet has it on the roadmap but they are trying to be the easy beginner wallet so it'll take a while. This is AFAIK the only true SPV iOS wallet though. 
Airbitz rebranded as Edge and you can beta test it with test flight. No bech32 yet but the model is good, it uses electrum servers so it's essentially SPV security.

Almost every up to date mobile Bitcoin wallet has a 12 or 24-word seed that can be backed up by the user. Many apps also make use of a phone's built in encryption hardware or "secret enclave" to protect the seed. If you lose your phone, you have a solid head start to restore your seed on a new device and move the funds before anyone finds and compromises your phone.
That being said, of course mobile wallets are more risky and should only be used as a "hot" wallet with smaller amounts of funds, depending on your personal risk toelrance.

There is no "the" mempool. Every node has its own pool of unconfirmed transactions it knows are valid. Nodes could all have different size maximums, fee policies or age policies. I'm not sure what the default behavior of Core is once it's max is reached (would know?) probably it dumps old or low fee transactions first. 
Bitcoin core also re-broadcasts its own wallet transactions periodically if they don't confirm. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:54:24
My wallet is asking for the mnemonic all over again. I don't have it with me right now! I just installed and set up the wallet a few days ago, now it's useless until I get back to my seed. 
I have a ton of other problems with the UI as well (clunky interface, no "back" or "cancel" button on "create new wallet" screen). Honestly I desperately want a bech32 wallet on iOS but I don't trust GA, it feels old and unfinished.

I don't understand why we are even talking about trade offs between security and Tx fees, when the miner income is still around like 99% subsidy. Isn't the whole point of the subsidy to bootstrap the network? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:01:50
Don't know if I'm any smarter than you but the theoretical threat from quantum computers is that they can potentially "derive" private keys from public keys. Or at least brute-force that process in a realistic time-frame. HASHING, however, is still just as irreversible. So mining couldn't be attacked, but we would have to find a more secure Asymmetric key system.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:00:14
The genesis block subsidy coins can not be spent. However, all the other bitcoins that address has since received CAN be spent. Either way, whoever owns that private key can sign any message at any time.

It's not about currency is why, it's about trustless interaction with time stamping:

Yeah, you CAN write entire blocks of data to the blockchain and people do, but it's expensive, and some people protest.
Next question: totally subjective, it's up to you. No added beneift or security or speed, you're just using the blockchain. If I have 10 bitcoin wallets on a bunch of different devices and I send money back and forth all day long and pay miners fees for 100's of transactions... does Bitcoin gain anything?

1: Hash the document. Then there are 2 easy ways of putting that in the blockchain: One is to include that hash as a 0-value "OP_RETURN" output, a special OP code that specifically allows up to 40 bytes of data. An easier way, use the hash as a private key, calculate the public key, and send it a tiny amount of money. In either case, the original document can be "proved to have existed" at the time of the transaction's inclusion into the blockchain. The original document must be kept so that it's hash can be recalculated in the future.
2 &amp; 3: All transactions cost fees. They exist in part as an anti-spam mechanism. Still, for some people it is worth the money to include large chunks of data in the blockchain. They pay for it and, although some community members think it is some kind of pollution, it must be allowed if we are to have a free, open, public ledger.

The sidechain has to be secured with some type of mining, I think it can even be proof-of-stake. Sidechain mining can either implement fees-only or the "Demurrage" model would be an inflationary sidechain where sidecoins are created out of thin air, and reduce all the sidecoin holders' actual Bitcoin value.
The fees will have to be denominated in sidecoin, because the sidechain "doesn't know" about anything else.
So let say you move 1 BTC into SIDECOIN. You spend 0.5 SIDECOIN by sending to a merchant, which requires a 0.1 SIDECOIN miner fee.
After 100 blocks (or whatever it is) you can now redeem your remaining 0.4 SIDECOIN for 0.4 BTC. The merchant can redeem his 0.5 SIDECOIN for 0.5 BTC, and the miner can redeem his 0.1 SIDECOIN for 0.1 BTC. Everything adds up.
** of course on the Bitcoin side there will be additional bitcoin fees for those miners.

Still, though, nodes that do not upgrade will not see any signatures and in that sense can not validate SW transactions... right? Technically the "nothing to see here" Tx still returns true, but a node that refuses to upgrade will have to wait for the majority hash power to include a Tx in a block to ensure that a miner has seen the signatures and validated them.
Example: My home computer is stuck on OSX 10.6.8, I can not upgrade past core 0.10 :-(
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:19:07
One nice thing about payment channels is that, if the two parties cooperate, you can keep it open forever. The trick is, throw out the refund transaction, and start a new refund transaction with an additional 30 days. If one party flakes out no one loses any money, but if you can work together you save on actual blockchain fees and just reboot the channel as often as you like.

@_date: 2015-06-09 18:35:04
For the current implementation of Elements-alpha, it's the Blockstream developers. There's no way to know if any of them individually has all seven private keys, or if each human on the team generated one and they combined them into the 5-of-7. Before the Bitcoin soft fork, this is how it must be done. If you want to use the Elements system and all it's cool features, you have to trust Blockstream the company.
Each node has one private key.

So the federated system is like an off chain web wallet. It controls the real Bitcoin keys, and can generate transactions of any amount back into Bitcoin at the valid request of a sidechain user redeeming his sidecoins?

I encountered this as well. If you read up on payment channels, I think you will find that the refund transaction is invalidated if the payment channel is closed properly. So if both parties "work it out" and settle to the blockchain, the channel is closed and the refund unnecessary. You just need that in case something goes wrong. 
I could be wrong about this though but that's my understanding. The refund Tx is just "insurance" to keep the process trustless.

No the refund Tx is a fail-safe. Ideally it never gets broadcast at all. So if you get to day 29 and want more time, just create and multi-sign a new refund fail-safe for another 30 days. 
From the blockchains perspective, everything is imaginary except the Tx that funds an initial multisig address... And the one that spends that output, splitting the value between the two parties. Everything in between is negotiated between the two users, and can stay active forever until communication is broken, or the channel is no longer necessary.

Keep in mind a big part of this debate (championed by Adam Back, is straight-up zero tolerance for contentious hard forks. It almost doesn't even matter that the issue is blocksize.

@_date: 2015-12-08 15:56:12
The signatures are of course still required to validate blocks. However the signatures themselves don't need to be contained in the block, under the 1 MB cap. They are instead transmitted separately, as a separate file "stapled on" to the actual block. 
Older nodes will ignore the extra file and validate the new blocks as being a little strange (all the TX's will be anyone-can-spend, with empty sig fields) but still valid. 
New nodes will validate the extra data, all of which is committed to in the "actual" block by placing a Merkle root in the Coinbase field. 
So we can reach 4 MB blocks with a soft fork. 
I think an easy misconception to make is that somehow we are still only transmitting 1 MB of data every time a block goes out. That's not true. You still need all the data, up to 4 MB worth, to mine and fully validate. But from the perspective of the blockchain (and the older noses) the block size has not increased.

"real world" timestamps are part of the block structure:
This is how the network knows to adjust the difficulty target to keep block generation at about ten minutes each. Nodes ask each other what their internal clocks are reading, and keep track of their discrepancies (the value is called "timeoffset" from bitcoind).

I have asked around about the double spend with higher fee "attack" and the best answer I get is, it won't work. Why? Because the client will not relay a transaction whose inputs are already signed by another transaction, even if it's waiting for a confirmation for days. Once all the network nodes have decided those inputs are used, your only option is to bribe a miner to include your transaction in their next block. Well, that is what confirmnext is supposed to do... Edit: but if you want to try, you can use brainwallet.org to create a tx that eats up all the inputs for an address (the one you want to double spend) and then use it's pushtx to try to broadcast your double spend with higher fee tx to the network... Try it and let us know!
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:15:44
Addresses aren't reused. A new address is generated every time money is received. Although I would like to see eventually a feature added where you can give out a few addresses at a time. 
You have access to your HD seed phrase which can generate addresses forever. So if you are an advanced user taking the right security precautions you can use that seed to generate addresses on a different system.

See this answer to my question about soft-forks a while back:
BIP34, if I understand, is mainly a way to automate upgrades to the system. For P2SH to get adopted, Gavin had to manually watch the coinbase messages from all the miners to see if the upgrade was adopted deeply enough. BIP34 was integrated to make soft-forking upgrades a part of the protocol.

You probably trust your bank because they've been around a really long time and you or nobody you know has been ripped off by them. Over time companies like Coinbase and circle might acquire that type of trust. But it is also easy to find financial companies that have betrayed trust that took a long time to build up. MF Global is one example. 
Unless you are a short-term trader, the best advice you will get around here to use exchanges to purchase Bitcoins, then withdraw them immediately.

I think the confusion is between addresses and transactions. There is only one single transaction output that can not be used in bitcoin, and its the coinbase (block reward) of the genesis block. Even though Satoshi can not spend that 50 BTC, any other bitcoin sent to his address can be spent. So if he spends any bitcoin with that address, and sends change back to that address, he can still spend that change just like any other bitcoin transaction. Is that what you were asking?

Without buying extra equipment and using a ton of electricity, the odds of mining a block by yourself running Qt on your CPU is, these days, impossibly small. So dont burn out your processor by trying. Ive played around with mining before, on my GPU, in a mining pool, and after a few weeks still had not earned even the minimum required to withdraw from the pool. That was almost a year ago.

If you run a full node, YOU do. A cap increase will require a hard fork. I'm sure plenty of users will disagree with it and continue running on the old fork, effectively splitting the currency in to two. Merchants will pick a fork, miners will pick a fork, and other users will pick a fork. It could be a huge mess! But just remember, you as an individual user have some power.

There is an offline decrypt wallet tool you can use with your backup. I link to it in this thread: 
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:14:48
It's an advanced feature on most wallets, that will allow you to enter a 256-bit value as a raw private key, then the wallet will do the rest.
But you can also use [brainwallet](
For my above example, using the hash as a secret exponent, my bitcoin address would be 18gY1DR58fVyyceEtu9YwkqdufcUjT3CRG
You'll also note you can enter any text phrase you want into this website and it will generate a private key and address for you (**INSECURE!**)
Note that this proof of existence requires you to keep the original data so you can prove ("in court") that the bitcoin address you put in the blockchain was derived from that data. There is no backwards-derivation or anything like that, it's a one way process that can be verified again in the future by going that one way again.
ALSO, don't use brainwallet for any important amount of money, and don't use this address-generation technique for any important amount of money, or ever use the address you generate for anything, especially receiving important amounts of money!

The real threats to the petrodollar cycle are 1- the United States discovery of shale oil and natural gas and 2- the rise of China and India as major oil consumers.

Well I'm sure you know better than using the phrase "worry free" when discussing bitcoin. But essentially yes. Your public address is a mail slot. Anyone can always at any time put money in it. To open the mailbox and take the money out, you need a private key. That's the whole deal. Keep that private key safe!! Also look up bip32 to encode your private key with a password.

A special new transaction type will be required to facilitate. Current protocol won't allow it, so a hard fork is necessary. Once that's accepted into the system, the new Tx messages will have a "to sidechain" and "from sidechain" function. Then any amount of bitcoin can go in and out.

Yep, you got it.
The private key is just a number, a very large, very random number. The wallet.dat file is just like a text file with a list of those random numbers. That entire file is encrypted with your password.
There are some bitcoin wallets that DO generate private keys from a 12-word passphrase, so maybe I should specify: so far what I've been describing pertains to Bitcoin Core (formerly Bitcoin-Qt). If you are using blockchain.info, electrum, or other wallet service that gives you a 12-word phrase to write down for backup, that's a different story

Yes, with an HD wallet you can only EITHER:
* give out your master public key
* give out any one of your private keys
If you do both, your entire wallet can be compromised. So just as a general rule of Crypto - never ever reveal any of your private keys to anyone for any reason.

A hash function is a mathematical process that takes an input of any size, and produces an output that is always the same size. (kinda like those big machines that crush cars into cubes...) For example, SHA256 is a hash function. The SHA256 of "hi" is 256 bits. The SHA256 of the entire King James edition of the Holy Bible is also 256 bits.
Hash function outputs are indistinguishable from random, so you can't tell by looking at a 256 bit string if it's the hash of the bible, or just 256 completely random bits in a row.
Finally, hash functions are irreversible. By looking at a 256 bit hash output, there is no way to know what the input was, unless you have that input and can hash it yourself to verify.
Hash functions are used in bitcoin for a bunch of reasons:
* to compress large amounts of data into a consistent, manageable size, like crushing 100 transactions into 256 bits.
* to protect semi-sensitive data (like a public key) because the function  can not be reversed to reveal it's input.
* to make mining difficult, because of the random nature of its output, you never know what you're going to get until you try. And right now, it takes thousands of billions of "tries" to get a block hash that is valid to add a block to the blockchain.

I made it for counterparty. The 12 word phrase seed derivation comes from Counterwallet.co so I don't think it's BIP39. Although that could be easily added to my webapp. 
Either way the master pubkey is a standard format and uses bitcore to derive the public keys starting at... I think m/0/0'/0 because that's what Counterwallet uses. I'm on my mobile and I wrote this code a while ago, but it's open source. 
If OP and maybe others think this would be useful for bitcoin HD wallets I can easily expand the functionality. 
edit - but it does already check the bitcoin balances of the addresses it derives, so it could work right now with a master public key

If you use a quality wallet with secure random number generator it will never happen (the number of potential bitcoin keys is similar to the number of atoms on planet earth, or something like that).

There's no such thing as fraudulent or counterfeit bitcoins. Every transaction starts with coins that already exist. If you were to try to send a transaction through the network with a fake "input" it would immediately get rejected and not sent around the network. It's like asking what happens when if you send an email addressed to "MOM" instead of "mom -- a message that doesn't follow the rules of the protocol goes nowhere.

There wouldn't really have to be any special agreement. I don't know how the mining pools design their blocks, but if this concept is practical at all, I imagine the miners would be incentivized by the large fee in the second Tx. Their software would have to look "one move ahead," and detect that the higher fee is linked to all the micro-Txs. To earn the higher fee on the 2ond Tx, they will have to confirm all the 1st Tx's

It's a probability thing. A "51% attack" can be carried out with less than 50% of the network hash power, but with a lower probability. You could have 60% of the hash power and still not succeed at a "51% attack" just because of luck. There's still lots of people out there trying to solve blocks, and with 51% of the network, you only increase the probability that you will find the next block, and the next, and the next - and do whatever you want to the blockchain.

Mmmm.... no, I don't think so. Just like if you flip a coin nine times in a row and it's heads each time - does that make it less likely to be heads the tenth time? No, it's the same odds every single flip. 
Every time a nonce is hashed it has the same probability of solving a block. It only takes a split second for a miner to update a merkle root, it's not like any miner is "getting close" juuuuust before the merkle root changes... 
The only time this is kinda relevant is in the delay it takes some mining hardware to stop working on a hash, and start over with fresh input.
Although, yes, it is cool that every Tx affects the block hash, and therefore the entire future of the chain. As long as the blockchain is around, my first transaction will still be in there!

You type in your 12-word phrase into the form only once (can be done offline, never sent outside of browser, code is open source...) which uses Bitcore to derive your MASTER PUBLIC KEY.
You can store your MPK on my server (optionally encrypting it with a password for privacy). All your wallet addresses can be derived from the MPK. No one can steal your money using just your MPK.
The disclaimer about HD wallets is, the MPK is safe to reveal as long as you NEVER reveal ANY of the private keys from that wallet.

@_date: 2014-10-23 01:23:24
Well you can send bitcoin to two types of addresses.
Addresses that start with a 1 represent a single public key, that has been hashed into an address. So someone out there generates a private key with their wallet, converts it to a public key, then hashes that to create an address. This is the classic, traditional, old fashioned bitcoin address. You send money to it, and the person who holds the original private key can then spend it themselves. This is called paying to a public key hash. 
Addresses that start with a 3 are more complex. Instead of generating that address by hashing a public key, instead what you hash is a SCRIPT! Wow what's that. A script is a set of instructions written in bitcoin script op codes that run a little program before the coin can be spent again. The popular use case for this is multisig. So if I run a company (like dark wallet, or ethereum) and I want our bitcoins to require multiple signatures to spend, I cook up a script that says "2 of 3 to spend" hash it, and thus create a pay to script hash address. 
The reason OP is stoked a out this is because it means people are using better security methods to hold coins.

Did Coinbase send you a 2fa notification or in any way double check the transaction was legit before sending? I understand you made a mistake but I'm curious if a Tx that size would at least tigger something at Coinbase.

If you use blockchain, make sure you have 2FA enabled on your account, and 2-password encryption on your wallet. Set it up like that before you use it or back it up, so all backups are encrypted.
you might also want to check out GreenAddress.it, they use multisig address to keep your wallet safe. But it's a bit more technically advanced service.

So the double spend attack till requires a connection to a dishonest miner, which makes it impractical for small brick and mortar purchases.
I think I'm understanding Peter Todd's attack described yesterday though - he builds transactions that will be just flat-out rejected by some nodes (for example, new minimum fee in v0.9) and for that reason, the network itself is sort of "forked." Half the network will not accept the first transaction at all, leaving the door wide open (as far as the code highlighted above) for a second transaction to propagate across the network. Then, assuming both Tx's reach a miner, it is up to that miner to decide which Tx to confirm, and of course the higher fee wins

It's definitely possible, just like all the other modifications all the other altcoins are making are possible.

What you are printing is a private key. Youre not printing a "1 BTC bill" the value is not printed. Just the private key. Each private key has a public address mathematically, permanently, associated with it. So you can keep sending money to that address forever. When you want to move those coins, you need to load up that private key into a wallet, then you can access all the coins it was ever sent.

My understanding is: The exact amount of bitcoins that go into a sidechain, may also come out. No more, no less.
So that means: Current existing alt coins (Litecoin, etc) can never be transferred back into the bitcoin blockchain, because no bitcoins were ever sent to the Litecoin blockchain. You can't convert something of value into a sidechain, the value of the sidechain MUST be generated by its parent chain.
In terms of a side chain that is inflationary, generating more units of its currnency - what will happen there is the value of those units will decrease *relative to the bitcoin that was sent to the sidechain.*
An example, as I understand it:
1) You send 1 BTC to your own, brand new sidechain and generate 1 Cryptolutioncoin. 
2) Every block, 1 brand new Cryptolutioncoin gets generated by mining. 
3) Nine blocks later, there will be a total of 10 Cryptolutioncoins in existence, all 10 of which are backed by the original 1 BTC.
4) If you transfer 1 Cryptolution coin back to the Bitcoin parentchain, you will have a transaction worth 0.1 BTC
That's my take... ?
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:56:40

How do I generate new addresses? I can only find one, and it's in the "Edit profile" mode. I can't select the address there, so I can't copy it to paste in an email or anything like that. Is there a "send invoice" function somewhere?
There's a USD option for sending payments, where does that price come from?
I'm guessing we are not downloading the entire blockchain here, do you use the same SPV servers as electrum, etc?

Finally, the mission district. Not sure where exactly would be good, but not only do you have tons of young hip tech employees moving in to that area, there is still a significant Hispanic population, and it would be amazing if bitcoin remittances to Mexico and Latin America could catch on.

What is the fraud here? Why is a bitcoin exchange required at all to stream accurate trading data? No other stock or commodity marketplace reveals its order book to the depth we are accustomed to seeing on bitcoinity.org, etc... In an unregulated free market (which I am a big supporter of) there is no requirement for Mt Gox to tell the truth about anything. Is it fraud? Is it criminal? No, it's basically just a retailer fooling its customers and jacking up its price... am I wrong?

The public key can be mathematically derived from the private key. So if you have the private key safely backed up, you're doing it right. You might also want to keep the public keys separately accessible too so you can easily watch them in the blockchain, and send more money to them.

You can't send anything through bitcoin besides bitcoin. Lots of people consider bitcoin money, though!

Check out proofofexistence.com (I think). 
Alternatively, try this:
1. Hash your document. 
2. Append random private key to that hash
3. Hash again to make a new private key and bitcoin address. 
4. Send a Satoshi to that address
5. Six blocks later you can reveal your original document and all the hashes used to put that Satoshi in the blockchain
6. Throw away that private key because once its revealed it's insecure. But hey, you got your data in the blockchain right?!
@_date: 2014-08-29 21:42:38
Nice! That's clever, the best answer

So the nonce has to be just as securely generated as a private key itself. If a random number generator is known to be flawed, an attacker can predictably "pre-mine" every K value it will ever generate and watch for them in the blockchain.

You're right, it's not as simple as just "key times message," but my point was, a signature can only be generated with a private key. I would not want to live in a world where there is any other way to generate a signature, that is the entire point of the signature algorithm.
The number r is included in the signature. Which means if r*d_a is known, your private key can be derived from your signature and the algorithm is insecure.
BIP32 still requires a master private key to work. It's true that you can generate public keys from the master public key without knowing any of the private keys, but there still has to be one master private key at the root.

Right, but just talking about getting that double spend Tx to propagate... nodes will not relay a double spend. So if I understand Peter Todd's attack, he's taking advantage of the fact that older nodes will not even have the first tx with low fee in the memory pool, because their version of the protocol will reject it. Then when the second tx goes out, the older nodes will relay it ("for the first time") and then yeah it's up to the miners to pick one and confirm it. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:59:57
Got it. Older clients on the network could create separate paths of propagation to the miner.

Search the emails for Coinbase, Blockchain, Mycellium, mtgox, bitstamp, greenaddress, localbitcoins. Look for anything in his office with a QR code on it, or any funny-looking, long strings of numbers and letters like this:

They would need your Master Public Key, which matches the Master Private Key at the core of your deterministic wallet. Be careful with master keys though! Improper use can compromise your entire wallet. 
Safe use of master public keys can be useful for a number of applications: for example an online store that can generate endless amounts of new addresses for payment, but doesn't need to store any of the private keys online to do so.

@_date: 2014-06-08 23:51:50
Yeah theoretically the Tx you broadcast is stored by most if not all of the nodes on the network. So theres a high probability that your tx is in the databases of all the miners. Now whether or not that tx ends up in a block is up to them. But if ghash refuses to confirm you for a few blocks, as soon as another pool mines a block, you could find your tx in there.

LockTime paramater can also be a unix timecode:
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:26:31
This section of the code determines whether or not a new Tx is accepted to the memory pool - the clients database of all unconfirmed transactions. The highlighted area, for a single Tx, loops through all the inputs (unspent bitcoins) of that Tx, and checks to see if that input already exists in the memory pool (a previous Tx has already "claimed" that output, those bitcoins). 
Simpler: For every Tx a client receives, it checks if the input to that Tx has already been used. If it has, this function returns "false" and the Tx is not accepted into the memory pool

Your private keys ARE your money. Who has them? You? Or someone you trust? Trust is fine, but remember, bitcoin is a system designed to work without trust. So, in some sense, if you are trusting someone with your bitcoin keys, you are doing it wrong.
Coinbase and Circle are trying to be trustworthy corporations by building up a good reputation over time. SO maybe you can trust them more than you can trust, I dunno, BTC-E... But how much money do you trust them with? That's a personal decision.

Everyone in this thread is suggesting that you move your coins, but to actually answer your question, regarding the recent vulnerability, there was a specific 3-hour window (or so) in which doing one of the following things would put your BC.i keys at risk:
* Generating a new address
* Sending coins from an existing address
If you did either of these actions during the vulnerability window, well... your coins are probably already swept by Johoe or stolen by someone else.

The gold ETF (GLD, specifically) was great at first, as it got gobbled up by new investors who wanted gold (but actually not really just paper representation of it). However, I think that ETF has really screwed up the spot price of gold, because now the commodity price gets brutally affected by all these investors who just buy and sell little three-letter symbols on their computers all day, with complete disregard for the underlying commodity. It made gold correlate with the rest of the stock market.

Imagine Tx1 has no miner fee, so it sits around unconfirmed. The recipient of Tx1 spends that bitcoin by broadcasting Tx2, consuming the output of tx1, but with a significant fee. Since the fee from tx2 is not mineable until tx1 is, miners are incentivized to prioritize the otherwise unconfirmed tx1, in order to mine the large fee from tx2. Hence, the child (tx2's large fee) pays for the parent (tx1, with no fee)

Now I get to watch tons of transactions for that address. Probably other users testing it out, and someone with a bot that sweeps any coins sent to it. Kind of annoying, but there's no way to remove a key from Bitcoin Core. ("Why would you want to?")

Your private key is needed to move your bitcoins around the blockchain ledger. It is extremely sensitive, because it *IS* your money. Your wallet password encrypts the private keys so if anyone finds or steals your wallet, they can not move your bitcoins.
Your ADDRESS is always safe, and never needs to be encrypted because with your address, an attacker can only give you money! (Not steal your bitcoins)
Your address is generated from your private key with an irreversible mathematical algorithm. Irreversible meaning, your address cannot be used for anything other than sending you money.
Therefore, an address+password combination is actually useless *unless an attacker has your password-encrypted private key*

Got it, very clever. So the creator, in parallel, produces n chains. Then  encrypts the IV of each chain in a quick serial process, and releases those encrypted IVs. The attacker, or I guess "treasure hunter" has to solve each chain one at a time in the right order to decrypt each IV

From Wikipedia:
In 1956, the nation was at a particularly tense time in the Cold War, and the United States wanted to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union, which promoted state atheism.[17] As a result, the 84th Congress passed a joint resolution "declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States." The law was signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, and the motto was progressively added to paper money over a period from 1957 to 1966.[14] (Public Law 84-851)[18] The United States Code at 36 U.S.C. § 302, now states: "'In God we trust' is the national motto."

You sort of have it in the wrong order. The last block is done. The miner listens to the network and gathers Tx's. He adds his reward. He adds the hash of the previous block. He tries a nonce (random number) all that stuff hashed together is the new block. If the hash is below the target (difficulty) the block is valid, and he broadcasts to the network.
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:59:42
The relationship of Private keys to public keys does not rely on sha256, they rely on an elliptical curve algorithm. Public addresses are hashed public keys. And in fact are hashed first by SHA256, and then by RIPE160. So if both of those hash algorithms were compromised, what you could potentially do is figure out what public key generated an address... Or you could just wait for that user to sign a transaction in the blockchain, which requires revealing the underlying public key anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:18:04
Maybe you have too much invested? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:24:54
Quantum computing will not affect hashing functions. A hash function is irreversible. Like crushing a car into a cube and then melting that cube into a bunch of paper clips. The thing to possibly worry about is ECDSA, deriving a private key from the public one -- but since you never reuse bitcoin addresses, and all your addresses are hashes of public keys, you'll be fine right?
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:05:50

One important feature of BIP38 is that it takes a long time to decrypt. So brute force attacks take an impractical amount of time. That is by design, to increase security. A brain wallet phrase is hashed into a private key in way less time. 
And then of course, a BIP38 requires you to have the pass phrase AND the encrypted key. That's two factors. A brain wallet can be guessed and checked against the blockchain without any additional "factors"

* sender uses that weird address to generate an actual bitcoin address, along with a little identifier
* sender creates a Tx like your example, with the identifier embedded in the OP_RETURN output 
* recipient scans EVERY Tx on the network looking for their identifier in the OP_RETURN output
* when identifier is discovered, recipient uses it to calculate the private key necessary to redeem it and spend as normal
note this OP_RETURN identifier is different for every stealth transaction, but the recipient can always detect identifiers being addressed to it

Typical regulation that raises the barrier to entry for small competitive startups. Wouldn't surprise me if Coinbase and Circle helped write it. These are hurdles that big businesses are ready to overcome, can afford to do so, and probably already are. It protects the cartel from new competition.

Bread wallet is also deterministic from the seed, meaning a separate app could generate all the addresses you would ever see in breadwallet. I've been playing with deterministic address generated by a master pubic key on my site  currently configured just for counterparty wallets.
Would you ever use a tool like this?
It would work like this:
- offline, enter 12 word phrase and extract master public key
- online, enter MPK and optionally store it on the server, password encrypted
- log in to the site to check balances and generate new receive addresses, watch-only-wallet-style

@_date: 2014-08-29 21:25:27
You don't need pay-to-script. What you need is nLockTime. I'm not sure if any wallets support it easily, but basically how it works is you create a transaction that is not valid until a certain block number (or unix time) is reached. It's like post-dating a check: you can't put the Tx into the blockchain until the LockTime expires.
The problem is, the original coins you are sending are still perfectly sendable, which would make the locked Tx useless (because their inputs would be gone).
So if you want to give a bitcoin to your spouse, but don't want them to spend it until a certain date, you can generate a Tx from you to them with a locktime. They keep the Tx until 2015 when they can finally redeem the coin... but in the meantime, they have to trust you NOT to move those coins!
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:15:34

I could be mistaken, but I believe the process that makes deterministic wallets possible could apply here. Meaning, when you add two private keys together, then generate a public key from that sum, you end up with the public key A. If you were to take those two private keys, generate separate public keys from them both individually, and then add those public keys together, you will again end up with an identical sum, public key A. 
So if my math is correct, private key holders can generate public keys. Then add those public keys together using modular elliptical curve arithmetic to generate a magic public key, and bitcoin address, without its private key being known. When the parties are ready they can add their private keys together to generate the magic private key. 
The security issue is that a trusted party must collect all the private keys to combine them. Soooooo youre better off using multisig anyway. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:16:17
Really one confirmation should be fine, unless you think this buyer has connections to GHash and they are coordinating a double spend attack on the block *following* your first confirmation.

The 50 BTC generated by mining the block. In the code, the block reward is linked to a "Coinbase" so, not the US bitcoin company, but an actual lingo. That block reward is not entered in the unspent outputs database for whatever reason, and therefore cannot be spent. But every other output that address controls is fair game.

The EnjoySochi Txs will never confirm, so the attacker will always have the option to double spend those satoshis

The US stock market is also killing it right now, attracting global capital as it surges upwards with no bear market or US recession in sight. 
I love bitcoin but what can we do? Well, probably forget about replacing the dollar. Let's start with smaller, weaker fiats and work our way up :)

Traders are always trying to buy before everyone else, and then sell before everyone else. The investors that can handle more risk for a higher reward jump in on something as soon as it's even *plausible*. Then when everyone else with lower risk tolerances start jumping on board as reality sets in, the price starts to rise. Once that first investor has seen a profit on his investment, he sells and takes the profit.

True, all nodes verify Tx messages and pass them along to their peers if they are valid. The mining process then vastly reduces the probability of a double spend, by committing a block of Tx's with a difficult hash. So you're essentially right, it is a bit of a misnomer to say miners validate transactions. Everybody does that, but what makes mining special is it secures valid transactions into an irreversible, cryptographic chunk.
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:04:29

@_date: 2014-03-27 23:07:05
I'm actually working on a double-spending wallet (white hat!). I use the old iPhone blockchain app, which is notorious for forgetting fees. Now if I have a well connected node running at home, I can program it to listen for transactions from a certain address, and they will trigger a double spend transaction back to myself with a higher fee. Why not? I think if you are a merchant, there will have to be tools to analyze transactions for standard-ness and fee... Or rely on bitpay or Coinbase who (I assume) take the risk on themselves.

My understanding is that locktime transactions can't be included in a block until they are valid. So you could respend the original coins. Doing so would obviously make the locktime transaction unusable. But the way greenaddress.it for example uses them, it's like holding a coupon for bitcoin. It's a signed transaction but you can't use it until the date on the coupon. And if the original coins move, the coupon is completely worthless.

You can't really delete an address. Once a valid transaction is written to a block, the destination address is permanently included in Bitcoin's history. If the user who generated that address, let's say, deleted the private key that generated the address, well then that transaction will never be redeemed and the Bitcoins will sit there forever unusable.

There still is a use case for all other blockchains, alt coins etc. Obviously we have no idea what winners and losers the market will choose over the next generation.
I feel like the one thing that sidechains are directly making obsolete is the "proof of burn."
When Counterparty began, early investors sent bitcoins to a cryptographic furnace, and the new currency (XCP) references the Bitcoin blockchain to decide who has how much XCP based on their burn.
Sidechains will make proof of burn obsolete, because once adopted, Bitcoin can be converted into a new currency (and back again!) as part of the protocol.

A fork happens when nodes running different software disagree on what is valid.
A hard fork occurs when that disagreement is about what goes into a block, confirmed by a miner and written into the blockchain.
A soft fork can occur when the disagreement is just about what types of transactions are considered valid by a peer, and therefore may or may not be broadcast to its own peers.
So when Core version 0.9 updated its minimum transaction fee, nodes running 0.8 might consider those Tx message invalid, and drop them from memory without passing them along to peers. However, those Tx messages are still allowed to be confirmed in blocks. That's a soft fork.
If the maximum blocksize changes, that's a hard fork because nodes that don't upgrade to the latest version of the protocol will consider entire blocks invalid, and live in a parallel universe of a different blockchain.
Peter Todd demonstrated that a soft fork could be used to double-spend, although only one of those Tx's would ever be confirmed into a block.
Regarding sidechains, something must be added to the Bitcoin protocol to allow side-chained coins to return. Most likely that will require a hard fork, because a new type of transaction or script command will be needed to make that return-peg work, and older incompatible software will consider those Tx types invalid, and reject blocks that contain them

This comment might get buried, but I think a lot of other people in this thread maybe haven't considered a few things:
1) The violent protesters were mostly not Cal students. The whole event might have been completely peaceful if it was not invaded by "the black bloc" -- and on that point, the black bloc might not have even showed up if it weren't for the very recent incidents at US airports, and the violence in Quebec. People are scared, pissed off, and disenfranchised. That breeds violence.
2) I don't understand why people are trying to use the phrase "tolerant left" so ironically - are you trying to point out how stupid and horrible some people are because they are hypocrites? "The Left" has a proud history of militant action. Do you think the left is just a bunch of hippie flower girls?

Yes, there are different rules for forwarding Tx's and including Tx's in a block.
This is pushing the boundaries of my understanding, but I imagine this was a design decision specifically to let soft-forks happen. Like, a hardfork can be catastrophic, so we want to keep hardfork risks as low as possible by allowing miners to mine almost any Tx they can find.
Something like minimum Tx fee is a much more flexible variable because it's just about anti-spam and network efficiency, and doesn't really affect the ledger.
I'm reading and re-reading section 4.4 of the whitepaper, its making me think I don't fully understand something. Changing an OP code is definitely a hard-fork, maybe Blockstream is suggesting another way for a subgroup of nodes to accept sidechain transactions that doesn't fuck up the blockchain? Or maybe this section is saying that AFTER sidechains are merged into bitcoin via a HARD FORK, there is then a NEW risk of a soft-fork because of the limited SPV security

Exactly. Not only would the polarized filters look plain flat grey under normal light, but even with a plain polarized filter on top all you would see is noise. One qr code would be the key, the other the encrypted bitcoin key. 1's would have 90° polarization, 0's would have 0°. When they overlap, they XOR and the bitcoin private key would be visible. 
The problem is, who do you get to make these? You'd have to give them your privates key and your polarized filter decoder key. I thought one way to be secure might be to send the printer like 10,000 patterns. Only one is the decrypt key, the rest encrypted bitcoin keys. They would all look like noise, but only you would know which one decides all the others... Still, not secure until complex polarization patterns can be printed at home.

The a-&gt;c transaction can be copied by anyone and simply broadcast to the other fork. Output a will exist in both forks. And IIRC, because Tx ids (hashes) are essentially deterministic, every child transaction will be valid on both forks as long as each Tx gets copy-pasted to the other fork, because the outputs will continue to exist in both forks.

Yeah any Tx will be valid on both chains, since the fork is not affecting the Tx part of the protocol. And spending unconfirmed outputs is allowed on both forks, so the only difference will be confrontation times, and NEWLY MINED coins, which of course will only exist on one fork or the other

Blocks aren't encrypted, literally. They are hashed, which compresses the whole thing into 32 bytes. Then continually rehashed with different "nonces" until that 32 byte hash hits the target. Then the block with it's winning nonce is broadcasted to the network, so everyone can update their own copy of theledger.

The blockchain is a document that is distributed amongst thousands of users, all using similar software to keep their own copies up to date with everyone else's, in real time. The fact that there is no central "main" document is what makes bitcoin a decentralized system, and is it's biggest strength. So far, the consensus software has been running for 5 years without any successful attacks against it. Another part of its strength is it was designed to reward users who follow the rules, meaning an attacker would likely  get a bigger reward for mining blocks and supporting the chain, rather than hacking it.

Are you using Bitcoin-Qt?
1) Wallet is encrypted by your password. And therefore so is your backup. You'll notice you need to enter your password for most wallet operations. When you do, the wallet is temporarily decrypted in RAM.
2) The wallet itself doesn't expose you to any additional risk, although I've heard some people claim that opening port 8333 (for bitcoin) identifies you as a target for attacks. Just keep everything encrypted, and take whatever action you can to prevent infection.
3) Qt generates 100 addresses in a "pool." So if you make one backup, you're private keys are backed up until you've used 100 addresses, Then  Qt generates another 100, and you'll have to back up again. All transactions are on the blockchain! So all you need to back up is the private keys, Which are generated 100 at a time by Qt.
4) Not sure what you mean. A receiving address IS a public key (compressed by a hash function) and that public key is derived from a private key. 
There are console commands listed here: 
If you're trying to actually see your keys.

I don't see how this would be possible. SPV still validates the entire blockchain from genesis forward, albeit headers-only. Then using Merkle trees, a requested Tx is proven to be included in a block, and how deep in the chain it is included.
So a majority of miners would have to produce a dishonest chain to prove a dishonest transaction is more than one block deep. 
And if the coins are coming from a bloated Coinbase block subsidy, that entire Tx would be revealed to the user who could just see that generated coins are invalid. 
When Peter Todd talks about fooling SPV users, he is only referring to transactions that are not requested by the SPV wallet.

Get the private keys off the internet ASAP. Paper wallets encrypted with a BIP38 password, or a Trezor. There's trade-offs for security / convenience, and of course the cost of the Trezor. But for 35 BTC it's definitely worth it.

There's nothing special about a private key. It's just a number. Any random number between 1 and 2^256
Then you do an irreversible mathematical function on that number to get a public key (that's elliptic curve multiplication)
Then you do a second irreversible function on that public key to get the address (that's a hash, sha256 followed by ripemd160)

No, it implies that you can't run a BU node using the data directory from a Core node after SegWit activates. Imagine trying to run a windows exe on a mac - you wouldn't  expect that to work.
Over the P2P network, Core and BU can send tx and block messages to each other just fine. The latest version of Core knows how to strip witness data from txs and blocks so that older nodes (and BU nodes) can receive and validate (as much as possible).

Advanced note, if this is something you actually *want*, it can be done with hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. In such a case you can derive and share your "master public key" from which an infinite number of new addresses can be generated by someone else, without them needing any of your private keys. You keep your "master private key" safe like any other private key.

I think this is assuming your node remains connected to nodes it does not agree with consensus–wise. If you receive too many messages that you think are invalid you may just disconnect from that node and you will never find out about the fork in the first place. (Apparently this is happening with XT on testnet)
However in a soft fork, your node will still connect and receive messages from newer nodes, but it will alert the user that the version number has been increased beyond your node.

What would actually prevent that transaction from being valid on the main chain? Tx messages would still be passed around the network, no matter what version of the software nodes are running, so any Tx would be valid in either chain UNLESS the coins sent were derived from a post-fork block reward on the old chain. In fact in the case of a bigger-blocks hard fork, it'd actually by *more* likely that a Tx would be confirmed on the new chain.
If I understand correctly, your hypothetical merchant would not be using an SPV wallet but be running a full node and he would hypothetically also be ignoring the error messages that node would produce as it detects a much longer invalid chain.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:18:39

Bitcoind will store in an array all the valid chain tips it knows about. (run command bitcoin-cli getchaintips to see). It will stick with whatever chain it saw first (as far as I know) until another chain surpasses the POW. But total POW also includes length, so there would only be a conflict for the time it takes one chain to add one additional block. If you were standing in between two completely split networks with equal hash rate, you might experience flipping back and forth repeatedly, but in your example the confusion would only last until one chain out worked the other, and all miners world wide converged on to that chain. So for large transactions, wait six blocks!

But if the only difference between forks is max block size, and the new chain actually has bigger blocks, the only way to create a Tx that is *invalid* on the main chain is to spend old-chain block rewards. And the merchant would have to be running a full node (AFAIK SPV wallets don't know about forks, especially if 95% of full nodes are on the new fork) and that old full node would detect the longer apparently-invalid chain, and alert the merchant. Not to mention we're hypothesizing about a merchant that accepts bitcoin and yet has no idea what's going in the community.

So those confirmed segwits will still be in UTXO for old nodes? Sounds like 0-conf for old nodes is wildly more risky in this scenario? Especially if SegWit tx doesn't propagate on old nodes, an attacker can send ANYONECANSPEND coins to a merchant before the "real" owner spends that output.

I don't need to trust anybody, I run a full node
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:46:05
Yep. This is my GitHub issue. What I didn't realize is that (at least in regtest) after segwit activates, the coinbase transactions in all newly generated blocks are segwit transactions. So the 'size' and 'stripped size' are actually different, even though it's an empty block, it's still a segwit block. Stored differently on disk. 
I was able to reconcile by running both clients in regtest and connecting them. The BU node downloaded the backwards-compatible version of the chain from the Core node.

@_date: 2016-06-17 18:37:57
ok I have to get back to actual work, here's how far I got:
• There are 51 points on the circle, so we're probably looking at a WIF (wallet import format = 51 chracters)
• Each point has 7 squares connected by a line, so if that's 7 bits, that would fit nicely into a binary ASCII table (Also the solution to puzzle level  was a 51-character ASCII encoded WIF key)
• Each point has a center square thats either big or small (0 or 1)
• There are three squares in and out of the circle, each either 1 step behind or ahead of the center point square (0 or 1)
So using that I went through each point on the circle and wrote down the binary that would encode. Starting from the OUTSIDE of the circle and reading IN down the line, a counter-clockwise square is a 0, a clockwise square is a 1. Small center point squares are 0, large ones are 1.
I generated this list of all 51 points on the circle, but here's where I'm stuck: I know this WIF is going to start with a "5" which in ASCII is  or 0110101 However I can't find that sequence anywhere in my list. Forwards, backwards, flipping all bits 0-&gt;1 and 1-&gt;0... I even tried just flipping the center bit (maybe I'm wrong about big / little center point squares). Anyway I can't figure out an algorithm that both produces an ASCII "5" somewhere in the list AND generates only BASE58 characters from the ASCII table (min 49, max 122)
Here's my list starting from the top of the circle, and going around clockwise:

You're looking at decimal integers but it makes more sense as hex. The current Core block version is 0x20000001 which uses "version bits" to signal new soft fork rules. Classic blocks are version 0x30000000

Here's some other arrays:
They all go clockwise around the circle, and all four treat the center square as `big=1 / small=0`. `outside_in` is counting from the outer sqaures inwards, `inside_out` is the opposite.
The `_flipped` arrays flip the bits on the outer sets of 3 but keep the center bit. In case you think *counter-clockwise* is "1" and not "0".
Converting these straight to decimal gives a range of like 5 to 120 or so... too big a range for ASCII or base58. So I don't know what's next...

if some one sends you a Tx with no fee, it will not be confirmed for a long time. But, if you SPEND that unconfirmed Tx with a fee big enough to pay for BOTH Tx's (the child and the parent) then a miner will include BOTH Tx's in the block, as if the first Tx had a sufficient enough fee.

So if an upgraded node has a non-upgraded peer, what happens? Does the upgraded node strip the witness data and send the base block? So it's up to that node to do that process? Or does it start with the miners? Do the miners send 2 things or 1 thing?

I answered no to this poll because it's a trick question. Blocks are still capped at 1 MB. Older (edit: ALL) nodes still cap blocks at 1 MB. However, sending the transactions' witness data outside the 1 MB block will allow for greater capacity.

There could be an offset, but either it's not constant, or my basic premise is wrong.
converting bin to dec of my list:
    [40, 12, 101, 113, 47, 62, 45, 72, 10, 81, 56, 43, 81, 68, 82, 27, 25, 78, 40, 26, 11, 66, 73, 56, 103, 60, 102, 47, 97, 42, 99, 67, 74, 27, 68, 57, 73, 59, 61, 70, 47, 45, 80, 99, 112, 78, 57, 96, 77, 48, 61]
and maybe reading the bits backwards (inside circle -&gt; outside):
    [10, 24, 83, 71, 122, 62, 90, 9, 40, 69, 14, 106, 69, 17, 37, 108, 76, 57, 10, 44, 104, 33, 73, 14, 115, 30, 51, 122, 67, 42, 99, 97, 41, 108, 17, 78, 73, 110, 94, 49, 122, 90, 5, 99, 7, 57, 78, 3, 89, 6, 94]
in both cases the range of integers is over 100 (max - min), but the ASCII characters that make up Base58 are between  -  a range of only 74. So both these interpretations, no matter what the offset is, would produce characters outside the Base58 range :-/

The blocks "tick" forward every 30 seconds. So the whole 3/4 perimeter they travel lasts about 45 minutes. With a glance you can see how many blocks were mined in the last 45 minutes.
When the clock receives a transaction the block that confirms it is filled-in. 
The clock also displays mempool size, latest block hash, and time until next subsidy halvening and difficulty adjustment. There's also other modes for displaying block version and size.

First of all, soft forks require much more than 50% 
The extension block you describe, how's that work? Is it funded by anyone-can-spend transactions? Then you definitely want to make sure all the miners are on board, or those funds will be spent... by anyone!
Secondly this isn't really an attack vector. Soft forks by definition do not disrupt the existing network. Non-upgraded nodes simply process the one-MB base block like usual. It's not like those old nodes are "coerced" into suddenly processing 32 MB extension blocks, that's the whole point - they won't even know about them.
If 51% of miners refuse to include your transaction in a block, for any reason, well there's still 49% of miners out there who will. If 100% miners all decide to mine empty blocks and sacrafice transaction fees, well then maybe we all have a problem. 
If extension blocks were ever soft forked in to main net, there would be no reason to stop processing base block transactions.

@_date: 2016-11-05 01:44:10
I think the best you could do is attack one node or SPV wallet (like if you met a local bitcoins buyer in a Starbucks with compromised wifi), double spend a zero confirmation transaction, and prevent the victim from receiving new blocks that prove your fraud. Once they connect to an honest node though, the game is up. This is exactly what the whole Byzanine Generals problem is about.

Love that the logs are available in the app! Nerd senses are tingling. I'm stuck on 99% sync though...
Edit: 100%!! Now how do I turn on autopilot? (Its greyed out)
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:06:29
I suppose that’s true if you assume the 51% could eventually overcome and wipeout a chain that is still accepting legacy transactions. At 49:51 ratio though there could be orphaned chains several blocks long. A legacy node could see its tx confirmed quickly and then unconfirmed several hours later.
I think a fundamental rule of Bitcoin is that at 51% miner collusion, a lot of (not all) bets are off. Even without extension blocks, a majority mining cartel can disrupt the system in many ways until they either run out of money to maintain the attack, or the network hard-forks around them. 
To answer your OP more directly, a full node could provide a user detailed information about the attack and alert them that it is happening. Some hard-fork solutions would be under the user’s control, for example bitcoind can internally declare a block invalid, and wait for a new block at the same height to continue the chain.

Just made this quick tool to derive legacy BIP21 invoice from a BitPay BIP70 invoice: 
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:32:54
Dunno the UX for each wallet but there's this chart:
Why would it even be an option? "Pay lower fee / don't pay lower fee"?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:07:29


Yes, but of course use at your own risk. BitPay still detects the Bitcoin payment on the network. What my hack doesn't do is send the "ACK" message back to BitPay, which is technically part of the BIP70 protocol. Breaking the BIP70 invoice like this also ignores the "expiry" of the invoice which may cause problems with the merchant.
edit: BIP70 also allows BitPay to "examine" the payment tx (for sufficient miner fee) before broadcasting to the network. If you use this hack, you need to make sure you're using a good fee!
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:23:56
"fuck them" is emotional, political, and doesn't help anybody.
Plenty of wallets support BIP70. Of course those wallets still send Bitcoin to a Bitcoin address. BIP70 is message exchange protocol to get that Bitcoin address to you in a secure way. I don't love it either but I don't think it merits a ban from the community web portal. Put a note on Bitcoin.org about the issue, inform people, let users choose.

Yes, Bitcoin QT (aka "Core") is a full node. Armory is, I think, the only wallet built on Core besides the one built in to Core itself. A full node downloads the entire blockchain. It is the most trustless way to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-04 00:41:46
Exactly, all transactions are approved by signature. So how do you know Alice had the 100 BTC to begin with? Someone must have given it to her, or maybe she mined it. Either way, I'd like to verify that myself with the software. The reason Bitcoin can not be counterfeit is because no coin is ever destroyed, no coin ever leaves the ledger, and every transaction relies on a parent transaction. Every block relies on a parent block, all the way back to block

If money is sent to an address, that means it's in the blockchain and therefore public. There is no "deleting" an address that has already been included in the blockchain. If you're already generating new addresses for each transaction (considered good practice) why would you need to consolidate the money into a single address?
Do you know about Hierarchical Deterministic wallets? They automatically generate new addresses that can all be recovered from a single 12- or 24- word seed phrase.

I specifically did not want to suck the interview into part of the opinion-exchange of the block size debate. I just wanted a solid technical overview so users can decide for themselves what the applications of LN are, and the technical effects LN will have on the blockchain. After talking with Rusty about it, my personal opinion is that LN doesn't belong in the block size debate right now, and is a bit of a straw-man when people casually mention it.
The exciting thing about LN is that it's brilliant, innovative, and has the potential to disrupt finance even more than "legacy" Bitcoin, giving us (the crypto-community) even more leverage. LN brings low-fee, instant transactions "back" to Bitcoin.

A signature is useless without the corresponding public key. It's required to verify the signature mathematically. At least, in the Bitcoin multisig implementation, which is really just one-at-a-time individual signatures just combined into a list.
I saw Greg Maxwell speak at a meetup and he described a different scheme that actually obfuscates the schema and the specific keys used to sign (can't remember the name). Monero is another interesting case that uses ring signatures: You see a group of public keys and a signature but can NOT derive which key produced the signature.

Is a pruned node vulnerable to some type of malware attack that changes the contents of the unspent transaction output set on disk? 
Without the raw blocks on disks, how does the node verify its own memory?
Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought a non pruning node verifies the entire blockchain on startup and rebuilds the UTXO set from verified blocks. A pruning node must still download and store all the block headers, right?

Why aren't you just as likely to find a 4-byte tail collision with the extra commitment? The miner can still modify the scriptsig (extranonce?) until a collision is found. It's the merkle root we're talking about right? That's a hash digest so shouldn't it be equally random all the time?

*Imagine if windows released 10 and said anyone that doesn't upgrade will brick there computers.*
You also have to imagine this "brick" statement is the most widely publicized and talked-about upgrade ever, broadcasted on all channels for well over a year. (Albeit maybe censored form one or two...)
You also ALSO have to imagine that windows is the software for money. If it doesn't work, there is no money. 
And still, this company doesn't upgrade after 95% of the network does, plus grace period. 
Obviously you don't think your hypothetical example would apply to Coinbase, Circle, BitPay, Chain, or any of the exchanges, mining pools or blockchain API services?
But I don't know, you think it's reasonable to assume that someone out there is running their own self-contained, self-built Bitcoin acceptance software that doesn't rely on any major external API, and not only are they neglecting it, but they also have no idea a hard fork is even a potential risk to keep an eye on? AND THEN this company is significant enough to actually be double-spent against.  
My opinion is, the economic impact of these edge cases will be negligible if they happen at all.

I'm not sure exactly what that means, but at the time I posted I still had 12 active connections and `getpeerinfo` indicated that most of them were up to date with the network (14 blocks ahead). When I restarted, it just took a few minutes to catch up after being stuck for 2 hours.

Can confirm!
During installation I had to increase swap file size to get enough 
memory available for everything to compile, then closed the swap. But I was able to compile everything from source on the pi, mostly following: 
I already run a full node on my PC, so copying the blockchain over was trivial. At times when my RPi node crashes, it can take a LOOONG time to catch up, but it always does. If I'm in a hurry (developing some fun stuff on top of the node...) I usually just sync up with my PC node then copy the blockchain over to the pi.
I also tweaked the .config file to keep the mempool under control. `maxconnections=12`, `minrelaytxfee = 0.00005000` and `limitfreerelay = 0`
I'm using a 128 GB flash drive for the blockchain. But one time it did fail miserably and I had to reformat the stick and reload the blockchain on to it.
So far so good! And I'm still able to play with the RPC interface and develop little apps with Python and PHP

Nononono... They are including an OP RETURN in the coinbase tx headed with the segwit magic bytes (on mobile but it's like `aa21a9ef` or something...) and this is where the merkle root of the witness data will live, when segwit is fully active. Read BIP141 for the details.

Do you understand that Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs?

@_date: 2017-04-03 19:38:50
Actually on closer look, the commitment header in [F2Pool's coinbase transaction's](  `OP_RETURN`is not the right commitment header bytes. It's off by one hex character. [It's supposed to be `aa21a9ed`]( not `aa21a9ef`. So it's just totally bewildering. Maybe they're just testing SegWit commitment structure?
As far as merge-mining, I'm pretty sure the alt-coin block header is embedded somewhere in the Bitcoin coinbase scriptSig (tx input).

IIRC, There's a dialog between Mike Hearn and Satoshi about this. Satoshi said he picked 10 minutes because he estimated that a block could take 1 minute to fully propagate through the network, meaning "losing" miners would only waste about 10% of their effort. Essentially the 10 minute block decision was based on 10% waste being the most acceptable to Satoshi.

I don't understand why the Electrum SPV model is any different than Bread's. Bread connects directly to full nodes. Electrum connects directly to Electrum servers which connect to full nodes. Neither wallet verifies the entire consensus rule set. Both wallets rely on merkle proofs for transaction inclusion in blocks and both wallets are vulnerable to withholding attacks.

@_date: 2018-03-13 22:19:56
I'm not even sure what you're arguing anymore. Yes, Electrum uses a different messaging protocol between client and server than the standard SPV service that bitcoind provides, which Bread connects to. 
But Electrum (like Bread) is a LIGHT client. It only downloads and verifies block headers, it doesn't download the entire blockchain and therefore does not verify the entire consensus rule set.
Furthermore, the Electrum client sends the server a plain list of addresses to watch which is arguably LESS private than the bloom filter model Bread uses.

I think I understand your question, a mining farm or mining pool just needs one node to validate transactions, validate incoming blocks from other miners, and create new candidate blocks. Once a candidate block is formed, the node sends "work" to the hashing power, literally just ~80 bytes for the hardware to hash on, seeking a no cell that solves the block. Upon success, the nonce is sent back to the Bitcoin node to complete the block and push it to peers asap.
I wouldn't call each individual antminer a node - you might get confused with Bitcoin nodes, a server running the Bitcoin core software, maintaining network connections and a complete ledger.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:28:17
I don't think is totally wrong. It doesn't matter if SegWit is active on the network, but actually mining SegWit blocks breaks ASIC boost. The Coinbase commitment on the left side of the merkle tree must be recalculated with each permutation of the right side of the tree. 
You can see the SegWit commitment in this Coinbase transaction: 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:23:37
The Coinbase transaction still has a witness commitment. That would break ASIC boost. As far as I know...
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:07:02
It's too bad they haven't implemented SegWit yet. I stopped using Bread because of this. Unfortunately, as far as I know, Bread is the only true SPV wallet on iOS. Bread also allows "trusted node" functionality which is the only thing that makes SPV safe.
BitWallet relies on blockchain.info and GreenAddress is just a damn UI nightmare. Edge looks ok, and relies on Electrum servers. So it's pretty good as far as SPV, but I am cautious about the username-password-we-store-encrypted-keys security model.
I don't really care about Ver and BCH or whatever, but I remember when this wallet was a project run all the talented Now it's another crypto startup with an overly-charming CEO, community manager, facebook live videos, and an ERC20 token...

First of all, we're talking about iOS wallets so electrum shouldn't even come up. But anyway, how is electrum any more secure than any other SPV wallet? As far as I know you are still trusting a full node to enforce the consensus rules and follow the "correct" chain. SPV wallets like Bread connect to full nodes. Electrum connects to full nodes that also run extra software (the electrum server) which adds a bit more security like end to end encryption. There is no such thing as a "half baked SPV node" unless you mean the wallet itself, in which case Electrum and Bread have the same security model. And I repeat, Bread can tether to a custom trusted full node of your choice. That's how I run it: connected to my own full node at home. 
Here is my SE post specifically addressing the benefits of Electrum:
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:26:32
You don't need to do anything. When the 2x fork starts you will instantly have the same balance on both blockchains. After the fork, if you want to spend one coin but not the other, you will need some help from a wallet. You shouldn't have to wait for Trezor, there are other methods, but hopefully they will make it easy for you.

No there is no 2x fork yet. The fork ITSELF is what actually "splits" the coins. Just hang tight, after the fork you will have both coins. You just need a wallet that can spend each separately, or a specific 2x wallet that can import your seed and just spend 2x coins. I don't think 2x has any wallet support yet, and their replay protection is still up in the air as far as I know, you just have to stay tuned.

@_date: 2017-10-07 01:40:08
Right! This is how all P2SH outputs work (regular P2PKH outputs are similar)
The actual coin output (scriptPubKey) is: `OP_HASH160 6e0b7d51f9f68ba28cc33a6844d41a1880c58a19 OP_EQUAL`
Meaning "if the `hash160` of the `sig` trying to spend this coin equals this number, then proceed..." Which in the case of P2SH means evaluating the `sig` itself (where the multisig etc rules would be). In this case, there is no extra script, just a number, which is "true" and therefore the spend is valid.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:35:20
The nodes aren't centralized but the consensus is. If I'm not mistaken IOTA still relies on a single server run by the devs called the coordinator, to prevent double spends and even classify which tips are secure for connecting to.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:35:50
Ah I see, the SegWit part isn't really relevant, it's about keeping large amounts in a hot wallet? [There are some Android wallets that are compatible with Trezor you could try]( Otherwise you could try GreenAddress which has some interesting security features like a multisig with spending limits, so for example their server won't allow (co-sign) a transaction that breaks rules you set in advance. Also with CoPay I believe you could set up a multisig with someone you trust, but that would require you to call them and get a co-sign for every spend. What is it exactly that worries you? If your keys are backed up, and your phone and wallet both require a PIN or password, that's pretty good security for a hot wallet.
Also, you skydive multiple times a day? Holy shit that's badass! I love that you're comfortable jumping out of planes repeatedly but don't want to risk storing $1,000 in Bitcoin on your phone :-)

As long as there's only five or so people with git pull access, we mine as well just concede to that amount of centralization. Let those guys put together a multisig and the community can fund that.

As far as recurrent and consistent funding, it would be nice to see miners offering portions of the block subsidy directly to the core dev fund. That way the mining community can vote with their hashing power, and it could almost be as like the Bitcoin protocol automatically funds development.

The problem with [benefit of] Bitcoin is that money can not be "pulled" from a consumer the way it can be with credit cards, bank accounts, and paypal. So the user will have to intentionally "push" a payment through every month.
What you could do is send the user an invoice with a QR code and at least make it easy for them to just re-subscribe every 30 days. OR - look into the Lightning Network or payment channels as implemented by Streamium.io and see if there's a model there for you.
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:27:45
Here's the metaphor I like to use: Bitcoin addresses are like the paper bills in your physical, real-life wallet. You might go through a few dozen in a single week, each one has a different value, and the whole collection of them together makes up your total balance. You can use more than one to make a purchase if the price is high enough, and you can always receive more than one in return for your own products or services, or even as change.

Also worth noting that the scriptSig needed to redeem coins sent to that address is [written in a comment in the code](
This means that anyone can spend anything sent to this address (on the main Bitcoin network) with the number `04148f33be`, kind of like a private key that is publicly known. I guess vanity-generated this address so it has the `Bit1x` string up front.
Also pt. 2: As far as I know, 0-value outputs are valid (correct me?) so you wouldn't need to actually send anything to this address. But it is a pain in the ass for sure.

It's considered best practice in Bitcoin to use a brand new address for every transaction output. Short answer is, it helps obfuscate how much money one person (with many addresses) has in total. It also ideally obfuscates which output is the spend and which is the change, adding to your privacy. 
Longer answer is, every time you spend an output you reveal your PUBLIC key. Before that all the world knows is your address, which is an irreversible hash of your public key. Anyway, it's possible that quantum computing in the future may be able to extract a private key from a public key. And every time you sign a Tx with your public key, that probability increases. Keep in mind right now this is still computer science fiction, but since Bitcoin addresses are disposable and we'll never run out, why not just use a new one each time?

Shortest possible answer: when a new user joins the network for the first time, he needs to see every transaction that has ever happened, so he knows which coins are valid. Everything in bitcoin is born from the Genesis block.

Totally agree. I have a full node on my computer and I'm trying to figure out a way to hack mytrezor.com to query blockchain info from my local node instead of sending my xpub to a server. I think with core 0.10 and the new "watch addresses" feature it should be possible.

Yeah you're right, huh! I guess Rusty was just referring to the IsStandard() test that doesn't apply to P2SH. But he also said the scripts with OP_OR were mineable. Or maybe he meant OR functionality could be acheived with other OP codes, like OP_IF and OP_ELSE.

Core nodes will wait forever for a new block. There's no risk of "wipeout" since 2x will fork off with a bock invalid to original chain. If 2x ends up with all the hash power then Core nodes will be in trouble, maybe permanently.

Bread does this, but doesn't support segwit yet because the once very cool technical project started by a single smart developer got turned into an ICO waste with a charming CEO who talks about being a "financial institution without any customer funds" and now they support ERC20 and Ethereum and BCH but not segwit.

Think about being as *trustless* as possible. The only thing a new user knows for sure is the GENESIS BLOCK and the PROTOCOL. Even the difficulty target required to satisfy proof of work starts with the genesis block, and can be trustlessly audited all the way up to present.

At first I ran it on the same pi as bitcoin core... it sort of worked (listings were visible, connections ok) but I was unable to successfully test a purchase from myself. So I closed core and now it's just running OB. It seems to be running fine! I can connect to it (at home) remotely from the client (at work) and check up on it.
I was reviewing the logs and realized that basically 99% of the traffic I received was from duosear.ch's scraper. They will ping you and request listings like every 30 seconds. And when your node goes down they will email you a warning. I had a nice conversation with them (that's when I realized I shouldn't try to run core on the same pi) and got a "trusted store" badge.

I'm still learning about the implementation but I think RBF is opt in by the sender, so the Tx would contain a flag indicating it is "vulnerable" to RBF. You can choose not to send with RBF and get zero conf, and the merchant can decide to wait one block if they see an RBF.

It's a great idea if it was implemented by Satoshi since day one. Now it's a hard fork proposal, which is nearly impossible to pull into Bitcoin. Not to mention that to do a hard fork, miners would have to agree to this "feature," which could only reduce their revenue, so it's extra impossible.

Because in modulo arithmetic, you can multiply but you can't divide. All division is like dividing by zero: there's just no answer.
    42 / 0 = ?    
Modulo arithmetic is like the walls in a Pac Man game: when you get to one side (the modulus) you immediately reappear at the other side (zero). So to get from point A to point B you can just keep going up and up and around and around and stop at point B. But if I were just to look at point A and point B, I would never be able to calculate HOW MANY TIMES you went around and around to get from point A to point B.
So it's easy to do this:
    A * (some huge secret number of times you go around the modulus) = B
But very hard to do this:
    B / A = ?

actually proposed this in theory a while back, so Bitcoin USERS would have a vote in the process.

[Link to the full DOJ report](
Executive Summary:
Approximately three years after its initial inquiries, the Committee
finally obtained copies of internal Treasury records showing that DOJ has not been
forthright with Congress or the American people concerning its decision to decline
to prosecute HSBC. Specifically, these documents show that:
* Senior DOJ leadership, including Attorney General Holder, overruled an internal recommendation by DOJ’s Asset Forfeiture and Money LaunderingSection to prosecute HSBC because of DOJ leadership’s concern that prosecuting the bank would have serious adverse consequences on the financial system.
* Notwithstanding Attorney General Holder’s personal demand that HSBC agree to DOJ’s “take-it-or-leave-it” deferred prosecution agreement deal byNovember 14, 2012, HSBC appears to have successfully negotiated with DOJ for significant alterations to the DPA’s terms in the weeks following theAttorney General’s deadline.
* DOJ and federal financial regulators were rushing at what one Treasury official described as “alarming speed” to complete their investigations and enforcement actions involving HSBC in order to beat the New YorkDepartment of Financial Services.
* In its haste to complete its enforcement action against HSBC, DOJ transmitted settlement numbers to HSBC before consulting with Treasury’sOffice of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) to ensure that the settlement amount accurately reflected the full degree of HSBC’s sanctions violations.
* The involvement of the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority in theU.S. government’s investigations and enforcement actions relating to HSBC,a British-domiciled institution, appears to have hampered the U.S.government’s investigations and influenced DOJ’s decision not to prosecuteHSBC.
* Attorney General Holder misled Congress concerning DOJ’s reasons for not bringing a criminal prosecution against HSBC.
* DOJ to date has failed to produce any records pertaining to its prosecutorial decision making with respect to HSBC or any large financial institution,notwithstanding the Committee’s multiple requests for this information and a congressional subpoena requiring Attorney General Lynch to timely produce these records to the Committee.

[BIP 39 uses 2048 words]( wheras by program uses a [list of over 58,000]( So switching to BIP 39 would require longer phrases with more words. The other thing about BIP39 is it's not actually "reversible" like my utility. 
    entropy -&gt; (word list) -&gt; 12 word phrase -&gt; (hashed with PBKDF2) -&gt; seed for private keys
    base58 -&gt; (word list) -&gt; multi-word phrase -&gt; (word list in reverse) -&gt; original base58
BIP39 was intentionally designed this way so that small devices or programs don't have to store the entire word list to create a seed from the mnemonic. It's also worth noting that the BIP39 wordlist is way more carefully planned out, where the first four letters of every word are unique, to avoid errors.

That wouldn't make sense, a miner can trivially generate any number of transactions to fill their own block.
What's even more important is that empty blocks are *necessary* because it gives miners a certain type of competition: In a no-size-limit world, if a malicious miner tries to broadcast a block that's 100 MB to DOS the network, an honest miner can eventually mine an empty block at the same height and it will zip around the network quickly, orphaning the malicious block.

I've caught technical errors in his articles before. I hope everyone does their due diligence... Not sure why this guy has a following?
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:47:58
Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:56:20
Okay thanks. And then on the subject of 2FA, what is the difference between one 40 character password without 2FA, and two 20-character passwords with?
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:19:02
There's already a version bit dedicated to a hard fork? Is it a standard BIP9 bit? Or like, setting bit 32 to 1 to break BIP9?
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:51:46
haha, ok sweet... I saw your comment before edit :-) but even 40 coins isn't worth staring at your word search until my eyes bleed!
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:20:24
Killer app, brah!
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:56:19
Thanks. Fixed my table. What I saw in regtest is posted here: 
It also signals actual bit 0 (CSV) as well as bit 28 (dummy test) but actually never bits 1 and 4 together. So I'd like to know how it actually deploys on main net.

Yes this is something I need to dial in. However, the shorter the word list I use, the longer the phrase will be. If I use the 1,200 word poetry list like electrum, the phrases will be almost 20 words. So it's a trade off. I also tried using a list of most common words from 'The Simpsons...' THAT was interesting!

Is there any way to minimize the capital gains when selling a large amount of BTC for USD? Like does it matter if I sell via Coinbase or gdax or...? Is it better to sell once or several smaller sales? I'm guessing nothing makes a difference except cost basis and sale price?

Before I write a script that aggregates data from over 400,000 blocks I thought I'd ask if anyone had already done the work.
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:32:52
Waitaminute, how do you use a "from" address without its private key?
@_date: 2013-10-29 05:59:49
This is hilarious 
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:57:35
Sure. We are all early adopters. But my question, why would they just post one address? Like theyre hustling for tips!
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:26:13
This is cool, but I was hoping for more years of history, and I don't care about confirmation times, just what got confirmed in each block.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:10:48
Yeah but what about cases like users running old versions of the blockchain.info app? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:19:35
I bet Purse.io and Gyft would buy ads on this site :-)

Yes. My next step is to include address validity verification on the translator. Even though wallets will check too I just think it'd be a nice feature to instantly check that the translator worked, right on the page. And I also want to make a little API so it can be integrated into other apps. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:22:27
That is raunchy
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:33:58
Scarcity and difficulty of acquisition do not make value. Neither does trust. What makes money valuable is, one human gives it to another human in return for something that is not money. If I started a brand new genesis block, would I be generating something scarce and difficult to acquire? Yes. Would it have any value...? Why or why not?
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:23:34
Oh ok but that's what I was doing. Sending $5 to my friend's wallet who is just learning about cryptocurrency. Am I spam or no I'm cool?
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:52:14
yeah I meant more like, some of the transaction comments I see on the blockahin.info address page
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:04:26
Isn't there a ?
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:18:23
I'm working on this. Uses a 50,000 word list to create an electrum-style mnemonic phrase from any base58 input. Read your public address over the phone!
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:14:33
Is it? The TX fees from transactions in the block disappeared right? It exists at no output anymore. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:57:21
Yeah I think a decree by a large group of people counts as fiat. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:10:16
THANKS BRAH GREAT DEAL PM YOUR ADDRESS HERE COME THE BITCOINZ!

@_date: 2013-10-17 00:14:07
I know, right? Just for spamming and occasional racist remarks, yes. So far not the huge boost the BTC community expected from this kind of news
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:57:51
so it is indeed hard coded into the protocol, like a Tx that breaks the rule is invalid and thrown out
@_date: 2013-10-04 16:24:44
That's going to be my profile picture on every site I use from now on forever
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:38:40
Yeah, that's what I thought. I wonder if you'll be able to convince the other commenters that there is a such thing like "128 bits of obfuscation" which approaches the safety of 128 bits of entropy. ps - can we assume your key is in wallet import format? i.e. starts with a 5 ?
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:40:57
Maybe I'm seeing it wrong, maybe it's just how regtest mode works with this client, I dunno. Here's console log generating 50 blocks at a time and querying block height / version / BIP9 stats:
I also notice bit  (DEPLOYMENT_TESTDUMMY) comes on at height 150 and off by height 450. Not sure why that is, but I noticed bitcoin core does the same thing in regtest.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:02:30
Also 'Fiat.' ALL currencies are fiat. Gold, dollars, bitcoin. They all have "let it be so" value. The difference is who makes it so. The government, or the people. But I'm annoyed by redditors excited about trading bitcoin for fiat. "you keep on using that word-- I do not think it means what you think it means!"
@_date: 2013-10-27 03:20:47
Got it. Yeah I understand google auth, I thought you did mean two passwords. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:54:57
Have you been able to take anyone's money this way?
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:52:43
It matters to a curious novice computer programmer obsessed with the btc protocol! Actually I was looking at raw transactions on blockexplorer. They are pretty printed JSON, and include a field for the hash. So I was wondering if that hash is just conveniently included by the website or if the blockchain actually includes the hashes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:55:55
That's a good idea too, but would again increase the number of words in the output. Might be worth the tradeoff though if the whole thing would be more human usable. That's my ultimate goal - address the problem of gibberish looking strings. Mainstreet hates gibberish...
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:45:10
Just like in PI:
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:13:05
Don't you see people bragging about their coins already? Prime coin generates useful math data, litecoin brags about being the most democratic, others brag about being more secure... Ok forget Walmart and credit cards for a sec - the altcoin competition will not end, and people are already picking coins that offer some kind of something they prefer over other coins 
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:36:01
huh, seems odd to hard-code any monetary value into a system specifically designed to be deflationary, I wonder why fees weren't designed to adapt somehow already
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:45:28
I have the same experience. Can't get verified, fails after first step. I wrote to customer service, and the agent replied, suggesting that maybe my address or social security number (huh?) had changed recently. Uh, no... Same name, address and social security number for at least ten years. I asked him how they verify, like against what database? But he can't tell me for security reasons...
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:01:40
there are lower-case L's in here... a good start could be whiting out all non base58 char's
@_date: 2013-10-27 21:01:16
what does that mean
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:40:23
Ha, sweet. If you just received 0.001 from me then it's a success! Next step, address verification so people don't send money to nowheresville over a typo...
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:18:10
I tried a few different word lists, and ended up choosing this one:
Electrum only uses 1,600 or so words - that's not nearly enough for my method, you'd end up with a 20-word phrase or something. Another list from Wikipedia had like 500,000 words but I'd end up with words that had apostrophes, and words like 'aaaah'
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:43:20
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:49:21
It's a bug I think. Archive an address. Like, create a new address then archive it. The scan private key button appears below the archived addresses list. Give that a try I think it worked for me. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:47:59
Has anyone been able to find the blockchain transactions for the theft?
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:40:55
Yes, and I am even saying that legal tender laws is ONLY ONE TYPE of fiat. The fact that I can trade BTC for an iPad means that at least two people agree that some amount BTC is worth an iPad. Therefore those two people "LET IT BE" that BTC is money
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:21:57
Finally! Some intrinsic value!
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:50:20
Hey check this out if you get a sec:  it's my first implementation of the tool. Totally not pretty yet but functional.
