Interesting thing also is he seems to always invest when companies or the economy are going in the tank. Warren has incredible patience and timing, he never panics.

I used to mine 1 bitcoin a day or so with 1 PC, if only I kept them. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:41:14
It is secure, your password was probably too easy or you used it somewhere else. They somehow knew you had bitcoins or used them, maybe they compromised one of your exchangers to figure out your ip, email etc. Or maybe you talk about bitcoin on your Twitter etc, you were targeted because they somehow knew you had a nice stash. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:59:25

Drive bys happen more often then people care to report. Java"bad bad ", flash, pdf "big one", browsers, os. And it can happen on legit sites if they got compromised. You aren't safe anywhere these days online, especially if you use Windows. To prevent majority of these install adblock, no script. And for God sake don't use Windows with bitcoin wallets.

Exactly, I think the real childish behavior was the dmca.

You mad? 
@_date: 2014-10-28 08:41:45
Only problem I see with Bitcoin is the 6 confirmation delay. No person will wait an hour after payment. This could be an big issue for larger purchases also. It would suck waiting an hour in a store after purchasing a phone or something. It's almost like a restaurant or store accepting a cheque, it could "bounce". 
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:17:55
For sure, if someone had let's say pictures from a once in a life time trip, which are priceless. Or in the sheriff's case, maybe tons of data regarding cases he's working on. Alot of people don't backup files.

Lol! 
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:22:06
I highly doubt it's related to miners, it's either market manipulation,government sell off,mt gox finally dumping their stolen coins.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:47:54
You will learn to keep an eye on bitcoin news and take appropriate action to avoid losses. Or just hold on tight for a long ride.

Surely will. $385 now.

I can't see the nsa announcing themselves like that, it's most likely a spoof or a cocky nsa agent. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:08:22
Converting it to litecoin probably ;) 
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:13:24
That's because of all the selling pressure dropping the price, when the price drops the market cap drops.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:28:15
Exactly, I remember hearing all the Chinese miners were behind the 8mb but against 20mb. It seems to be more of a core dev issue not the miners. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:45:56
Best use of this gif I have ever seen. My god how fitting.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:53:11
Yes because of all the investigations into it recently. The timing is strange don't you think, few days after this report there is a huge dump

Bitcoin acts no different than the stock market. People are investing into it like stocks, bad news sell, good news buy. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:00:07
Is this a good or bad thing :P
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:50:17
What happened to the 8mb. If we go to 2mb we are going to have to deal with drama bullshit in another 6 months.

He said it has failed which means the same shit. " despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. " 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:48:25
A fall? 
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:40:47
I don't think so, I trust either blockchain.info or coinwarz. Coinwarz seems to be the fastest to update on hash rate though.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:25:27
And it's showing us even more how manipulative the banking system is. If anything, R3 is showing users bitcoin is needed. We need some media outlets to post about this. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:40:01
And that was in 2014. Lol

Technology will adapt, new chips etc and they will be able to do double the hash rate for the same as it costs them now. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:41:21
Snoop probably does. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:57:20
Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:48:43
Out of the loop a bit, why 8mb and not let's say 4 or 10? I remember hearing 20mb for awhile.

I know I'm going to get down voted to hell but this has always worried me tbh. Even though the chances are basically 0, all it takes is one time to seriously fuck something up. For instance a company transferring millions of dollars and hits the duplicate address? Why didn't satoshi make it required to be online to make a new address and verify it's unique over the block chain to avoid this? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:43:25
Exactly, it's way too big already they need a way to maybe read the chain off a server securely somehow instead of downloading it all. Or compress the data somehow. It's going to hit 100 gigs before we know it. I notice for some reason also updating block chain is getting slower too. It will go fast then last few gigs or so is super slow even with upnp enabled and fast connection and several restarts.
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:38:58
Horrible? It looks like cancer. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:39:34
And people are dumping bitcoin to cover losses in stock market. As someone else also pointed out people are also dumping bitcoin for fiat to get ready to buy stock once they think the stock crash bottoms out. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:56:12
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:38:54
No, China saw an opportunity to make a killing by pumping bitcoin and with the help of the Greece speculators they made a hefty %. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:08:01
You can't compare that to bitcoin. First off people care a lot more about "how it works" when it comes to someone/something holding their cash. Secondly cars are usually essential to get to point A to B, no need to know how it works. Phones are essential to communicate with friends/family, who cares how it works. Banks in their minds are essential for holding their hard earned dollars. It's embedded in their brains from a young age and it's backed by the government so it's the safest way "lol". They think why would I use bitcoin when I can just use the bank? They don't see the purpose and never think that the economy their in will fail. The sad part about this is I think the only way we will see mass adoption from the sheeple is if something bad happens to the economy "again".
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:44:56
Not hard to grasp online banking and doesn't matter because it's backed by the persons bank so they trust it even if they don't understand it. Paypal uses FIAT it's technically just a intermediary using their banks/credit cards which people trust, plus eBay helped get it rolling. Bitcoin has nothing "Backing it" and they often ask what gives it value? People can't grasp this concept, it will take a long time. Plus the only big news about Bitcoin is related to drugs, so that doesn't help.
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:54:10
Cyprus helped get the word out there and in my books showed the world its use. Look at the daily transactions ever since that day. People need to stop looking at the value and look at the transactions. For real mass adoption we will need to see an economy crisis in north america or another 10 years of nothing big happening before we see it used throughout our daily lives. I personally think the blockchain itself will be used in everyday lives in the backend of things very soon.
@_date: 2016-02-16 05:13:34
Yea because using other people's credit cards is legal. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:26:52
Because your average person doesn't understand it and even when you try to explain they still can't grasp the concept. It will take a long time for people to adopt it.
