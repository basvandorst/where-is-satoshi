Correction?  Correction to what?  This is purely supply and demand driving the price up.

I don't understand the point you're trying to make.  By your argument, you shouldn't invest in anything other than USD because the US government might ban it.

You say that but I still pay about the same price to buy a loaf of bread as I did 3 years ago.  If your statement was true, the price of bread would be going up significantly from year to year.


Gold is valuable for a few reasons.  1) It's relatively rare and people aren't making more of it, 2) it possesses certain characteristics that add to our daily lives and 3) it possesses certain properties that make it difficult to reproduce.  If any of these 3 statements were proven wrong, the value of gold relative to USD would plummet.  The only statement that holds true for BTC is  and   For BTC,  only applies when you talk about gambling or illicit substances.  If you take that out of the equation, BTC is not on the same level as gold.  On the same level, if we discovered that gold is as abundant as sand it will immediately become value-less.

1 - Why would anyone put their life savings into such an unknown market?
2 - Why would anyone advertise they they were selling everything without specifying what they bought in as?
3 - Why would  also advise everyone else to buy in?

But.  Aren't the majority of people that actually transact with Bitcoin using them for gambling and/or drugs?  There just aren't enough other places to spend your "money" so my logical conclusion must be that people are either (a) holding onto those Bitcoins or (b) getting them to use them for illicit activities/items.  And as this is the easiest and lowest risky facility that I've seen to perform these types of activities, people will continue to acquire and use them for that purpose.
@_date: 2013-02-22 03:01:25
What is your distinction between stable growth and a bubble?  It's supply and demand so I don't see how that could be a "bubble".  
As long as there is increasing demand, the price will increase.  When demand goes away, the price will fall.  
(See Beanie Babies)
Edit: Sorry as long as demand outpaces supply, the price will increase.

@_date: 2013-02-04 04:14:00
I think the price rises because BTC is quite difficult to acquire.  And the majority of the ways to get it immediately, require you to pay a premium.  The people/companies selling BTC at this premium then need to replenish "stock" so they purchase at the lowest asking price on whatever exchange (which is likely higher than the previous asking price).  I just can't see any other logical reason that normal people would drive the currency up so much in the last month or two.
People want to buy drugs online and need BTC to do it.  They purchase them through any means necessary which ultimately drives the price up due to a high demand and an unfortunate barrier to supply.  The price hits a certain point, though, and other people holding onto BTC sell off resulting in the temporary dips.
@_date: 2013-02-22 03:50:23
I think it could go up infinitely.  As long as people can use Bitcoins to buy stuff / gamble / whatever, people are going to want to acquire them.  And as they purchase them, the price tends to go up.  
I don't understand this concept of "settling down" as it relates to Bitcoins.  It seems to me that it is purely supply and demand.  Supply is increasing but relatively slowly.  Demand is increasing at probably a higher rate than that.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:24:08
Can you please define "unsustainable growth" as it relates to Bitcoin?  Also please refrain from using the term "bubble".  Bubble implies artificial inflation of price.  This is purely supply and demand of a commodity.
@_date: 2013-02-22 12:25:39
Please define correction.  That implies that there is a generally accepted value for 1 BTC that will equalize to, right?
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:00:23
Try again.  By your logic, most orders in the last 1/2/3 months would have been canceled as the price has steadily risen up.

Yes, the USD will be the dominant currency for drugs.  It even is with with SilkRoad and the like in existence.  I believe that suppliers define how much they want in USD and the system just does a magic conversion for the buyers to Bitcoin.
Can you support your statement that most people that transact with Bitcoin (for goods/services) are doing so for something other than gambling and/or drugs?  Because the logical side of my brain says that it makes perfect sense that the majority of transactions are "illicit" - otherwise they would be performing those transactions in USD (or whatever their local currency happens to be).
@_date: 2013-02-22 22:24:26
I've had no issues but there are plenty of threads with people that have had problems.  Try searching and you'll find a bunch of stuff on coinbase.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:04:05
For what it's worth, I've purchased 60+ BTC through coinbase over the past month with no issues.  Some where purchased at $15/$16 and were not canceled.  I don't think they are specifically canceling orders because of price increases - otherwise I would have seen mine do the same.  
I think they probably have some flaws in their "high risk" logic.  But then again, if I were running a company like this I would make my risk logic pretty strict as well.
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:36:28
I don't understand the constant complaining about Coinbase.  We get it - they have issues.  Nobody is forcing you to use their service.  If you don't like it, use another avenue to get your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-20 06:06:04


You are the exception.  Every new person that gets into this game does it for one of the two reasons that I laid out above.  And I hate to say it but I'm right unless you prove me wrong because my logic makes more sense than yours.


That may be the case but you're missing the point.  People that use Bitcoins today are either holding onto them to make money or using them to do things they can't do easily with their USD.

You can't save+speculate unless you have a reason why you believe that currency will gain in value.  For gold, the idea is that people will continue to want it for various purposes - jewelery, computer crap, etc.  Can you explain what you see as the gain in value for BTC other than gambling / drugs?
@_date: 2013-02-17 03:11:08
Out of curiosity, what makes you think that's a scam as opposed to a system issue / error?
@_date: 2013-02-20 06:27:35
So your point is don't purchase any BTC?  If so, I'm sorry.  I assumed you were blindly trying to convince me to put my money in BTC.  It makes a lot more logical sense to invest in a business because they can actually make real profit based on sustainable input.

It's also what the seven dwarfs are famous for.
@_date: 2013-02-20 05:47:21
I've bought some because I believe the demand will always increase.  As long as people want to gamble / purchase illicit substances and Bitcoins give them the ability to do that, demand for Bitcoins goes up.  The number of Bitcoins available for purchase remains (relatively) constant.  Therefore, the price relative to USD should skyrocket.  I'm just trying to find the flaw in my logic.
@_date: 2013-02-14 15:49:27
I'm still a little green when it comes to how transactions work but when I look at the block chain, my BTC are coming from two addresses.  One of those source addresses has the previous transaction confirmed.  On the other, the transaction before mine is still unconfirmed.  I assume this is why my transaction is unconfirmed as well.  Something down the line is jamming up my current transaction.

I'm saying that even if the government doesn't "ban" BTC, there is no reason to invest.  And I'm saying that the price rise is directly related to people acquiring BTC for illicit uses.  Because if the illicit uses were removed from the equation, there would be very little reason to acquire BTC.
@_date: 2013-02-14 15:27:09
I noticed the same on a transaction I performed yesterday.  It looks like CB is attempting to re-send the transaction after it "fails".  I've received 3 separate notices of incoming coins into the destination account.  I sent an email as well but haven't heard anything back.  My transaction still shows as Pending on CB's site.
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:20:30
What does your transaction on Coinbase show?  I moved some coins from CB last evening and it's still a pending transaction.  You may be experiencing the same.
[similar issue](
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:05:08
I totally agree.  But if you are investing, having your coins immediately is less of a concern (and the price is locked when you buy).  
If you are purchasing something that you want/need now, I would go with another route.  Or buy some now and hold them so you have BTC on hand when you are ready to purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:52:24

I'm sorry but as I've said, my sweeping statement makes logical sense to me.  If you can provide data that shows people use Bitcoins for other transactions, I'll be happy to eat crow.  What transactions have you made with your Bitcoins?  And what evidence do you offer to support the "fact" that the rest of the Bitcoin owners follow your same behavior?


I'm fairly certain that people have been saying this for as long as they've been saying Jesus will come back to Earth.  When an average loaf of bread costs $10, let's talk about putting my money in an alternative currency.  But you and I both know that will never happen.

BitInstant charges a fee of 3.99%.  If you agree to fund $200, ~4% of that will be given to BitInstant.  In addition, you must pay $3.95 to a middleman (ZipZap) on top of your investment.  I've used it several times and had successful experiences, but [this]( thread below seems to indicate that things may not be as instant as they used to be.
If you use this service, when you go to Walmart ask for the form that is indicated on the print out.  Fill in all of the relevant information.  If the person asks, you are paying a bill.  I tried to explain that I was buying digital currency but the person taking your money is not going to understand.  Also explain that the fee is built into the amount that you're paying.  They don't understand how you're sending a sum of money without a separate fee line being added.
If your CVS uses the Moneygram red phone, use that.  You get to type in all of you information and then hand the cash to the cashier at the front when you're done.

@_date: 2013-02-20 06:53:11
No worries.  I just don't believe that BTC has any real value currently other than being used for illicit activities.  Don't get me wrong though, those activities are very much in demand and BTC allows them to be satisfied.  So I see BTC growing significantly as long as it allows people to transact in that manner.  But if/when that goes away, BTC unfortunately becomes meaningless.

When the BTC / "Loaf of Bread" Ratio is relatively constant, then it can be used as a real means of trade.  You can replace "Loaf of Bread" with any good/service you buy often but if the price isn't somewhat constant like it is with USD, then you won't keep your day-to-day money in that currency.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:22:48
I think your definition of "correction" and mine differ.  Can you please explain what it will be corrected to?  That implies there is a baseline price for a BTC that the market will stabilize to.  And I don't see how you get there considering at this point there is a higher demand than there is supply.

People usually cash out to take a profit.  And I'll wager that there are a lot of people doing just that.  But the number of people getting in is still larger, so the price continues to rise.  Now if some new hack happens to shake the Bitcoin community, you might see a mass sell-off that outpaces buyers which would result in the price going down.
As long as there is a reason that people want to buy Bitcoin and the number of people outpaces (the miners bringing new units in + people selling off), the price will go up.
I'm not an expert but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.

You're right.  But if you were suddenly not able to gamble or buy illicit substances with BTC, why would the lay person have it?  And by lay person, I mean your mom/dad - not your computer science professor.
