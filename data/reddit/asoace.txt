That's why it is very stupid to compare bitcoins with "tulips" based on bitcoin's limited dankness.

If it crashes %70, I am buying 5 btcs. It will rise back in no time if a big scale crash happens as we all are waiting to buy cheap bitcoins.

As far as I remember, he had a terminal disease when he wrote that post. I am not sure what happened to him by now. Hopefully he is still alive.

It's funny that the price is already past 15k on CEX at the moment.

Nobody knows if there are gonna be a larger correction or not for sure !! We are all expecting for the dip based on the increases we had recently but I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see a major dip at all. If we knew a correction was gonna happen at the 10th/18th for sure, we all would have cashed out to buy cheaper coins by now..

The main reason is that Coinbase just listed Bcash, people thought bcash was going to skyrocket (which kinda did), so they dumped their btcs into bcash. Things will reverse in a couple of days. People already started selling their bcashes and buying bitcoin.

I believe this isn't going to affect btc's price unless the hacker sells off all the coins.Also this is the first time I heard about the NiceHash !!

If you have an Iphone, you can get an Apple Watch and download Crypto Pro from Appstore. I'll get one for myself for the same purpose.
