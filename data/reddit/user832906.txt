I was at a party yesterday. Full of thirtysomethings. Bitcoin came up and let me tell you, people dont have a fucking clue. It made me want to buy more. We are still in the early stages!

I bet the Slovenian government helped out.

"Hacked." The people involved w nicehash are shady

There is a lot of misconception.  They literally think the coin cant be divided. So they think you need to spend 12000  just to invest. They think its fraud. The the government will shut it down. Just typical shit.

Mines disabled for the last few days as well. No idea why. Don't have much in there but found it weird.

So what youre saying is 100k in 4 years?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:51:07
30% down. Then back up.

Major usa bank here. Takes about 5 to 7 business days for me through bank transfer.

"I declare a ban!"

To put that in perspective... that is one quarter of the annual budget of the biggest US federal agency. That's nothing in the grand scheme of things.

Good time to buy more.

Yea, wtf is going on with them? What a mess.

Thankfully this 93 year old man is here to warn us and at the same time say that regulators should let up on wells fargo.

Literally looking at my 2 GTX 1080 Tis pulling 0.0005 each right now and they've been averaging about 0.00045 the last week or so (so slightly lower). In fact, I keep meticulous records and since July, I've averaged about 0.0007 per GTX 1080 Ti. Whatever you're calculating, its way way waaaay off.   
EDIT: Just took a screen cap of my 2 GTX 1080 Tis pulling 0.001 combined (that's 0.0005 per card).

You rock mah dude!
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:34:21
GTX 1080 Ti gets you 0.0005 BTC per day. 1 divided by 0.0005 = 2000 days.

Yea, I see what you mean. If we're talking mining ACTUAL BTC, yea it would take forever. But no one in their right mind would do that. I assumed OP meant how much could you make (in BTC) currently mining (whatever it is).

No idea, but I'm buying all I can at $3,200 cause the bounce back will be sudden and fast and I'm scared I'll miss it.

Really rough calculations. To mine 1 bitcoin through a pool, at current difficulty (remaining unchanged), hash-rates (about 0.0005 per day right now), etc. with 1 GTX 1080 Ti ($1000 for the card) it would take really roughly 2000 days and cost you about $900-$1000 in electricity total.   
EDIT: My electricity costs are low. Should be twice that or roughly $1800-$2000.

holy shit. I never knew this!
