Any technical analysis of this? Satoshi Nakamoto planned to increase block size and even made instructions on how to so before he left the project. 7 years later the block size hasn't been changed. Who is in control of Bitcoin?

It's not limited to BFX. Some websites limit API requests so you build your own API on top of their site using a webdriver such as Selenium or use their internal API if they're built using Angular/React/Vue.

Doesn't seem that good, there are much better services out there right now such as TransferWise and Revolut and their fees are tiny compared to Bitwala's.

I remember Bitcoin from 2010. I was thinking about buying it but at the end didn't because the idea of new Bitcoins being generated each 10 minutes and computers doing weird mathematical tasks on your PC seemed sketchy...
That's the biggest regret in my life.

It's fake, lol. If you check the transaction fees now, you're going to see that BTC is 7-8 times higher.

Revolut seems really nice, I'll open an account on them! It seems like a better version of TransferWise but it doesn't have some features that TransferWise has.

Well... if it continues this downhill trend, it won't. It will be interesting what will happen after LN is fully out, it might help BTC a lot.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:26:35
It has nothing to do with the file name.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:15:08
That's absolutely normal.
BTC and BCH transaction fees are going to be identical while the network is not under load. The second the BTC network is under load the fees exponentially rise.
Only a half megabyte block size increase back when the BTC transaction fee was $100 would have lowered the transaction fee from $100 to just a few cents but they didn't do it.

Look at the bright side, we're heading where BTC was before the november\-december hype.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:30:32
I suppose someone could put a large quantity of BTC into the LN, the transaction fee compared to the BTC will just be a small fraction and people wouldn't need to buy BTC using on-chain, they would just be able to buy on LN.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:56:39
With 0-conf only the first transaction sent to the network will be accepted, other ones will be declined.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:40:09
This is because of the doublespending attacks on other cryptocurrencies I believe. You'd thin that Bitcoin being an ASIC coin is bad but turns out that it has its benefits.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:16:43
Your comment is funny because BCH is actually forming the longer chain, lol.

Is there any exchange where you can buy and sell BTC over LN?
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:07:59
But I'm wondering like, are there any services out that that would allow me to open a channel with a node where I put 0 BTC and he puts a specific amount and I would buy the BTC from him or someone else so they send me the BTC using LN.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:48:59
Currently we have two types of nodes, normal client nodes and hubs even though their implementation at this point is pretty much the same?
Is there an ongoing plan in which there will be added support that the hubs take track of all nodes and calculate hops instead of each client doing so? I believe such feature would be very useful.
The developer from Electrum are already thinking of implementing their own version of this [here.](
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:55:04
I believe that 0-conf is not 100% safe and many merchants don't even follow it, they will still wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:46:51
Honestly, by then, Bitcoin will probably be POS.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:30:10
Most cryptocurrencies have the same problem. Lightning Network is a solution for it that could work.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:48:26
Look at the bright side, it's good for micro-transactions. which is the point of LN.
If you want to send larger quantities, you can always do it on chain.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:27:29
Merging cryptocurrencies is pretty much impossible and has never been done.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:49:28
You can still use the Beta and it works pretty well.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:49:21
It probably won't need to do it for a long time after Lightning Network comes out.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:52:46
You can technically send BTC from Binance to the ATM by withdrawing from Binance to the ATM's address but I wouldn't recommend it.

@_date: 2018-06-07 12:27:39
Just wait for LN on Bcash, it's gonna be dope.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:14:06
I believe that it's a good side about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been seen as something to evade taxes and buy illegal stuff and the argument that all transactions are public kind of helped Bitcoin not to be declared illegal.
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:17:14
Nobody will sell you BTC under market value, it isn't like it's hard to trade BTC nowadays.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:26:57
 Why?? What would be the purpose?  We already have a nicely centralized one.

It's funny because it turns out that coins with ASICS are more secure against 51%.

I personally recommend Coinbase, it's very good for beginners.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:52:10
I had a similar problem when I first tried LN on the testnet, I couldn't send a payment because no channels were found to the payee, apparently it didn't fully sync and after syncing it always worked for me.
Your funds can't be stuck, you can always close the channel, even if your peer is offline, you just have to wait for the timeout time you and your peer choose.
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:51:17
Can I use them for Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:45:01
Unless you already have LN channels open. Then, it would be equal in speeds.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:55:33
Coinbase is just GDAX with a different name.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:50:02
Go ahead, nobody is stopping you.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:47:06
When you send the BTC into a channel it is in the channel and you can only send it over LN. If you want to send it normally you need to close the channel. Opening and closing channels takes the same amount of time as sending a transaction. (99&amp; of the time)
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:06:35
How the hell are they mining  12.53583158 BTC? isn't the limit 12.5? When did this get changed or are those fees?
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:42:39
It kind of is like TCP/IP but not exactly. See the fact that each LN node has to have a list of all other LN nodes.
For me to access another device on the Internet, my device doesn't need to have a list of all other devices.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:38:47
Technically they can support as much as their Internet speed and hardware can support.
But I was talking about the fact that each node has to have a list of all other nodes to calculate the routing.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:16:55

That would be considered fraud as far as I know and they're a company...
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:13:57
Payments on the Bitcoin blockchain are public. Why would having public payments on the LN be a problem?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:43:24
Do we even need to close channels at all? We can pretty much do everything over LN. Only problem I see if we want to receive or send a large quantity of BTC and the channel doesn't support that much.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:33:47
I supposed so. I use what's cheaper. If LN works out to be good with low transaction fees, I'll, of course, use it.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:29:04
It looks like bullshit honestly.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:25:39
There's no reason to do that, BCH has quite a bit of trading volume on Coinbase.
They should, in fact, support more cryptocurrencies...

I don't consider this a compromise on security, both type of blockchains can be secure. Scaling may not be such a problem for Bitcoin since Bitcoin stepped away from the idea of "cash for everyone" but towards a good such as gold in a digital form. I've used Bitcoin as an example since it's mainstream. This is more for a blockchain made for multiple uses such as Ethereum where microtransactions would be heaven.
