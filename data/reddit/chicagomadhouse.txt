Are you trying to withdrawal all 0.03? Try a bit less, the fees of transferring might not let the transaction go through. I believe the transaction fee is around 0.0005.

I would wait for Winklevoss ETF to come out. Currently GBTC shares are priced at a 35-75% premium since they say that one share is equal to 0.1 Bitcoins. Also, if you look at their business description, they claim that over time the share of Bitcoin that you had "purchased" before would actually decrease with time. For example, you purchase 10k worth of GBTC at 100 per share,  that's equal to 10 full BTC. 1, you're paying 45% more than market price, and the 10 BTC that they have allotted to you will actually become 9, 8, 7 BTC over time. I would look for an ETF that doesn't have this behavior. What you buy now is what you should retire with later.

Isn't GBTC overpriced because of the benefits of not paying taxes on the earnings? In the long term this seems like a no-brainer if someone were to expect the value of a Bitcoin to increase 10-100 fold - and this is the purpose of this type of account. Also, in investing it's about the % of return, not the price of the asset.

But if you are buying at a premium, you are selling at a premium too. I understand the direct liquidity is not there, but the value of the "asset" still is.

You should be fine. The address should still be associated with your wallet. Just wait 10 mins or so and you should see the confirmations start.

Avoid avoid paying taxes? So in other words, pay you're income tax? If it weren't for taxes we would live in a chaotic country (US) where nothing would get done. We don't have to worry about the high level details, only ourselves. Taxes are necessary to create a simplistic lifestyle for the citizens - although the tax money is not necessary spent in the most efficient manner possible.

Incredible article. Shared this with my buddies interested in learning about Bitcoin. Resonates strongly with me, as I am saving up for a wedding 11 months out). I have two portions to my savings, Bitcoin and Fiat. I found that when I hit my Bitcoin goal for the wedding, my fiat savings remained dormant. I purchased more Bitcoin this past weekend to add to the savings because of the point that the article makes.

Those fees look almost too good to be true! I might pick me one of those up ��
