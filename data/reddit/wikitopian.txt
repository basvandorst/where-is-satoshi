The music industry in the 90's presumed and promoted the idea that they caused music. They envisioned themselves as necessary and loving patriarchs of the art form, making artists and cultural phenomena from scratch. Time has proven them wrong, demonstrating that they were essentially parasitic, feeding off of and manipulating a phenomenon which exists independently of the "music industry".
Metaphorically, I believe the central banks and the "financial industry" are under a similar illusion that they are the loving patriarchs of money, creating wealth and financial opportunities from scratch. I believe the argument you're promoting here is premised on economic theory which relies on these false premises. Wealth is created by people doing useful work, by people extracting wealth from the environment, and by people concocting ideas and so forth. The idea that wealth is created by this or that incentive to respond to this or that central banking adjustment of monetary inflation is "not even wrong".
The question itself is premised on a wrong idea about the very nature and origin of wealth.
The optimal currency for maximizing economic prosperity is one which is as transferable, divisible, and predictable as possible. In other words, it's a currency which gets out of the way. Whether a currency predictably inflates, predictably deflates, or is predictably steady in its value is largely irrelevant, as long as it's predictable. Precious metals have predictable value, but they're cumbersome to transfer or divide, and you can't peg notes to precious metals without a secure central bank of some sort blessed by a sovereign entity...which will sooner or later succumb to the natural and unavoidable urge to manipulate or exploit that power (and then weave esoteric arguments for why it's altruistic to do so).
