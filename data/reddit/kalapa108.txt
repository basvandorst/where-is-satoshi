Wow! Incredible thoughts. Thank you!

Retail payment incentives are key. 
In time is it plausible that via lighting retailers could offer incentives without sacrificing margin.

Thanks for providing context here. Always remember to learn from the past...

Will do!

Very eloquently written!

I would posit that it’s totally rational logical that Bitcoin Collateralized Smart Contracts are key in driving market cap in the near term...
When individuals use a platform like Abra price exposure to equities is collateralized on both sides. The circulating supply of Bitcoin is small, we have a finite supply of collateral to post against trillions in equities.
People will gravitate towards platforms like Abra because there is great UX, the complexities are totally hidden. Additionally access is so simplistic and cheap...

From what I understand wallet of satoshi is an open source project &amp; currently does not have a real time price feed...

I’m pleased you think it’s an ad for Abra! It’s just a fun video I made in my office the other day. :)
I agree with your take: “BTC is steadily replacing gold in an era of economic uncertainty”...additionally I believe Bitcoin being programmable money will be a huge driver of market cap in the near term as well.
Have a great day!

Hi Guys,
Eric here from Vancouver BC. First of all great job on ABRA. Love the app, your companies mission is incredible!
How are you guys thinking about governance moving forward with respect to potentially holding/borrowing majority positions in US stocks and ETFs. For example in the future ABRA may hold a majority position in "XYZ" company listed on the NASDAQ, will you technically be an insider?
@_date: 2019-04-17 04:21:12
True, well said

I like that approach. Thanks!

Excellent point sir. Your commentary is a major value add to this community.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:58:28
Lol, enjoy your day my man...
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:22:29
All good points ^^.  This  truly is about the politics of money

Walked by a cafe in 2013, saw a “bitcoin accepted here” sticker. Went inside, enquired, fell down a rabbit hole...
@_date: 2019-04-17 03:56:26
I completely agree. In essence it goes against the ethos of bitcoin.
Although I still think a multi sig fully/semi insured cold storage solution is needed. 
My mom says she’s wants to buy one bitcoin but is too afraid to store it on her own...

Just read your link, thanks for sharing. I h e heard xapo provides custody for coinshares, tim draper, polychain, and  few other high net worth ppl/funds.
@_date: 2019-04-17 04:23:54
There has to be top tier custody solutions to on board institutional investors

I just got paid the other day in bitcoin, it’s an amazing feeling!
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:55:51
Eventually it has to move to a second layer
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:24:04
When fiat truly dies will it be akin to the wreckage we would see after the detonation of a nuclear bomb, or will it try to spark and then die out like a dud firework?

This knowledge/hypothesis is new to me. I only recently came to realize bitcoin can be used as the collateralized rails to move any type of value or create price exposure to an asset recently. Possible with a multisig smart contract executing in the background...
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:47:10
Bitcoin Standard...great book!
@_date: 2019-04-17 05:44:27
Awesome, appreciate your comments/reply.  I think it’s fair to say if you want true financial sovereignty you have to take on full custodial responsibility.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:59:58
Well said. Perhaps a belief in bitcoin is a disbelief in the system?
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:06:02
Yes one to buy and one to sell. All on chain.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:50:05
More commentary than a question. I just suspect beyond the bitcoin network underwriting a massive wealth transfer it also is a represents to the transfer to a new belief system
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:15:28
That’s correct. 
Although I’m talking about using BTC as the collateralized rails to move fiat or gain exposure to equities. This could create unprecedented demand for BTC.
Imagine I’m in Manila and I want to buy 1 share of google, and I only have a smart phone.
1. Load my Abra app with my local currency.
2. In the background a multi sig BTC contract is made.
3. I then get exposure to my 1 share of google. My exposure to google is collateralized with BTC.
* from a user perspective... all I think I did was load my iPhone with my local currency and bought a share of google.

On the contrary. Platforms that flourish will be non custodial...consumers will always hold their own keys...
