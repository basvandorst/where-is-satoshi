Yes but you know what, every step of the way has been a hassle, and these are things that should have been smoothed out the past 5 years, or someone should invest half a million to get all this stuff integrated into one easy site that is organized well.  Here are some problems I've had that I would not have had using hard cash at the corner store.
1. Scan apps don't work on apple products
2. Apple mobile browser can't scan QRs
3. 17+ hours to "sync" my wallet the first time - due to a "Fork"
3. Dwolla takes 8 days to transfer anything
4. MtGox hard to find the verification pages
5. Mtgox verification wants sate ID and state utility bills (anonymous HA!!!)
6. And top it off all of the so called "bitcoin trading communities" haven't sold in 2 months what I would have sold on ebay in 2 days.
I'm a total geek, but most logical humans would have said fuck it at 3.  I'm rallying for this currency right now, so I've stuck with it, but really this is fucked up.  And there are people that are going to have a lot to say in defense of it, but you know what, if this is going to become globally accepted something has to give.  This is worse than trying to set up an ebay in 1999 for someone that has never used the internet, but worse.

Bitcoiners are using FIAT wrong, 
Fiat is: any money declared by a government to be legal tender. *state-issued money which is neither...
You mean "physical coins" and yes they are hard to use.  But something should give here too, because if people should be able to accept a physical unit.

I get that, but if your going to be the "authority" and have millions of dollars passing through your system world wide every day, you should get a dev. team that can handle this, outsource this to india, or make it automated and check back after AI approves.
