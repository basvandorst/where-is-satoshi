It will never scan

Sounds similar to my case, except the scanner thing is still broken. The difference is, now they never email you back.

which ones do you recommend?

Only got one lens on my phone :/
Thanks though

Well, there's no "verify" button. It's linked to my bank account and I'm allowed to send and receive cash. There's only an "enable withdrawals" button when I look at my bitcoin, and that's where I'm supposed to scan my DL.
And yeah it sucks, I heard cashapp was one of the best ways to make daily buys.... Any ideas on other ways to buy $5/day or so without fees?

Found any alternatives for making lots of small buys?

Regular coinbase has fees though

Do **NOT** use Cashapp!
Their withdrawal system is broken. In order to withdraw bitcoin, you need to scan your driver's license, and it never actually scans. This is an old problem.
*However*, until recently, you *could* get around that by sending in a support ticket. So, users who contacted support before around a month ago were then told to email in a picture of their driver's license and a selfie, and then it would be unlocked.
**Now, they do not respond to any bitcoin-related tickets**. Trust me, I have sent in over ***FIFTY*** tickets over the past month. They have NEVER responded. And, just try looking up a phone number for Cashapp. Seriously, try it. They do not have a single working customer service phone number.
What this means, is **you can** ***buy*** **bitcoin, but you can** ***NEVER withdraw*** **it. ANY BITCOIN YOU BUY IS JUST A DONATION TO CASHAPP.**
**Don't make my mistake.** You can see my thread about it here, and I'm not the only one:  [

I'm glad your id was verified, but unfortunately it seems they no longer provide support.
\&gt;think before you make any purchase
you just admitted it would have happened to you too if they didn't verify your id. Thankfully, I spent one dollar, but I'm still pissed they stole my dollar.

free options for depositing fiat?

CashApp is a scam.
You can buy, but you can never withdraw.
Been trying to withdraw for 3 weeks now, but they conveniently have no customer service either. Any  BTC you buy there is just a donation to the CEOs pocket.
