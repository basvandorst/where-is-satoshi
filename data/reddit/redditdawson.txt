Dude, there's no reason for you to act all snippy and condescending, you literally said there's no such thing as a blockchain without Bitcoin and now you're backpedalling. 
It's obvious you were trying to dictate that Bitcoin is the only blockchain of value but you were erroneously stating that Bitcoin is the only blockchain, end of story.
You can't honestly say you didn't try to claim the only blockchain is the Bitcoin blockchain when this was your statement :

Keyword being "possibility", in reality this is not the case. 
In reality Bitcoin transactions are only "cheap" because there are so few users and the blocksize reward subsidy still makes up the bulk of miner revenue. 
If billions of people were using Bitcoin they would all be fighting for space on a tiny blockchain and transaction fees would skyrocket. People prefer intermediaries for added convenience and liability. Most Bitcoiners use intermediaries (wallets, exchanges) because it's too complicated and risky to handle yourself

Okay but you said 


Which isn't true. There are plenty of non-Bitcoin block chain whether you like them or not

Why would users pay more to use Bitcoin?  typically they expect a discount for doing so but in this case it doesn't even save the merchant money. 
Even if a 3 cent fee was sufficient (it isn't) as Bitcoin gains more users all fighting for space on the same blockchain that fee will go up. A busy store owner doesn't want people standing around waiting several blocks for a confirmation

Well, Bitcoin is a fairly decent example. People defer spending because they believe coins they own today will be worth more in the future, this translates to poor retail sales figures for Bitcoin-accepting retailers. 
Your logic of "just thinking things through rationally" doesn't really hold water. You might want to rebel and argue mainstream economics are somehow wrong but the principal is sound - money expected to lose value will typically be invested and money expected to gain in value will be held - *that's* thinking things through rationally. 
Out of curiosity, have you taken any college-level economics courses? Calling basic, proven, century-old economic fundamentals "goddamn retarded garbage" isn't really an intellectual position. How does the experiment go in your head? 
If you have $1 in two different currencies, one will be worth 90 cents tomorrow and the other will be worth $1.10, which do you spend?  
You have $1 in an inflationary currency. You can either invest in a bond that guarantees a 10% return per year or wait a year and allow inflation to reduce the value to 97 cents, what will you do?

Considering how few places accept Bitcoin in Africa, why would they only want to convert to a fully-spendable currency once per month? 
Bitcoin isn't well suited to use in Africa. You need a constant internet connection, the value is unstable and it's very complicated to keep secure. MPESA works because it doesn't require data is immediately spendable and has low fees.

Just Google "Bitcoin mining electricity consumption" and you'll see a few studies. Apparently Bitcoin is on track to use as much electricity as Denmark by 2020. It's massively inefficient in terms of how much electricity is used to process a relatively tiny number of transactions
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:27:40
That's not comparing apples to apples though. Banks hire millions of employees , offer loans and investments and insured accounts and service billions of people conducting thousands of transactions per second. 
Meanwhile Bitcoin is a system of rewarding Chinese miners thousands of dollars every ten minutes for processing less than four transactions per second. Last I read Bitcoin mining uses as much electricity as all of Ireland to simply pay these miners and process less than one tenth of one percent of Visas capacity

There will be no socialized losses, in fact there will be no compensation whatsoever for those who lost their coins. 
When a user signs up for Finex they agree to the Terms of Service, part of which indicates that BFX has a very limited liability when it comes to any losses whatsoever. 
This is directly from their TOS:






To clarify - Bitfinex owes its users *nothing*. By using the site they agree not to hold Finex liable for any losses whatsoever, and despite a few responses I've received there's no reason this agreement isn't enforceable.

This is provably and categorically untrue. Litecoin operates on a block chain that isn't Bitcoin, so do many other cryptocurrencies both public and private.

This is like saying a Honda isn't a "working" engine because it isn't as powerful as a Ferrari. Just because a blockchain isn't the Bitcoin blockchain doesn't mean that it isn't working. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it's a duck. 


I really don't need to justify it to you - you admit yourself it's a technology. If banks (or anybody) can harness that technology for their benefit then they will, it doesn't change the definition of that technology and it doesn't qualify as a "hijacking". 


Sorry, but they are still blockchains. If you copy Bitcoin's blockchain and only mine it privately between five of your friends, it's still a blockchain. If you change to some other algorithm, whether it's successful or not, it's still a blockchain. Just like an engine is still an engine whether it's a rotary or a Boxer and whether it's in a Ferrari or a Pinto. 


Again, nobody needs to justify the "legitimacy' of a technology to you. Banks appear to be using blockchains privately for document transfer, fund clearing, etc. Just because it is not decentralized and not public and not Bitcoin doesn't mean it's not a blockchain. A car engine doesn't cease to be called an engine when you use it only on private roads. 


No, it was an immutable ledger. Being decentralized and public were qualities of the Bitcoin blockchain but not inherent qualities necessary to qualify as a blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:43:08
You didn't mention large scale, you said it's the only "true and working" blockchain. It's certainly not the same scale as Bitcoin but I think Litecoin certainly qualified as a working blockchain, as do the private ones you despise. 
Blockchain are a technology, period. Banks and companies aren't "hijacking" anything, they are using technology as they see fit. Your hyperbole is really absurd.
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:25:29

The point has flown entirely over your head.

@_date: 2017-03-27 03:50:36


I'm not sure why considering your next two paragraphs of drivel are some of the most pretentious and juvenile bullshit i've ever read


This is laughable. Downright laughable. 7 years in and Bitcoin has amounted to a slapfight about how to scale past 3 transactions per second...the banking industry isn't threatened by this, this isn't competitive. I have an FDIC insured bank account, pay no account fees, get cash back on my credit card, can transfer friends and family up to $6000 for $0.50 and can use my debit card tap-to-pay at literally every retailer in town. Again, your post is just hilariously pretentious - banks are going to have no problem surviving the next 20 years if the past 7 are any indication. 


So aside from not having a clue about Bitcoin security you're also totally ignorant of the ecosystem? It's been years since banks have invested in bitcoin companies and private blockchains. JP Morgan, Chase, Citigroup, Santander, Barclays, Credit Suisse...virtually every bank has forayed into the Bitcoin/blockchain world and certainly knows what a blockchain is. You're utterly naive. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:15:42


You talked about how banks "might have a chance to survive 20 years" as if there's any indication they won't. It was pretty safe to assume you were referencing Bitcoin considering thats common rhetoric in this, the Bitcoin subreddit. 
You were talking about PayPal?  Who do you think owns PayPal?  


Okay, then you've flown past naivete to willful ignorance. Nearly every major bank has invested in Bitcoin technology at this point. It's been all over the news including on the front page of many prominent newspapers, on television and in movies...You're not only kidding yourself but outright deluding yourself if you truly believe that bankers haven't heard of Bitcoin by now. It's not just "startup-y arms looking at the tech" which is, again, a laughable downplay of the reality, banks have major investments in prominent Bitcoin companies like Coinbase and Bitpay. You sorely need a reality check in so many ways.

First of all, of course if you're willing to pay the highest fee you're going to get a quick confirmation, my point is that Bitcoin wasn't created to work for only the richest people using it. 
Second, 1-3 blocks is 10-30 minutes. 20 or 30 minutes for a confirmation is a joke when you're waiting for a purchase to be verified. Waiting 30 minutes to pay a vendor that was told bitcoin is awesome for his business isn't reasonable. 


Okay? I literally never said it did....but thousands of members of this forum couldn't help but proclaim that Bitcoin was great for remittances and for banking the poor and for low-fee transactions and now it's "so long as you pay the highest fee you'll probably get confirmed in 10-30 minutes!"

This is the main takeaway here - you've lost the entire point of using Bitcoin if you're encouraging people to do everything on a third party service. Bitcoin was created exactly to get away from that system. You're trying to reintroduce trust into the mix.

You're asking for "a recommended road map for entities that are custodians of coins", "Specifics of steps to be taken to safeguard the security of the coins", " common pitfalls one should look for", "a document somewhere that can shed light on them?"
It genuinely sounds like you guys are totally clueless about basic security and the main tenets of Bitcoin. This is a currency for people who want to control their own security and be ultimately accountable for it, making asking for a guide on how to do so pretty ridiculous when you're already in custody of funds. Imagine a US bank making a reddit post asking for some kind of wiki on how to protect money they've been trusted with? It's downright ludicrous.

There's some kind of disconnect here. Coinbase can't magically remove Bitcoin fees, if they pay $0 in fees it's because they're now using Bitcoin 0%. Presumably they don't want to be reliant on a third party, which is one of the main points of using Bitcoin at all
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:47:57
Fair for who?  If you're exclusively using Bitcoin to send thousands of dollars then maybe it's fair but if you've been priced out of using it at all for your business even though a bunch of rabid Bitcoiners convinced you it was the future of money you might consider it unfair, no?  
The tone and message of this subreddit has changed so much in the past two years it's utterly unrecognizable. A few years ago Bitcoin was going to bank the unbanked and disrupt the remittance industry and allow merchants to avoid terrible credit card fees and now you have people saying $100 fee is just fine and some people are too poor to use Bitcoin.

Mind you, I barely post here at all and barely pay attention to Bitcoin anymore but I've literally never read somebody post that Bitcoin doesn't work. Of course it hasn't stopped working , blocks are still being made and transactions are still being processed. The complaints I see are about use cases being dissolved. Forget about microtransactions and forget about getting a transaction confirmed in a reasonable time, especially so if blocks are full. Nobody is going to encourage a street food vendor to accept Bitcoin if they have to pay a $1 fee or wait for 20 minutes or otherwise rely on a third party, all of which would have been unimaginably unreasonable a while ago 
It's unfortunate to now see so many people proclaiming that Bitcoin was never made for microtransactions or that poor people shouldn't use Bitcoin (I literally read this here today). Justification is a slippery slope and you might not be too upset today about paying a Max $1.50 or waiting 19 minutes with a 5 cent fee but that's missing the first for the trees and down the road you'll be justifying a Max $10 fee and waiting 30,40 or 50 minutes for that same five cents and still asking why people think the Bitcoin they used to read about isn't working as intended
I'm not opining one way or another, I don't know if BU or segwit or lightning are the solution or most fair or whatever, but I will say that it's unfortunate to see how quickly Bitcoins original ideals have been abandoned and dismissed as if they never existed

It occurs to me that companies like yours who have to ask these kinds of questions on an internet forum shouldn't be holding other peoples money. You're using Bitcoin, the "be your own bank" currency, you shouldn't have to or be asking for roadmaps on how to handle custodial funds.

You can argue that fractional reserves are a bad idea, that's fine, but it's not like any Bitcoin owners are going to be providing mortgages or liens of credits. Banks are a voluntary service and charge a fee for what they provide, I don't see the problem. You can typically avoid fees by carrying a decent minimum balance
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:50:45
I'm not sure why the "no more need for a bank" rhetoric is so popular - banks do a lot more than hold your money. Is Abra going to offer you a business loan?  Are they going to issue you a credit card?  
If it worked ideally I can see Abra being a killer app for sure but it wouldn't eliminate consumers need for banking services. 
I'm also very skeptical that financial regulators are going to let this function as-is. It's basically allowing people to be their own money transmitters, which is a highly regulated industry.

This is a very short-sighted view of the world. The legacy system maybe uses more electricity but it also generates more jobs, handles more transaction, serves more customers and merchants. 
Some of the supercomputers Bitcoin is being compared to are doing invaluable medical work or securing nations, all of Bitcoins power is simply to secure a 3 transactions per second network. It's really not brag-worthy that it takes so much work and so much electricity for such meager results. 
I'm not knocking Bitcoins but the exact same transactions could be secured with 1% of the electricity if there wasn't a mining arms race going on and it's downright ludicrous to compare the relatively tiny economic benefits of Bitcoin to those of legacy banking. You might have an anti-establishment view of banking but it's a local job with money being spent in your local economy rather than money being funnelled directly to Chinese miners.

Bitcoin is a transaction network.

That's not exactly right. There's nothing inherently wrong with loans, it's loans issued to people who can't ever repay them that arguably caused the most recent financial crisis, but I suspect you just wanted to rant about fractional reserve banking. 


An emerging loan market has made banks obsolete. Gotcha. Hey can you lend me a mortgage? 


This is actually like, the least usable thing banks do. Banks help your local economy much more than you apparently realize. Your local stores and service providers who need capital for their business aren't using "emerging peer-to-peer loans", they are using reliable banks. 


1. That's an enormous assumption considering the tps limits Bitcoin is hampered by and 2. Because the entire point of credit is enjoying things today and paying for them tomorrow. There's nothing inherently wrong with this. Bitcoin and Abra, even gone mainstream, will not suddenly cause people to not want things in advance.

To be clear, its not that people don't understand it, it's that this isn't remotely the Bitcoin people were talking about years ago. Instant, cheap transactions on the permanent and immutable Bitcoin blockchain was going to be the backbone of The Internet of Things, capable of banking the unbanked and capable of microtransactions. The goalposts have moved so far from there that Bitcoin is unrecognizable and so it's tough for people to go from the thought that Bitcoins blockchain is capable of cheap transactions for the whole world to the idea that the Bitcoin blockchain is only for the wealthy and anything else requires prepayment and use of some convoluted side-chain

Neither of those are evidence of anything. You don't know who is broadcasting these transactions nor do you know their intent. A chart of rising transactions isn't proof that those transactions are spam. Care to try again?

You're the guy who decided the best way to encourage people to use Bitcoin is to lie about it's functionality

Okay but there's going to be much steeper competition for LN fees - mining on the Bitcoin blockchain requires millions of dollars in mining equipment to be profitable, running an LN node takes considerably less resources and so Bitcoin miners can't reasonably rely on expectedly-low LN fees to provide a worthwhile revenue


This is going to be dictated by the fees attached to opening/closing transactions, any miner will pick up such a transaction quickly so long as the fees are sufficient. 
LN fees will never be a significant source of income compared to what miners are anticipating to pay their bills in the future, that is, on-chain transactions

A partial alternative to the USD that's only capably of 3 transactions per second currently?  I wouldn't agree Bitcoin is decentralized either considering mining is heavily centralized to China. 
Lastly, "low to no transaction costs" - I thought this kind of blatantly falsw rhetoric was laid to rest. No fee transactions will never confirm and fees have been steadily rising as the blockchain fills, they would absolutely skyrocket if major adoption actually occurred.

So you're claiming "tens of millions" of users are conducting less than a half a million transactions per day? 
I'm aware "some wallets claim 10 million accounts" but some users are bound to have multiple wallets and many (millions) of those wallets have a negligible balance or have since been abandoned. No matter how you paint it Bitcoin scarcely has a million active users. Telling a merchant they will benefit from "tens of millions" of Bitcoin users is a bit disingenuous when the reality is that they might see a few dozen sales from Bitcoin acceptance.

Okay but my entire point is that this train of thought didn't exist two years ago. Side chains and other convoluted bullshit weren't necessary, and in fact may not be necessary for a more robust cryptocurrency that can handle the throughput without having to lock up funds and establish channels.

Bitcoin is for big transactions only and otherwise you can figure out the LN (ETA unknown)".

Beyond this, even in a fully-working format there's still doubts about how many people will actually end up using LN. It requires typing up funds, essentially prepaying for days or weeks worth of common purchases, and requires channels between retailers to accept. Will McDonalds or Amazon ever have interest in a "Lightning Channel " ? Will regular users want to lock up a weeks worth of coffee money?  
I have no doubts that LN will eventually work in one form or another, but I still question the demand for such a convoluted system. When I first heard of Bitcoin years ago the talk was all about transparency and affordability from cheap (even free) on-chain transactions, now the future clearly holds the majority of transactions on what amounts to a series of IOUs and I'm not surprised that people are disappointed or disillusioned with Bitcoin

Sorry, but the idea of having to create two transactions on the chain (opening and closing a channel) PLUS locking up funds in advance is going to eliminate a ton of use cases that Bitcoin hoped to achieve at its inception. This whole payment channels mechanism that has become the focus of Bitcoins scaling efforts has so thoroughly obfuscated the benefits of using Bitcoin I cant imagjne it gaining the appeal it could have had on-chain scaling been at least attempted. Instead Bitcoin is owned by Chinese mining interests and a handful of developers who tell the majority what's good for them.

To play devil's advocate a bit I don't think it's exactly honest to claim that Bitcoin is succeeding despite whatever the current price is. Bitcoins could be $100,000 each but if mining is totally centralized and blocks are full and fees are crazy and the poor are still unbanked and it never went mainstream I wouldn't really call it a success personally. There's a lot more to what Bitcoin is than the price and I honestly think the price is still reflective of a lot of unrealized future potential that, if never met, could quickly tumble 
Bitcoin is *surviving*, sure, and yeah the price is definitely nice but we've got slapfights among developers, full blocks, centralized mining, decreasing nodes and the concepts of cheap on-chain transactions or microtransactions are totally gone.

Probably not the answer you're looking for, but I'll take a shot anyway:
With segwit implemented the actual Bitcoin network will be able to process up to 4x more transactions (roughly 16 tps?) but, on average, it will be closer to 2.1x (roughly 8.5tps?)
That's strictly on-network traffic. Now, with Lightning functioning, transactions on the Lightning Network could theoretically be thousands or tens of thousands of transactions per second, but these transactions are happening "off-blockchain" and within Lightning channels. Eventually the sum of these Lightning transactions are settled into the Bitcoin blockchain, which is still only capable of 2.1x to 4x the current capacity. 
Now someone much more knowledgeable can obliterate my answer. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:38:54


No, they are not. Certainly not necessarily. Bob-Alice-Carol isn't connected to Tom-Jim-Alex. 


Yeah, in *that isolated network*. Not the entire lightning network. I'm afraid it might be you who's misunderstanding the LN. You're certainly making some outrageous assumptions. 


Yes, you absolutely do. I'll explain in the next point.


Withdraw directly as a LN channel...therefore locking funds up in that channel. You can't spend those coins without closing that channel and finalizing the transactions within it. 


No, they absolutely are not. You lock up Bitcoins within an LN channel and then can only transact those coins within that channel until that channel is settled. If a channel doesn't have enough funds within it to conduct a particular transaction you'd require yet another actual Bitcoin transaction to load more funds into it. 


Far from easy. Bitcoin adoption proper hasn't reached critical mass and we're yet to see whether or not there is significant demand among these payment processors for convoluted LN channel payments. Do you think BitPay is going to want to lock up a week or months worth of Dell transactions? Do you think companies like Dell or Newegg are going to want to lock up funds? No, of course not. It's far more complex and involved than simply accepting Bitcoins. 
Unfortunately a *lot* of the dialogue I see about the forthcoming LN implementations are completely ideal fantasy scenarios where absolutely everybody is connected and operating as cheaply as possible out of pure benevolence. It was enough of a challenge to get some companies to accept Bitcoin indirectly via services like Bitpay where there is basically no involvement whatsoever and it cost Bitpay/Coinbase etc relatively little to sell off the received coins and transfer the fiat to the company. Now it's expected that BitPay/Coinbase et al will establish Lightning channels with every major company, which absolutely necessitates locking up an unknown amount of funds in advance in order to maintain the channels.

Here's somebody saying a 4 cent fee is too much, and claiming they are curious whether fees are optional or not:


I could fairly easily dig up dozens of these examples, they are extremely easy to find because "cheap transactions, everything on the Bitcoin blockchain!" was the hyperbole du jour of 2014. Nobody mentioned "on-chain" because nobody imagined scaling efforts would involve just moving transactions off Bitcoin.

I feel like you're not really considering the monumental stupidity of what you're suggesting. 
Merchants can use stuff like Bitpay today because of the low requirements and relative availability on the blockchain. If a merchant as big as Walmart wanted to use a service like Bitpay they would take up nearly all available space on the current blockchain and so obviously something like LN would be required....
...now in order for something like Bitpay to process all of Walmart's transactions they would need to establish a gigantic Lightning channel, enough to accommodate hundreds or thousands of transactions per second. Again, in order to do this either Walmart or Bitpay on their behalf would have to lock up hundreds of thousands of perhaps millions of dollars in a channel. They would never, ever, ever be interested in doing this. 
It's plain to see that Walmart or Amazon would never touch Bitcoins, but they would also never involve themselves in something so convoluted as Lightning Channels in order to get "Bitcoin-paying" customers in the first place and they would rightfully laugh in the faces of Bitpay execs when they ask for money in advance to operate something they try to explain as a "Lightning channel"

Consider this - two vendors selling two identical items. They both offer free shipping. One of them charges $10 flat and "eats" the fees, the other charges $10.50 to recoup credit card fees. According to you they have cleverly hid the fee in the cost of the item, right?  
Now what happens in real life is that the merchant selling for $10 makes all the sales and the merchant charging more sells none. The merchant who tries to gouge their customers makes no profits and the one who eats the fee more than makes it up by actually making sales. 
You see, no offence, but people who make the claim you are have no experience with business or economics. Paying the fees are simply a cost of doing business, a cost that comes with the great reward of having your products be purchaseable by millions of people using credit cards. The smarter merchant eats the fee because you take the 3% off your profit versus not being able to take 3% off anything because you make no sales. Credit card fees are literally just a cost of doing business and in fact a business expense that reduces their taxes owing. 
Look at OB as an example - they pay no fees but also have no sales because the millions upon millions of people who own credit cards and are ready to spend cannot buy their products....which is obviously so much better than paying 3% for thousands of sales.

It occurs to me you're just assuming LN channels will operate in the most socialist fashion possible while nothing else in the Bitcoin universe has done so. Not every channel will be connected and where only one connection exists it can be expected that fees won't be minimal for essentially no reason other than the benevolence of a node op

This is anecdotal (and old) but here's an article about how darknet markets processed more payments than Bitpay in 2014
and I don't think this trend has reversed. Bitcoin is very seldom used for online legal transactions because it's in many ways inferior to payment options that already exist for those legal transactions but when it comes to buying drugs online Bitcoin is essentially purpose-built.

Ironically it's exactly the opposite - Bitcoin is so highly centralized that Chinese miners decide what happens to it. They're decided, along with a small room full of devs, that on-chain scaling isn't desirable and so the community is rallying behind what they're left with - transactions off the blockchain. Chinese bandwidth concerns are literally the reason people like you have concluded that LN is "the best idea" 


Haha, it's not this easy. You can't start a channel willy-nilly, you have to lock up a certain amount of funds and then maintain that channel. Who even knows if Dell or any other Bitcoin-accepting merchant is interested in such a complicated system. It was easy to allow Bitpay to take Bitcoins from people and give them cash, this isn't so simple. You're again making the wild assumptions that absolutely everybody is going to be interested in maintaining Lightning channels with everybody else. 


Not how it works, how it's intended to work. Bitcoin was intended to be a 1PC = 1 vote decentralized system with cheap nearly instant microtransactions and a solution for the unbanked but that's obviously no longer the case - how things are intended to work is rarely how they play out. 


Actually Bitcoin doesn't need Segwit for LN to work. 


Because not every altcoin is so thoroughly dominated by chinese mining interests not every altcoin even needs a convoluted Lightning network to process thousands of transactions per second. Again, LN is just the hope people are latching on to in light of the fact that dominant Chinese mining interests are controlling what's actually happening to Bitcoin's blockchain.

"Linking the networks" isn't as simple as saying the words dude. You need to lock up as many funds as those networks will need to transact between opening and closing the channel to refill it. These maintenance costs are not trivial. 


and yet at the end of the very same paragraph:


If the channels are not connected then they are isolated and ultimately NOT on the same network. You're contradicting yourself. 


Yes, they absolutely will. Absolutely any transaction that exceeds the amount of funds locked into the channel will require the closing and reopening of that channel. I'm getting the very strong impression you really don't know how LN functions and still don't at all understand the necessity to lock up operating funds. 


Of course, because according to you Bitcoin is a perfectly efficient system where every business has channel connections to every nonrelated business and every single user is operating an LN node for pennies out of the goodness of their heart. 


As you explained yourself, companies operating with Bitpay already don't need to transact with the Bitcoin network at all, nor is BitPay required to lock up any funds in advance for this operation, yet you naively go on to presume that this will continue in the exact same fashion despite Bitpay needing to operate an insanely complex web of channels involving the locking up of potentially millions of dollars of operating funds directly in a LN channel simply to overcome the shortcomings of Bitcoins blockchain. 
The very distinct difference is that Bitpay today owns Bitcoins, yes, but they are free to spend them anywhere at anytime. When these channels are intact the Bitcoins they have locked up cannot be spent anywhere without closing the channel to which they are designated. It's not at all the same level of investment. 
This conversation isn't progressing at all, you just want to delude yourself into thinking that every BTC-accepting company (that doesn't actually hold any BTC whatsoever) will be willing to lock up funds for the meager amount of Bitcoin sales they see, or alternatively that BitPay will be willing to lock up funds for every business they service. Everybody will apparently operate LN connections for pennies and nobody will ever need to close channels because everyone has every penny locked into the convoluted LN. 
When LN is *actually here* you're going to see that it doesn't play out at all as you had hoped, just like Bitcoin mining has strayed miles away from the 1PC = 1 vote and decentralized mining system it started with.

First of all, lol, no you can't. Not at 3 transactions per second, not if you need to lock that Satoshi up on the Lightning Network to do so...Just no. If there was only Satoshi remaining and the world was expected to use it for any meaningful number of transactions a different cryptocurrency would simply usurp Bitcoin as worldwide adoption hasn't even begun to occur and nobody is obligated to use that Satoshi when other options with potentially higher throughputs could easily be developed (and potentially already exist)
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:48:37


Because in it's infancy there are already regularly tens of thousands of backlogged transactions and mainstream adoption hasn't even began to occur?

It's great that you're so happy to pay triple the fee it took last year to confirm a transaction, and adoption hasn't even begun!  next year you'll be paying $0.50 or $1.00 just to move money from one wallet to another and you'll still be saying "just pay the proper fee!"
It's people like you that have apparently completely forgotten that Bitcoin used to be hailed as a banking solution for the poor and useful as a microtransactions mechanism, now it's people like you who are happy to justify to themselves skyrocketing fees thanks to a chokehold on Bitcoin development 
@_date: 2016-12-11 05:18:40


Haha. None of this is true. You can't change anything in bitcoin without the miners supporting it and there's no limit whatsoever on their control. If you (or I, or anybody) wanted to fork away from the chain they control they could immediately sabotage your new chain with their enormous hashpower. You can't add Segwit without them, you can't change the mining algorithm or blocksize or block reward or essentially anything without them. Chinese miners own Bitcoin. Period. Can you name a single significant change that can be made to the Bitcoin protocol without the support of the Chinese miner that own a majority of the network's hashpower? 


Once again, there's no point. No changes that China doesn't approve of would ever be possible and it's utterly irrelevant what the average Bitcoin owner wants. Why should I bother articulating my opinions when people like you rush to call it an "agenda" or, laughably, FUD and ultimately it's irrelevant because I don't own a major chinese mining farm. Bitcoin user wants are irrelevant. 


I'd love to hear what you think my misconceptions are, just a moment ago you accused me of not articulating anything and it's conversely you who has major misconceptions about how LN will ultimately work, how decentralized Bitcoin is and how much control miners have over Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:13:19


I honestly expected this - that kind of rhetoric is pretty popular around here. If you have a problem with the way Bitcoin is being controlled or the direction it's headed in you're assumed to be a FUD-spreading troll from r/btc. Par for the course. 


Right, and yet everybody here talking about LN is happy to assume absolutely everybody will be connected to everybody else and nobody will have an issue locking up coins to avoid using on-chain transactions and node fees will be absolutely negligible. Assume anything else and you have an agenda and need to "go get the deep technical understanding" of something that doesn't exist yet. 


Again with the presumptions. I don't *know* that at all. A solution involving locking up funds and reducing Bitcoin to a series of trading IOUS with money put on a table in advance doesn't seem like the best solution to me but hey, it's what we're all pinning our hopes on, right? 
The benefits of Bitcoin used to be instant, secure, cheap transactions and now all of those are being foregone in exchange for a convoluted system where people need to lock up a week or months worth of spending money in order to avoid actually making a Bitcoin transaction. Everything the LN is being used to accomplish could just as easily be accomplished with no Bitcoin tokens and a centralized server (like the centralized Chinese miners that control Bitcoin wholly). The emphasis has shifted from Bitcoin transactions to trading points on the Bitcoin Lightning gift card network and I'm left wondering how this is ever going to catch on in the mainstream considering how convoluted it's become to use.

Realistically the low cost to operate a node is irrelevant. Market prices are very rarely related to the cost of production or operation and much more frequently established as the most you can practically charge for. As long as a fee is marginally less than on-chain fees that will be the preferred option and competition will force fees lower but not any lower than necessary - certainly never negative. 
I just find it so odd that everyone has their hopes pinned so heavily on Lightning operating in the most ideal and efficient way possible when essentially nothing in the world of Bitcoin has gone this way so far. I'm yet to see evidence that so many users are willing to lock up funds on LN and operate a node that competition to route transactions will be so stiff and absent these benevolent users LN fees could conveniently be far from cheap 
@_date: 2016-11-13 15:05:56
To be fair, this doesn't really answer the concern. OP asked" how can you send many transactions per day on chain with little fee" and your solution is "don't. Wait for money to accrue". 
I remember very clearly two years ago in this subreddit when people were talking about how amazing Bitcoin is going to be for all kinds of use-cases, including payment-by-the-hour instead of two week paycheques or per-song Bitcoin payments for streaming music, with the emphasis moved to off-chain transactions it's not surprising to me to see people disillusioned with the Bitcoin they knew

The question as phrased doesn't make sense. You'd have to buy a "gift card" for a specific Lightning Network channel.

An interesting idea, improbable to implement.

It's neither a red herring nor irrelevant. No offense but you clearly don't know the first thing about taxes


It's not at all that they can't fathom Bitcoin being an expense (you sound incredibly hyperbolic making such idiotic and pretentious statements) but that it's an expense declared totally incorrectly. Declaring expenses is a very specific and regulated thing, for which coroporate accountants must follow strict guidelines and do so in a reasonable and consistent fashion. To list a bitcoin purchase as a technological expense makes no sense whatsoever and so the IRS got involved, it's not at all because they don't understand Bitcoin.

I'll politely disagree. Merchants are the ones who will encourage adoption by offering a savings on their goods in exchange for the savings they see for not using credit cards or banks. In addition they'd also expectedly see appreciation from the deflationary aspect of Bitcoins. It's called an economic cycle for a reason, you can't expect retailers to accept with little adoption but you can't expect much adoption with few places to spend it. 


This is inherently wrong. Early adopters are people that bought in early whether they hold or use Bitcoin. It's arguable that what really kicked off the value of Bitcoin was a very famous user, they guy who spent thousands of Bitcoins on a pizza. If all early adopters were strictly holders there wouldn't be a single Bitcoin merchant or remittance company today. Retailers will never see sufficient demand without a decent userbase and a decent userbase will never emerge without a plethora of uses for buying Bitcoin beyond speculation. 
I'm not at all criticizing early adopters, I'm criticizing holders whether they were early or late and I'm not sure why you're conflating the two so naively 
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:00:17


And I'm trying to suggest that Bitpay could never afford to maintain a Lightning channel for a company with the sales volume of Amazon or Walmart. They can't lock up tens of millions of dollars for an indeterminate amount of time. 


You're just speculating here, and so am I, but it's hardly an "attractive 0.5% fee". Bitpay has to lock up enough funds for days or weeks worth of Walmart transactions and walmart customers would inexplicably have to do the same. LN is nice as a fantasy solution to Bitcoin scaling woes but it simply won't play out in real life - if Walmart and Amazon didn't want Bitcoins when it only involved Bitpay handling regular blockchain transactions they certainly won't be interested now that somebody has to maintain a Lightning channel for them and their millions of customers.

I've got two thoughts on the matter - 
One, if the blocksize is so low that a "spam attack" is this easy, that's a problem. 
Second, it's pretty sad that Bitcoin users have referred to people simply using the network as a "spam attack". There's no proof whatsoever that this use was malicious and if you read this subreddits past you see all kinds of talk about using the Bitcoin network to do all kinds of things that would generate tons of transactions. The Bitcoin network was going to be used to "bank the unbanked", to handle the Internet of Things, to pay other drivers a tip for moving out of your way on the highway...I could go on and on about the thousands of use cases Bitcoin was going to be great for, but now that the blocksize has been stuck at 1MB and growth is still down the road any kind of significant use of the network is suddenly deemed a "spam attack". 
Imagine you read about this fantastic Bitcoin network with its instant cheap transactions and upon actually testing out a new service you see people claiming there was a malicious attack going on. If someone is paying a fee to use the Bitcoin blockchain they are not unlike any other "non-spam" transaction and so I'm not sure why the heavy spam rhetoric is so prevalent now. A paid transaction is a paid transaction is a paid transaction and this spam attack business is a witch hunt to justify Bitcoins shortcomings. 
I'm not a "big blocker" but the narrative here is just pathetic

There's at least two examples in the several quotes I made of people discussing free Bitcoin transactions. When they mention Bitcoin, they're obviously and inarguably talking about the Bitcoin blockchain, therefore free on-chain transactions. Sorry about your piss-poor reading comprehension skills but being an asshole on the internet doesn't cover that up. Again, you have no evidence whatsoever that those quotes I did provide were discussing anything but transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Fuck me man, you're squirming really badly here to explain how several people talking about transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain were inexplicably not talking about transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It's utterly pathetic.

I didn't say this, I said mining is already centralized. Pretty poor arguments to put words in my mouth. 
I do get a kick out of phrasing like "the big blocker ideology". I don't really care either way but it's funny to hear hyperbole like this in conjunction with dozens upon dozens of threads complaining about rising fees and hours of waiting for confirmation while the highly questionable Lightning Network is being hailed as Bitcoins saviour by pushing all traffic off chain into what amounts to a prepayment system in a database. 
Segwit is, on average, only a 2.1x increase to Bitcoins current 3 tps max capacity but isn't it great that we didn't increase the blocksize!  darn big blockers!

No matter how high the value of Bitcoin is in 20 years the mining rewards will be relatively small to today's block reward. With only 1% of the 21M limit to be mined over the last hundred years of mining the block reward subsidy will surely no longer comprise a majority of miner revenue. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:34:47
Hey look, more outrageous assumptions about how the LN will actually operate. 


Maybe, not definitely "will be". I'm not seeing any indication that Bitpay will be willing to maintain such a diverse and wide series of channels for multiple large corporations that all require locking up funds for at minimum days worth of transactions. If multiple companies need hundred- or thousand-BTC channels then Bitpay might be tasked with locking away millions of dollars of operating capital just to maintain LN channels for a few stores. If not enough funds are locked away then channels will need to be topped up frequently, creating two on-chain transactions each time, negating some of the savings supposed to be achieved by LN. Of course you'll argue that Newegg and Dell and Bitpay will all happily cooperate on a single channel creating thousands of confusing transactions amongst each other but that's some completely naive optimism. 


I'm not insisting on anything, that's just how the LN works.. 


You aren't making sense. Payments collected on the LN must stay on the LN unless that channel was closed out and reopened. You can't just "sell those Bitcoins to their fiat suppliers" without finalizing the channel and then presumably opening up another one. 


Because of what I just mentioned, none of this will be instant. Assuming they want to close the channel they have to wait for confirmations on bitcoins blockchain, and then more confirmations to reopen the channels and resume LN transactions. 


More hilarious assumptions - on-chain addresses are somehow obsolete. 


Or several hours, if all traffic is pushed on to the LN and the Bitcoin chain stays at 1MB + Segwit with more adoption confirmation times could easily exceed an hour - they already do and Bitcoin has fairly low adoption rates. 
You still seem to grossly misunderstand how the LN functions. If Newegg wants to conduct 1000BTC worth of business on their LN channel then 1000BTC needs to be locked away between Bitpay and Newegg. Is Bitpay supposed to provide this money? It's an extremely complicated and convoluted system and wholly disingenuous for you to just pretend like everybody will be connected and everything will work perfectly and nobody will be unwilling to lock up operating funds simply to conduct LN transactions. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 00:11:35
Nobody mentioned "on-chain" because they were all talking about the Bitcoin blockchain already, something you obviously knew.

I think it's probably worth mentioning that in order to conduct the Lightning network transactions you're talking about you need to lock up funds in advance. 


The way this is phrased makes no mention whatsoever of the requirement to first reserve all the funds necessary to conduct these transactions within the channel. You're phrasing it as if simply establishing a channel means you can conduct unlimited off-network Bitcoin transactions but in reality you need to lock away all the funds necessary for those transactions to take place


Beaten to mention it but there are multiple different Lightning protocols under development, it's not one version being worked on by a single employee. 


This is also, in my opinion, disingenuous. Lightning transactions are not Bitcoin transactions, they are not occurring directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning transactions are more like a changing balance on an off-chain spreadsheet using funds that were initially locked away when creating said channel. 


Why only "might"? Bob will take a fee. nobody knows how small it will be. If Bob is the only avenue for Alice to send money to Carol why wouldn't the fee be as much as the market will bear? Why won't fees be just marginally less than Bitcoin on-chain transactions to maximize fee revenue for Lightning nodes?


...and funds need to be locked away for the operation of the channel. Are you intentionally omitting this important factor?


No, they are not "real Bitcoin transactions". Only real, on-blockchain Bitcoin transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. Lightning transactions are simply changing balances on a Lightning channel, essentially two or more users trading IOUs until an actual Bitcoin transaction takes place to finalize things.

Chinese miners? I'm not sure people necessarily care extra about newly mined coins. There's no evidence they command any kind of premium. 


Yeah, no, this isn't it. Bitcoin has by far the highest liquidity of any coin. You can buy or sell thousands of dollars worth without crashing or spiking the price. It has nothing to do with honor. 


Again, no. At this point Satoshi is out of the picture both technically and figuratively. 


And because of low liquidity none of them are viable for the same uses Bitcoin is today


Being the most immutable coin has nothing to do with Satoshi being anonymous. Bitcoin would stand on its own merits if the creator was a known individual or entity. It's also far from faceless, some of the biggest controllers in the Bitcoin world are well-known individuals that own bitcoin busineses, thousands or tens of thousands of coins and own massive Chinese mining farms or produce mining equipment. Bitcoin is far from faceless in terms of the people most important to this economy. 


LN doesn't exist yet, nor is it a proven scaling solution. Time will tell. 


I think the more important perspective is that while Bitcoin's price isn't dropping it certainly isn't rising to new heights. The current price is still a reflection of Bitcoin's future potential and it would arguably be much higher and reflecting a greater potential if the infighting you mentioned wasn't happening.

No proof whatsoever that an increase in transactions is a spam attack.

Cheques are essentially IOUs...you realize that, right?


This is exactly right. It's as if two people both put $10 on a table and then wrote transactions back and forth between them until they decide to walk away and settle up the balance of all their transactions. It's exactly like a giant chain of IOUs and if any transaction exceeds the amount locked up a new on-chain transaction must be made to maintain the chain. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:08:09


I meant instant in that you were virtually guaranteed to be picked up within a block, and free in that a one or two cents fee was essentially free. 


And this is the same depressing rhetoric I was talking aboit - you have no idea when looking at a Bitcoin transactions what's spam and what isn't. This "spam attack" could easily be somebody piloting a new service on tbe blockchain only to discover that actually using Bitcoin is apparently an attack. The way to stop spam is apparently to raise the cost of a transaction by choking blockspace but that's also a great way to deter anybody to actually use Bitcoin too. Cutting off the nose to spite the face. 


In many cases being unbanked means you are in poverty and I clearly recall Bitcoin being touted as the saviour for poor third-worlders getting robbed by the evil banksters. $.20 may not sound like much but Bitcoin still have very few users relatively and such a modest fee already prices out the possibility of on-chain microtransactions. The linked fee page is on the 21 website, a company that hoped to use the Bitcoin network to foster microtransactions between all kinds of devices but fuck them, right?  they obviously just want to spam the poor network with all those awful transactions!

I'll never understand why people like you struggle so hard to deny the benefits and even existence of private chains.

You can't quantify individual free-time and it has absolutely nothing to do with saving vs spending. Some people go shopping in their free time, some people don't. Some people invent stuff in their free time, some people invent stuff at work. Your argument is wholly lacking in merit and logic. 


Some people have savings accounts without debt, some people have investments while still holding some debt. A mortgage is a debt and yet millions of people have mortgages while making other investments. Again, you make no sense, you're kind of just rambling here. 


Source? How can you possibly prove this claim? A lack of capital or a surplus of debt doesn't stop people from thinking dude. I'm sure a ton of inventions have been made by broke people who've accumulated debt in the process of developing their idea. 


The nonsense rant continues! 


Who's talking about writing cheques? What the fuck are you even on about here? 


I suspect we disagree on a large number of points considering how nonsensical your post was, but an inflationary monetary policy doesn't guarantee you spend every penny, it encourages people to either spend or invest, both of which ultimately stimulate the economy. 


Nobody said anything about bailouts. Lay off the egg nog dude. 


I'm not apologizing for anybody, I'm explaining that buying a coin and then holding it forever does nothing for the Bitcoin economy, one that has already seen a number of companies pivot away from bitcoin use due to lack of activity or viability. If you think a lack of economic activity that forces businesses to close is somehow a challenge to monetary policy you're sorely mistaken. 
Changetip has closed, OpenBazaar sales are absolutely dismal, and a cursory Google search shows a number of Bitcoin-based remittance platforms have closed over the last year. This has nothing to do with central bankers or the free time you're rambling about, this is a direct result of people favoring hoarding of a deflationary currency versus using it to stimulate the local Bitcoin economy. It's economic fundamentals ringing true because, well, obviously companies can't succeed if nobody wants to use their tokens. There's no incentive to risk lending Bitcoins when youre expecting appreciation with no risk and the lender would be expected to be both interest and the appreciation incurred.
Hell, even the savings you're talking about being immeasurably good for the economy are typically stored in a bank that's using those funds as a basis for making loans to local people and businesses. Storing cash under your mattress is about as stimulating to the economy as buying and holding a Bitcoin.

Now, interestingly enough, after reading your incredibly petty thread I browsed your posting history and look what I found:






So, by the admission of your own peers on this subreddit, you're lying to people about Bitcoin in order to promote it. Bitcoin isn't cheap, it isn't instantaneous, it isn't capable of microtransactions. You're in another thread talking about how Bitcoin can be the savior of Venezuela while Bitcoin users are calling additional traffic a "spam attack". Every time I bring up the rhetoric about how Bitcoin was promised to be cheap and instant and a revolution in banking I'm told those were lies but here you are in 2016 telling people Bitcoin is cheap and instant and laughably going to be used by devices for the Internet of Things. 
I wouldn't be surprised if Newegg never received a single Bitcoin in their existence. They obviously use a payment processor to convert coins to USD before receipt, which is a wonderful business move because you get the benefit of Bitcoin owners money without having to deal with a single confusing facet of Bitcoin, all while being praised among the Bitcoin community for being so innovative. Check Newegg's financial statements, they have absolutely no cryptocurrency holdings or funds...but you felt it wise to take the incredibly petty route of calling out a random internet stranger for posting on reddit (not even in this subreddit)

If it didn't have the security of Bitcoins current hashpower it simply wouldn't be Bitcoin. You're talking about a weaker, untested and unproven fork and it certainly wouldn't be the Bitcoin we know today supported by thousands of retailers and services. You're kidding yourself if you think a handful of rebels could fork this coin with a new algorithm and people would respect it as Bitcoin. People have *already* forked this chain to create different alts with different mechanisms and those certainly aren't Bitcoin, you're just deluding yourself into believing that Bitcoin is somehow still decentralized or in any way controlled by the users

Is this a real question you're asking?  the "reasonable alternative to breaking the law" would unfortunately be to allow yourself to be victimized by the ransomware but there's no way in hell the court is going to side with somebody who caused another individual to be victim of a software in order for somebody else to avoid the same circumstances. If you're unable to pay the ransom that sucks for you but it's nowhere near a reasonable excuse to infect somebody else's property considering they may be equally unable to pay the ransom. 
It's insanely stupid to claim you were under duress because you couldn't afford something. That's like saying you had to rob a bank or store because you couldn't afford your rent. Ransomware on your PC creates no physical threat of harm or fear for your life and the consequences are so lacking in severity that no court would agree you were essentially forced to become a criminal yourself go avoid the consequences. The case you linked involved people being beaten in jail and fearing for their life which makes a comparison to PC ransomware victims downright laughable

Yes except said appropriate mining fee keeps rising and rising, so much so that microtransaction on-chain are no longer feasible, Bitcoin will no longer be used for Internet of things transactions like everybody used to talk about, and such a limited blocksize means even if you want to pay "an appropriate fee" chances are you'll be priced out of the block by somebody willing to pay more...exactly the problem I'm talking about. 
To dismiss the entire issue as "pay an appropriate fee" is so shortsighted it's ludicrous. The "appropriate fee" has tripled in the past year despite adoption being fairly slow and still relatively very low

I fear you're kind of missing the point here. Saving is a good thing when a currency is already well established, which Bitcoin is not yet. At this stage stimulating the economy by spending Bitcoin at retailers and using it for remittances helps prove its utility. Hell, even using it on darknet markets helps prove one it's best use-cases. To simply hold and hope for appreciation means you may as well be holding baseball cards or Hatchimals or stamps - these things can potentially increase in value but are not a currency. 
You're perpetuating one of the main arguments against Bitcoin, one that has essentially been proven true by the lack of Bitcoins commercial use - a deflationary currency is not good for economic stimulation because why spend a dollar today when it'll be worth more tomorrow?  In the meantime retailers don't see any business and don't see Bitcoin as a useful and popular means of payment
Saving is good but does nothing for the economy - investing is a risky savings by means of economic stimulus but ultimately it's for the benefit of everybody. Holding or hoarding your coins and then simply hoping for the moon is doing nothing to actually work towards that mean.

Okay but one cent or a couple satoshis for a fee is as close to free as you can get. Paying 20 or 25 cents to move coins from one wallet to another is not. 


Of course I don't, but people are calling normal, paid transactions spam without any evidence simply because the blockchain can't handle the traffic. It's like a bartender is serving people and is all of a sudden swamped with drink orders so he accuses the excess traffic of trying to ruin his business. Do you not see the stupidity there? 


I don't buy this for a second. Nobody was lying, they were optimistic about the possibilities for Bitcoin before the entire network was strangled by the Chinese mining interests that now control it. 


This is basically laughable. Yeah, Bitcoin will help the third world by actually keeping all transactions off-chain using a convoluted system that hopes people can lock up funds for days or weeks worth of transactions and that these convoluted channels will be established between every vendor they need to shop with, lest they be accused of spamming the poor blockchain with their paid transactions.

The cycle goes something like this (in theory) - 
User buys Bitcoin, exclaims to retailers how they can save money with Bitcoin
Retailer begins accepting Bitcoin but sees very few sales. Retailer decides accepting Bitcoin is not worth doing, discontinues acceptance
Bitcoin fails to grow in value due to lack of retailer adoption, retail use of Bitcoin is not seen as a prominent use-case. 
Even if Bitcoin is growing in value from other uses, its growth is ultimately stunted by its lack of actual economic use. If nobody is using it for shopping or remittances in favor of simply holding, those retailers and remittance companies close or pivot away from Bitcoin. This has literally already happened in multiple cases. 
Like it or not, consumer use of a currency stimulates the economy. If you buy and hold a Bitcoin it stays in your wallet and for all intents and purposes may not exist. If you shop with Bitcoin the retailers see that people actually use it, they can potentially pay employees or vendors in the currency and the economic cycle continues.

 I'm not advocating one way or the other but there's an incentive for miners to avoid segwit (and by extension, Lightning)
Lightning threatens to move a majority of transactions off-chain, taking transaction fees from miners and giving them to Lightning node operators while alleviating pressure on the main chain. If miners can force traffic onto the main chain they may hurt the value of Bitcoin by ensuring it doesn't scale but they'll still theoretically maximize the transaction fees they'll eventually be totally reliant on for income
@_date: 2016-12-01 01:34:34


Not at all the same thing. You convert fiat to Bitcoins and then you can spend those Bitcoins in any way you like anywhere you like. Locking up Bitcoins on the LN means you can only spend those coins within that channel and cannot conduct more business in total than the funds locked within that channel without creating another two on-chain transactions. 


This requires closing and reopening the channel, or not reopening it but at least closing out the channel. So yes, there is something stopping you. 


The transaction creating the channel is a Bitcoin transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. The transaction closing the channel is a Bitcoin transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions on that channel are not, they are adjusting balances on an internal ledger that doesn't touch the Bitcoin blockchain whatsoever. They have as much in common with an on-chain Bitcoin transaction as using a Paypal account. I understand that it's still trustless and your money is (mostly) safe in the channel but those transactions are decidedly NOT Bitcoin transactions as none of them are validated on the blockchain until the channel closes.

This isn't true at all, otherwise smartphones and tablets and wearable technology etc etc wouldn't be so popular. The masses have been adapted to constant new technology since the 80s and 90s, the problem with Bitcoin adoption is that the benefits for the average user are questionable and it's not easy to use. If you already have a credit card or debit card you can use to shop anywhere then Bitcoin isn't something you'll ever need, and merchants might pay less fees but they see so fewer sales that they'd rather just pay what Visa asks and enjoys thousands of sales

That's not how it works. Tap to Pay works for all purchases under $100 and randomly will ask to confirm a PIN, unless you try to use it outside your local area in which case it will ask for a PIN on any purchase and then temporarily allow spending wherever you are. You don't have to confirm your PIN every $100. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 22:02:11
Right, there's a $100 limit *per transaction*. Anything over $100 requires a PIN but you can do several transactions totalling more than $100 without entering your PIN providing none of them are over $100 each
I've gone weeks paying for gas and groceries without entering a PIN, the transactions probably totalled over a thousand dollars by then. The only reason I get prompted to enter a PIN anymore are for large purchases and when I shop out of town

With block size at a constant, an ever-increasing number of transactions trying to fit will either raise fees or simply price out cheaper transactions vying for space in the same block. Assuming the price of a Bitcoin doesn't rise to compensate the loss, transaction fees could be expected to rise as the block reward halves and miners lose their subsidy. Within 20 years 99% of the block reward will have been mined and this effect should be entirely visible. Eventually once the block reward is totally exhausted miners will be totally dependent on transaction fees as revenue. 
Developments like the Lightning Network are expected to reduce load on the main Bitcoin blockchain and significantly lower transaction fees but are still in production and come with their own sets of complications, including the need for users to lock up funds for use on the LN
@_date: 2016-09-19 01:24:50


And if (last year) you paid 5 cents per transaction it would have confirmed properly. These average transaction fees are rising at a rate that makes Bitcoin transactions uneconomical for the poor and unbanked people Bitcoin was intended to service and quickly approaching the rates of modern, higher-capacity services. 
Even worse, if you're willing to pay a 20-cent fee you'll price out the smaller transactions hoping to use the Bitcoin network. With such a limited blocksize it's a matter of only the wealthy having their transactions confirmed with priority, which obviously isn't a very good system. 
Last year it was "just pay five cents. Is five cents really too much?" and now it's sixteen cents. Maybe next year it's 25 or 50 cents to confirm within the next tiny block. Do you not see the problem developing there? 
@_date: 2016-09-22 22:26:49
To play devil's advocate, we see anecdotal evidence that deflation is bad with the dismal sales figures for Bitcoin retailers.

I know there's an emphasis on bashing legacy banking in this subreddit but you're referencing an ad for Interac debit cards, which is actually a pretty fantastic system for Canadians. 
First, NFC use is now pretty widespread. At grocery stores, gas stations etc you can tap-to-pay and be at the counter/checkout for literally five seconds before your payment is confirmed and you're out the door. 
Second, for merchants, accepting Interac debit purchases costs a fraction of one percent. It's less than a penny per dollar and allows you to accept payments from millions upon millions of canadians. 
Lastly, Interac E-transfers cost $1.50 (less in some places) and allow you to email thousands of dollars instantly. I checked quickly just now and my fees are $0.50 to send less than $100 or $1.00 to send anything over $100, with limits of $3,000 a day or $20,000 a month. 


My point is that banks have not been completely stagnant with regards to technological advancements here in Canada (much better than in America, from what I hear) and the advancements they have offered are working very well for both Canadian consumers and merchants.

I didn't say you always had more than a dollar in the bank but if you have a job you probably qualify for the overdraft protection that would avoid this kind of issue, or you can cash your pay cheques without an account. You aren't required to have a bank account to get a job and I've never heard of an applicant being denied because they didn't have direct deposit information, you just simply cut a manual cheque. 
These fees, while awful, are not a mystery, they are provided to people who sign up for bank accounts and it's up to them to budget accordingly if they want to voluntarily use the services a bank provides. The situation is entirely avoidable - you either budget accordingly or sign up for overdraft protection or simply don't use a bank. Saying that the situation is avoidable is not insulting to anybody and it's laughably condescending to claim it is on their behalf. You should know how much you have in the bank, what the fees involved are and whether that bank is right for you. Claiming you can't get a job without a bank account is laughably stupid.

That's a complicated questions. Blocks will still occur every ten minutes, it's just the reward will be significantly diminished. Assuming you're paying a competitive fee then your transaction should still confirm quickly, but if Bitcoin gains more users and the blocksize doesn't grow (and solutions like Lighting don't pan out) then you'll be in a competition for block space with a large number of users. If the value of each Bitcoin doesn't rise then miners could presumably charge much higher fees than today in order to offset the loss of the block reward subsidy
