Isn't this rather confusing? My understanding of Bitcoin is that the confirmation means that your tx is included in a mined block, and preferably a block that has little chance of being orphaned. Which in truth means waiting for a couple of blocks to be mined after the one that included your transaction. 
Feel free to correct any error there.

Indeed there are. 
Rate hikes enforced the by the decisions of small groups is definitely questionable in the context of a purportedly trustless network, don't you think?

I think he's not doing that. Short term changes are influenced largely by journalism. Long term influences are guided by technology. I think Jihan gets that and understands that the current implementation of the technology doesn't support long-term economic viability.

"dominance" - interesting choice of wording. And who is "us"? I don't expect your answer to be "bitcoin users" as my observation is that bitcoin participants, as a whole, are a deeply fractured community right now. For those reasons, the implicit assumptions of your comment confuses me and probably needs elucidation to understand your assertion.

Declaring my opinion, I'm currently favoring BU for scalability and FlexTrans as a solution to malleability (lower priority). 
No idea what will actually fall out of it all, but I do think that there's a visible need to release the chain from the current transaction limit (given that something over 50% of outputs are unspendable right now - some of them mine), and the best solution option seems to be upping the block size as a hard fork. 
I have always seen the value in SegWit (and in fact, all of Pieter's work), but right now I think classic's Flexible Transactions proposal is an interesting and very clean alternative. Either way, I don't see that the transaction malleability issue is one that should be solved as a soft fork. 
Probably just too technical a view, and I'm no economist, but that's the one I hold as a developer who is interested in extending the reach of this wonderful technology and the vision that Satoshi presented.

Wow what a straw man argument.


You didn't respond to my question. What's more interesting is that you seem not to think that hashrate is any kind of vote; I'd be interested to learn why?
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:29:18


Think really, really, really carefully about that statement. Then wonder if you really did understand what Bitcoin is about.
EDIT: Maybe my answer was obtuse given your current position. The point here is *not to have to trust* financial incumbents. Bitcoin was invented to avoid exactly that line of trust.

Can bitcoin ever be a peer to peer electronic cash system?


I had some discussion with luke a while back about the definition of "spam" on the network. I found myself agreeing with the sentiment "there is no unimportant transaction". Where we stumbled, and the conversation ceased, was about transactions that were targeted at a reduction of utxo by collecting them into one address. I think we really need a firm definition of "spam" and discussion of such.
/z 
@_date: 2016-12-06 03:46:52


Yea, well, I disagree with your plan. As a "low value" person I'd really would like a peer to peer electronic cash system if possible. *If that is not possible*, my bank seems the best bet for money matters. That way I don't have to stuff private keys under my digital mattress. 
Wondering what reality you are thinking of?
@_date: 2016-12-06 03:22:49


Your argument here doesn't appear to have historical support.
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:10:05


Curious as to why? It's the same "win" whether it's nominally BTC or some other cryptocurrency? For sure, if BTC did retain/regain its momentum in such a direction that end could be closer by years.
I can imagine that the debate over widely deployed LN will be even more fierce than the debate currently raging over block sizes and SW malleability fixes.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:29:25


Does that "trustlessness" extend to the point of final settlement? I don't quite see that.
EDIT: I see it in the simple cases, just not convinced about more complex networks.
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:12:25
I'd suggest that your factual support isn't factual. It's a bunch of people imagining that they can do business as usual on a public ledger, which of course is not at all possible. Such use cases that you describe require a kind of operational privacy that bitcoin does not offer.  Hence the blockchain these experts are talking/imagining about is not bitcoin, but some "permissioned" version of it.
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:10:59
Yes, I know that is your belief/prediction. Thing is, that fear doesn't appear to be supported by the evidence of the years prior to hitting the current "limit" earlier in the year. Transaction volume was growing for years at an almost predictable rate, not suddenly jumping around. You do *see that* don't you?
@_date: 2016-12-15 00:39:10
Things indeed do change. To believe what you do, you must have evidence that I do not. What for me would count as evidence beyond that which is historically available would be increasing investment in support of such use cases on the Bitcoin network - but I'm not really seeing that?

Q: How will Lightning route transactions?
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:48:40
I personally think your proposition here is worthy. I suspect that in the end, as Satoshi indicated, some overlay network would be necessary. Criticism of LN is not of LN but rather that it is not here yet in a meaningful way. 
We are, however, so far away from a general popular uptake that it's possible to kill the golden goose simply by choking current (and evident) demand for cheap, quickly settled, transactions. This has been possible up to now, and there can be little doubt that over the last quarter or so the current core implementation is *artificially* limiting capacity.
Right now, I'd say that a good rule of thumb is that "there is no unimportant transaction".
But that's just my 2c.
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:49:22
I don't.

@_date: 2017-05-16 19:16:28
Thank you. Actually, it's not the existence of the parameter I was referring to as being artificial, but rather the value of the parameter being incorrect according to the original design for the scalability of the system. In that sense the value provides an artificial limitation on the performance potential of the software. Say the parameter was changed to be 8 times its current value, then the likely throughput would be ~25-26 TPS. So, I'd argue that the real capacity limit of a Bitcoin network is far, far greater than the current version of the software allows for. I'd go so far to call that a bug.
@_date: 2016-05-18 13:35:06

Since you raise the issue, which seems is an inevitability...
What are the technical benefits of a segwit SF instead of segwit HF?
Genuinely I can see (given the answers above how Pieter's idea has legs), but SF leaves me kind of cold and feeling it leads to future maintainability issues. 
I would genuinely like to understand that SF reasoning.
@_date: 2016-05-21 23:46:15
That's your response to the question? I guess you considered that your one-word response is spam itself by any measure.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:51:48
I think people are just trying to use it, and finding the fees and transaction delays are proving uncompetitive, even when compared to fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:46:04
But not now. The coinbase reward incentive is there for that reason. i.e. to allow for adoption prior to the introduction of reasonable fees. I'd suggest that the adoption is far too low to start competing realistically with existing payment systems on fees. If fees rise too far, people will simply not use the coin.

It seems that you're unaware of the issues that a backlog causes wrt to settlement. Or that real users are subject to KYC on exchanges in order to on-ramp. For those reasons, your comment seems a little naive to me. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:24:44

No please, just go for July 4 UASF. After all that's "Independence Day" isn't it?
@_date: 2016-05-22 00:11:33
Indeed. *If* the subsequent discussion in that thread holds true, then BTC isn't sustainable --- no matter WHAT you do. 
We could encourage a better solution faster by allowing BTC to be what it's going to be and find out if it wants to fail. Or have it prove itself as the right solution.
We'd actually LEARN something that way...
@_date: 2016-05-18 00:35:24
Not really apples and oranges, unless you think that tx malleability extends into the rules enforced on the scripting language as currently allowed. I'd need that detail to understand your response. I have a suspicion I may have a response to any later response on that latter subject... :-)
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:40:33
OK I misunderstood your first response. Thought you were saying the question was spam, not that the answer to the question is spam on the blockchain! If I understand right, that was indeed the initial reason for the "temporary" introduction of the limit by SN...
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:22:47
Couple of questions: 
How is SegWit superior to Flexible Transactions? Both fix malleability, but seems to me that FT opens up the code to greater innovation, whereas SegWit locks it down some, and further causes some ambiguity over the state of past transactions. 
Is the SWSF version really so amazing? I have issues with the technical design of the SF version of SW with regard to enticements and use of various fields which are not used according to their original intent and purpose. In my experience, such modifications always cause centralization of maintainability where the "nuances" of a codebase have so many concerns that only the most expert (and usually the original authors) can make a change without it having impact.
Another thought: Realistically SW offers a 1.7 MB lift since most transactions aren't multisig. Do we really want to have to revisit the block size debate again in 12-18 months? Some commentators even say that as soon as the space is available it will immediately fill to capacity (a proposition I personally refute on the basis of the historical numeric evidence). What's your opinion on that vector?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:26:27

"removal would be disastrous"
...perhaps, but I suspect it would be temporary "disaster".
It would surely prove out what bitcoin really is destined for - far more clearly than blind trust in the projections stated by current stakeholders who necessarily have an agenda for their futures (which seems to lead to all sorts of conflict).
Seems clear to me. Do you feel that analysis is faulted?
@_date: 2016-05-21 23:51:27
Thanks for the thoughtful response (+1). One does wonder if anyone truly knows what bitcoin wants to be (commodity or currency). It's surely one of those two. Are we shaking in our boots too much?

10PH of &gt; 2.5EH? You seem to be saying &lt; 5% of votes in a pool with &lt; 5% hashrate is some kind of achievement? My take is that, despite all the hat promotions (yeah that was a bit of a dig), this is rather a bad stat and indicates extremely low general support.
Not a good assessment? Please feel free to correct my math.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:25:24
