Those other coins fail on The most important detail of a "decentralized currency" : a decentralized development. That's what makes bitcoin the most important crypto today. It has no owner.

Most people is expecting at least to go up 14.9, some says it could go down. I think it will go higher than 14.9 if Macri releases it, and im not the only one. But it depends on how does he do it, if he actually does it. 
CNH is not an option here, most people doesn't even know where, how or why to buy CNH, the confidence in USD is kind of mystical here. 
There is also a lot of people holding usd that could sell them in the moment the ratio go up bit high. 
I really dont know if the credit card special foreign shopping tax is going to be removed, dont recall Macri talking about that. If the oficial usd get released but that tax doesn't get abolished it would be a really bad situation for foreign credit card shopping.

There are not much "official" transactions we Argentines can actually do with usd. Credit card buying in usd currency is the most common, which uses "official" rate plus 35%  special tax, thats almost the same amount as "blue" (unofficial) usd rate.  
For most Argentines usd is 14.9 a long time ago already. 9.5 is just a state lie to foreign people. 
And no, there are no reserves built, so probably when the exchange rate get released the peso-usd rate will moon.

Lets say you can use "your" national floating currency which is good for paying things only in your country OR a global decentralized one that is accepted to pay on almost every place on earth for almost anything (except national taxes...). Which one would you use? Which one would be used broadly as "reference" ?

"The proposal dispenses with one of the defining characteristics of bitcoin (decentralization)" ... So ... Its like fiat? On an excel sheet?

How much time until internet controls all of information? When did you wrote this in 1998?

"Its always been about whose fiat" ... The definitive solution to that is "nobody's fiat" (which isnt fiat anymore... But decentralized money.)

These are the type of comments that 25 years later we laugh about and feel difficult to believe. Like : "do you really think that you can sell more than a few "computers" to main universities  ?? Who's gonna pay that thing and why??"

Guess the end of the story.
