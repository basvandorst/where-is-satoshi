Buying products in foreign markets without paying a conversion fee. Securing money in markets with volatile fiat. "Anonymous" transactions. Also harder to get mugged for your btc than cash or even credit.
Edit: in Japan and South Korea there are emerging markets, its being hailed as a "lifesaving currency" in Venezuela.

Not sure USD could possibly be more flawed, prints pennies, dependant on the oil market of all things, banking system is fully corrupted with no sign of regulations on the horizon.

@_date: 2018-06-10 23:11:03
Its the entire economy. They own the whole thing? Why did my ancestors die on a foreign beach for them, why does my family work? Does 1% do 82% of the work.

If you honestly think that. I pity you. If only you could try hard enough to win the birth lottery and have sociopathic tendencies.

I mean I gave stats he gave anicdotes. He didn't qualify any of his anicdotes.
I guess your ok with them leaving 18 cents out of every dollar for 99% of us to split?
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:59:00
Obviously not. Pity isn't a response I can really control. I could have just not said anything in reply I suppose. But I feel like his comment is so dishonest it demanded a reply. The idea that the rich are purely benevolent is beyond childish.

You were working for them and you got paid, what do you want me to do pat them on the back for not enslaving you?
I'm talking about the family homes that were ripped from desperate peoples fingers. Perhaps they shouldn't have been sold to them, but it was obviously a systemic effort.
You were working for / with lackeys, The sociopaths were the people who engineered the crash with the plans of gentrifying entire cities.

I blame the people who have their every political whim serviced by the legally bribed representatives while making 82 cents out of every dollar yes. I don't need to know their names no. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:25:03
Or carving mountains.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:39:34
Probably due to that pesky 1% inhailing 82% of all wealth generated while we're throwing around random figures.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:22:43
I didn't bring that up, you're confusing my point with his deflections.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:12:38
Wow what a reasonable request. Ill get that to you along with the location of the amber room and world peace.
