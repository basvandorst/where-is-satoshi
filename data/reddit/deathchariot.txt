Imagine Satoshi came back an cleaned the mess up that we produced. Bitcoin would probably X5 lol (even though I'm sure Satoshi does not give a shit about Bitcoins price).

You do have to pay miners fees if you open a channel and your funds are only secure if you close it? I mean if you're in for a quick trade then sure this might be beneficial but if you can't leave the channels open I don't see the point.

I'm neither invested in Bitcoin nor Bcash but I don't understand why you're trying to spread FUD about Bcash when it's objectively working better atm.

Another reason why I like Japan. European countries could learn from Japan especially in technology.

The only guy I would trust with a Seminar like this is Chris Dunn. He specifically said you should only visit it if you can easily afford it and want to trade professionally. 
Most of those courses are bullshit and don't teach you much more than what is available for free.

With the recent crash I know that market cap doesn't mean shit because literally a few dollars can make the market cap go up 200 MM
