The question is can I start mining bitcoins with this? 
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:38:37
I'm using electrum wallet. Also you are right, it's never a good idea to hold with exchange. Also I was wondering what if the wallet itself take our coins? I mean wallet itself created the private key so it can do whatever it wants right?
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:01:51
That's my plan too!

The funny thing is, no one is playing these games with graphic card anymore! Everyone got ASIC Consoles to play, with improved performance like 13.5 TH/s, Full UltraHD 16K 120 FPS.

How many coins you lost? That's why remembering the first and last two digits of public key is necessary.

Then bring back that virus to offline computer, then it grabs private key, then you offline transact, then you connect USB to online computer = profit???
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:10:31
What's the point your transaction needs internet anyway?

The regulation of Fiat currency is what I am talking about, I want the freedom of bitoin.

OK for example after August bitcoin price is like 1 lakh or 10000, would you still buy weekly or buy it for 1 lakh rs assuming you have that money?
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:54:52
Have you tried it? What happens if 0 fee is applied, will the transaction fail?
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:35:31
????? Profit

How much it can go below? Zero?
@_date: 2017-07-08 07:00:14
I want small amount. Also what's the point of decentralization and government taking control of this currency?
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:40:30
Should I buy now or wait till split has happened? Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:29:47
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:38:17
I can buy more bitcoins!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:33:33
Gonna try it!
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:21:19
What's the advantage of this move?

Currently I have no option than buying Bitcoins by giving my identity out. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:06:38
I know it has value the dip is temporary. That's the right time to buy more coins, since it's value increases soon.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:59:59
I think the best time to buy is after the split and the transactions start.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:48:28
May I know where exactly this source code stays? I mean which computer? How this game got value and why I am getting paid for playing this game? Even after getting money how can it be valued in real world which I played in virtual? Thanks!

I'm watching the price drop and I was about to buy bitcoins then I came to know about the split. So I'll buy after the split became normal, the bitcoin price may drop even to zero it seems! If that happens it's like a new start! Then bitcoin is expected to reach $55000 within of this year! What do you think?
Also the selling price is too low, the exchange is keeping 6000 rupees margin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:23:51
You are not mining? How about altcoins? What's your strategy?
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:00:32
It can't go any lower after the split.
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:13:56
Will it decrease or increase the bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:03:06
August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:38:09
I already asked "without mining I want to buy Bitcoins."
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:32:46
So buy 1 and get another one free bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:05:25
So if I buy coins before the split I'll get one coin extra for every coin? Like having 1 btc will get another btc free?
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:43:46
Zebpay or unocoin which is better? Also the bitcoin split is happening are you prepared?
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:39:02
I didn't understand why you buying in small quantities during the dip? I mean you can buy more bitcoins and hold to get the price for profit right? 200 bitcoins??? That's great. I wonder why I came late to the party. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:17:12
OK where you buying Bitcoins?
