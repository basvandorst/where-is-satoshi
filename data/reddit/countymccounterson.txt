It's more like you have strapped an engine to a horse and it burns thousands of tons of coal a day but doesn't actually do anything with the coal because it's just a horse still. And of course the engine broke the horse's back killing it so the horse doesn't even work as a horse anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:41

Then you are stupider than I thought, why are you shilling this if you aren't even making money from the pyramid.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:27:35
So what you're saying is, it's a massive pyramid scheme and can therefore never be used as an actual monetary system because a handful of people already own most of the money in existence.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:48:59
Oh you silly silly bernie supporters, you just never learn that when random people on reddit tell you to give them money they can't be trusted. "Bitcoin is guaranteed to win the election" "Match me, it's going to the moon"
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:26:53
And that's great for you at the top of the pyramid but for the idiots you roped in they have just lost 10% or more of their money in a few hours so they are going to run and bring the whole thing tumbling down.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:03:23
This is like the film about the housing crash, they know they have to sell quickly because it's all coming down but at the same time they have to pretend that everything is okay otherwise everyone else will sell and they will go bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:35:04
The price curve is identical to the standard textbook bubble curve down to the individual bumps
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:37:43
The whole point of the system is that supply can't be increased so the network just burns thousands of tons of coal for no reason while not actually handling more transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:51:29
And then when they go bankrupt they can all blame you
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:28:10
The bubble is maintained entirely by making it easy to buy but disabling the ability to sell. When a crash starts the exchanges shut down to prevent it getting worse and if you try to sell more than a small amount at any given time then they just run away with your money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:57:22
You're getting pretty cocky for a bubble that has only lasted a few days and is already looking like it is going to crash

And most of those years were just people casually using it to buy child pornography and drugs, it's only now that the normies have come in and ruined it that the inherently retarded design has been revealed. Now the bubble will kill it dead because of how shit it has turned out to be and it's all the fault of you fucking normies.

You soy boys crack me up
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:30:52
Nobody uses it is a currency and there isn't 261B in the system to pay out so obviously it's just a huge bubble that will pop if anyone tries to sell. Hence the whole "hold until you die" meme that the top of the pyramid spreads to keep it stable until they can cut and run.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:31
What do you think the price rise was?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:15:35
Haha I remember when the berners were like this, good times. Soon the meltdown will come.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:48:02
Haha yeah to be fair it takes a very high IQ to understand pyramid schemes, people just don't get the complex nuances behind the whitepapers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:20:41
And again, that's great for you at the top of the pyramid because you've already made 3000% and run away but for the idiots you roped in they are fucked now, the price is flatlining
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:12
The top of the pyramid has memed you all into believing that continuing to hold the bubble together rather than cashing out millions and never working again is a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:20:42


@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:43
I can't wait for this to crash and burn so that you normies all go broke and fuck off and we can go back to using it as a niche currency that nobody knows about.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:51:51
Hahahahahahahaha they have definitely fucked off with it
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:41:56
People who join later in the scheme hand over money to the people at the top of the pyramid so in order for the scheme to continue you have to keep the pyramid growing by recruiting people to be the bottom of the pyramid.
e.g. Someone makes a magical currency and gives themself a good chunk of it and then sells another big chunk to a couple of people and then they sell smaller chunks to more people. Then you get to the current year where people buy tiny fractions for thousands of dollars off people who hold millions of complete coins.
The only way for these people with tiny fractions to make money is to split up their fractions into even tinier fractions and sell them to new people and if they can't then the entire thing collapses and the people at the top run away with all the money they have made.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:21:19

As demand goes up and capacity the remains the same, fees obviously go up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:49
Haha this is called the bull trap where idiots who held out for ages suddenly decide to buy in out of fear of missing out and then wham they get wiped out and it's really hilarious for everyone who watched them do it.

So don't eat fats, carbs, sugar, protein... Just don't eat any food at all and the cancer cells will die when your blood sugar runs out and you die.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:10:26
So what happens when it has crashed to $100 or whatever and the fanatics have all of their cash stuck in it waiting for the "inevitable" rise and therefore can't buy anymore? What happens when nobody is joining the pyramid and keeping demand and therefore the price up?
The fact that you honestly believe that this isn't a bubble means you are going to get bubbled so hard in the trap dip which makes you pump all of your remaining assets into it before the final collapse which wipes them all out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:15:32
How is it going to get cheaper with increased usage? The block size will always be limited so it's always going to be shit and once the miners can't even get new coins they will start rejecting any transaction that isn't giving them a healthy profit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:56:55
I can't wait for you normies to go bankrupt so that we can go back to the good old days of buying illegal memes. You normies ruined this like you ruin everything.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:09
So it's a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:07:24
Because it takes 60 hours to verify a transaction and the fees mean that unless you are buying something like a car, using paypal is cheaper.
Compare that to visa which is cheap and instantly goes through and doesn't cost me anything to use and well you just don't have a use case except for selling child pornography.

@_date: 2017-12-16 13:22:19
You're going down in the history books lads. My future kids will be laughing at you when they learn about tethers and how the price only started rising once an exchange bought bitcoins off itself using billions in imaginary printed dollars and then sold the bitcoins for actual money which they quickly moved away to their offshore accounts.
When it all falls apart and you start killing yourselves, just remember to hang the people who made all the money first. Don't let them get away with what they did.

Reasons why bernie can still win
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:06:40
Haha I get that you have to say that to justify ~~bernie~~ bitcoin can still win but jesus christ if you actually believe that any serious thought went into designing this system then you are going to be disappointed when it all collapses.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:54:44
Because they are naive and have already forgotten about how reddit told them to buy bernie and that it was a guaranteed investment because he was sure to win.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:42:55
And yet that "market cap" if plotted on a graph matches the exact shape of the graph of tether quantity. Every price increase matches a huge surge of tethers being printed and used to buy up the market.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:04:19
It's a reverse funnel scheme actually
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:32:35
1. I could spend billions sending up an ICBM with a suitcase strapped to it and get the suitcase filled with money to the other side of the world within an hour but that wouldn't really represent the average cash transaction would it. 10 mins means you are spending an absolute fortune.
2. Visa doesn't cost me anything

The people at the top got most of the coins and they got them for free or $1 each or whatever, the next level down got a small amount shared among more people and paid more money to the level above them. And so on, until you get to the bottom where it's a million idiots each holding a teeny piece that they paid 20k for to the level above them.

@_date: 2017-08-15 18:51:25
A smaller amount of the pie is available to each tier that joins after the people at the top aka a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:47:02
That's what the pyramid schemers always say.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:37:16
It's literally a pyramid where everyone who joins later gets a smaller amount
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:12:54


lol that's the point I'm making, the amount coming into the system shrinks forcing new adopters to buy off the top of the pyramid as their only way of joining.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:02
It's still crashing

There is no asset, you've bought literally nothing and that nothing has no value to you if nobody is willing to exchange it for something of actual value
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:44:05
No, you simply need to ban the exchanges and get all of the banks to agree to block and report transactions.

No because if I leave £5 in paypal and come back tomorrow it will still be worth £5, it isn't an investment it is just a payment processor for actual currencies.


Fees are already what like $5 per transaction that's approaching the fees of fixed cost stock brokers and it's obviously going to keep rising due to the transaction limit

@_date: 2017-11-24 23:02:49
Yeah that's great and all until everyone wakes up and realises that everyone holding something with no value purely to sell it later is stupid. If everyone in the market is holding forever then who is going to buy off you when you finish holding?
At this point everyone runs on the exchanges and tries to cash out everything causing a total collapse.

This is known as the delusion phase of the bubble where the normies have rushed in to make money and all the dumdums are believing that it's going to keep going forever because the sudden rush made the price shoot up.

Gold has value. Even if nobody in the world wants your gold then you still have gold that is shiny and nice and you can use it to make nice things.
USD has value because everyone uses it to buy bread and all kinds of other things. Nobody uses bitcoin. You all just hold it in the bank and tell other people that you aren't going to use it until it's worth enough money.
Hence the inevitable run when people want to cash out but nobody has any reason to buy because nobody uses it meaning nobody can sell causing the price to flatline.

The anonymous creator controls a good chunk because that's the entire reason they made the pyramid and that's why they had to stay anonymous so they don't get shot when it collapses.
Then there's the people who got in early to pump the pyramid, they have most of it because they had all the hardware at the right time.
The plebs like you have little bags of coins and your job is to recruit for the pyramid so that the people on top have people to sell to, that's why you are allowed to cash out small amounts every so often to encourage others.
The normies who you persuaded to join have pockets filled with dirt that they paid $7000 for and the hope that one day the dirt will sell for a fortune.

Blockchains are a meme. You go "oh but MUH BANKERS MUH BANKERS" but your solution is to give a handful of people all of the money in the system. That's worse than inequality has ever been in human history.

So it's not a currency, it's an asset with no security?

Most people buy gold jewellery

I could have, I also could have lost everything. I could have put a mortgage into pets.com but I would have lost everything.
People are born and given billions and all the yachts they can burn and I wasn't, but that doesn't bother me. Some slimy scammer has created a pyramid worth billions and they're getting ready to run away with them but that doesn't bother me.
There will always be people who get lucky and there will always be people who shoot themselves because their luck failed. I'm happy being neither. 
You say that I could have made a nice bit of money but that wasn't guaranteed, it's easy to say that shorting pets.com would have been a great move after it collapses or that buying into apple at the start would have made you a billionaire. You couldn't know that at the time so it's meaningless. I never regret a decision because I made the correct decision with the knowledge available at that time.

What ever keeps you pumping your salary into the top of the pyramid
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:23:44
Hence why those in the know call it a bubble. Obviously reddit thinks it is great but they also said hillary was 99.9999% guaranteed to win and that bernie could still win (no refunds) so just don't trust them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:14:43
lol a handful of people own 99% of the wealth in your system, that is worse than any economy in human history. And there is no way to get more money so they can just control everything forever.
Hence why it is a pyramid.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:41:01
That's why this pyramid scheme is so good, it taps into the starbucks millenials who don't really do anything in society but want free shit. You just hand over your student loans and honestly there is a 1000% chance that you will double your money each week! It gives them hope that without hard work they can still buy expensive things.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:31:49
This is the stage of the bubble where people who know nothing about it have heard about exponential gains and jump in even though they don't have a clue what it is.
It's still going to keep going while these normies rush in but eventually people are going to want to cash out and the problem with these kinds of bubbles is that once people stop coming in you can't cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:15:16
Welcome to the media stage of the bubble where normies with no knowledge are brought in to boost the price.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:55:21


@_date: 2017-11-04 15:22:28
I don't have to pay a 10% fee or whatever the miners will charge at that point to transfer gold. I also can actually use gold and people can't just run away with my gold if they gain access to my computer network.
Gold has actual uses and is an actual physical item, I can't just create more gold out of thin air if I control 51% of the gold market.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:13:41
Yeah try cashing out a billion, see how that works for you.
Oh wait you can't because exchanges only let you sell a tiny amount at a time in order to prevent a bank run.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:55:23
Just think about it, if you normies who don't know shit about shit and work in starbucks know about this then that means it is a bubble. You never hear people going "oh my god guys the corn futures are unreal pump your entire salary into corn it's the future" do you?
When random normies are buying in for guaranteed profits you know the crash is coming.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:29:30
This is going to be the funniest thing since hillary lost, the meltdown will be unreal.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:36:37


@_date: 2017-11-27 14:36:14
lol I love that you can say this and then at the same time unironically say that it isn't a bubble
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:58:12
When people want to realise their gains of supposedly 50 million dollars each or whatever but nobody is willing to hand over actual money for them making the coins useless causing them to flatline.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:18:06
Nope, the exchanges only let you sell one a day so it's impossible to cash out large amounts. This is what keeps the bubble going.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:52:47
lol do you need new people coming in to keep the pyramid from collapsing?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:59:32


I'm talking like you made someone with more control than them because they didn't own the majority of the currency at any point
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:54:33
So what is the point of the database at all if everything else is going to be centralised?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:01:23
Who owns the majority of the currency? Is it 5 guys at the top?
Soy vey it's almost like you just created an even worse system than we currently have. Instead of musk being rich, you have some slimy scammer owning half of the currency.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:21:13
This is known as the delusion stage of the bubble

I could purchase things with leaves but that doesn't make leaves a currency
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:17:38
I'm not salty, I had money and I considered buying into the pyramid but actively chose not to because it is going to crash at some point and I don't believe I could cash out in time to avoid losing money.
Bubbles are great if you look at the people buying all the women they can rape with their profits, just don't look at the people who shoot themselves or jump off buildings when their entire wealth disappears in an hour.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:58:58
Haha yeah nice one goyim show those nasty democratic systems what for
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:41:51
But the transaction fees are like $10 per transaction or more and they take an hour to go through
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:25:36
Oh my this is going to be so fun to watch
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:33:11
Bitcoin isn't going to replace payment structures, it already costs far more than any other system. You have to be buying things in the range of hundreds of dollars for it to equal the cost of paypal so you can't use it for food shopping or anything.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:57:51
You are buying literally nothing. You are buying shares in a company that doesn't exist and has no income because hopefully someone will buy them off you for more later.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:08:30
If you have to keep telling people it's not a scam maybe you should consider why everyone knows it is a scam
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:38:39
Also gold can be used to make things
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:03:18
No more like pets.com is just a fad
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:21:31


@_date: 2017-11-19 16:08:58
Because they have enough cash to pay suppliers with cash and hold the bitcoins for extra profits. When they run out of cash the pyramid collapses.

@_date: 2017-10-18 15:58:34
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:11:41
And in Bitcoin nobody uses the system except to hold in the hope of selling later so as soon as people stop joining the pyramid all value is instantly lost.

Why would I read an in depth guide to the latest pyramid bubble?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:51:30
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:14:55
The people at the top of the pyramid get the majority, the people below them get some, the people at the very bottom get little bits of dust that they have to buy off people higher up because no more are created.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:18:04
That's why it's a pyramid scheme, it only has value while you hold it and new people are buying into the scheme. 
As soon as the new people stop turning up the entire pyramid collapses because nobody actually spends this currency.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:29:41
Uh oh looks like you've had a little too much to think, better shut this goyim down
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:22:13
Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 each honestly it's guaranteed buy my coins now it's not a bubble it's not a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:16:12
But if you invested (saved) then you would have more than inflation

Banning your little meme currency won't turn the US into a third world country, jesus christ.

Read the dotcom wikipedia page, it is a word for word description of bitcoin.
It mentions how coins could be started up with no future or previous returns and immediately get valuations of billions, how random people would buy in because everyone told them to and it was easy and how it all collapsed.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:25:31
Stocks have returned 40% over the last two years with no risk because even if a crash happens people who hold still end up with a profit after a few years no matter when they invested in the last century.
You want me to buy into a pyramid scheme, if I buy into this pyramid scheme at 5k and it reaches 10k then I double my money but doubling money isn't that good for a roll of the dice where losing is losing every single penny.
Only winners here are the founders of the pyramid with their fortune and anonymity who can just fuck off and leave the pyramid to collapse without facing charges.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:27:34
To be fair you need a very high IQ to understand bitcoin, the white papers are extremely subtle.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:56:21
So it's a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:27:48
Almost like some sort of pyramid shape where the width of a layer is the price and the number of people who bought in at that price.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:55:39
Couldn't someone just control 70% of the network and start writing whatever transactions they like? If they all confirm it then surely the majority wins so it becomes official.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:10:51
We had anarchy for most of history and it was shit
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:32:08
lol you have to keep tricking people into joining or the pyramid collapses
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:27:08
It's almost like that is inevitable no matter what because your entire meme currency is a poorly thought through bubble worse than dotcom.
Like honestly, what did you expect to happen? You can't just make some pyramid scheme into a billion dollar industry while at the same time keeping it out of the hands of the powerful people.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:26:33
The whole point of bitcoin is that it's just buying literally nothing.
Gold can't pop and leave nothing behind because you still have a bar of gold and gold is rare and useful but bitcoin will pop and leave nothing behind.

You can't outbuy the wealthy. You made a pyramid scheme and now they run it.
If you invented a magic chip that had the same capacity as their data centre in a single computer then they would buy the factory the makes the chip and use it to stock their data centre.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:04:16
If there aren't any plebs coming in and buying 0.00000001 pyramids for $5,000 then the people holding their millions of pyramids aren't growing wealthier so they have no reason to hold anymore and dump their entire stockpile on the market while the currency still has value.
Once one major player dumps everyone is going to otherwise they're that guy that got left behind with worthless memecoins so the entire market crashes in a self fulfilling prophecy.
That's just what happens when something that actually has no value is being sold to banks at high markups. It happened with mortgages when people who could never pay back debt were being sold as the highest quality of investments despite being worthless.
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:05:37
I can't believe you guys fell for this pyramid scheme, the entire system is literally a pyramid with the founders and their huge pile of easily generated coins on top and the millions of plebs with $5 each on the bottom. You only get your money back if people keep joining the pyramid otherwise the entire system falls apart.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:26:24
This is why bitcoin is a joke. Some random guy buys a couple of them a few years ago and now suddenly he has control over the currency.
That doesn't happen with real currencies.
