You could only "ditch" traditional DNS if you didn't want/need access to that namespace.
For example, until your fiat bank/google/whoever register a name on NMC, you'll still need old DNS to retrieve their IP.

Er. Maybe I'm getting terminology confused. 
It is practically implemented as a new TLD for resolving human readable addresses against the NMC blockchain. 
My point was, unless the owner of a service registers their name with NMC, you won't be able to retrieve their IP with NMC. For example, your traditional bank likely does not have a NMC address.

@_date: 2017-11-30 17:38:06
I'm afraid I may have given the impression I consider myself a communist in the traditional sense. I'm more post-capitalist. Think having the means of production shrunk to a personal/tribal level where it can be *directly* possessed by the masses. Any sort of intermediary, including a party, is an intermediary still; a vulnerability.


Sure! I think we may be missing each other on some definitions.
I don't think markets or market-like behavior inherently necessitate the entitlement of private property as granted by the state. I'd merely seek to disclaim your authority to exclude me from the means of production.


And now that they are here and they have such power, how do you intend to rectify this? If resolved, how would you keep it from happening again?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:30:19


I want to put this on a t-shirt.


As long as "free market" is defined by a lack of rents/intermediation instead of its conventional use as a thought stopper against criticism of those same rent seekers.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:21
Marxism is a loaded term so I'd rather not discuss anything in that context. And anyways, as I will attempt to point out, capitalist and anti-capitalist discourse tends to converge in interesting ways that superficial understandings often miss.


If rent seekers were sufficiently suppressed by an efficient market so as to make profits/rents marginal, how is that promise *materially* different from the general promise of (achieving) communism? That is, if you're reducing overall costs to marginal you're going to do about as well in providing material abundance and access as any communist society could hope for.
If I'm hearing you right you find rent seeking undesirable but necessary. What is a rent seeker that collects little or no profit? 
Are you really pro-private property or do you merely see it as a necessary evil towards a goal?
What would you say to the counter the assertion that rent seekers will use their rents to actively disrupt free markets that threaten their margins?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:08:16


Even many communists make a distinction for "personal" property such as your dwelling and personal objects. More or less everything you *directly* use. The distinction of private property is drawn when you own without directly using; especially where you derive income from mere ownership. And it's not black and white. For example, the faceless corporate real estate group owning an apartment is meaningfully different than the handyman who owns rental properties he keeps up himself.


The inefficiencies are feedback loops. As the rentier gains, their ability to coerce instead of compete grows. And coercion is far more profitable.


In my opinion, Bitcoin is a tech demo; an experiment. If Bitcoin actually becomes the defacto medium of exchange as it exists now we will be in an awful place. I say this even as someone who has some already.
My sincere hope is that Satoshi sold a speculative bomb as a technological market revolution. If only for the lulz.

Ownership requires *enforcement.* With virtual currencies, that enforcement occurs in the network itself. That is: instructions are provided to, verified by and recorded on the network. 
How is a blockchain going to enforce your ownership of physical things?

He *was* deriding those who would seek greater financial freedom. That was the "libertarian" and arguably even the "criminal" jab.
The article is about a member of the scene being involved with blockchain analysis. Such analysis nullifies one of the greatest benefits of cryptoassets: being permissionless. You can't truly expect that feature if there is recourse against you for your transactions.

None of those *necessitate* a distributed or decentralized system. In fact, some of those suffer from serious tradeoffs in our current reference implementation of crypto (Bitcoin). 
It sure is great when a software exploit is found that empties your entire account balance without *any recourse whatsoever.*


Who are you contending with? A state? Then why do you decry "criminals"? 
Anyone else? See above.


Provided the network is operating sufficiently below (hardcoded) capacity and your wallet software guessed the correct fee level for your needs. 
What would you estimate the upper limit for transaction speed to be in a centralized system designed to operate as such? What's the ping time between you and your financial institution's server?
Keep in mind, there is actually a reason instant, irrevocable transactions are not preferred in the current financial system.
I bet your broker has a fantastic API available. In case you mean "smart contracts", see the first point. 


So you're just chasing tulips? Then I would urge you to not "kill your golden goose", so to speak, by deriding people utilizing crypto for what it is *actually useful for.*

Use a hardware wallet to generate a wallet from seed. This should be a NEW wallet if you are currently using a wallet generated  on a general purpose computer. Use this to manage day to day movement of coins.
Stamp the seed by hand (a full set of alphanumerical stamps is only about $20) into a metal plate and bury it/hide it in a (non-combustible) wall or something to that affect. 
You're also going to use a passphrase on top of that. Come up with a passphrase you and your wife will remember. This will be required in addition to the seed to generate the wallet you'll use. See:

I want to see frenzied meetings with "legislators" demanding a bailout. I want Bitcoin to cede at just the right time as to take out this whole heap of garbage while those paying attention step casually onto the next raft.
