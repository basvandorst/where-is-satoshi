I really don't want to bash Blockchain.info but what is happening is extremely bad. To be down for over 24 hours is VERY unprofessional and not acceptable.
I wont use blockchain.info anymore once I am able to remove my funds from the website.

TL;DR: we can safely draw the conclusion that Chinese corrupted officers will push Bitcoin price up 1000 times.

my guess is it will not go below $400 - even if karpeles lost all coins. and from there: to the moon!

here are a couple of things which are different:
* adserver which supports BTC (
* currency converter which suppports BTC (
* Over 1,300 info boxes all related to Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies (
and much more. At the end of the day I hope to contribute to the Bitcoin community with vertical search engine and help to further promote Bitcoin to a broader range of users.
