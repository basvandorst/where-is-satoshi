Here you can deposit 1 coin and have the trading power of 20 coins.
If the market moves 5% you either make 100% or loose 100% of your stake.

Each one lost increases the value of the ones still in circulation. Bitcoins are practically Infinitely divisible. As the supply dwindles people can break off ever small fractions further down the decimal place.

other options that are more risky is leveraged trading on one of the futures exchanges or trading shitcoins.

So the way bitcoin would be implemented In mesh as a incentive to Handel/route traffic for the mesh network. People running clients on their device will earn fractions of a bitcoin as a fee. Probably only reasonable with mid to wide scale adoption.
From a routing/networking perspective probably a nightmare but I know only broad concepts nothing logistical.

I dunno. I just can't fathom this being acceptable if bitcoin is to survive. Core devs need to look into this. I'd say a key logger getting your email wallet backups is more probable
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:24:49
Id say go with the printer then immedately go office space on that thing. Its the only way to really know. 
Bitcoin and that plan im the movie had surprising similarities.

@_date: 2013-04-13 21:49:13
This is a fantastic post. Yesterday this issue sent me into full panic mode.
Pro tip: if you use blockchain.info for your paper wallets you can select custom spend in the side pane. There will be a option for change address where uou can select what address to send the funds back to your paper wallet instead of creating a new one. Dont forget to delete your private keys to keep paper safe. 
Beware of keyloggers
