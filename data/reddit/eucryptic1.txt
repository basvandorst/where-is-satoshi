If you file a legal case, you better hurry up and get in front of a judge.  File an injunction blocking their petition for bankruptcy.  You might be able to get a secured interest in a liquidation proceeding (Ch 7) maybe, but I sincerely doubt you will ever see the bitcoin.

It's spelled "losing" ... Not "loosing".  Misspellings like that cause your valid points to lack credibility.
BTC needs no reality check and until you grasp that 1 bitcoin is worth whatever price the market will bear and that ETF's would only cause more price manipulations instead of having real price discovery and a currency free from gooberment manipulation via monkey-hammering interest rates and money printing.

This is what happens when options trading is allowed.  Bitcoin is now basically being traded like gold and silver - on paper with people and algos allowed to trade it short and long. Machines can buy and sell paper bitcoin futures contracts.  A machine can process trades at high rates, some can trade a stock a million times a second and profit from micro moves.  That's how many daytraders run their portfolios, they let their trading program run all day and sit on a beach.  I really wonder if a BTC ETF would change this or turn it back to those wild fluctuations in years 2012-2017?

Interesting but what level of fee do they charge ? Anything over 9-10% is a gouge, like LocalBTCs, charging super premium level price for BTC, that is not right.

Wouldn't Overstock give you your electronic order acknowledgement number before providing options to send payment?  You would need an order number to confirm your order was accepted.  Is it possible your order number is in your browser history or email if they sent you an email acknowledging you placed an order?
