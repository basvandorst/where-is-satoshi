Rumor has it, I'm on LN mainnet. I will 100% pay for two pizzas if any of you can help facilitate the transaction. PM me! I'll even have them delivered to the facilitator... ;-)

Maybe has some ideas?  
It's the first real post I noticed with some insight into running a Lightning Node on mainnet. I'm considering giving it a whirl myself, but without guidance I'm a bit afraid to lock up any funds... which means even if I get the node up and running it'll be fairly useless to others. :-/

^ This is the correct response, as opposed to my half joking around one (it was late for me, I apologize). There's a fantastic community of thousands of folks on both slack and discord lightning channels, working together, testing constantly, and submitting issues on github.  
Interoperability also seems to be an interesting challenge across the companies. However, it's already very, very encouraging IMO that I was able to use lnd to transact with a c-lightning node with very little hand-holding. My channel is still up, active, and used daily too! It's proof positive that the protocol is not vaporware!  
I also agree on the UI front. I've been in and out of conversations with folks talking about "LN Grandma," and what it will take to make her happy and transactions seamless in the future.

TorGuard generated an invoice for me, and I paid it. I no joke just hit their website, waited for a chat window, asked them about LN... support forwarded me to a guy. I emailed the guy, and we worked together for LN payment. It was surprisingly easy

My understanding is that the lightning network needs a certain amount of liquidity to function as intended, which means that nodes would hold a certain amount of BTC to open channels with other nodes.
See this comment from the previous thread:
Is this true? If so, would let's say running a lightning node with 0.5 BTC be considered sufficient and useful to the network?
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:01:45
LOL thanks! I honestly have no idea! My official order was ~10:45 est on 1/15. If someone can beat me, the trophy is all theirs! That said, if the amount I paid TorGuard ends up currency converting in 5 years to anything even remotely close to the amount of said pizza guy, I think I deserve a punch in the face instead of congrats! ;-)

That's fantastic to hear! I can't wait to try it out.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:06:45
SegWit acts like a blocksize increase, and could reduce 60-70% of existing network traffic if it was widely adopted. Lightning network will likely push that adoption, and help even more by moving smaller transactions off-chain. Schnorr signatures should be coming this year as well, which will also help out. Personally, I'm optimistic. :-)

I completely agree. I also think the first large exchange to go LN is going to blow the doors open. It's almost by default the perfect model for LN, and will automagically act as a huge channel hub with loads of local and remote liquidity moving in and out constantly.

This is honestly one of my biggest hopes / pie-in-the-sky dreams for LN or something like it. I travel abroad... a lot.

Actually we just surpassed 1 BTC and we're nearly at 100 open/active channels!   
  
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:25:35
Bonus points: the more people adopt LN, the more the mempool clears and onchain fees drop!
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:20:44
Agreed. Pretty much just wait it out and consolidate all of them (preferably to a SegWit address) when the mempool is clear. Hopefully once the lightning network makes it to mainnet, we will see loads of transactions move off-chain and on-chain fees rapidly decline.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:04:51

For lnd the default is 1 sat. It appears that c-lightning is setting a default of 549 (an issue has been submitted on this) for its channels. Here's what at 10k sat transaction looks like across 3 lnd channel hops:  
   "total_time_lock": 505209,  
            "total_fees": "2",  
            "total_amt": "10002",

                    "expiry": 505065  
                },

                    "chan_id": "555122530222276608",

                    "fee": "1",  
                    "expiry": 505051  
                },

Edit: That is total fees of 2 sat period, not 2 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:35:38
I'm seriously a nobody compared to the folks that have been supporting and developing this for years. However, based on my own personal experiences, an exchange going all-in on LN will set it off. They're the perfect model to provide liquidity to the network and open channels across the literal globe. I think the first exchange to do so, will likely leap so far above the competition that others will either follow-suite or... fall by the wayside. But that's just like.. my opinion, man... :-)
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:02:32
I'm interested in the security aspect as well. I'd be more than happy to also run a Lightning Node and stake some BTC in it to add liquidity, but I'm not sure what the best OPSEC practices are here.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:40:32
Easy...

            "total_amt": "11092",  
            "hops": [ ...  
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:18:36
Exactly!  
I think it will also become economically viable for an entry point, let's call them LightningBase, to "front" instant channel balance. As an example, I purchase 0.5 BTC, LightningBase opens a channel with me with a 0.5 local balance (my purchased BTC) and a 0.5 remote balance (their BTC). Now two things happen which are useful to their business (and to me):  
1) if I'd like to purchase BTC in the future, they can simply push it to me, instantly and for 0 fees, via the existing channel, with no onchain required  
2) I can now route through them for LN transactions to other vendors/exchanges/users and they can collect a small fee, for every single transaction over the lifetime of the channel
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:05:02
No problem!  
Also, very important distinction and glad you asked! 1 sat period. The fees are flat rate across channel hops and not related to size or weight. Yeah, a 1092 sat/B fee would be horrible! Thankfully this is not the case on LN! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:12:44
I agree, except that I could see both the maximum (and perhaps even average) transaction amount go up on LN over time, as confidence and trust goes up. I'll happily toss in dinner/drinks/coffee/small goods money to start, but I likely won't be trying to buy a new laptop.  
Over time, I expect on chain to act more like a savings account and something you'd only use for very large transactions / payments, like a downpayment on a house / car, or for large exchanges / transaction processors on LN to do weekly / monthly profit taking.  
None of that is necessarily revolutionary though, other than perhaps not having to "cash out to fiat" to pay for the day-to-day. What I'm long term excited about is the possibility of being able to use it globally. No scammy fiat forex booths, $20 ATM fees, foreign transaction fees, or getting completely ripped off because you screw up fractional calculations in your head. 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:57:53
wallet.db is encrypted, but yes it is true that you do have to keep your private keys available to the LN node. Standard OPSEC will probably be sufficient, but I'm no expert. I'm secretly hoping that Trezor or Ledger figure out a way to make funds on their HW wallets available to LN.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:00:26
If the amount of satoshi ends up having the monetary equivalence to said Laszlo pizza... well, it was worth it! No regrats... ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:29:49
Could be a positive thing, if it was something like this?  
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:25:54
I have questions related to this, just as an average tech / cs geek:  
If I wanted to host a mainnet lightning node once it's ready, is it possible?   
If so, would an Atom box be good enough?  
Is it also necessary to run as a full node / are they related?  
Is it also necessary to "seed" the LN / channel(s) I'd host with actual BTC (presumably my own)?  
I would be interested in doing this to support the community. Any small fees I may collect would be a bonus (likely to make up for bandwidth and power consumption). I assume another bonus would be making my own lightning transactions cheaper by using my own channel as the entry-point... if I understand it correctly?  
TIA for any enlightenment here!  :-)
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:51:47
I tried to cover this in my original post, but perhaps I did a poor job of it. You're correct. I initiated one on-chain transaction to open the channel, which was iirc ~$2.40 in fees. From there the fee to pay TorGuard twice, once for a monthly subscription, and once for the router, was free. Since then, I've used the channel idk maybe 10 times at maybe 30 cents in grand total in fees. I have not closed the channel yet, because the channel allows me to pay TorGuard next month to continue my vpn subscription, and also still provides me a route to other vendors/users. This is the real power of LN, IMO, that one simple channel has now provided me a gateway, nearly fee-free, to everyone else on mainnet. It's pretty rad!
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:32:35
Piggy-backing off of your comment because I'm interested in the same thing, just as an individual user:  
If I wanted to host a mainnet lightning node once it's ready, is it possible?

Is it also necessary to run as a full node / are they related?

@_date: 2018-01-11 14:25:12
So as an end-user, to help contribute to the LN, the minimum is essentially to 1) run a lightning node and 2) fund it to some degree of usefulness?  
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:32:16
LOL you joke, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if in a galaxy far far away from here (a moon perhaps?), LN BTC was valued slightly higher than on-chain BTC. The on-ramp could be a real thing...

@_date: 2018-01-20 05:45:37
In theory, BTC HODL folks could run their own lightning nodes with their HODL BTC, provide liquidity to the network, and collect fees for every hop across your node. I'm also very excited for bitcoin!

I found this post on the subject as well:  
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:55:35
I believe this will be the case as well. All it will take is one big player to enter the space, and end users will simply pay them for an open lightning channel, then use them as their first hop across the network to other vendors / exchanges / users / etc.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:07:32
It's great news that an individual user can run a lightning node!  
Any idea of the minimum hardware requirements? Would a miniPC (Atom box) suffice?  
Any idea of the minimum BTC which would be useful for liquidity of the lightning network? If I ran a lightning node and contributed 0.5 BTC for example, is this enough to hold open many useful payment channels / act as a meaningful contribution to the network?  
  
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:03:18
If I combine these two statements:  
"All lightning wallets have node software integrated into them"  
and  
"According to Rusty's calculations we should be able to store 1 million nodes in about 100 MB, so that should work even for mobile phones."  
  
Does this not imply that every single user of the Lightning Network could also operate as a Node, therefore "automatically" supporting/growing the network by virtue of simply using it?  
Imagine a checkbox in Eclair that says "Lightning Node" which costs 100-200mb of additional storage on your cell phone and that's it? Obviously there would be a hit to battery life and data usage, but if almost every cellphone user of a lightning wallet also participated as a node... we may have more lightning nodes than bitcoin nodes, available in even more locations, practically overnight.  
Or is this pie-in-the-sky oversimplification on my part? :-)
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:13:45
Great point. If I think about LN as credit card style daily purchases, 0.5 BTC should be more than adequate. If I think about it in terms of exchanges and/or atomic swapping usage, it's likely far too low.  
Is it correct to say that "seeding" a lightning node with 0.5 BTC effectively means I can assist anyone in transacting across the LN as long as their transaction is less than or equal to that 0.5 BTC? Then any larger transactions would have to find a node with adequate liquidity?  
Thanks for the response, still trying to get the hang of lightning node liquidity requirements / management.

@_date: 2018-01-20 05:03:17
I'm genuinely curious what your lowest setting is broadcasting to the network in terms of sat/B and also weight. My fee was low because SegWit, and fairly great algorithms monitoring the mempool. I honestly have no idea why anyone using a SegWit transaction should possibly be paying over $5 right now, maybe $10 in a super rush.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:32:41
That's great news! Thanks for confirming! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:46:12
I opened a direct channel with TorGuard. My transactions with them have all had a fee of 0 sat. All direct transactions have 0 fees. Because TorGuard also has channels open with other LN users and vendors, my channel offers me the 'bonus' of being able to also route through them and send/receive payments to others as well. Each hop incurs a fee. That fee is set by the channel owner.  
What we discovered yesterday is that lnd out of the box is charging a 1 satoshi fee. c-lightning (I already submitted an issue on this) is defaulting to a 546 satoshi fee. My "expensive" 1k sat 4 hop transaction happened to hop across 2 c-lightning channels.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:01:53
Testnet is growing rapidly in both the number of nodes, users, and open channels:  
  
I can't speak for when it'll 'launch' on mainnet for regular users, although I'd be surprised if it's 6 months out. Given that it's being designed such that you could run a lightning node on your phone if you really wanted to, adoption could really shoot through the roof practically overnight.  
Best source of info if you're interested in learning more:  
If you wanna give testnet a whirl now:

Yeah, right now I'm playing around with lnd:  
lncli getnetworkinfo

    "graph_diameter": 0,  
    "avg_out_degree": 2.0106177606177607,

    "num_nodes": 1036,  
    "num_channels": 2083,  
    "total_network_capacity": "19051033146",

    "min_channel_size": "5000",  
    "max_channel_size": "16777216"  
}  
I'd love to eventually run a "HODL" lightning node and help support the network.  
I agree with you, though, vendor and exchange adoption will make or break LN. My sincere hope is that one big exchange rapidly adopts, and it drives tons of business there, which causes a chain-reaction of other exchanges to adopt or be left behind due to the competitive advantage of using LN. I could easily see exchanges, accidentally, acting as the first "channel factories."

I'm just a scrub. Big ups to roasbeef and stark and the whole lnd crew. I've only been dabbling for a few weeks, but they're the real deal.

You can't see the entire potential of a channel's wallet balance, but you can very easily graph the network, then subsequently look at individual node channel balances:  
lncli getnodeinfo 123456deleted  
{  
    "node": {  
        "last_update": 1515975982,  
        "pub_key": "123456deleted",  
        "alias":  
 "123456deleted\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000",
        "addresses": [  
        ],  
        "color": "  
    },  
    "num_channels": 1,  
    "total_capacity": "300000"  
}

Can confirm, neutrino works great; no full node or blockchain d/l required!
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:42:00
It requires 3 confirmations (this is adjustable between parties, but that's the default), so no. My 120 sat/B txn to open took ~35 mins or so iirc. If I was in a hurry, I guess I could've cranked up the fee, but I wasn't.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:58:39
Have you tried testnet yet? There's thousands of people playing around there right now and testing around the clock!  
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:40:25
If you check out my linked transaction, you'll see that it got confirmed at 120 sat/B. I'm not sure what to tell you other than that it's SegWit, and I monitored the mempool before I submitted my channel open. Some folks also being  on mainnet I know have chucked out 400 sat/B txns just to get online and playing around sooner. I'm too cheap for all that, so I rolled the dice. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:11:49
Give it time and it honestly won't matter. UX folks will eventually make sure that even the most tech challenged have onramps to LN!
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:54:08
Right, which makes cellphones the perfect targets! It'd be good to arm users with "only act as a Node on wifi" and "only act as a Node when charging" options. However, from what I've read transactions are small so maybe it wouldn't even impact data consumption or battery life very much. For sure if I had the option, I'd leave my cell phone running as a lightning node at a minimum the entire work day (plugged in and on wifi).
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:58:37
So when is my "seed" BTC being used by individuals on the LN exactly, and how frequently do those transactions usually settle? I understand why we'd never want to over-commit due to unbalancing risks, but it seems like if someone used my channel even for let's say 0.25 BTC for a large purchase, that purchase would complete in a matter of seconds, freeing that "large chunk" of my seed amount back to my channel... no?  
The real answer is probably "who cares, software algorithms are going to sort it all out behind the scenes," but I'm curious anyhow and I'm sure there's some value to understanding how much BTC a lightning node operator should expect to front to be useful to the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:56:28
Excellent! Thanks so much for the quick and thorough response! Is there a particular OS flavor that you'd personally recommend?  
Also, regarding funding the channel: if I funded it at 10k USD as you mentioned, is that basically a static liquidity value? So, for any transaction less than 10k USD, someone could use my lightning node / channel? However, if the transaction was higher than that, they'd have to find a channel available with that level of liquidity? I'm still a bit fuzzy on the whole channel funding bit... clearly! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:02:46
Can confirm, here's mine:  
  
~$2.50 to open the channel from me to TorGuard, payment to them was instant and 0 fees. I've since used the same channel to send 5-6 additional payments to/from others via multihop, largest 4 hop fee being iirc 1092 satoshi! I also haven't closed my channel yet, and don't intend to!
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:50:19
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:53:54
Here's my onchain txn to open a mainnet channel:  
  
  
It cost ~$2.50 in fees (thanks SegWit), took less than an hour for the 3 confirmations required, and I've since used it to pay a vendor, and multi-hop payments over to probably 5 different users now. Each payment was instant, and I think the most I ever paid in fees was 1092 satoshi over 4 hops. I say I think because the fees are so laughable I already quit paying attention. It's honestly amazing now IMO, and will be astonishing once large vendors/exchanges/nodes/etc and real liquidity enter the space.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:42:25
It is possible, yes! Right now the defaults for both lnd and c-lightning (I heard issue was fixed) are 1 satoshi as the fee rate. This means if you're a lightning node, you get 1 satoshi every time someone hops through you. You can customize it, of course, and yes I agree. For the HODL crowd, they could "HODL" on LN as a node and make more BTC for all the transactions they route.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:18:09
HL3 was confirmed on mainnet, LN really solves all our problems!
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:15:44
Please simply be patient for now. Mainnet is not developer approved. Once it goes live, there will be plenty of opportunity for you to participate as much as you'd like! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:02:00
I funded with satoshi baby!

Here is an example of a 3-hop payment routing through 3 lnd channels:

Edit: An example of sending 10k sat to a another user, across 3 lnd hops (hence the 10003 total amount).

BTC was similarly cheap (even free at times) when it was transacting at low volumes. My fee/transaction cost will continue to get cheaper and cheaper the more and longer I use my channel. It's not a bad idea to track, actually. I'll see if I can put together a simple script/monitor which keeps up with number of transactions on my channel as compared to total fees over time and see how it shakes out by the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:40:08
btcd sync'd to mainnet? all you need is to attach lnd and *poof*, you're a lightning node!
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:48:57
I guess you missed the part where I've used the same channel 10 more times and probably incurred a grand total of 30 cents in fees. That's pretty dang exciting to me!
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:46:08
I hope history has a place for all of us. The old way isn't working for new generations. :)
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:19:24
LN is already here. I'm running a lightning node on mainnet and have successfully funded my wallet and opened channels. In fact, my one channel with TorGuard (who I now I have a subscription with for 1 satoshi) allows me to also currently route to Bitrefill and Yalls. LN will drive SegWit through the roof, just be patient.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:23:30
Paging who may have an interest in adding this to the Lightning Network Megathread.
I also think this is a fantastic graphic and does a great job clearing up common confusion about LN usage. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:24:26
So without funding, I will connect to other lightning nodes, but they will be unable to route users / payments through me?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:35:42
If so, I should've really kept the router unopened and sealed! Doh! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:16:17
Wait really?! I thought funding was required to open channels period! Maybe if you aren't providing liquidity to the network, you can still act as a 'hop' but likely won't receive any fees? How cool would it be if everyone who installed a lightning wallet on their phone *poof* instantly acted as a node/hop for others on the LN as well?  
Personally, I'd like to fund a lightning node with my HODL stack (presuming I feel its secure enough) and provide liquidity to the LN. If I pick up some fee scratch as a result that'd be a cool bonus, although I'd prob set it as low as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:16:39
Once mainnet goes live, become a node with good channel balance and liquidity, and you'll be a route for others on the network and both help LN and collect fees in the process.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:55:07
This is true. I'm insanely impressed with how stable lnd is given all the warnings. That said, for mainstream adoption? Ehh... wait for an explosion of apps supporting it. I don't think you'll be waiting too long.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:53:51
That's true. Someone was asking earlier how to query full accounting data of mainnet. Crickets. Why? Because you can't! This isn't something I particularly care too much about, but it's still a built-in feature.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:02:56
I just tried it for giggles. It's true! Now, it's changed! :-)

Does Gemini support SegWit?
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:46:48
Serious question (although it may be a silly one):
Can I safely move BTC out of Bittrex to a SegWit (Trezor) address?
Can I safely move BTC from a SegWit address to Gemini?
Thanks! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:54:41
I already decided to switch over because of SegWit support, and am waiting on verification. Yesterday's insanity has completely sealed the deal for me. Buh-bye Coinbase / GDAX!
