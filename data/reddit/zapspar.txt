Then tell me how that revenue is generated.

Aren’t we passed that station?

Hear hear

I think that is what I meant to say. Taking it without their consent is theft. 
So you mean, if you are against tax then it is theft? Well sue them.

Fees? For what? Fees for owning a house? Fees for selling products?
How much land, minerals and resources can you sell until you need more income opposed to available resources for selling. Eventually you will run out of one or the other.
Where would the bitcoins come from? Mining? Which then pays the roads and such? How about the electricity bills for mining?
Whether it's bitcoins or dollars or euros or whatever.. it needs to come from somewhere. You probably understand only the sun is free (until now).

That's theft. Stealing. I'm talking about paying for maintenance of roads etc. 
I know majority is being misused and collected for the wrong reasons. (In NL we have an added 12ct/L on gasoline since the 90's to boost economy. And it has never been removed , although they promised it as a temp rule). 
I'm not against tax per se, but I do disagree with the current use of it by our governments.

It's only theft when the government doesn't do with it what they are supposed to be doing: Serve the people, honest and fair. 
Majority of governments put it in their own pockets and have fancy dinners and big expensive homes, that's when tax is theft.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:14:15
And who is paying for that?
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:35:50
How else should we fix the roads?
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:23:44
Buy and HODL. Of course.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:28:04
Sounds legit but feels not.

Hodl is the word

Money has an imaginary value anyways.

Forgiveness is the most powerful of all

Time to buy.

It’s the beginning of a new period

But you only play with money you can afford to loose, right?
