...at the wedding?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:57:33
Me too

Why wouldn't you just buy $10-20 per month?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:12:41
It is, but it's bigger than nothing.

We won't see 20k USD tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:28:38
No, it isn’t safe.

I use Coinbase but I have no idea what I'm doing so probably ignore me

May we’ll be worth letting the press know about this. Sounds like the kind of story some publications would love to run and may pay reasonably well for a bit of your time (not that you’re struggling for money but, you know...)

I hope people are preparing some very British memes as we approach £10,000.
I quite nearly spit tea all over my bloody crumpets when I checked the price this morning.

It's what makes Bitcoin possible, no?

There is no ‘scientific perspective’ when it comes to right and wrong. It is purely a moral construct. Therefore, if it’s ‘morally wrong’ (as you’ve said it probably is in your question) then yes, it is wrong.
There’s nothing wrong with stealing someone’s car from a scientific perspective. Only from a moral perspective.

CEO of JP Morgan (bank). He recently said *people who buy bitcoin are stupid* so nyeko_92 was just making a joke about that.

I know piss all about cryptocurrencies so take this with a pinch of salt but, from what I *think* I understand, both of these statements are false:




In terms of benefits vs fiat, [this article]( lists some pretty compelling advantages of cryptocurrency.
In terms offset being replaced by multiple cryptocurrencies, I imagine there are several examples but Litecoin is one currency that people talk about being designed to co-exist with Bitcoin. In the same way as cheques, debit cards, bank transfers and cash all exist together to serve different use cases and demographics (I'm sure someone will tell me this is a terrible analogy).
Like I say, I'm a complete amateur when it comes to this stuff so I'm ready to be told I'm talking shit.

Probably a stupid question but is this an issue for me if my laptop isn't accessible to anyone physically? And I don't have VNC enabled?

$2k means $2,000
Often, people will use ‘k’ to refer to a unit of 1,000 (usually when talking about money).

Yes, I realise that, perhaps what I should have said was:
It's ~~what~~ one of the things that makes Bitcoin possible, no?
