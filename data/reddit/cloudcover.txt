Still at a smaller fraction of our total GDP, or even per capita, than many, many other developed nations. 
Meanwhile we enrich corporations to the exclusion of our social safety net, forego decent wages, deny access to healthcare, let the infrastructure crumble, or neglect public investment. However you try to twist the numbers, we neglect the poor and the people as a conscious choice made by policy, not because we can't afford it or because we're too big or because the USA is just so different and so hard to solve. It is a choice.

Notice how no matter how many times you walk into the ER, you still can't get chemotherapy or treatment for your chronic kidney disease there? Notice how "somewhere else", like in the UK, every single medical problem you have is treated free at the point of treatment from birth to death?
By the way, I notice how you don't make an attempt to argue any of your previous points, but just keep newly bringing up wrong, bad faith examples to try to disprove what is plainly the case: the USA is a awful place to be poor in, and a place where the poor and the people who are at risk of being poor are growing all the time.
