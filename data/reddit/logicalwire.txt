When, in your scheme, do the people get their deposits back ? Because that's why they deposit for, to be able to get their money back, not to give you the ability to play a dangerous lending game with their money. If at least you gave them some reward in order to participate it could be some sort of ponzi scheme where you pay the withdrawal from new deposits.
At the end the problem is making people to believe they can actually get their money back when in realty there is absolutely no way every one get everything back. And don't bring the deposit insurance, from whatever organisation in the world, argument it is a complete joke.

First let me tell you that the 68k you pay in interest are no where sufficient to cover the default resulting of the loan generated by deposits. Do you believe that ?  Even if at some period of the time people are paying their loan back the problem is that on another period of time everyone or most of them willfail to pay all together.
From what I have seen the so called bad loan are first hidden in some "complex" products which bank try to resell to depositors. It is possible to mix it with some other good investment in order to average out the loss or just try to exchange the bad loan, for something better, with a greater fool. This could work some time but when the basket of toxic loan become to big that it can't be hidden anymore the bank change his structure as you described. It can be merged with another bank but most important is to isolate the toxic loan outside the new structure. Well so what ? Bank will never get the money back but it don't really matter this money didn't exist anyway. If it is small and it happen on a bigbank depositors will most likely get the money back so everything is right ? Absolutely not the amount that wasn't paid back is circulating in the nature inflating the monetary supply and decreasing the value of everyone saving.


How easy it is to access a determined price is directly proportional to how much money are in circulation so when you put more money in circulation it is more easy to access a determined price. And because of this chaos prices are floating like crazy trying to preserve the assets value try resulting in massive bubble which inflate and explode in dramatic ways.
Why do you think bank always existed ? But what I have to say is that fiat currency systems are not tighten to banking industry. Banks existed in the gold standard system, before and will most likely exist after the fiat currency system. This is a point that we tend to mix because actually the usage of the legal tender without any backing or value is enforced by governmental laws. So everyone have to use it including banks.
And about the short that have to net out you are missing the time parameter. Of cause they will net out sooner or later but between this time people will have to live with the current situation. This is maybe what you are also missing in the fractional reserve banking system. Everything take time. Like  to make business or even to pay interest except the loans which are instantly inflating the monetary supply.

The point is that banks have to keep customer's deposits safe. It don't matter at all who is at fault the lender, the borrower or the lier. 
If the bank is stupid enough to get scammed by some poor immigrants it is their duty to pay the money back to depositors. We aren't giving money to the bank in order to allow it to play dangerous lending games but in order to protect it against theft, disasters and to be able to get access over it at anytime.

You are describing well the US banking system. When banks screw up over their loans sometime the Fed is creating new money in order to compensate the bank's customers for their loss. It don't matter if the banks will pay their loan to the fed or bankrupt later. When you create new money like this the whole currency is depressing in value and even if the banks give back the nominal amount of currency units to bank's depositors the value of their holdings is lower. This is where inflation kick in, prices explode and the whole economy collapse in a week. Well even if it don't collapse at all at the end who is paying for the loan's default ? The working people !
The FDIC insurance fund DRR is 2% so let me laugh when people believe their money are insured. There is absolutely no way to give deposits back the money mass is way to big for that. No insurance fund in the world is holding more money than the banks loan it is simply not possible.
Let's me tell the story. Working people deposit money in a bank to keep them safe from thief, disasters and to be able to get them when they want. They think the banks, huge corporation, will take care of their hard earned money. Then as soon as the bank touch the money their loan out 900% of it to people which have interest to hold the debt as much as possible and to push the currency value down and pay less to the depositors. This is a moral crime, by loaning so much money banks are acting against depositors interest. Just thinking in absolute for a second. If everyone take a loan in a currency X, change it to USD, and then short sell the currency X with USD as collateral what will happen ? How deposits are supposed hold their value against loans when banks have a reserve ratio &lt; 50% ?

The problem isn't blockchain.info. The problem is that my transaction isn't confirmed since 14 march and I send it twice when it come back in my blockchain.info wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:54:35
Why do you have to validate the time of transaction ? Bitstamp api send you a number like "1397778218" that's the number of seconds that have past since 1970. After you have to set it in a local time system using something like $time = date("H:i:s", $trensactionDate);

Hello everybody,
I'm making some software that interact with Bitcoin trading API like those provided by Bitstamp.net.

Blockchain.info wallet address aren't confirmed by the blockchain (the real). I have this issue since the 14 march and my transaction was returned twice. Now the person which have to get the bitcoin don't have them and I'm unable to send them to him. I'm looking like a scamer and I have also lost more than 2% by panic buying and selling so what's that fuckingfuck ! We realy don't need that after the mtgox tragedy and in my opinion blockchain.info is the most important bitcoin company. If pople lost trust in blockchain.info bitcoin is dead.

They can buy only that is for sell and I'm sure that if rumors that a government will buy bitcoin the price will go to the moon and the whole 3.77T will not be enough for buy every bitcoin ;)
Actually you aren't able to buy millions of bitcoin. You can take the whole order book on bitstamp it is far to few.
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:24:08
Because if bitcoin go to $0 every other alternative currency will go to $0 but if one alt go to $0 the bitcoin will not follow it.

I don't understand why I should use a company that look like a bank but isn't a bank for centralize my decentralized currency.
If you want to use a centralized entity use a real bank. The real reason for use bitcoin is his decentralized nature and the guaranty to be the owner of your wealth what ever happen except the end of the civilization.

You can trust a text file and some wav hosted on dropbox.
You have to read the code and check how it work for been sure that it is safe before to download it. If you aren't able to understand the code you can wait that a trusted person confirm that the script is safe.
But believe me the only point that can be subject to caution in the script is the donation link and for been sure that is a real blockchain address and not a fake link to a fake dangerous website you have to check that the bitcoin address exists on the bitcoin blockchain.

Why and how a bitcoin bank could insure funds ? Like NeoBee ? How to centralize the decentralized currency will bring some benefits ? If you want to use a bank use traditional currency. Anyway most of bitcoin users have also bank account so we really don't need others bank. If I want to give my money to a centralized institution that will insure it, until they can't insure it anymore, I know how to do it without bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:30:50
The first function of a bank is to hold the money. The rests of the services that you describe are provided because the banks hold money. Bitcoin addresses hold your money in the same way that a bank do. So when you own bitcoin you are your own bank. After all you are totally free to manage your investment by yourself and to take a interest on a rate that you fixe... The "your own" mean that you can do the same things that a bank without use a centralised entity.
The power of bitcoin is his decentralized nature. No one can prove that you own a bitcoin private key and no one are able to take it from you if you don't give it.

The money (USD) that we own come from absolutly nothing. 
They are created just by will by a central bank and the value is always set in advantage to the bankers.
And you holy gold boy you thing that your money worth something just because you was never fucked up by your banking system and you imagine that your money are safe because they have assurance.
But believe me when your country expect 100'000% inflation reassurance of reassurance go bankruptcy. You will still be the owner of your 1000 buck but you will not be able to buy a single hamburger with that.
Coinbase dump the bitcoin price just by the 1% amazing shity fee on every transaction that they do. On bitstamp there is people like you and me and like coinbase that sell and buy for real.

what kind of connection problem could make a transaction to become reversed ?
I did it again but the transaction still not confirmed like the first attempt.
I didn't add transaction fee manually because I send them by the fastest way from the blockchain.info wallet. So I put just put the address and the amount. I expect that the transaction fee is added automatically.

The title of the announcement speak about wallet(s). This is a mistake because the number of wallets is pre-set and can't vary between 1 or more.
Two factor authentication isn't required anymore.
Any email wasn't sent to customers.
Hackers that are good enough for steal mtgox database are good enough for inject a dozen of code line and insert 2 textbox linked to their own server with the stolen database.
That's possible and they could do it because they want to have user's passwords. You can be a hacker good as you want you aren't able to decrypt user's passwords even you steal them. If you want the passwords you have to record them again in one unencrypted form and verify the validity by using the stolen database information.
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:59:27
There is no unbanked bitcoin owner. The few of them that was unbanked are early adopter and miners that are actually very riche and own dozens of bank accounts. The others users are sellers and bitcoin buyers from online exchanges. You can hold your private key is some very secured ways. It look like you aren't very familiar with bitcoin so you have to know that there is really betters way to hold private keys that on a paper wallet. You can encrypt your private key with a random bip32 algorithm and split the password in 10 parts that allow you to reconstruct it when you combine 4 of them. After that you put the 10 parts in different places like under your carpet, in a bank safe, different web services like google or facebook and your bitcoin privat keys have more security that any bank can provide for a deposit.
