how's the quality on these?
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:51:31
I would do 80/20 BTC/ETH to hedge just slightlyy
edit:Half before the ETF decision so you're exposed to the upside and put the other half in after
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:20:32
Hell yeah, Patrick is a beast
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:25:19
There's been a noticeable tone shift in the way the MSM covers bitcoin lately.  
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:04:32
I personally think we could see $10k overnight. The amount of institutional money that would be interested in buying small percentages of the ETF as a hedge can't be underestimated
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:36:24
not if they hedl
@_date: 2016-03-04 05:23:19
This is incredible and may be the best use for bitcoin i've ever seen. International B2B payments are such a royal pain in the ass right now
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:09:38
what 4% drop? Unless all my quotes are off.
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:58:53
As a CPA I approve this action and recently did the same thing
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:49:40
this should be on the front page. implications are huge
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:02:06
Thanks, last question. I know you generate a new key when setting up the TREZOR. Is it possible that TREZOR could have access to that key and everybody else who's bought one?
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:52:01
ETF speculation I'm guessing
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:09:39
Thanks for all the help, you just sold me a Trezor! I've been auto buying $100 a week from coinbase for a year now, so it's probably about that time.
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:12:28
Very excited for this. good luck!
@_date: 2016-03-15 02:15:15
I got this email last week as well
@_date: 2016-01-25 07:27:24
not to hijack but i have a stupid question that's holding me back from buying one. If the mytrezor site isn't here in 10 years and usb is obsolete is there a risk to never accessing your coins? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:25:38
what's Nov 15th?
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:02:29
Are hardware wallets vulnerable to this?
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:48:16
Is this debate EVER going to come to a resolution or will we be in limbo for another two years?
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:03:18
I hope you're right, sky is the limit if that happens. I just wish everybody would keep in mind the pie is limitless if this is done right
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:50:05
the betting markets broke for trump towards the end though, I'd be interested to know what the trend is here
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:05:46
how is it over yet?
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:40:29
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:56:04
Thank you for saying in 3 paragraphs what took me a month of research to feel comfortable doing.
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:59:23
amazon prime 99.00 keepkey that shit will be there in 2 days and pay for itself many times over. Idiot proof setup too.
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:57:28
check your sell limits on each account and make sure. In Coinbase's case, you can request a limit increase (mine got raised to daily buy and sells of $10k recently).
You might want to look into an actual exchange account at Gemini or Bitfinix if you're doing higher quantities than that.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:13:14
trust me man I know the anxiety. BTC has a lot of great things going for it, lots of good momentum and getting legit attention. Try to unplug for a little bit and distract yourself with something fun.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:49:18
why October?
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:13:31
This is the future, awesome. 
Do you use bitcoin as the payment rail or what?
@_date: 2016-06-13 03:36:25
They should be happy paying you the fee if they don't want to do the research themselves, it's a good deal for both of you.
@_date: 2017-01-15 19:31:39
Trump is president now, you should be able to talk about the American president in places other than the ONE sub it is okay to have non socialist views on reddit
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:10:42
dude relax. when you wake up tomorrow it'll be fine
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:17:04
the bitcoin virus is strong in the Trump administration
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:24:32
Have you guys raised any capital or self funding this thing?
@_date: 2016-06-25 03:14:13
IDK why Bitcoiners hate Trump for the most part, but i guess that's just Reddit in general
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:12:16
Why does BTC trade in USD by the British people? Not challenging your statement, just curious
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:03:30
what canadian weed stocks you into and how's the '17 outlook?
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:59:18
sorry to hear that man.
If I were you I'd write down your most likely PIN options and think about what led you to choose the PIN you would have. Take a step back and just think
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:36:40
Used to be a fan... now i realize he's just a joke
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:15:25
glad to hear it

Anyone got an archived version? My ad blocker won't let me read this
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:30:42
how does this work if you lose your trezor and restore on mycellium for example?
Do you type in the seed and multiple accounts open in mycellium?
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:43:58
aaaaaaaaand it's gone
@_date: 2016-12-25 06:45:02
good with all things cyber

very cool man that's great!

Go Trump 
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:20:55
Thank you, I always forget there's a lot of blue pill swallowers among bitcoiners
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:31:03
Vote total doesn't matter, it's the location of the vote. Trump flipped a lot of rust belt counties that Obama had won previously and had more votes than Romney in those key counties... so he did win
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:13:29
is there any type of recovery seed? I guess that would defeat the purpose of a "bearer instrument." but losing the physical stick is game over?
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:57:37
13 word?
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:32:00
The popular vote means nothing... that's how you end up with two states taking advantage of the other 48...
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:18:55
their heads would explode if they admitted it to themselves

Do you publish any financials? what percent of donations actually pay for dinners?
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:12:34
I sidelined most of my cash until there's a clear road ahead. AFAIK nothing has really changed yet. If I lose some money buying back in so be it, but sitting tight and watching for now.

I've had the weekly buy set up for 5 months and haven't done any others since then
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:46:27
haha I'm an accountant who has been fascinated with bitcoin for 3 years and gradually built a stockpile..... I would describe it in exactly this way. cheers
@_date: 2016-05-31 04:32:19
great point, thanks!

Love this and love to see firms like Deloitte coming back to the bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2016-07-01 05:09:44
stupid question- how do we know the private seeds aren't all saved by BTCC?
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:37:27
I love my Keepkey as well
