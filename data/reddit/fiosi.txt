Reading those types of comments really makes me question the sophistication of the typical Bitcoin investor.
Ignorant investors to me play a huge red flag in suggesting a bubble.

Do you not think deflation would spiral out of control? People save more -&gt; demand decreases -&gt; price decreases to accommodate -&gt; I.e. Further deflation, becoming more extreme each cycle?
Perhaps central banks are protecting us from this?

If you read the full interview you will see Shiller is slightly uneducated on the topic:
TLDR; He has never heard of an ICO

Great read.
You don't have to think Tether.io is a scam to be upset about their lack of transparency with regards to audit compliance (despite that potentially changing).


This is debatable - although the purpose may be to only provide a safe haven, the actual pegging mechanism is based on an arbitrage incentive. If tokens cannot be redeemed for their 1 USD that pegging system fails.
Even after all KYC formalities you are not guaranteed 1 USD per token, which although understandable from one perspective, is also a barrier of use for some people.

Not quite.
OkCoin and Huobi just released statements that RMB-crypto will be closed by the end of October but no other operations (i.e. Crypto to crypto) will be affected.

You can still make money in a bubble.

To clarify, the question I asked wasn't about deflation specifically with Bitcoin. The comments were suggesting that 1) Deflation would be an inevitability of adoption and 2) Deflation in ANY economy is okay because "spending is necessary but people need to be encouraged to save"
This articles handles 1) nicely:  
But 2) is where I need some reassurance/understanding of what's going on

More likely to be CNBC responding to clicks than some conspiracy.
People will naturally be concerned about disruptive technologies and will want to hear the risks.

What do you mean by your technology comment and how would it change his prediction?

Disappointing from Shiller
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:44:38
Very true

Assets can still decrease in value in an economy with inflation

I really respect Shiller and have read a lot of his work.
That being said, he doesn't actually seem to have researched Cryptocurrencies that well (based on this one interview alone).
Read the full/less edited version here:
TLDR: He has never heard of an ICO.
If he does to decide to write about it as hinted, I would be very interested in reading his ideas - I'm sure at this point they would be well researched and fleshed out as always.
