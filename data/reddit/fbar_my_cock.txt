You mean, like options trading? Companies have to burn all of 0.5 XCP, as an anti-spam measure, to issue stock. For end users, XCP has nothing to do with stock trading on Counterparty. You don't need any XCP to use the system as an end user unless you want to trade binary options. Even the companies doing the IPO don't need more than 0.5.
Ethereum took $15,000,000 from the public and then premined 20% of the ether supply for themselves. It would be one thing to knock Ethereum for that, but Counterparty did nothing like that. As an end user of Counterparty you don't need ANY xcp for stock trading.

Patrick Byrne recently hired two Counterparty developers to develop a distributed Bitcoin stock exchange. You might find this link interesting:

If Luke-Jr can slip in personal patches unchecked at the source, just imagine what the government could do if they really wanted to subvert Bitcoin.
It's shit like this that makes me wonder why I have anything to do with Bitcoin.
We genuinely could be voluntarily building our own financial panopticon. GTFO LUKE, GTFO.

You thought Huobi was shady? Most have little appreciation for how absolutely *pervasive* OKCoin's social media tactics are. OP has been a Redditor for 9 hours, and is more than likely a paid shill from rival OKCoin.
Both OKCoin and Huobi have been at each others' necks fighting for the title of "highest Chinese volume" since 2013, which is obviously a terrible battle to be had. I'm not sure which one is more notorious for misrepresenting their trading volume. Does anyone else remember when Huobi claimed 60% of their users were female?
Li Xiaolai called out [OKCoin for fake trading volume]( in 2013.












We have no way of knowing if OKCoin's reported figures are at all defensible today, but judging by their track record of explicitly questionable business practices, it's really no wonder BitcoinAverage.com, CoinMarketcap.com, and others choose not to factor in Chinese exchange volume by default. This is the market's only defense against these maneuvers.
OKCoin came out of nowhere alongside Huobi and immediately began proudly displaying a string of impossible 1,000,000 BTC daily trading volume and 10,000,000 LTC daily trade volume, unleveraged. They continue to deny that they have ever outwardly manipulated their trading data, which should be condemning enough.

Exactly, and has no obligation to please Reddit.

So Luke, which has more value as a database:
A) MySQL
B) the world's most secure blockchain
Answer: B)
Because the blockchain is more open, accessible, dependable and secure than a private DB cluster, it will be used for the same things as a private DB cluster. What is your argument here? That people shouldn't use the world's best DB as a DB?

Exactly. You don't need ANY xcp to trade stocks on Counterparty as an end user. That is the fact. Please do your research.
There is no "intermediary currency" involved in Counterparty for everyone aside from Companies issuing shares, and even then it only requires burning 0.5 XCP once as an anti-spam measure.
