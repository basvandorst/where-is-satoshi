Those were crimes in those communities, and hence criminal in nature. Whether or not you agree that those should be crimes is largely irrelevant.

Yet its the only thing that would prevent people from taking advantage of others.
That is why small communities tend to be so crime free... Everyone knows everyone. There are few secrets. Someone misbehaving is going to be found out sooner or later, and shunned, if not punished outright. In larger populations those misbehavers can fade into the background clutter of people.

You'll reduce violence by ensuring everyones basic needs are covered, but you won't eliminate it. 
Imagine you live in that world of excess, where everyone owns a star trek replicator and energy is too cheap to bother metering. Maybe you found a nice little plot of land on a riverside, built yourself a house, and live their with your wife and kids. Cool.
What happens when I decide I like that spot? And I come in and pitch a tent on your lawn, or even just walk into the house and take over the couch? What if I instead like your daughter? What if I brought friends with me?
There are only two ways I can imagine a world without human violence... Either some sort of genetic engineering/mind control/whatever that makes violence an unthinkable act to us, or some omniscient AI overlord that prevents us from doing anything violent. 
Otherwise, humans are gonna be humans.

I honestly couldn't say.
