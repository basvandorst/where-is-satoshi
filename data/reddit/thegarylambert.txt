Thanks for the help everyone! I couldn't find the right firmware for ddwrt or openwrt, but changing the port to 58333 did the trick.

I’m not sure - it very well could be the OS or hardware. That’s why I’m looking for advice on troubleshooting.  I’m fairly new to this and don’t have a good sense of the steps to take to identify where the problem is.

It’s frozen - can’t use the mouse, keyboard, etc. The only way to get it usable again is a hard reboot.

Update - I put in  Raspberry Pi Config presets and that seems to have done the trick. My node has been running without issue for close to 24 hours which is over twice as long as it has ever run before.

Thanks! I have more RAM on the way, since I want to open the node up to more than the 20 connections I've been limiting it to. Hopefully that will take care of it.  I'll take a look at /var/log/kern.log right now as well.

If it’s a western government, they would also find a way to blame white males right before throwing money at it.

It certainly is. I was initially pretty pissed until I realized that.

+1 for Gemini. Very easy to use and reasonably low fees.
