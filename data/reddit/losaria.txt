perhaps this is obvious... you need to program (and advertise) an app that uses your site.

i think it is the same. only some readers misunderstood and seemed excited about not having to pay sales tax at all when purchasing with bitcoin.

CONGRATULATIONS!!! let's hope value goes to 300K :)

yep, smartphone. useful when:
1) you do not own a computer (more relevant to africa/s. america than europe, but you never know) 
2) you are away from your desk, have forgotten your physical wallet, and need to "recharge" your wallet (avoid embarrassing situation in the store/pub) 
i admit, not extremely convincing. but people are addicted to their phones and constantly comparing apps. it would help publicity-wise.
another promotion option: bitcoin gift cards, purchased by credit card and sent to the email+wallet of your choice with a fancy e-card, similar to what amazon has.

i love how it simplifies transactions by cutting out the middlemen/red tape/fine print. and i love that nobody knows how far it can and will go...

any infographic regarding the buyer side? it would be interesting to see if your service is benefiting people in locations with no access to bitcoins.

did you notice that when BTC is "unchosen" it disappears from the currency list? :(

the business benefits, the customer less so (unless s/he is offered a discount).
quoting from the [official doc](
Example 1: An online retailer registered for New York State sales tax purposes accepts convertible virtual currency from a customer as payment for home décor items that will be delivered to the customer’s location in New York State. In effect, the customer has purchased the home décor items in exchange for the convertible virtual currency, and the retailer has purchased the convertible virtual currency in exchange for the home décor items.
Because home décor items are taxable, the customer owes sales tax based on the taxable receipt for the purchase of the items. The taxable receipt is the fair market value of the convertible virtual currency in U.S. dollars at the time of the transaction. However, because convertible virtual currency is intangible property, the retailer does not owe any sales tax on its exchange of home décor items for the convertible virtual currency.
The retailer must record in its books and records the amount of the sale and the sales tax collected in U.S. dollars, and report the sale and remit the sales tax due in U.S. dollars when filing its periodic sales tax returns.
Example 2: A vendor in New York State that accepts convertible virtual currency as payment creates custom computer software for sale to a client. The custom software is delivered to a New York location. Since the sale of custom software is not subject to sales tax, this barter transaction is an exchange of a non-taxable product for non-taxable convertible virtual currency. No sales tax is due on this transaction.
Example 3: A New York State resident sends her watch to be repaired at a New York repair shop that accepts convertible virtual currency for its services. Since watch repair services are subject to sales tax, the resident owes sales tax based on the taxable receipt for the purchase of the service. The taxable receipt for the repair service is the fair market value of the convertible virtual currency at the time of the sale. The repair shop must collect the sales tax and must separately state the tax from the fair market value of the convertible virtual currency on any sales slip, receipt, or invoice provided to the customer. The repair shop must also record in its books and records the amount of the sale and the sales tax collected in U.S. dollars, and report the sale and remit the sales tax due in U.S. dollars when filing its periodic sales tax returns.

hope you're still feeling tipsy :)

what about BTC gifts? is "basis" the value on the day the gift is received? what happens if the gift is passed on in BTC (not fiat)? does the new owner then have a new "basis" based on the day of the most recent transfer?

What's with the tips today?
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:28:02
very, very smooth. wow! registration took less than a minute (i admit i did not read the terms and conditions). 
1) your site is very ugly/nonfunctional when NoScript is enabled. (not your fault, but you should know)
2) perhaps recommend 2FA more strongly.

- anything run/overseen by the government (in your case, universities and lower education, hospitals...) could be taxed when paid (deducted automatically from paycheck, no need to file). it does not matter if the salaries are in bitcoin or fiat.
- this could also be enforced for employees of larger companies, whose annual financial data is on public record (if a company claims to make X, after paying Y in salaries, then the government could expect to collect some known portion of the X and Y as taxes).
- voluntary tax filing by all other hopefully law-abiding citizens. 
- the "problem" is collecting taxes from those not interested in filing. i think the main issue would be small businesses, which have absolutely no incentive to publicize their finances. but then, this is what goes on now, with fiat taxation... you would have to have IRS-like snoops looking for evidence of tax avoidance. the evidence might be harder to find (changes in car/home ownership, plane tickets - all can be linked to a person). bitcoin privacy would just force the snooping to the next level.

the hash needs to be hard to find, but quickly verifiable once found. how would we all go about checking that the protein was folded as claimed?
