Sorry my bad
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:56:03
Well done not suggesting any better sites
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:51:16
Yes, I am using it since a few months without any trouble. Support is also great imo
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:58:15
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:18:00
Up but this is ofc just my opinion
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:36:20
Dont need to worry at all, the network is completly overloaded with uncompleted transactions, ~145k atm
Just wait
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:12:21
That wouldnt be smart though, a ban wouldnt reduce the energy consumpion and most citizens wouldnt care about a ban
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:06:36
Not necessarily, 5 BTC  at 17.5k means he invested 87,5k
Selling at 18,5k means he made a gain of 5k of whatever currency and now owns 92,5k worth of bitcoins. If he now cashes out he has to pay (I dont know what would be the tax in your country of capital gains) so lets say 20% taxes that would mean he would own 74 after the process
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:51:04
You are right, thanks for the idea
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:39:32
I often have the same thoughts like you, even if it dips hard, the price will always go up after some time.
Hodl, you will feel better
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:11:35
Whats the mainnet? Well it does not help with the current situation... how long will it take to get fully implemented? Can you provide some more infos?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:49:35
Theres a voting at the end  of the post. 68% of the voters think that bitcoin is in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:10:16
Dont believe the FUD, fear is the best thing bitcoin opponents can spread inside the community
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:48:27
You and me know panic is never a good advisor. What if the price will rise during that event, that would mean you couldnt buy back the same amount you once had. 
Still your decision but I will continue to hold for long term
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:43:12
I do, I give each of my family member a 50€ cold wallet card but not as a main gift ofc, just to get them involved
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:55:17
Get yourself a ledger nano s and move your btc from coinbase to the device. Google will help you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:47:31
Any exchange you feel comfortable with.
To give you some names, here are a few exchanges you can check out:
Use google to get a basic understanding of these things before you start
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:42:37
If you plan to hold long term - buy now!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:10
Im from germany, anycoindirect.eu its a site in the netherlands, very reliable
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:13:46
Yes this is an existing problem which can't be solved right now, lightning network will fix that to some degree
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:47
You obviously havent been active in the sub the last three days
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:20:03
Thanks, also nobody could prove that I own or have access to the wallet I sent the BTC to, as TOR browser doesnt save any logs or something similar(referring to the dark net wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:07:50
Do you actually care about the technology behind it?!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:56:11
Well was this worth it considering the taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:49
You should be fine, you will see how it goes over the time, nobody can helo you with that.
As always, enjoy your ride!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:34:51
You almost answered your own question.
Buy now or you will definetely punch yourself in the future
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:54:44
I get a the website is not available/connection was refused error when I click on submit!
Also is there a way to actually buy the card shown above? Would love to own one regardless of the cost
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:46:14
Pathetic. Makes the government look like a joke
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:44:05
Cash out? 400.000/btc but who knows maybe never
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:36:48
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:54
Always depends who you're talking to but I think you would most likely seem like an crazy risk taking idiot to the person you're talking 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:14:56
If you aim for long term - buy now
Day trading - wait for a dip
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:37:00
Hopefully Deutsche Bahn comes with this feature soon too! Great move of the SBB
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:17
Best support, fees are okay
Never had trouble with it
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:07:31
Oh I get it you only have to tax the gain sorry for making a fool of myself
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:07:04
Why has just arrived in time? Its not implemented yet?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:51
Good, they have to feel the consequences
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:38:14
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:22
Im not upset but thanks for caring
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:11:56
This is from a radical xrp-believer(view his post-history),  dont take him serious
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:21:58
Always put as much in as you can afford to loose
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:20:15
You sure you want to invest 1000000 in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:47:47
Yeah you can do that but thats not really something you "gift" someone right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:28
Thats right
You would have 4000 then
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:47
Nobody can take that decision for you, but by investing in BTC you store your money away from the  bankers and invest in future technology and at the same time you most likely are gonna make some gains..... so think about it
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:17:25
Try harder
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:42:15
Nobody can say for sure what will happen of course, but I'm in a similar situation like you, I will just hold my coins during that event as I dont expect a major crash. If you think a few months ahead, does it really matter then what happened this weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:11:56
When the lightning network gets actually implemented
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:17
Yes you do, otherwise you will regret it
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:57:04
62,57% at the moment to be precise
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:29:22
lol had the exact same struggle a few days ago, insane right? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:12
One of the best posts the past week in here, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:55
Just doing my duty exposing toxic people like you, nothing more or less
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:56
Yes, just HODL you would regret selling in the future!
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:00:09
My BTC on my ledger are on a legacy address, how do I transfer them to a SegWit address without loosing any of my BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:05:49
I agree, they need some pressure
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:09:50
Hold long term, dont sell now at a loss
How long are you in the business? Do you get scared at the first dip you see and panic sell?
Not clever.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:30:10
I already corrected myself but thanks anyway
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:32:01
Remindme! 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:34:17
HODL or nothing
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:13:24
 you already made a fool of yourself, try harder
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:37:52
100% in bitcoin, hold vertcoin for some time(nice community) but exchanged it for BTC when it was lile 5-7k
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:16
Sure this isnt a good sign, but the lightning network will be implemented sooner or later, that will improve a lot of things.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:46:30
Yes, if you plan to hold your bitcoin for long term, then now is a very good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:18:45
He didnt, its just op spreading FUD
@_date: 2019-03-16 07:47:59
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:05:42


yes you will get bogged!
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:42:40
More like this article: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:22:03
Yes now is perfect to buy, there is a small dip happening at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:06:32
They are trying to devide our strong community, dont let that happen, stick together!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:06:43
Yeah you got this right, the article is an eye opener. Please do the community a favor and spread it as much as you can!
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:23:55
Title is wrong, nothing on the website is about bitcoin being the future!
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:20:43
Wtf is wrong with you
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:10:39
No its more like there are a few individuals that think the future would be better without bitcoin. These individuals try to make people loose trust in bitcoin/crypto in general and divide the community.
This article describes the issue in better words:
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:29
Love you too
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:47:42
I advise you to read this article, it sums up pretty much what is going on atm: 
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:53:42
actually already purchased a pack with bitcoin some time ago but I think I ended up having to pay with bitpay
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:49:47
I personally use AzireVPN, its privacy minded and totally sufficient for my needs: 
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:59:41
- bitrefill 
- vpn service
- send a friend money (instant)
donating to some open source projects
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:45:56
burger king in germany is actually accepting bitcoin as payment method in their online shop, checked it myself today
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:29:47
this! using it for years now, very convenient and easy with excellent support!
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:50:52
thank you
