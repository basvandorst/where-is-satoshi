I’ve been thinking about this. If I had that amount of money I couldn’t give it to charities, I’d have to help individuals only. To be able to play a role in someone’s life that directly is really awesome.
Oh, you’ve always wanted this thing...here, go kick ass. 
I think giving gifts is super fun, why not amplify that by 80+ million dollars... right? If I’m ever in the position to do so, that’s exactly what I’d do.

Where is it cheaper, what exchange can you buy in with USD?

I’ve been only using my bank account. I’ve added a debit card

Okay I’ve got a good handle on the transaction thing. The incredibly high fees basically negate the effectiveness of day trading to me though... I mean, you’re starting off at a 3-4% loss, so you’d need an 8% gain or so to even see a 4% return. Not to mention the fees to transfer money out. What am I missing there?

So by transferring them to my Coinbase wallet, I was actually removing the coin from the exchange? How would I do it as to keep everything “in the exchange”

I guess I’m just confused since my transaction took so long to clear. I understand there are two types of transactions, but I’m not sure exactly how to do it the other way

Ahhh, yes that’s the thing I was missing. Bank transfers are cheaper but take forever. I can day trade with a card.
Fees are definitely a killer, other exchanges are cheaper.

The first time I bought from Coinbase, yep.

He’ll be headed right back up at light speed.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:18
Is it even possible though?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:44
It just started totally not working for us. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:09
Coinbase totally down for us at work right now
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:45:37
So for example, on Coinbase. If I buy I can immediately sell? When I bought before nothing showed up until about a week later
