Took this time before the next big breakout to buy more Bitcoin.. and I am excited to say I now own over one whole Bitcoin!

More realistically 200-250k but you can always dream
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:34:37
My VERY GOOD source says 12k in 2 weeks (Friday the 18th to be specific) then dip of about 10-15%. Privileged information so y’all should feel lucky

@_date: 2018-03-29 13:21:42
That’s actually a really good idea. Just did that

Reporting in from the future. Bull run

Like left-leaning sites/individuals don’t skew facts and pick and choose what ‘facts’ to report based on their narrative. Please. Don’t bring politics into this subreddit

I bought MORE at 7k, crashes are good reason to buy
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:41:35
He offered to buy out her position... It's a free gamble pretty much
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:36:08
Need to get to 9130 to break even. HODL
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:53:03
If you haven't noticed the trend It's bouncing around 9500-10500 for the past few days. Sell at 10400, buy at 9600. Easy $$$

Better believe my crypto stash will be in my prenup ain’t no way she’s getting her hands on that
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:19:28
Bitcoin already up 5% today. BUY!

Because It’s a good way to get a point across, regardless if it comes from Trump or not?
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:48:26
Double down, in this sense of the word, means repeating a previously made declaration, not literally buying twice as much Bitcoin

The SJWs will find some way for women to be the victim
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:28:54
Yeahh wait until leftists get into office in 2020. Ain’t gonna be pretty
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:16:02
I bought even more at 7k. HODL
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:42:57
‘Bounce back’ from what? BTC went up 8x since 2017
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:17:30
I am now above even. Yay!
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:12:10

Bush, Obama, Trump, all the same :(
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:53:37
Looks like we're going up. We'll see by the end of the day
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:51:37
Vegeta incoming?
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:13:37
I always put my sell orders 10$ before the round numbers cause I know It's gonna go straight back down lol
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:31:29
I have VERY reliable insider knowledge that says you have until Friday to buy before the bull run
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:10:02
I own 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:22:20
Sell at 9500 buy at 9200, this shit's way too easy lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:49:12

@_date: 2018-04-03 09:49:42
My prediction is 10k by summer
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:04:12
We have great chocolate cakes, don’t we folks?
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:02:44
Sold at 9700 and made a nice profit, anyone who thought it wouldn’t be bouncing around the 9000s for a few days before 10k was delusional
