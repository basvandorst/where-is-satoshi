Best possible scenario to me is find a qualified CPA, crunch the numbers, and make an informed decision. I would personally buy back into monero or dash, and relocate to Aruba, and enjoy life. 
Another option would be to use the profits to purchase mining equipment and open your own litecoin or x11 mine, run a business, pay the taxes, and cut yourself monthly checks for freaking ever.

She would intentionally say it incorrectly to annoy me. The first time I tried to say "be patient" that was the mess that came out. Kind of a private joke. That's why I said it in quotes... Lol

Sideline it from coinbase to gdax and withdraw from there. Way lower fees.

I sign into coinbase first, then set up the gdax account. Once you have it managed, you can deposit and withdraw directly through gdax

You know that most of the btc that was sold at 4900 will be bought back at the bottom of the dip. Enjoy the ride, buy more, and do what my old Spanish teacher used to tell me daily "estoy la paciente".

Once it's set up,  it holds the private keys,  safe as it gets.  Various access methods.

Your own wallet.  I recommend a Trezor or a keepkey
