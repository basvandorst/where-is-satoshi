Good overview.
FWIW, Bitcoin Lightning Wallet has implemented watchtower service in their wallet, though the "official" LN final spec implementation is still in progress I believe.

I am very excited about Lightning for many reasons.  Particularly in how it could dramatically improve cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities, as well as create a much better UX for payments.

Realistically, wouldn't it be a huge advantage for Core to change the PoW if B2X looks like it's going to cause a chain split?  I would imagine this would be a great time to move to a GPU friendly algorithm, especially with Nvidia and AMD jumping into the mining industry.

What service would this provide?

Proof-of-work is fine.  It's the only proven method of unbiased security.  Decoupling the relaying nodes from the validators (miners), improves Bitcoin's security.  It allows for economic nodes to become very influential for network consensus and helps balance out the miners and developers.  
So maybe one of the alt-bitcoin forks will go PoS, but "Bitcoin" will likely never be a proof-of-stake blockchain.

Trustless payments, notarization, &amp; timestamping.  Timestamping is a big deal for proof-of-existence for intellectual property purposes, and can be done for free already with [OpenTimestamps]( thanks to Peter Todd's work
The OpenTimestamp protocol and Lightning Wallets are the two things that excite me most about Bitcoin, and hope to use in the near future.

SegWit actually did both.
