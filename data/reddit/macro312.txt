If you're not confident in your decision, why make it?
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:42:37
why do you keep trying?
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:26:09
So.... we don't lose the fun bucks, they just aren't worth anything.
God I hate these cunts.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:18:07
Is there a fee charge (+% ontop of fiat to bitcoin)?
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:25:43
Everyday law is almost non-existent here.
IE. Look at the traffic. Look at the knock offs. 
1 billion + people here, pretty hard to enforce the internet (GFW is a joke. $5 VPN get you to Valhalla in no time). 
Let alone, trying to ban bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:09:41
I'm shocked
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:48:41
This thread actually made me laugh haha
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:01:38
Not my point.
I understand a loan does not reqiite a bank. It is just the nature of bitcoin is analogous to cash. Once sent, it can never be retrieved.
I was asking about the services. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:54:53
I'll hodl you harder ;)
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:24:56
That is exactly it. But when the high ups come for a visit, they haul ass XD
@_date: 2014-01-22 03:46:28
and that is relevant...how?
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:35:33
Damn it! I would love to come but I have work :L
How are you indexing your prices?

@_date: 2014-03-27 04:29:54
Could always strip for bitcoins
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:29:41
And it dropped again! :L
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:32:49
I guess I can be the first to *coin* this insult.
"You're the Mt.Gox of Bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:43:04
I couldn't give a flying fuck if apple wants this or not. They're openly hostile to bitcoins and do not deserve our praise or support.
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:30:10
51% is pretty high.
That is also a statistics.
Thoughts and feelings cannot be put into statistics.
Also, it is gambling. Pretty different that day to day decision making.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:41:22
Alright so if you're saying how does it move from node 1 to node 2 without the price inflating.... how is that relevant? Its price shouldn't change like how If I handed you hard cash, its buying power shouldn't move?
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:21:50
At the level of seizure, I think it is prominent as dead man trigger but you're probably right if they are that professional.
@_date: 2014-11-30 23:16:20
We have to go deeper.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:02:40
lol, alright settle down, idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:51:49
from 1000 to 100.
What a thrill..... (snakke eaterrrr)
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:13:18
Hold up, are you saying r0nj0hn3 continuing to do so is the 9/10 people that refuse to do anything?
Then how is that not sowing salt? I'm not saying its a doomsday scenario but the logic behind it is counter intuitive.
For example, why pure Communism wouldn't work is because everyone would eventually realise why bother doing work when the others can do it. 
This 51% leaves the *potential* of smashing the value of bitcoin IF an attack was to happen. Then what will be the point of mining in the first place? Why risk it? to make a quick buck?
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:05:24
I can circlejerk as long as you.

Loans without banks?
So who is loaning what?

As soon as MT.Gox fucks off. Bitcoin will be a better world.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:10:15
"I'm making money through exploiting the system which will fundamentally make bitcoins lose its value"
Smart move, its like sowing your fields with salt after a harvest.
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:03:14
Do people do that? (I mean without escrow)?
I mean the whole beauty for BC is the money is only one way, no take backs etc.
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:25:18
I respectfully disagree.

@_date: 2013-03-21 06:24:36
I went with them in Feb and got a refund asap. I sorta want to gamble with my bitcoin on the statements buy too fuspy...bet they won't get it before April.
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:24:09
Oh fucking today tonight. Dont trust these fucking bastards. They spin any story just so that bitch can have her job.

@_date: 2013-12-10 07:39:20
I don't care a single bit. Being forced to have a wallet will only mean a giant spec bubble will occur again and again. Instead, I suggest they adopt it when they are ready.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:15:55
Can someone explain how bitcoins encryption is different and actually secure? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:24:34
Yeah i've been wondering too...
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:11:32
Damn. I thought it was a price prediction XD
@_date: 2013-02-26 14:05:08
So glad i ordered and the quickly got a refund. Fucking hell. This is why companies need to develop and have it packaged before you fucking sell it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:27:03
Is this legit? Why are they giving away small sums of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:24:05
Lol, this wont stop much. Many businesses still require USD payments instead of RmB. Here is a weird thing, factories often only pay sums of money to their clients afterwork hours....they often feel dodgy.

I'll say it again.
*When has Apple ever listened to public opinion?*
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:21:11
The bot holders will sooner or later destroy the bitcoin market. That is undeniable. They are just creating an environment only they can trade while others lose confidence.
BUT the fact humans are greedy (see natural resource such as fishing industry), this will not stop them from trying to make a quick buck and jetpack out...
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:53:05
Apple's TOS is so large, it includes the ban on using Itunes for WOMD, so this isn't exactly a surprise.
@_date: 2013-09-22 09:07:21
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:18:42
It is apple. When has public opinion ever phased them?
@_date: 2013-05-29 01:29:04
OP I wanted buy that but couldn't find a link to it. Can you show me?
@_date: 2013-02-13 12:57:39
I suggest you keep investing your bitcoins in new hardware.
What is your take on the new ASICs coming into town?
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:58:52
The difficulty ramped up again.... by the time the 3rd batch comes out. They will either have to sell them cheaper or no one will buy it....I think...
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:35:50
Just curious. Does this only mean shops or online merchants? ?
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:28:23
Can someone get a mobile version? I only have my tablet atm :/
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:13:29
Why are they even letting bots buy and sell under 0.1 bitcoins anyways????
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:16:22
Did they actually have open hostility towards bitcoin? Can someone source me?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:35:06
They put up all these rules. Why? So you can gain a small profit and piss off your customers? It is so counter intuitive and 1950's.
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:52:53
Welp, I guess I can fap to this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:30:00
Or...you know....HOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:25:23
I find it hard to be scammed from a 3 m tall sheep....what if they sent you a ram instead? haha
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:27:10
I honest don't care if Apple implements it or not. That is the point!
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:19:43
I WANT TO BUY IT ASAP
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:54:33
I didn't even notice it dropped.
The price means nothing in comparison to liberty.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:50:23
It is my fucking money. I can do what ever the fuck I want with it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:29:00
It wasn't a public opinion. It was pure marketing.
I'm talking about the fact, they refuse to listen to anyone that does not follow their 'vision'. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:02:01


@_date: 2013-03-07 22:52:58

@_date: 2013-12-10 04:48:00
Like I give a flying fuck if bitcoin is available on an iphone.
They are the pinnacale of control in that industry, why the fuck would I want them to implement it? It should be the other-way around, they should beg for our forgiveness.
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:18:10
So basically... they get to *print* more money of equal worth at that instant, then use it instantly. They pretty much buy things at a discount.
However,  the inflation occura and the next time they want to buy something,  they must print out more than last time?
Or am I just crazy and know absolutely nothing??
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:19:33
"GET APPLE TO" &lt;- shut your mouth. Just stop using them.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:00:52

Ahh the meta of bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:04:24

@_date: 2013-12-29 13:08:23
I'm not talking about UI. Ui is probably the last thing I need for a security program. Right now, from my understanding is Win8 is running it in Win7 mode. right? Or I'm wrong. Then I'm wrong.
