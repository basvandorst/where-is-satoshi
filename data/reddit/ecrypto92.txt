Buy during dips, hold, sell a little for profits, hold &amp; repeat.

Please don’t jinx it...

Do you know how to win in this situation? Invest in both...

Eh, it’s debatable for sure. Since China banned crypto and South Korea is also debating if they will ban it or not — both play a big role in the crypto market, as you can tell by the price dropping to its lowest in quite awhile. 
It wouldn’t hurt to put some money in it at these low prices; that way if it does go back up to $20k + you’ll have a nice little profit.

If so, I’m buying 10!

You can’t base the entire crypto market off of one bad apple.... you clearly know nothing about investing.

Who is wrong? When you sell for a loss you lose money... when you hold and the price goes back up (often times it eventually will) you will be making money again...

Pure speculation... 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:34:54
Yeah, but when I do check it’s down so I’m like wtf and just hold.

Is it safe to buy again on Coinbase? I’m not trying to buy $50.00 worth of crypto and being charged $2747289384783. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:37:49
I’m hoping this is soon! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:29:12
Haha, so accurate. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:48:12
When does it go live?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:09:14
It’s weird seeing Bitcoin below ten-thousand when Ethereum is steadily going up! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:03:44
Upvote me brah

If that’s so, we have a longggggggg way to go.
