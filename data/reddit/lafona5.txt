You may want to check out the bitUSD offered by the Bitshares group. You can exchange btc for one of the assets(USD, gold, silver etc) via metaexchange.

Blockchain voting seems like a pretty interesting idea. I believe the guys at  are working on this too.

There are ways to manage the volatility. I would suggest checking out some of the recent products including Locks, Bitreserve, Nubits or Bitshares BitUSD.

Bitreserve and Locks I believe are centralized in that they hold reserves or require the trust of a single entity. Nubits and Bitshares are probably the best decentralized options. While I am not as familiar with the mechanics behind Nubits, I have been following Bitshares and I like the way they address the volatility issue. Their product, BitUSD, tracks the price of a dollar but is backed by their controlled supply crypto, Bitshares (BTS). Currently BitUSD tracks within a a percent or two of the actual value of a dollar, but this is expected to become tighter as market volume increases. As a merchant accepting BitUSD, you dwould not need to immediatly cashout to fiat after each sale and if you held BitUSD, would be eligible to earn additional income from the asset itself, similiar to a bank. Depending on your location, there are other bitassets designed to track CNY, EUR or even gold or silver. Hope this is helpful. I tried to keep it short but if you have any questions concerns I would be more than happy to go into more detail.
