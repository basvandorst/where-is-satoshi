Going to chime in as well, please remember that your fees for doing that sale on coinbase vs. gdax will be substantial.  Transfer to GDAX (free and instant), sell as a limit order (no fee) and then withdraw the cash.  The coinbase fees are insane.

When you setup the trezor you are given the seeds.  These are normal words that when entered in the same order result in the same configuration.
So, if you lose your trezor, you can buy a new one, input the words and have access to your account again.
So, you can write down that list of words, wipe your trezor, input the words and the funds are available again.  I tried this with a test amount (like .00001 BTC) and it worked perfectly.
The trezor also allows you to have multiple 'wallets' protected by different passwords.  When you enter in password1, you only see that single wallet.  You can use that method if you are ever held at gunpoint ;)  i.e. put 1btc in password1 and 1000btc in password2.

Read everything you can about bitcoin, understand it, believe in it, then invest in it a little at a time.  Look at market capitalization and understand that as a store of value, we are not anywhere close to anything else yet.

Over 6 confirmations, that should have been credited by now.  Double check the deposit address is legit.

It looks like for each transaction they are sending out .02 BTC.  If from those 200 people they get just one person to send them 0.03 BTC then they have made a profit.
HAHA, I just got one as well.  Interestingly it was to my wallet at cloudbet.  I wonder if that is how they are harvesting addresses.

Sweet.  That was actually pretty painless.

The problem is that paypal is reversible, bitcoin is not.  Sure, I can agree to sell you $4 in bitcoin.  You would send me $4 via paypal.  A few days later you dispute the transaction and paypal will refund your $4.  I get nothing.  You get your $4 plus my $4 in bitcoin.

The vault part is mainly used for 2 reasons:
1. time delay (48 hours)
2. multiple approvals
So, say my wife and I had 20btc in a vault.  I wanted to spend 5btc on something, I would submit a withdraw from the vault to my personal wallet.  Emails would go out to whomever was listed and all would need to approve the withdraw.  
48 hours later, if everything was approved, I would get my BTC into my wallet and could do what I wanted to with it.
Think of it as purely cold storage.  Great for making sure no one steals your BTC without you having a chance to react.
If I lost my phone, my finger (to unlock it) and my email, they would also need to gain control of my wife's email to approve the request.  Then wait 48 hours for it to move the funds.  We are talking hostage situation.
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:50:38
Use the vault.  2 email accounts need to authorize a withdraw.
Or the multisig Vault.

Mainly want to see how it works.  If you want, just send me 1 bit and the rest to a random charity.

What you need is a Bitcoin OTC counter party.  This is not one an exchange and is a bulk purchase at a flat price that will not affect market price.
Here is an ok article on it:

So, since the last time I posted in one of these got me started with changetip, I signed up several friends, let my local BTC group know about it (they had no idea) and when the new facebook option came out, I sent out 5 invites which all but 1 were collected.  Great idea.

I can see $1000 again in the next year, $5000 in the next 5 years.  Assuming that it replaces existing fiat entirely then it will need to cover something like 12 trillion USD.  That means you are looking at over $500,000 per bitcoin.  And that is just currency in circulation.
Or, it could crash and burn and be worth nothing.

Get a Trezor.  Store the seed (24 easy words) somewhere/somehow that no one would know about.  It isn't that hard to figure out a way to hide a secret message.  Even some simple book cipher would work.  
Create a few different "passwords" for each of the wallets you want to use, these are like "Scruffy", "BananaStand" and "Banjo".
Log into the trezzor site, plug in your trezzor, enter the pin and enter in BananaStand and boom, there is a bitcoin wallet.  Close that wallet and type in Banjo and there is another wallet.  Put say $50 worth in Scruffy, that's your spending money.  Put $20 in Banjo, that is your decoy money.  Put the rest in BananaStand.  That's where you will keep most of your funds.
Someone abducts you and threatens you to reveal your pin?  Fine, give them the pin. 
"Redwing4114, what is your password? We want that sweet sweet bitcoin you are hiding!"
"It's Banjo!"
"Hey, that worked but his account only has $20 in bitcoin in it!"
"Oh well, take his bitcoin and lets get out of here"
Little did they know that there is always money in the BananaStand.

The problem is that while paypal is reversible, bitcoin is not.  You may be able to find some way to automate the purchase of bitcoins from your bank account via that transfer from paypal.  
1. Paypal deposit detected, withdraw request to bank account. 
 A few days later...
2. Bank account deposit detected, initiate purchase of bitcoins from circle/coinbase/whereever.
I wonder if you could do it with IFTTT

I think you can still deposit cash into coinbase for free, then transfer the balance to gdax and place a maker buy order (not market/taker) for free then transfer it out.

I disagree.  You should learn on your own time and apply what you have learned on theirs.  This may not apply if this is your 9-5 job, however as a consultant you must have a solid understanding before you start charging.
Will you learn while you apply your knowledge?  Absolutely.   Just don't charge that much until you can honestly say to yourself "I know what I am doing".

Personally, I would just ask for some cake and coffee.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:47:22
I agree.  You can definitely put a price on your ability to solve a problem.  At least to conceptualize it and figure it out using what you know and some google-fu.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:43:58
Well, you cannot learn on someone else's dime.  Whatever you charge needs to be for the number of hours that an experienced person would charge.  That may be 1-2 hours as stated by others.
You need to think like your customer.  What would they like to see from you and what types of services should you offer.  Now leverage that against the estimated sales increase.  That is what your customers are going to look at.

Um, but someone is paying for your power.  Not cool to cause your parents electric bill to go up because you are mining.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:37:21
Yeah, wait till all the teeth fall out first.... or so I have heard.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:14:46
Problem is that for every $1 you make from mining, a portion of that is spent in electricity.  That's money that he is having to pay out of pocket.  From my moral perspective, it's wrong to mine on someone else's dime.  Now if you are at university, you pay for your room and electric is included.  If you rent an office it may be included as well, but you are essentially stealing from your grandfather.
Now, you can easily figure out the wattage, kWh, etc. of your mining, find out what he pays per kWh and hand him cash.  Or not, totally up to you.

I have what used to be called a signature loan with BoA.  They converted it to a home equity line of credit, although I do not own a home.  It works just like a credit card, but without any transaction fees, a low 6% APR and the same 30 days grace period.
I had the same problem with them.  I paid off the 0% interest for first 15 months BoA visa card on month 14 (around $750) directly from the line of credit.  They declined the payment with no notification.  Thankfully I noticed 2 days before it was due and transferred from line of credit to checking, then checking to pay off visa.

Also the updates to the balance are a little delayed.  I spin, win then as I am spinning again, it finally updates my balance with the prior win.

Other than those things, and my OCD going nuts with the lopsided bigcoin logo spinning it is pretty addictive.

They are correct in saying that mining bitcoin is not profitable on your own machine.  However, it is cool.  Go buy one of the small USB ASIC miners like a gridseed and play with it.  Your cost is going to be around $25 for the hardware.  Plus you will learn alot about the software/hardware side of bitcoin.
Just realize that the added electricity cost from mining will never get paid for at current bitcoin prices.  That being said, you will be an actual bitcoin miner.

I was still on the page when you funded it, saw it go up to 1.1 but each spin that I lost did not change that value from 1.1 until the 3rd spin which I won and then the amount changed to .998.
