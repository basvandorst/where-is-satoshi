Thank you so much, for the donation and the kind words :)   
I was planning on opening some more soon, as I received very little complaints so far!

Thank you so much :D

Monero? Never heard of it before, sounds interesting. Thanks for the lead!
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:40:48
Yep, that too! I'm a system administrator and the technical aspect is pretty intriguing to me. Also, some papers on Bitcoin in relation to real world markets would be cool.

wow, thanks! this is my network of relays  the address is in the info in any of the servers, in the comment section.  
I'd rather not link to the address directly, because I'd rather get donation for a good reason (running the relays) than just because I did a post on Reddit :)  
thanks again!
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:38:15
Will do!
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:20:41
Thanks! I bought one the other day, could be a cool project!  
What's the bandwidth usage?

Thank you so much, and sorry about the typo. In my mind the field was called "Comment" and not "Contact".  
My bad! I'll change the config asap
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:40:54
Will do, thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:49:30
Will do!

Thank you so much! In addition to all the Snowden and Prism talk, I recently discovered the hard way how important privacy is even if you don't consider it your biggest concern. You can bet your ass I'll keep doing this.

@_date: 2015-03-25 23:50:32
Yep, I think that's where the tip came from!
@_date: 2015-03-26 09:22:09
Wow, thank you SO much!
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:04:36
I will. Out of curiosity, what kind of specs do you need to run a BTC node? I might try to run one.  
Thanks, I'll do my best!
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:41:35
Yay! High five for running a relay :) thanks for your work, keep it up!
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:55:27
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:43:07
Thanks, I will!

THE FUTURE! Ahah thank you so much!
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:50:51
Thank YOU mate! :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:45:49
I didn't know about that. What's it about?
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:50:23
Thanks for the links!   
Last questions then I'll stop bugging you: any tips on the state of hardware wallets? I looked around a bit and since I'm kind of a security freak I'd like to have something I can bring with me all the time. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:15:29
Thank you so much for the tip and for the suggestions! Really looking forward to get my hands dirty :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:27:09
Thanks a lot!  
Actually the FAQ is where I started some months ago, but I was talking about something a bit more advanced! I missed though, I'll head over there! 
Thanks for your answer :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:38:47
Thanks. I'll try it and see what comes out of it! :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:40:40
Thanks for everything!

Thank you so much!
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:12:29
It's a nice feeling, isn't it? :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:52:47
Will do, thanks a bunch!
