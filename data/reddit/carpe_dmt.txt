I thought the same thing! It's like the same font 
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:10:40
I may do just this! Thanks for the advice. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:21:55
Nobody will ever see it but him!
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:25:08
Sound advice! Thanks!

Once again, I must posthumously thank you, Hemingway. You suicidal smartass.  If, from this particular pickle, I take away nothing but your advice, my life will still have been immeasurably improved.

Thank you, and thank autocorrect.

Nope! But I like nice round numbers when I'm drunk. Plus, I get tantalized by the prospect of having all my money in a convenient
And secure crypto currency rather than in the bank. When I'm drunk. 
All my money just happened to be pretty close to the price of a bit coin, so It seemed like kismet.

Ah but the guy was smart about it-
He had the private key tattooed onto the inside of his eyelid.

You misunderstand me, sir- the price drop is a problem, indeed, but the real issue is that the balance of this bank account may not be able to cover the cost of coinbase's transaction, since it's about a week away. 
Though you're right, I shouldn't be so concerned about cancelling
The transaction. Despite my vocal support and faith in Bitcoin as a currency, I got nervous about putting all of my purchasing power into this new, fluid format. I'd have preferred to get my boring old US Dollars back rather than enjoy the freedom that BTC provides. After reading the advice in this thread I've decided to try not to spend a cent and  wait for the coins to come, then sell them or spend them or otherwise boost the Bitcoin economy

Thanks for the advice. I'm not sure about chase as a whole, but my account does tend to cover the balance of any transactions that put me in the negative, and as a result I've been hit with some ridiculous overdraft fees in the past. I don't wish to incur them if I don't have to.

Thank you! I'll have to be in touch come Wednesday, depending on whether or not coinbase follows through with the transaction , which is depending on whether or not i can cover it come
Wednesday.

Haha holy shit what are you doing

I don't think I have a backup, and i can't seem to find the recovery phrase, though both were saved at some point I have no idea where. I thought I might be able to get in touch with the folks over at Walletrecoveryservices.com but It sounds like I'm out of luck without the actual wallet file. It's a bit of a bummer.

 I've *got* the private key. It's on blockchain.info. I can see my wallet, I know it's my wallet, it's not going anywhere. I just can't access it without the password/12 word recovery phrase/mnemonic/ fairy magic :C
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:38:25
encyrpted, I think. I'm not so good at this whole thing. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:37:41
I'm in the same boat. Now I'm just watching all of these numbers going up and kicking myself.
