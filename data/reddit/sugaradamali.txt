Thiel is usually always wrong on his big bold predictions 
This is the same guy that has been saying for a decade that the market is gonna crash and implode and we had the biggest bull run in history 
This guy fits right in with crypto 
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:44:43
Yes because the exchanges are so much better at getting money in and out.  Nobody ever has any issues with exchanges.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:50:59
Ok so why did you bring up banks then?
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:10:37
If less than 0.5% of market cap can crush a market, then the market is very heavily manipulated.
I think bots add a lot of inflated and artificial volume

Why would you make your elderly mom do that? Horrible advice for someone at retirement age.
She should be putting money into a fixed income fund/etf and not fucking around in speculative crypto.

Who do you think visa does clawbacks with and clears funds? 3 day confirmation? That was the only reason why I said banks, I thought that was understood.
No one is trying to use a straw argument, it’s just stupid to think bitcoin handles transactions better than visa. 
How does one get a refund with bitcoin?  Refunds are a huge part of daily transactions and visa handles it perfectly.
How does bitcoin handle refunds?

Lol..   who buys “investments” on a credit card?
You can’t buy a house, stock, etf, etc on a credit card.
And the bank has every right to do this, it’s NOT YOUR money, your using the banks on credit.

Sounds legit

Of course he is going to say this, his company is making boatloads of cash from the crypto community.
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:25:31
Holy fuck,,  you are gonna lose it all, plus pay interest.
What did you put up as collateral?
Or is this a payday loan, please god don’t tell me you took out a payday loan at like 25% interest.
This is beyond retarded.
You should have just taken downpayment and invested, and then the money you are know gonna have to use each month to pay interest on the note, you could be instead buying more.
Having a loan for crypto buying just reeks of retardation

You lost me at “Titcombe”

Visa handles like 25 million transactions a second...  bitcoin,,,, not so much

You need to check out their last few ER.
Nvidia has absolutely been helped by the rise of crypto. Probably more so than any other stock

Lehman at least you could find their home office.
And in the end, Lehman Bros had no value, was worthless and disappeared.
But still, they at least had a home office

Yes, but nobody is stupid enough to invest in USD, or any currency
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:27:53
illiquid is a very good word for it.
The bots make phony trades between them to keep volume moving and people talking and give appearance of liquidity but in reality there are a lot fewer actual buyers, and when some dumps a large sum, it cuts thru all the bullshit bots and prices fall as market is too illiquid to handle 
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:05:58
Aaaannnnd, it’s gone
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:37:16
Lmao,,,   Since when are google and Facebook “big banks”..  they dropped them because all the ads where for scam ICOs which fools ate up
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:36:06
You basically set it to buy at 8k and above, since it was already at 8200, it executed order
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:09:08
Lol..  
So basically the honor system is the refund mechanism for bitcoin, I’m sure that will do great in e-commerce.
Explain how merchants are being ripped off and defrauded by using visa, yet bitcoin will solve the defrauding, even though refunds are on the honor system.
And small business owners prefer to be paid with what?  Bitcoin? Visa? Cash?  
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:50:36
I’m sure you can look them up with ease because they are legit companies

Source for your claims?
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:59:05
Not you, different poster, sorry.
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:29:50
Pure cash maybe, but banking will get funds frozen.  Crypto can easily be tracked if you know the addresses to look at but it’s nearly impossible if you don’t 
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:52:06
I have no idea what you are trying to say
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:30:06
This dude is a fucking idiot or con man... and anybody that believes this is a fucking moron.
Market cap of over 4 quadrillion, yeah seems legit...    more money than the entire free world has in 4 years
This is why crypto is clowned on and not taken seriously..   
Someone just makes up random numbers and idiots believe it.
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:18:56
Wtf are you talking about..  who said anything about Saudi or any country?
3rd world Muslims are now ok to use crypto, regardless of country, this will lead to terror funding.
And post your source showing that Saudi has killed more people in recent weeks than extremist terrorists?
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:56:02
And you didn’t post your source to back your claim of saudis killing more people in recent weeks than terrorists.
Please share and spread that knowledge you possess
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:54:49
Not a shill.. just not an idiot to think that bitcoin has non-shit tech compared to other major coins
The tech is shit....  it’s not even close to being superior to other cryptos in term of tech
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:08:08
So name the major coins that bitcoin has better tech than..
How many transactions per seconds?   How many coins does bitcoin best in that?
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:06:54
What generalities?
If you need crypto to be “sanctioned” by your religion before using them, those are the people producing the extremists. 
What nonpracticing or non fundamental Muslim is waiting for crypto to get sanctioned by the religion?
This isn’t a hard concept to understand.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:41:11
Yes, above 8k due to a huge spike from a whale...
Idiots will get excited, buy more after the run up and be holding bags as it dwindles down..
How stupid are you to buy after it’s a fucking straight line up....
Crypto idiots—— buy high, sell low
Anybody that bought today is a complete fucking moron
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:33:53
I’m sure she is going to be better off with that 7k sitting for 14 years in bitcoin and not an index fund

Extreme Muslims terrorists?   Same guys that kill for the Koran and follow it like crazy.
Not saying you are wrong, just that it getting supported will spread the use and it will be a bad thing.
It’s already tough enough to combat these terror groups without crypto hiding their funds/transactions.
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:08:59
You’re welcome

Well what’s the value of 10 million users if it’s not zero?
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:32:38
All the forks are better tech...   bitcoin is old, and has been improved upon..  its like trying to say windows v1.0 isn’t shit tech now and and windows 10 is only an offshoot.
Why is it so hard to admit that bitcoins tech is outdated..
The brand awareness of bitcoin is its most valuable part, not its outdated and improved upon tech.
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:28:24
Name the coins that bitcoin has superior tech to. 
How many transactions per second can bitcoin handle again?
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:32:57
The tech is shit...
Nearly every other major coin has better tech..
And all are worthless
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:36:14
Soros is great for crypto.
He knows how to manipulate millions of idiots, and now he can manipulate them to buy crypto 
Hodlers need new buyers or else their investment is worthless, now George can provide the new idiot buyers
Win/win for everyone
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:51:03
If you think it’s great that crypto is now supported by the community with the highest terror rates is a good thing, good for you.
And this isn’t racism, there are plenty of Muslims all around the world that aren’t terrorists, but the ones that would actually take religious support for crypto seriously are probably the same ones following the Koran to a T, killing innocent people.
Only hardcore Muslims would care if crypto was allowed or not, and that is the same group that produces the most terrorists.
