Who's to say OP didn't also put money away for more "intelligent investing", as you so stupidly call it. 
People like you aggravate the hell out of me. You would rather shit on any progress someone has made than to actually provide alternatives. How is the gaming PC overpriced? How is Bitcoin a bubble? What is your "intelligent investing" (I keep putting that in quotes because you don't seem to understand what it means)?
All it takes is someone going through your comments to see the problem with your kind of people.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:00:29
Except they aren't corrupt. But good day, continue to be misinformed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:22
They had just enough time to make 13k ones 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:24
You keep coming back to postulate about how you see this better than I do. Yet provide no proof. Go to bed, kid.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:17
If you still know where it is, offer someone a reward to get inside. Just make sure to get a binding contract. And make sure to get their personal information so you can track them down/send police their way if they transfer the bitcoins without your approval.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:01:45
I hate you for this because now I can't unsee it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:30:59
Says the kid who has not made a single valid point/argument this entire time. Keep it up buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:33:45
And yet you still reply lol. This is beautiful to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:59
I'm not going to lie, I was very relieved then. Especially if you listen to the rest of his answers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:30:05
Off to watch now, thanks for the resource.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:09
It just went up in order of thousands. More than 60% if I'm not mistaken, and then slammed back to $15k. Please explain how this isn't one of the most highly volatile times of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:21
Pathetic. I'm more than happy to keep this thread going and show people your level of immaturity to the point you can't answer a simple question.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:57:25
Very well could. That's why shorting is used. Hedging your bets.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:23:20
"Invest: expend money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into financial schemes, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial venture."
That's what you get when Google it. An investment is merely using a tool to gain a profit. In this case, I am profiting off a declining price. Then when I buy back in, I profit off a rising price.
So if I sold half my Bitcoin, shorted some more, but kept other Bitcoin, I'm suddenly not an investor because my focus isn't 100% long-term? Jesus christ kid, move out of the basement. Go live in the real world.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:10:52
And yet you still come back. How will Bitcoin crash me, as I am an investor here as well? Not to mention a believer in the technology/what it can do in terms of financial freedom for more people.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:47
Oh I'm sorry, didn't realize I was speaking with a psychic.
You need to go learn what shorting means and how it can be used to hedge your bets.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:07:10
Stabilization is achieved through volume of trade. When you have $100b of trade happening rather than $10b, a $1m trade won't affect the price the same way. That's as simple as I can make it for you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:41
Thank you, I could not keep the two dates straight.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:48:05
I know what I'm about to say because I have friends in the local wealth management industry.
There are a large portion of doctors in town (as in paid in mid-six-figures) who live paycheck to paycheck. Like this one specific doctor I'm thinking of. He kept living outside his means. Apparently there were budgetary cutbacks and his salary got hit hard. He lives like a pauper now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:21
That's one of the days, yes I am aware.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:19:46
You refuse to go away, while adding no value to the topic or conversation. Yet again I say, fucking edgelords.
I never said futures will do that, I said Bitcoin will. But since you're woefully ill-informed on what futures do for Bitcoin in the long term, let me educate you:
The amount of money about to flood Bitcoin is something you can't comprehend. And that's good. The sheer volume of dollars into it will make a market that can't swing so hard in either direction. Bitcoin desperately needs stable gains. Then you can get it, as well as other cryptocurrencies, accepted more readily by merchants. 
Now, more people are free to make purchases without the government interfering.
Explain to me how that's a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:56:08
Explain to me how those exchanges are corrupt. Or that the methods used are corrupt. I'm awaiting your answer.
Fucking edgelords, losing my patience with your kind.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:37
They very well could, hence the concern.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:34:14
Anyone with half a brain stopped reading pretty quickly haha. But let's address your half-assed attempt to "win".
* 1) Shorting does not keep Bitcoin from winning. Research and understand what shorting does. I'm taking a short-term profit before buying back in at a lower price. Multiple revenue streams.
* 2) What intention of mine am I hiding? I've provided you virtually every step to repeat exactly what I am doing. Also, why the fuck would I care to hide anything from you?
* 3) The fact that you say "you failed to defeat me in your first attempt" has me thinking you watch way too much anime. But to answer what you said, futures are investing. I don't understand how you have such a hard time grasping that fact.
* 4) Yet again, I am on the side of Bitcoin. I want this to succeed. Are you still not getting that? 
* 5) You still failed to explain to me how a more stable market that promotes trading is a bad thing. That stable market means more will adopt it. So the believers in it can trade in it. Again, I tell you to explain how that is bad.
EDIT: Changed formatting.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:24:01
Sadly, you can't quite grasp that I'm not trying to "win" anything. I already won. When did I say there was no speculation?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:36:31
I have absolutely zero idea. This market is already acting wildly counterintuitively.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:45:54
Removing my down vote from your comment. Bitmex is not an exchange of nearly the same caliber as the CME though. Really recommend learning about what they do.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:18
That is an unknown. It could go up due to the bigger spread of the name/awareness. It could go down now that institutions want to push the price down to profit from a short position.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:58:38
I've got a bigger question for you.
How does someone so inexperienced as to ask reddit whether to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum happen to know such a big whale that they could have enough liquid capital to buy/sell Bitcoin on that scale?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:44
No it isn't. Your comment just proved how little you know about investing in general.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:55
Not a bad way to do things haha
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:36:51
Shorting, or purchasing futures contracts, are by definition speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:16:49
Let's keep this going. How much have you lost to trading fees?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:46
December 10th and 18th are when two of the world's largest exchanges add Bitcoin to their shortable positions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:42:37
Still watching. Fantastic resource. A fan of how he answered the question. His point about volume helping stabilize the Bitcoin is spot on.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:27:14
Some of the largest exchanges in the world for shorting are adding it to their current repertoire. Terrible wording I know, but that's the best I can come up with on such short notice (wink wink).
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:33:36
Thank you for this. God, I am so tired of people acting as though Ripple is the devil because it's "too centralized". It was never supposed to be used by people who want a decentralized payment method. Like you said, it was created for banks. It's a very valuable tool, I'm looking forward to trading some of my holdings for it. Even if I missed the train haha.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:36:33
You can't seriously believe that was due to panic, can you? Like you can't be that stupid..
That was people realizing that they could ride the wave of BCH and then jump off back into BTC. Friend of mine who uses GDAX (and had to have sacrificed a virgin or two for the luck he had) dumped all into BCH, sold somewhere before the peak, then bought back in. Essentially almost doubled his BTC holdings.
Jesus, stay in school kids.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:56
Yes, so long as they don't add it. The two are not connected
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:43:31
Truly living up to your username.
@_date: 2019-11-02 12:02:21
You can’t even do the math right for the lottery ticket purchases. But yeah sure, correctly predicting an asset will go up thousands of dollars can make you a lot of money. 
Who knew?
@_date: 2019-11-02 04:41:09
Thank you for this, OP is kind of crazy. Was just arguing with someone recently because they said that buying stocks was stupid when you could get better returns from Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:54:42
Man posts like this might be the last straw for me leaving this sub.
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:52:33
That’s genuinely not a good thing. It’s an issue in a lot of areas, including investing in traditional assets like stocks.
@_date: 2019-10-20 14:50:32
Can everyone in this sub stop calling it Dollar Cost Averaging? That’s wrong. It’s continuous (or automated) investing. Dollar cost averaging is when you have a lump sum that you split into smaller payments. And even that hasn’t been found to be as effective as lump sum investing. 
Continuous automated investing is what is done by a large portion of small investors in crypto. They don’t have $10,000 to drop at once, they have to piecemeal it as they have spare money.
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:34:37
Jesus I hope you’re kidding
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:51:12
It’s a fucking meme, buddy.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:19:01
Look up the property tax in the area you’re looking at. They’re listed online, though some old-timey county websites take some digging. But the U. S. Average is 1.08%. So every $100k of home value equals $1,080/year in property tax. Roughly $90/month
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:35:21
So you need to go research what a time horizon is. Yeah, returns of 7-10% annually are great. But what if they don’t have time to ride out the market’s volatility? They could only do medium risk investments at absolute best with a time horizon of 10 years. If it’s that easy to get $100,000, why don’t you go do it?
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:21:23
Ahh yes because your standard young adult has $100,000 laying around.
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:44:43
I imagine it will. I first started investing in individual stocks as a freshman in college. My choice did well, then basically went to $0. I was checking the price every few minutes! Now, I watch my 401k plummet and I get excited because that means I buy in cheaper haha
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:39:34
Also gets them prepared for volatile markets lol. Imagine putting a quarter in your piggy bank and then the screen tells you it’s worth $.20 or $.30
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:20:35
Truly. We live in a society. Gamers, we should rise up.
@_date: 2019-10-28 23:09:00
Mortgage rates are at some of their absolute lowest?? They’re certainly down from last year’s. And rising housing prices are a short term issue. I work in construction, so I can see that the industry is snapping up a lot of property for single family and multi family homes. Not to mention the rising prices are likely due for a correction considering how over-debt-burdened the public is. 
All of this still ignores the basic premise that young adults have nowhere near $100,000. If they’re paying rent while saving, they’re going to need a middle class income to get that $100,000 anytime in the next decade. And again, this ignores that having equity is much better than renting, even if the two cost the exact same. But at $100,000, monthly payments (including mortgage, tax, and insurance) are just under $950/month. Considering my 3bed apartment (in a very cheap housing city) costs about $1300/month, a mortgage would be a massive win.
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:15:44
Are you talking about Bitcoin? Please tell me you’re not...
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:39:02
1) it isn’t about returns. I feel like you didn’t follow my instructions on researching time horizon. 
2) your returns are based on commercialization of bitcoin instead of its inherent value increasing because of technological and economic applications. We’re still struggling to get it accepted mainstream. Your focus on price points instead of use case is yet another thing holding Bitcoin back from widespread use. Disgusting and greedy. 
3) you think most young adults have 2 or 3 grand lying around? What, did mommy and daddy give you money for getting A’s or something? If young adults have any money invested, I’d wager that it’s in tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s or IRAs. Neither of which have many options for “investing” in bitcoin. 
4) your premise is that bitcoin will always rise. I think it’s a fantastic invention, but where’s that $100k coin? Didn’t all you “experts” (loose term for someone who just jerks off to candlestick charts) say that would be here by now?
5) what happens when the value of their investment crashes right before they go to buy a house? Guess they gotta get back to saving up for that house again. There goes another decade or two of paying rent instead of building equity. There goes another house’s worth. 
Fucking idiot. I’m done with you. “Drama queen”? No dumbass, I’m just someone who learned their shit and isn’t stupid enough to “invest” all liquid assets into something that might crash back down to $5k. I know you see yourself as some hotshot gambler/investor, but you’re not. You’re someone who got lucky and thinks that somehow translates to expertise. Blocking you and I hope you soon get banned from r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:22:03
So you recommend that instead of building equity in a home, the young adult in this scenario should invest heavily in the single most speculative and volatile asset I’ve ever seen... wow. Please never give anyone financial advice. You’re a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:22:23
An old adult with equity instead of having paid rent. Not to mention that a mortgage is always going to be cheaper than rent unless in exceptionally inflationary markets. And assuming that young adult experiences typical gains in housing, their home value has kept pace with inflation.
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:40:12
Yes, but one is driven by speculation of future use. The other is driven by ownership in a company with assets and liabilities that can be looked at to determine current value. I’m all about Bitcoin, and I’m loving when people implement it. But to act like shoveling money at it somehow secures its future does its value and its potential a disservice. It’s not a money making machine.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:53:57
I am not talking about gold? Gold is also speculation.
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:15:12
Yeah, a conservative estimate for stock returns is that your money doubles every 10 years. So with both starting at $100, 20 years later stocks would be $400 and gold at $500. That’s pretty good
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:34:01
Damn it, you’re right haha. Don’t know how I got that mixed up. It doesn’t even sound like “bøkmal” when you say it out loud
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:44:18
You read Bøkmal?
