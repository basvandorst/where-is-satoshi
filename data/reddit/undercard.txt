Yea I know they are not directly connected. I'm just trying to understand the NSA's envolvment in creating the version of encryption that bitcoin depends on. The NSA loves to put back doors in everything so why wouldn't they put a backdoor in SHA256 and lie about it. If it came down to it could bitcoins code be modified to change the encryption if needed?

Black Coin is dependent upon Cryptsy? I thought the whole point was decentralization.

Well from the comments below SHA-2 technically is SHA256 which the  NSA did in fact help create. I'm not here to spread FUD. I do support quark because security and speed but I have a real concern about this and I'm sure others would as well. I'm not trying to bring down Bitcoin. I think this is something worth looking at and people are brushing it under the rug. 
Edit:If I was trying to spread fear in bitcoin, I would have created an alternative account to hide the fact I support quark.

Corrupt parts of government and big banks are the biggest hypocrites I have ever seen. They run the majority of the drugs into the country so they can control population and fill the prisons. They love shutting down competition and pretending they have the moral high ground though.

I'm going to have to take a cryptography class to understand this a little more. I was trying to learn about SHA256 and I saw it branched off from SHA-2 which was apparently created by the NSA. I thought it was alarming especially since no one really knows who Satoshi really is. Maybe I'm just being a little paranoid. Haha.

Well personally thought one if the greatest features about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was the anonymity in a completely monitored world. But if Bitcoin is this going to be that traceable I guess anonymity shouldn't be a talking point for cryptos.

Nice design! I am also trying to get into GUI design for crypto wallets. I'm currently working on one for Quark.

Zuckerberg calls his users dumb f*cks for trusting him with FB user data. To me this sounds like a great way to link your CIA profile with your wallet address.

So your saying to reinstall the old software to access and export the passphrase into electrum? I do have the old exe. Ive seen other threads saying to export the private keys but i just dont understand what that means. Currently looking into that now.

I dont think they could have forged the dates the files were created or could they? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:44:53
So i gave it a shot. I dont think I encrypted my wallet back then but i could be wrong. I just keep getting this error. 
Error: running with an unencrypted wallet, but walletpassphrase was called. (code -15)

BTC38's servers were unable to handle quarks volume. This caused a lot of people to bail. If BTC38 decides to expand to adopt quark, expect to see a hard comeback. Until then you will see quark continue to drop. But as for it being a scam. I find that highly unlikely. It would hurt the entire Cryptocurrency  community. And as for you people claiming it's a scam. There are a lot of newbies that hopped on board with quark do to Max and Bill. But don't exploit that. Your claiming it's a scam so people sell quark and put money into your own coin.
