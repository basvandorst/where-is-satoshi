Really what this pattern predicts is that the price will continue going from left to right for the near future.

The idea of a global "blue wave" due to QE and interest rate policy is so tone deaf. 
Average voters don't know or care about these concepts, average voters care about "lower my taxes" and "protect the middle class", any more in depth financial policy makes them feel like someone is pulling one over on them.

What is the point of this post?
Coinbase gives you an extremely easy way to buy bitcoins. 
Unless you're talking about daytrading. But I don't think the "mass that you want to buy Bitcoin" is interested in daytrading. Coinbase lets you buy 10BTC/day (50 if you jump through a few hoops), which is far more than the average person will ever need.
How hard is it to do? Set up an account, type in the amount you want, and click "buy". No more difficult than buying something on Amazon or Ebay or whatever.

Just look for april's posts. Bitcoin was already popular enough back then that the sub was pretty active.
There's a bunch of "It's not over guys! Bitcoin is still valuable, trust me!" posts.

Yup. I crystallized some profit this morning but this "slow" increase of $20-$30/BTC over the past 12 hours with almost no volatility (compared to the last 3d) has me worried that I'm either:
Losing opportunity cost of a long term bull market 
Psyching myself up to buy based on the above when we could easily be in an overvalued market ready to correct a couple hundred pts. at any time.
Feeling bearish until I see the volatility drop to trade within a few $/day or another correction sobers up the speculators trying to ride Monday's bubble and test the top.

[Here]( is how it looks on bitcoinwisdom.
It's a bit hard to decipher on that website, the wall/order book is a lot smaller than most sites. If you look at my picture the piece in light blue is the wall visualization, it represents the **current** resistance to price movements. The more horizontal the line, the more resistance the price has to movement in that direction.
If you look at the yellow portion it shows the order book, which is nice and easy to read. On the left is current orders listed at price | BTC.
In this instance, there are 22.911 BTC @ $721USD/BTC. This means people need to buy 22.911 BTC to move the price up to the next order. On the right is sort of a condensed version which shows a more aggregate view of the walls. (buying 1000BTC will put the price between 760-765, selling 1000BTC will put the price below 680)
When someone places a huge "wall" the order book looks more like [mt.gox looks like right about now](
See how the green line goes straight to the right? It means people have to purchase a large amount of BTC to move the price even a little. If you look up to the right it shows the order book, which shows someone dumped a 1000BTC sell order  This means people have to buy 1000BTC to move the price past $699, whereas selling 1000BTC will drop the price down to between $655-$660.
**It should be noted that these walls don't give an accurate depiction of what the price will do. They only show the *current* resistance to price movement. People are constantly moving their buy/sell orders around to respond to the price movements so these walls only really represent what would happen if X amount of BTC was transacted this instant.**
Something you'll see with BTC on large price swings (like the last couple of days) is a whale/tuna/big fish like that 1000BTC guy putting up an artificial wall to help push the price in one direction. As the price moves down, the downward resistance will raise and the buy pressure will also raise which is when this guy will stop putting up his 1000BTC sell wall and probably buy a bunch of 'cheap coins', bouncing the price temporarily upwards until the upward resistance/sell pressure gets too great and the price starts to slump again.

I've been hearing "Moore's law is coming to a halt" for ~15 years now...

buy part of a coin if you think it's going to go up.

Well I don't think there's a 'perfect hedge' in this instance, because the value of BTC isn't binary as is the outcome of the bet.
However, He could have guaranteed &gt;$0 profit by buying 2BTC at the time.
I don't know what the price was but it was somewhere in the $50-200 range. So even worse case scenario he drops $400, their value drops to 0 and he nets $600 from the bet. Another scenario (assuming he closes his position as soon as they hit $1k and doesn't hold), he loses the bet and nets $1k from the sale of 2BTC. Best case scenario, they hit $999 and stay there until Jan 1, he closes out and nets $2998 from the bet + sales.
(actually losing the bet would net $600 as well it seems and the final scenario would net 2598. Forgot to subtract the 400 both times)

I see what csiz is trying to say and I think he is more technically correct than you.
Look at it as a binary option:
A) His friend made this bet, then put $1k on bitcoins
B) His friend made this bet, and hoped to win it outright, putting $0 on bitcoins
If his friend did A) then the worst case scenario is he gains/loses $0. We see the risk as 0 because his $1000 bet on bitcoin would have been insured by this bet. However, in the instance that bitcoin went to $0, the friend would have still effectively 'lost' the $1000 profit he made by taking the bet in the first place. His friend might have considered this course of action, but being bearish on bitcoin he would have considered it throwing away his free $1k winnings.
It all comes down to % chances of outcomes. Option A might have had enormous upside potential but if his friend felt it only had a 0.00001% of occuring, his EV from the bet would have been higher going with option B

Well first thing you should know is is irrationally bullish (positive) about the future $/bitcoin. Many people will tell you to just buy up (Here and there or all at once) then forget about it for a couple years and you'll be rich!
But I'm going to tell you something a bit different. You should wait. Wait a month or two. Watch what happens to bitcoin between now and then. It's very possible we're testing a new plateau and it will not go outside $700-900 for the next two months, and its also possible that it will double or half in that time.
The volatility is too high to buy in right now. This could be the top or near the top of a bubble waiting to pop. Even the past couple of days it seems (to me) the exchanges are struggling to justify the current prices. Some people say its because there's no new money in the exchanges because weekend woes, who knows?
Winklevoss brothers have come out and said it could grow to ~$400B market cap, which is ~50x where we are now, but what are the chances of that and how long would it take?
Bitcoin has shown that, over time, its value positively correlates with demand. Where do you think Bitcoin will be in 1yr.? 2months? When do you want to "cash out"? Look up the market cap and do some math on your own. If there's a 1% chance that it grows to have a market cap 50 times bigger than now, what's the expected value of each $ you put into bitcoin today?
Wait on throwing your hard earned dosh down, in the meantime read up on bitcoin, how it works, what problems it solves, and decide ultimately where you think it's going in the long term and whether it's worth an investment.
