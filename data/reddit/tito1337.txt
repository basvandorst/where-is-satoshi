Aaaaand the office space is priced in EUROS. WTF?

Waw, what a bunch of pretty words. If it sounds like bullshit, smells like bullshit... Probably is genius :D
More seriously, reading this is rebarbating. We need a simple functionality example, or even better : screenshots !

Yeah but they only consider bitcoin as a transaction intermediate. Not like the awesome real money it is.
How can they encourage bitcoin based business by using prices fixed in another currency?
Or, more importantly, encourage a bitcoin economy withouth being part of it?
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:13:48
Probably a Ponzi scheme...

Doesn't SR allow sellers to put a price in USD and thus the BTC price varies with the exchange rate? If so, SR has nearly no impact

More interestingly, why in USD when we have coins?!

I withdraw my BTC from Gox yesterday and it did that shit too (giving an inexistant transaction ID)
The BTC showed up 1 hour later, no worries

Is there any plan to develop such a network?
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:43:34
Yes, just override it, I just did the same ;-)

I'm going for Bitcoin-24.com, I prefer to trade in euros anyway.
I discovered their website an hour ago and I'm very pleased with it. Very userfriendly ! Plus they have SEPA withdraws and deposit for a very small fee (1.24€).
Definitely my new trading platform.

"You must tip at least $0.10 USD (฿0.00084545 BTC)." Well F-U too, Bitcoinbot!

I think those are manual exception from them trying to resolve some issues (like triple trading)

IMO lag is created artificially so MtGox-guys can cheat (if they have orders priority)

100 spins! It's crazy how I have more satoshis now than I had before. But I guess I had 49% chances of that happening :D
I love the penguins and the game is really addicting and easy to play. I found that there is a tiny little lag at the end when you already want to reclick the Spin button but can't. It would be fun to have a "Spin 10 times" button or something like that also.

I think that SEPA has a maximum of 24 hours transit time :/

The designed-for-that-purpose ring. It's not too expensive either.

How many hashes per second do you get out of your ATI laptop card?

Here is their mining address :  You will easily find the dividend transactions from there.
I don't know what are those +50 BTC transactions, maybe payments from BTCguild.

They actually cite the chip used : NXP NTAG203. You can find on eBay the exact model they used in that clear prototype picture.
It has 137 bytes of user-writable memory. You could store a 130 characters message or URL on it. Plus the Unique ID can be used for identification purposes or as any NFC tag.
It's sad though that this chip doesn't have any cryptography. Anybody with 10 seconds access to your ring could clone it.
@_date: 2013-07-31 22:58:24
They could do that on purpose to gain propagation speed. But if you look a bit more you'll see that it's Slush's pool that mined that block and they don't usually do that.
The real explanation? The previous block was mined 20 seconds earlier! They got lucky.

I was one of the first to withdraw when they announced the 12-hour cooldown. Maybe they have too many withdraw request now.
I think they keep most of their bitcoins offline so it could take some time to execute all requests.

I did 3 no-fee transactions last week. One got confirmed right away (6 minutes), the longest took 4 hours

Oh and the 5x and 10x don't work, I don't understand why
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:55:17
They have many IBAN numbers, presumably for each currency they accept :
* EUR : DE94290400900322935800
* USD : PL95109011150000000120219096
* PLN : PL67109011150000000120219018
* GBP : PL63109011150000000120219090
I don't know if they changed them recently. Maybe your money will show up in a couple of days. Or you can contest the wire via your bank.

After you buy some shares through btct.co, I think it's possible to get them out and become a real share-holder with voting rights.
