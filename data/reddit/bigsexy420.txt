"Fair" is subjective, you may not find it fair to have "your" bitcoins split with others who lost, but they don't find it fair that "their" bitcoins were stolen and not yours.

Only if you care about looks, the most important part isn't the interface its making sure that everything works in the background.
You can slap a new coat of paint on the car and a slamming stereo, but if the engine block is cracked and the gas tank leaks you're going no where.
Without the technical backend the pretty interface is just that, pretty.

Yeah your missing just about everything, Segwit is in Bitcoin Core, has been for almost a year now. The Segwit upgrade has been active on the Bitcoin Network since August 1st. Right now you can manually create a segwit transaction in bitcoin core if you wanted to. The only thing missing from Bitcoin Core inreguards to Segwit is the pretty interface. 
None of these companies use the Bitcoin Core interface, they all use the bitcoind (core bitcoin daemon), which includes Segwit, and write their own pretty interface on top of that. So if they are all writing their own interface and won't be using Bitcoin Core's interface why do they need to wait on Core to develop and interface? Core users can already receive funds to a segwit address, Coinbase simply has to give them an interface with witch they can interact.

While I agree that it takes too long for transactions to go through, the high ass fees, are 100% BitPay. I tried to buy PubG when BTC was around $10K. $29.99 for the game, or around 320K, when I scanned the code somehow I didn't have enough even with 360K sats in my wallet. 
When I checked the fee, 32,000 sat fee. I noped the fuck outta there and paid with a Credit Card, I'd rather pay with that then send the transaction from my segwit wallet(~100 sat fee) and give BitPay any part of that transaction.

People have an issue because of how Coinbase is handling this, they have always been supporters of bigger blocks and onchain scaling, which most everyone is fine with, to each their own. Now Coinbase has out of the blue and with possible insider trading added a coin(BCH) that they support, while at the same time delaying an upgrade(segwit) to the existing version(BTC) due to "lack of customer demand".

Core has added Segwit, they haven't added a UX for Segwit to the core wallet. There are plenty of other exchanges, wallets, and services that all utilize Segwit perfectly fine without that UX. At this point if Coinbase has not added Segwit they have chosen not to add Segwit.

I use maple syrup is quite a few of my sauces and rubs. Never as a base but it adds an amazing flavor if used properly. It also works wonders to negate an over spiced rub for those with heartburn issues.
Worcheshier sauce, maple syrup, and Montreal steak seasoning makes for a quick and easy rub for just about any BBQ meat. Toss it in a ziploc over night with some sliced up purple onions and you've got the makings of an amazing meal. Toss the steaks on the BBQ, caramelize the onions, and serve up with a nice baked potato and you're eating like a king.

This is why I always recommend looking at the actual data instead of the article. 
[Labor Board](
This data only accounts for Federal minimum wage ($7.25/hr), so states like California ($11.00/hr) and Washington ($12.00/hr) don't show nearly as many at minimum wage workers, which is technically true. All their minimum wage workers are making almost twice what Texas workers are, and yet the Texan can afford a 2 bedroom house, while the Californian shares a studio with 6 other people.
You can see this data reflected in Table 3 which lists the Percentage of Workers at Minimum Wage for California, Washington, and Texas at 2.9%, 0.8%, and 18% respectively.
While I am surprised the number of minimum wage workers is much lower than I was expecting, I would love to see a data set that includes state minimum wage and see how the data differs. Though I expect that it will show the number of people earning minimum wage to be much higher than what Forbes would have you believe.

Yes you could do that, except that the primary chains determined by the majority of miners, not by which is longer, so yeah you could go offline, wait for the difficulty to drop low enough you could mine the entire rest of the block chain in 24 he's and upload that. Then watch as the majority of miners laughs at your chain and you sit there with 21 million coins worth less than the hardware you.kined them on. You entire theory requires you to be the only person in existence.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:28:34
Sure if you were the only person in the world mining, but since everyone is doing that now you'll have a hard time mining on ur cellphone. I suggest you look into how the EDA works.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:42:33
It could be 1000000000x higher than btc and it wouldn't matter because 40% of the miners will bail and in 12 hrs it will be reduced to compensate for the loss if miners
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:30:39
No one is going to line it hence why EDA kicks in. When 40% of the mining power LEAVES then EDA is invoked and the difficulty drops. If the diifculty changes to 1000000000x BTC the miners will leave and the block won't get mined. 12hrs later EDA kicks in and now the diifculty is less than BTC.

No not really. I tried to transfer almost a full bitcoin at 8 am on Friday with a $6.50 fee and it still 24 he's before I got my first confirmation. I didn't want to send a non segwit transaction but after 45 min of reading through the documentation I still wasn't sure how to manually create a segwit transaction and send it to the mempool. I'm sure I could have figured it out and with a couple hrs of testing gotten it down pat, but I didn't have time then and I'm sure most people won't ever have the time.
Just because a couple of technical people have sent transactions doesn't mean we're not still months out from segwit adoption.

Compared to the value of BTC they can take, yes. Hackers steal the CC list and do what? Sell them individually to the limited number of buyers online for ~ $15/US CC or ~$30/EU CC? Sell them in bulk at a discounted rate? Or they can take the BTC, spend it, sell it on over seas exchanges, or localbitcoin while minimizing their risk.

They replace your money through a 3rd party insurance, only if the bank is robbed AND fails will the FDIC step in. 
From the [FDIC Website](






Its possible someone could make a case with the EFTA, but I haven't done enough research to know how that works, but the FDIC would not be involved.
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:15:34
Actually your mistaken, the FDIC does not protect against stolen money i.e. bank robbery, or hacked account. Only if the bank makes a long series of bad investments, goes belly up, and has to declare bankruptcy or has managed to fail in some other way.
[ History)
The FDIC insures member banks and savings institutions and the following items:
*All types of savings and checking deposits including NOW accounts Christmas clubs and time deposits.
*All types of checks, including cashier's checks, officer's checks, expense checks, loan disbursements, and any other money orders or negotiable instruments drawn on member institutions.
*Certified checks, letters of credit and travelers checks when issued in exchange for cash or a charge against a deposit account.
The FDIC does not insure:
*Investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds (see why), municipal bonds or other securities
*Life insurance products even if purchased at an insured bank
*Treasury bills (T-bills), bonds or notes
*Safe deposit boxes
*Losses by theft (although stolen funds may be covered by the bank's hazard and casualty insurance)
The FDIC doesn't protect your mothers bank accounts from theft the same way they wont protect BTC from theft. That requires a separate 3rd party insurance which brings us back to the original 2nd and 3rd questions.

Sure people trust the banks because they trust the gov't, and they know that despite how long it takes to get paid back $1 = ~$1. They know that if someone steals $30k from the bank they'll get $30k back. Thats not the issue here, the issue is what happens when someone loses $30k(2 BTC) and 2 years later they get $5k(2 BTC), or the flip side they lose $5k(2 BTC), and get back $5k(0.5 BTC).
Both scenarios would pay back the customer in full, while saving the company potentially Trillions.

This idea is going to be seriously challenged when Fidelity/Bakkt/&lt;Insert Custodial Service&gt; gets hacked.
Finally hackers will have something of direct value to steal instead of just ID info. I'll be very curious to see what happens when they are hacked and the bitcoin network moves on without them.
Couple things to remember:
-BTC is highly volatile
-Insurance investigations take years
So 2 questions now arise:
-What happens after a hack and during the investigation the price of BTC climbs out of the insurance coverage limits? How happy are hedge firms going to be if they buy at 3k, get hacked at 5k, and the insurance investigation concludes at 20k?
-What if BTC goes down after the hack? If the same investor buys BTC at 3k, custodian gets hacked at 5k, and the investigation concludes at 1k? Can the custodial service buy up BTC cheap(er than paying out at 5k) and settle with that?
-What happens when a Senator like Mitch McConnell or Nancy Pelosi is invested and decides they want to try and push a law forcing the BTC network to roll back after the hack?
-What happen Grandma is set to retire in the middle of the insurance investigation? Does she have to put off retirement because of this?
So many people seem to be blindly accepting these custodial services as a good thing, with out even considering any of the downside or the drastic harm they could cause. These services are giong to do as much to educate their users on BTC as current banks do to educate you on economics.
Now before someone says "Oh its Fidelity they know security they wont get hacked" remember since 2013 there have been 17 exchange hacks (2.83 avg/yr). Fidelity, Nasdaq, and NYSE have all been hacked in the last 10 years for nothing more than account information (KYC/AML docs). Why wouldn't someone try and attack them if they could take actual BTC?

Unfortunately no we don't have the ability to build them better, faster, or more efficient. [This is a list of ASIC Vendors in 2014]( most all of them has shut down. When KNC went under in their closing announcement, KnC stated that despite all the money and research they put into it, KnC was unable to figure out how BitMain was able to produce AISC, and remain profitable, unless they were getting free electricity or some other advantage.
