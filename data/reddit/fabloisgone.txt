7.61638 send em to me 
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:55:31
Good response, thank you. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:05:12
I wish I got into bitcoin at age 11
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:53:51
But doesn’t Satoshi have an equal amount of bitcoin? 
What’s the proof bitmain owns that much Bcash? (Not saying you are wrong, just curious). Also, how do we know they don’t have that much Bitcoin, seeing that they have owned a ton of hash power for years now. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:38:48
Yeah but you would need to generate a new transaction for each address to send them all to one when you finally want to cash in your piggy bank?
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:02:50
Could be, I see a head and shoulders karma pattern forming.
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:21:23
Well that’s interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:41:38
Upvoted. Let’s get this to the top
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:51:54
Well one could easily say that this is due to the fact that Bitcoin got the original name while Bitcoin Cash sounds like a knock off 
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:56:52
Because that volume is split between constant buys and sells at the current price point. Bots opening and closing positions, making a few bucks on each trade. This is entirely different than a 8,000 bitcoin sell, which will need an 8,000 bitcoin buy just to keep the price stable.

Let me translate for the other redditors: “I’ve got stolen cash that I need to convert to internet money without using my ID”
@_date: 2019-03-25 01:10:40
Sure, but “I don’t have a valid ID and I need a place to convert cash into crypto” is sketch lmao

Sir I realize you are angry with your purchase, but we don’t accept returns here. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:45:16
Well according to Buffet, Bitcoin is like rat poison. Must be why they are eating USD instead
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:14:58
Amazing what happens when you truly only invest what you are willing to lose. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:14:08
Wow can’t believe all that happens in 24 days. That’s a whole lot of action for 28 days. The debt must be increasing fast to pass bitcoins market cap in just 16 days. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 04:23:32
Didn’t you just say it was a she in a comment above??
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:19:29
Thank you, this answers my question. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:55:46
Oh sick, I must have missed the bitcoin feature that lets me take out a mortgage to buy a house. Send me the tutorial please!
We aren’t there yet man. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:43:33
Lol if bitcoin reaches $100k, bankers will be in a panic trying to stop it. That is if they don’t already own a large portion of it
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:18:35
Well my man, I wish I knew that before
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:39:44
Chinese New Year, Wall Street bonuses, whale inverted squeeze proportional liquidation, USDT tether scandal, bitmains new asics, but most importantly Satoshis shit this morning was in the shape of a cup and handle. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:27:05
Signed and chipped in 
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:38:55
I can attest to this 
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:03:16
Because their victims most likely aren’t crypto savvy. So when they ask for Monero or Zcash they may not even know what the hell they are talking about.

I’m a bitcoin bull for sure, but your logic is poor with this argument. 
Gold cannot be mined without the use of vast amounts of energy. Period. 
Crypto currencies can be “mined”, I.e. distributed/minted and secured without the use of proof of work algorithms.
