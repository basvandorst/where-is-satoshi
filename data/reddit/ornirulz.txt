i'm pretty sure we just saw an epic case of the greed stage
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:17:05

so sorry you'll have to start again

all it says is that mtgox handles millions of dollars of transactions. Mtgox only receives profit from fees of 0.5%

someone has 2058 coins on a sell @ 99.99
thats over $200,000 :O
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:58:53
Can someone please explain how Mtgox can even afford $75 mil?  Like a link to their revenue/profit statements. I know that they profit off fees so... 0.5% / 75 mill = profit. or am i missing something.
