They could test the QC by breaking the bitcoin blockchain.

6k cents you mean

Bitcoin will never run because of bagholders trying to get out

We're planning to write the content on Bitcoin blockchain in OP_RETURN transactions using the BitDB library.We've set the fee structure to support the expenses of this. Content creators will never be censored and deplatformed again :)

well played OP
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:06:36
His bags too heavy
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:12:23
It's simple, you'll lose access to content if you miss a payment.

Spout popular opinion validating a communities beliefs -&gt; get shitloads of upvotes -&gt; get validated into repeating that opinion -&gt; brainwash yourself and everyone with those beliefs and never question
You people are not human, you're NPCs

Solid marketing strategy bro
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:50:12
It actually makes sense, why build a good product, and bother with marketing it when you can just steal a brand and leech off it's reputation and qualities? It's effective marketing. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:02:39
We're building an alternative for Patreon using Bitcoin, stay tuned

My workstation is open at night so I let it run a LN node to feel like I'm not wasting electricity. It's fun watching things go through it.

Sounds like the PnD type of girl
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:49:42
Please re-read the whitepaper, we're planning to store the content on the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:11:17
Good idea! Will look into it soon
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:54:29
What are your suggestions?
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:31:35
It's a constant cycle of feeding hopium for upvotes and upvoting for hopium. People here lost their minds in their sadness of losing money / fear of missing out.

This website launched 2 days after our [ domain was launched, we're in the process of sending a cease and desist letter to them.
