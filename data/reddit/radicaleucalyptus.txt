I was trolling through the movie news this morning for my blog and came across this awesome story.  I already wanted to see *Dope*, and now I guarantee that I will go and see it in theaters - and pay with bitcoin!
Hopefully, if this goes smoothly, it will result in movietickets.com adding permanent bitcoin support!

I mean that you have more security with Bitcoin because your identity is not automatically attached to your transactions.  I agree that there is greater responsibility to take care of your keys, devices,  etc with Bitcoin, but the benefits lay in divorcing your personal information from your purchasing power, and I think that is worth the increase in personal responsibility.

I think I am going to close my MasterCard account.
They make me call them up to do it.  I have never really had the impetus to actually go forward with it (yay inertia!), but I think this might do it.
If they ask me why, I think I will tell them that it is because their stance on Bitcoin is blatant protectionism and ultimately destructive.

Exactly right.  Very important thing to keep in mind.  In fact you wouldn't even need a card - just flip your hardware wallet into credit mode with a button!

I'll help you out a bit by giving you an overview of the process that I have pieced together from a couple of different sources.
First, this is fairly time-consuming, but really only happens when I am legitimately moving a lot of bitcoins out of savings and into something else.  Ultimately, I like the setup because I feel like there are multiple redundant protections.  I like to imagine a virus called, "The Perfect Bitcoin Thief" or PBT, for short:  this virus can read all of your files and the clipboard, plus logs all of your keystrokes and will keep them in any available memory until it has an internet connection.  This is probably paranoia, but it helps me think in a worst-case kind of way.
So, like you, I have armory running a full client on a computer connected to the internet.  On here I have a general-spending wallet which is encrypted.  I don't keep many bitcoins in that wallet, it is mostly for a way to move coins on my PC (like, if I am buying a plane ticket from expedia or something).  The other wallet I have is a Watch Only Savings wallet, so I can't spend from it on the online machine at all.  This "Savings" wallet is backed up with a 3-of-4 fragmented paper backup.  I have the different fragments stored in distinct places (both within my residence and without), as well as encrypted digital backups I have sent friends/family members in case of some weird total loss.
So, to spend from my watch-only wallet, I boot an offline machine into TAILS from a USB stick with nothing else on it.  Then I can create an unsigned transaction with the watch only, transfer to the TAILS machine, sign it, and transfer it back to broadcast.  It all ends up looking like this:
1.  Create Unsigned transaction from watch-only wallet.
2.  Boot up TAILS from a live USB stick.
3.  Use another *virgin* USB stick which **never touches a machine that sees the internet** to load the offline bundle of Armory.  You *can* have a wallet file on this USB, too, but I just rebuild it from my paper fragments, as that reduces the risk.
4.  Sign transactions and move the signed transaction file between the TAILS system and the full Armory system.
5.  Broadcast the transaction from the full Armory computer.
So, how does PBT fair against my setup?
1.  The watch-only wallet with the funds has no private keys on the computer with connection to the internet.  PBT can have this wallet file - it does no good.  
2.  The only system which *ever* sees the fragmented backups (and hence the private keys) is TAILS without an internet connection.  Once I have the wallet, I load up the unsigned transaction, sign it, and eject the USB.  Unless my USB somehow downloads PBT, there's no way in.  TAILS wipes itself clean after every shutdown, so there's nowhere for the private keys to be stored, either.
3.  When connecting the USB with the signed transaction, do so with the Armory computer unconnected to the internet.  Then you can unload the signed transaction file and disconnect the USB, keeping it cleaner.  Be sure to look over your signed transaction before you broadcast it to make sure things are going where you want them too, just in case.
So that's it!  The main point of failure is (admittedly) the fragmented paper backup.  If someone was to steal three of the four fragments, they could reconstruct my wallet from scratch, and start spending those funds.  But, in a situation where one is in my home safe, one is in a security deposit box at a bank, one is at a family member's house, and one is in a file in my file cabinet at work (called something innocuous like "Group B Meeting Minutes, 2004"), I think this is an acceptable amount of risk.  Note:  these are only examples; I didn't just tell the internet where my paper backup fragments are!
If you wanted to make this a little more secure, you could run the 2-of-3 Lockbox into the same kind of system - only signing transactions on an offline TAILS machine.  I think you can do that, anyway.  Not sure.  I hope that helps.  I have been struggling with finding a system that makes me feel at ease, and I think this one is my favorite so far.

This was a very valiant effort for morning news/talk TV.  Important points were made, there was some fogginess on the details (I don't think she really understands where bitcoins come from or what they *are*), but overall this was way better than I had anticipated.
If segments like these cause just 1 in 100 people to give bitcoin a serious investigation, then they deserve praise.

The confirmations happening is what the "miners" do.  It isn't "automatic" - but it is being carried out by the actors on the network, not by you.
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:27:10
Yeah, I only have the fragmented paper backup - I restore the wallet from the paper fragments whenever I make a spend transaction from the cold storage.  You *could* keep a digital version too, but I don't.  I *might* decide to keep a USB with it encrypted - but that introduces a very weak single point (someone steals the USB).  They'd still need to break the encryption, though, so I am not sure.  I do have the fragment files encrypted and in the possession of four individuals who have good data storage practices.  So, if my paper fragments get lost in simultaneous fires, floods, etc, I CAN restore from a digital source, but it takes a number of additional steps (I have to collect the fragments from my buddies, decrypt them, and THEN restore the wallet).
Armory has an option for making fragmented paper backups.  The Armory website has lots of very good tutorials for that kind of thing (and lots more). Be sure to use the SecurePrint option to prevent someone from spying on your printer (or, write the fragment seeds by hand).

Probably all of those things at once.  Some folk will be more savvy, some less.
The article claims that there are some businesses already accepting, and have been even before the announcement of the Bitcoin Bowl.  So, you'd assume that the earlier folk know what they're doing.
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:20:58
Yeah, that is a major early misconception (one which I had, as well).  And you can tell that the gentleman was thinking along those very lines when he asked, "And that's for *one* Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:15:20
There's some good, technical answers here, complete with some nice links, but the ELI5 is this:
Every bitcoin transaction needs to FULLY SPEND the funds in an address.  The amount you "want" to spend goes to the address you wanted, and the remainder is returned as change.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:52:45
You're right there, and the next step is actually just an "Eureka!!!" moment:
You don't remove the incentive!
You want to move house deeds, car titles, AirBnB keys, notarized documents, etc, etc over a blockchain?  Then the "miners" who are securing this chain get transaction fees (in bitcoin).  Alternatively, you could be rewarded with a different cryptocurrency, which may have its own value (either within this particular blockchain, or through exchanging it for bitcoin).
Simple example:  I want a blockchain which allows the movement of car titles.  Whenever someone wants to sell a car and transfer the title, they hop on CarCoin, broadcast the transaction (Title 1:  Owner A --&gt; Owner B, agreed price, etc, etc) to the network.  At set interval, all transactions are placed into the next block, mining happens, and someone wins the race, the blockchain is extended, miner's fees are given to the miners (this could even be in bitcoin!), and CarCoin reward is given to the miner who won the race.  
Maybe CarCoin can be exchanged for bitcoin.  Maybe CarCoin can buy cars outright.  Maybe the transaction fees (in bitcoin) provide enough of an incentive, particularly because this mining would be less difficult than bitcoin mining.

An honest question here:  has this gentleman even read the Satoshi paper? His argument takes the following form:
1.  Bitcoin's value is dependent on the existence of a number of its features, especially the integrity of the "miners".
2.  "Mining" inherently trends towards monopoly.
3.  A mining pool which has become a monopoly nullifies the key features of Bitcoin.
4.  Therefore, Bitcoin is inherently flawed and doomed.
Even granting him that his first two propositions are true (which can be argued, but to Hell with it, I'll be generous and give him those), his conclusion ( and thus  does not follow, because a 51% attack does not create the problem that he thinks it does.
In the Satoshi paper, there is a mention of a 51% attack problem, and it clearly shows how the incentives for the system make it economically infeasible to apply your mining power to a 51% attack - the system is such that applying that power to the network honestly would get you a greater reward.  The only thing that a 51% attack can do is shut down (or delay) the system until the other actors discover what is going on.  Hence, a 51% attack can, at most, maliciously attempt to destroy the functionality of the system - but it would not hinder it for long, *for multiple reasons*.
First, these gigantic mining pools generally contain many individual miners.  Once they realize that them being part of this pool has hampered the system, their incentive for remaining in the pool is gone (they are getting a return of exactly zero - even hashing by hand is better than that!) Second, even if (somehow) this really is one single, gigantic, malevolent actor using all the mining power for evil, all we need to do is alter the Bitcoin protocol enough to make his ASICs obsolete.  Then, all that money was wasted building and maintaining ASICs that are now built for a slightly-different task, and the Blockchain goes back to the longest "good" chain and re-starts, albeit with much less mining power.  But - the wealth (the coins) are still there.
tl;dr - This argument is based on one incorrect assumption:  that a 51% attack can disrupt the Bitcoin network permanently by stealing coins.

How has this gone for you?  Not asking about RoI or anything like that, more about how the process went, whether it was difficult and if so where the sticking points were.  Happy with it?  Would you do it again (for example, if a spouse or sibling wanted to set one up)?

Largely, the differences are cosmetic, I admit.  But Mastercard is explicitly attacking something that I believe in (albeit very poorly), so they have given me a reason.
Ideally, I could bail on all of them (Master, AmEx, and Visa) and relegate my relationship with them to zero or close to zero.  At the moment, it is a step in the right direction to reduce my footprint, so to speak.

As the article suggests, there may be some relationship between having very large gaps in between primes and some cryptographic algorithms, but I seriously doubt that this will affect much in a practical sense.
Different cryptographic systems take advantage of the properties of large prime numbers in different ways (difficulty of factoring the product of two large primes, arithmetic modolo a large prime, etc, etc), but largely these algorithms don't choose the prime numbers to use based off of the gap size between the adjacent primes.  Like, if you wanted to use the first of a twin prime for the modulo arithmetic of RSA - you could (I don't know if you would want to, though - the twin primes are kinda special so many very large ones are well-known, slightly reducing your randomness).
Ultimately, it seems to me that this work is largely academic (and very interesting, don't get me wrong!) but it likely has only slight application to most cryptographic systems.
If someone with a little more background in the nuts-and-bolts of these disciplines (Number Theory and Cryptography) believes that I have missed something critical, I'd love to hear about it, as I am merely an armchair prime number enthusiast.

This seems like a reasonable enough opinion to me.  Credit cards are fine at deferring payment (never mind that they charge a *ridiculous* percentage of the amount for this "service").  And the "market share" of Credit, Cash/Debit, Bitcoin, if you want to call it that makes plain that there is lots of money out there and it is unlikely that Bitcoin will destroy or replace everything.
But, a bitcoin protocol could just as easily delay payment, and probably with less overhead and thus fewer ineffciencies.  I respect where this guy is coming from (different people have different payment needs; there's lots of room for many alternatives), but don't be surprised if Bitcoin is capable of performing the tasks that you figured were only the domain of the established payment systems.

A Few tips:
1.  Don't mine.  Others have linked you to hardware specs and mining calculators, but for the most part the only people who can mine (profitably) are dedicated outfits with cheap electricity, cheap hardware, or both.  In general, as the hashing difficulty increased, it too more and more specific hardware to mine profitably.  So, it went from CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; ASICs pretty quickly.  Now you certainly need ASICs.  If you're a big hardware geek, you might like putting together a mining rig as a hobby, however, so that's up to you.
2.  Do not day trade bitcoin.  It is too easy to lose money there.
3.  Figure out if you like the technology enough to buy some bitcoins for savings, or whether you'd rather just use it to pay for things / experiment.
4.  Educate yourself on good security practices.
5.  **If you do not own the private keys, you do not own the bitcoin**.

Look up the Dutch Tulip bubble.  It was one of the weirdest and clearest examples of a financial bubble in the preindustrial world.  Basically tulip bulbs became huge stores of value until one day it just popped.
First comment is saying Bitcoin is a bubble.  Second person is saying that argument is old and worn out.

Nice article, but this is a little misleading:


Specifically, I take issue with the "least transparent" part of that statement.  Transactions on the blockchain are inherently transparent!  I think what the author is trying to say is that doing these transactions through bitcoin are less noticeable when compared to something like directly trading rubles for dollars or gold or other stores of value.
Is this nitpicking on my account, or is it important to clear up this misconception?
@_date: 2014-12-06 04:02:01

@_date: 2014-10-21 21:29:59
Totally agree.  My go-to "elevator" explanation is this:
1.  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency which is traded through a *network*.  (People understand "peer-to-peer" from Napster, and most have a reasonable concept of a "network").
2.  Just like banks/companies/families have a ledger/transaction balance/checkbook - so does the Bitcoin network.  But, it is public, and everyone in the network has a copy.  (Likewise, people understand a "ledger" - making the jump from a pen-and-paper ledger to a digital, decentralized on is certainly a leap, but you can help facilitate that leap by introducing that concept early)
3.  Mention the "headline" benefits (no 3rd party, personal security, etc.)  (Get 'em excited!)
**Then**, if they are interested, we can talk about the blockchain, mining, SHA256, etc, etc.  But don't load people up with that up front - they'll get scared.
