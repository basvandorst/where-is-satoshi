Your usage of ‘bro’ really sounds too close to home.
Awak seorang warga Malaysia, betul tak?

Nice! How do I as a normal user use LN? Do I need to setup a node or wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:39:04
Hehe, 420. Nice
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:44:49
Use Segwit man! Just sent using 5$ fee and got it confirmed in 30 mins
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:07:29
Ah, so that was the issue. Not some kind of key logger or spying device implemented in the cable itself?
Could that happen?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:12:46
I know that reference 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:36:21
I don’t know where OP is from. But where I live (Malaysia), cows are just like 400$ each.
So that picture is likely possible for 0.6BTC. With a lot of extra money in my opinion to build the fences, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:06
It depends on you. I believe that Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core from the original chain) is the true Bitcoin. 
Some minority thinks Bitcoin Cash is the real one.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:14:32
I recommend alts for mining. I don’t think you will get much profit mining Bitcoin. Correct me if I’m wrong
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:59:47
Bump. What is it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:00:46
Wait for LN my Friend.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:56:55
From Coinbase? Nothing. You will get your coins. But transferring to your personal wallet is not recommended right now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:26:39
I love this speech. The crowd seems a bit quiet though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:24
r/bitcoin is focusing more on the original chain, Bitcoin. Some people call it Bitcoin Core. 
r/btc focuses more on the development of Bitcoin Cash, a hardfork from the original blockchain of Core. It is considered an Altcoin to me.

I’d say from the bulge it was a 100inch increase.

Everyone upvote this!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:19
r/btc existed before Bitcoin Cash was created (or forked from Bitcoin in this case).
That subreddit chose to go to that path.
Hence, the subreddit name maintains. Also some (if not most) believes Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. So that is also a problem that causes this confusion.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:05
I dare you to type Bcash in r/btc. ��

Maybe he/she bought at 19K?
@_date: 2018-10-18 11:39:08
I know right, really puts my mind at ease knowing my Bitcoins are safe. Just waiting for IOTA integration and I’ll be all satisfied.

My room at college doesn’t have internet. Have to go to the lobby room to access the WiFi
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:15:52
What about people like me who bought a lot early january 2018?
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:16:17
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:01:08
Do you have a link? If it doesn’t cost too much maybe I can make one
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:40:21
Is it possible to learn this power?
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:45:43
Don’t worry, he came out gay.
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:16:20
Are they using flash channels for this? Because Iota takes around a minute to confirm transactions right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:34:14
I see your mushroom grew watching the graph, eh?
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:25:48
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:28:55
Oh sweet, I haven’t used IOTA in a while.

Just a bunch of us college HODLers celebrating this historical moment by buying the worst pizza to celebrate the best currency there is. :)
Donations so we can buy more Pizza to celebrate 10K ��: 
Edit: Holy Cow! Thanks for my first gold, Stranger! May god bless you in the nicest pool of medieval Bitcoins!
Edit 2: If you guys are wondering the origin of the Famous Pizza, here it is:

Dude, I read this as Memeland.
I‘m disappointed..

Yeppp. Here is the Famous Transaction:

I believe the upcoming Lightning Network will fix this. I am not sure when it will be implemented though.
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:04:54
*clears throat*
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:14:56
Awwww. Now kiss.
@_date: 2018-11-17 23:22:03
Doesn’t Petrol explode and burn too though?
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:08:04
But once you get the hang of it do not keep BTC in an exchange for long term holding. Keep it in your own wallet.

What‘s a watchtower?
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:44:16
Does Bitcoin Second Layer LN use DAG like IOTA? If not, is it possible to implement in the near future?
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:35:18
Does Shango require my own node? I’m looking for one for iOS too.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:23:02
Me too, I thought the hardfork is in November. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:55:22
I love you, for thinking that way.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:59:48
HODL it. Keep it somewhere secure in a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:38:10
It’s kinda funny seeing your username and beside it saying “Redditor for 5 days”.
No offense though. You did give a great point.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:12:41
That was genius!
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:59:06
I wanna know too OP!
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:02:47
Coinomi works well with Segwit.
Currently no iOS wallets for Lightning though.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:08:33
Lol, but you did good OP. We need more people like you.
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:54:53
Dude! You gotta try an LN transaction with him using eclair.
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:12:23
Tell him you accidentally bought a scam coin and lost all your BTCs.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:05:09
I don‘t get it, sorry. ELI5? Thank youu
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:42:27
Yes, once you see 1 or more confirmations and only then give him the GPU. Do not give the GPU until it is confirmed.
@_date: 2018-04-09 09:32:20
You mean 2018 may?

He tweeted “Wanna buy some Bitcoin?” a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:45:38
At your age having that much money opens up a lot of opportunities. Create a business, etc. love will come eventually ok its own.  Don‘t worry about it too much
