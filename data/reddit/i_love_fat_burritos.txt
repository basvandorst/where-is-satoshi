Pineapple fund said some of his beneficiaries were using these guys - at least that is what I think he wrote.
If you use them please report back.

From what I have read this is correct.  Replace the word blockchain with Database and that is all you have once you remove bitcoin.  He must really like SQL and Oracle too.  LOL.  So much garbage out there.

Why is that?  New guy here and the world is focused on this why is she making statements that indicate it is not a priority?

b/c the fat guy does not know what he is talking about.  He thinks the ETF got rejected. It might, but as of right now it has not.  So, if he does not know that how can I trust a word he says about anything else. Plus at this point it's all just words and ideas on paper.

it's funny b/c it stimulated some discussion and there are folks over there going back and forth now.  a lot of comments.  it's been voted up to the front page.  WTF.  I think some folks think it is a good thing.  I honestly can't tell.  what a frickin twilight zone.

thx.  done.  always wondered what that meant.
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:02:08
that is what i see, but i posted it over there and they upvoted it to the front page.

I agree.  w/o some form of economic incentive all you have is a database.
Can you give any real world applications?  I am super curious how this might look one day.  For example; let's say some corporation or government agency has a real use case for a trustless, decentralized network.  Would they then have to own bitcoin (or other crypto currency) before they could roll out their application?
If that is true how does bitcoin function in this scenario?  How much bitcoin would they need?  Would they just use small amount of satoshis to keep it working?

Thank you.  I wish i really understood how all of this will work in real life outside of a currency or store of value.  I guess that we will have to wait.  I find it interesting that they all like the blockchain, but w/o bitcoins economic incentive the blockchain is simply a database.  There is no need to distribute it b/c nobody will work on it w/o the incentive.  So, they might as well just go buy some SqL or Oracle licenses.
I think if they want to deploy blockchain and have it work in any capacity they are going to need the coins too.  Not necesarily bitcoin, but some economic incentive will have to be there.

Did he though? Seems he said that b/c bitcoin was invented we have blockchain as a bonus.  you can't have one w.o the other. I really want to understand this b/c my understanding is that you can not have a blockchain w/o bitcoin.  w/o bitcoin all you have is a database.
That said, how would some of the examples he provided work?  Do you need to own bitcoin to make his examples work?  Would the us government then have to buy bitcoin to help them with regulate?

i suspect you're right.  it would be interesting to figure out how to use your pass phrase to see the actual key.  maybe somebody else will respond too. thanks !!

dumb question to be sure, but i have to ask it.  if using trezor where are your keys?  Are they hidden by trezor?  I can obviously access my trezor and get addresses to send and receive, but i have yet to ever have to enter my full key.  does that mean i dont have my keys?

take a look at rustynomads comment.  case solved.
