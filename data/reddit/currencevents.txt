The article that I link to says:" If your biggest Japanese client, who also happens to golf with the governor of the Bank of Japan tells you on the golf course that BOJ is planning to raise rates at its next meeting, you could go right ahead and buy as much yen as you like. No one will ever prosecute you for insider trading should your bet pay off. There is no such thing as insider trading in FX; in fact, European economic data, such as German employment figures, are often leaked days before they are officially released."

The thing is is that Namecoin is mined in parallel to btc. If you are mining bitcoin with your unit then it can mine namecoin at the same time. Since that exists it is relatively difficult to mine namecoin. I am not 100% sure about the previous sentence.

You are right; however I am assuming that the price would be $440,000 in today's dollars. So if you want to think in something that you can hold the value steady I could say a Bitcoin would be worth 270 ounces of gold or 4000 barrels of oil.

I think a very important point about the bitcoin community is that many of us use a different definition of inflation and deflation than the mainstream economic community. We use changes in the quantity of money while they use changes in prices. Their definition labels the symptoms rather than the causes.

The AFIP charges increased foreign spending to 35% and extended it to buy dollars
By: Rosalia Costantino rcostantino
The advance payment of Income Tax and Personal Property passes from 20 to 35 percent. Also, the only window that was open retail closed physical access to foreign currency notes to official listing Picture here
The Government decided to increase 20 to 35 % surcharge for credit card purchases in foreign currency and tourism operations . The rate , as an advance of Income Tax or Personal Property , will also apply to purchase physical tickets for travel abroad. So the only window that was open for retailers to access dollar publicly traded $ 6.15 now closed.
The rate applicable to today had been renovated in March when the government expanded from 15% to 20% surcharge for tax obligations. The surcharge was born in 2012 as a way to stem the outflow of foreign exchange, essential to the balance of trade and payment of debt.
The AFIP based the new system on " economic policy decisions ." Thus, the regulations published today argues that " become advisable to extend the use of the fiscal tool ( 35% surcharge ) to the sale of foreign currency for tourism and travel expenses ."
And states: " amend the General Resolution No. 3,450 , in the manner indicated below : a) incorporated as subsection d ) of the first paragraph of Article 1 , the following:" d ) All purchases of foreign currency - notes or travelers checks - for tourism and travel expenses , tax- validation ( 1.5). Also included are transfers abroad for tourism and travel tax subject to validation ( 1.6). " . The amount of perception practiced in that case " must be entered in discriminately "adds the measure.
As for the new value , the Official Gazette slogan: " The amount payable shall be determined as follows: a) Transactions covered under subparagraphs a) , b ) and d ) of the first paragraph of Article 1: Applying the total amount each operation ever , the rate of THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT ( 35 %) b ) Transactions covered by subsection c ) of the first paragraph of Article 1 . Applying on the price - net of taxes of each transaction - ever , the rate of THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT ( 35 % ) . "
According to the latest official figures , card purchases abroad grew 80 % in October compared to 2012. The use of plastic joined last month or $ S616 million against 340 million achieved in the same month last year.
So far in 2013, the figure had climbed to 5.2 billion dollars, while in 2012 reached around u $ s3200 million. If the trend , the annual end card spending between $ u $ s7000 s6500 ou million million.With the application of the mark for foreign exchange transactions , the gap between the official and the free dollar dollar ( today is about 50% ) is dramatically reduced. Considering the price of yesterday and apply now 35% passing card dollar worth 8.36 pesos. With the 20 % surcharge , yesterday traded at 7.39 pesos.
The decision comes amid rumors of a split currency (one dollar for tourism and for other business operations) , in the change of the economic team , following a decision by President Cristina Kirchner to appoint new owners of the Economy Ministry , the Central Bank, the National Bank and the Ministry of Domestic Trade .
Yesterday, the coffers of the Central lost u $ s200 million gold fall in sales and market changes and pierced the wall of the $ s31.000 million. They are at 2006 levels. International banks are already talking about " unsustainable levels " looking for reservations and , in that sense, estimated yesterday that the government would strengthen the stocks , which effectively made ​​now with this measure.
Asked about the possibility of further action in the foreign exchange market , the minister Axel Kicillof assessed on their first day management : "We have reserves that have suffered some cuts but they are consistent and very strong levels , the exchange rate and form part of a comprehensive plan of economic management . " " What we have to do is generate increased dollar supply and demand with respect to see what the usage is given to those dollars , will not do anything to generate sudden changes in the economy ," he reiterated .
The minister added that this time the surcharge to purchases in foreign currency is one of the many " valid measures " to be adopted. "There are many tools and one goal: ensuring predictability is not going to do anything harmful to workers or employers, because this model looking for companies to have good results," he said.
According to the 3550 resolution , the new measures apply today but will be given " a special term , until December 9, 2013 , for institutions authorized to deal in foreign exchange by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA ) adapt their internally in order to comply with the provisions of this general resolution " systems.
Meanwhile, to date, the purchaser of foreign currency "shall make a payment on account of Income Tax or Personal Property Tax as applicable under the tax status of the subject ."

No one definition, quantity, is the cause while the other definition, change in price, is the symptom. That difference is extremely important. Using inflation and deflation as change in price would be like calling any runny nose a cold.
