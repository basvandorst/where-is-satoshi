ARGH! I completely forgot that I had this reddit! :) - I will follow up and respond to users

Does this mean that anyone  an run an exchange??
I'd love to setup a server and issue my own 'currency' but I'd love to do it as a sort of gimic to see how it works in practice - on paper, open transactions looks like it'll take over the world, and turn everyone into ferengis !

I'm going to have to do some background on this - I've never heard of Slush before! But he should thank you for the vote of confidence!
I'm going to look up the Trezor line of devices

I don't think I'm going to play around with any alt coins :)


Well, sort of -- but if a company has a good enough reputation for their product, I'm okay with that.
is an online interface important to you?
Define Online Interface - you mean as in log into someones website? I would really prefer that not to be a thing! What if I'm somewhere with no interweb?


huh!? I think I get what you mean, I want it to be portable, so I'm assuming .... neither. If I pair with a desktop wallet, that means I can only use it with a system that is running my desktop wallet? I don't think I want to be tied down like that, or is that unavoidable?


huh!? Coin control? Are you saying there are solutions without coin control?


I want whatever all the cool kids have!

1. Buy a Trezor-T from [shop.trezor.io](  (see [r/Trezor](
7. BONUS: Enable a passphrase on your Trezor for better security  
I was with you these first seven steps, but


This is a new phrase for me -- can you expand on that please?

DUDE! You lucky and SMART guy!!!!!
Good Move to take a picture of your passphrase! :)
My sister works in wealth management, and one of the first things wealthy people do with windfalls, is attempt to by a property, (either commercial, or residential), and rent it out, to make sure they have a nice stream of residual income. I think the formula they use, is 30% property, 30% investments, and 30% art - the rest is splash cash.
Hey man, I don't know if you got kids, or if your planning any in the near future, but for me, I would get a property, or two, and lock down that residual income
I'm just saying :) Enjoy !

A darnnit .... your right!!

Well, you'll probably get a better return than the same lump sum in a savings account, but it'll make a nice piece of collateral for any future investments..... 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:22:56
I said smart - because he took a picture of his passphrase! - I better go make that clear in the post!
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:20:58
This is what I said earlier today! (or similar vein of thought....) .... go upvote me too! 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:50:53
Well.... yes.... but ..... awww darn it! Why you have to bring reality into the dream for!?!? Huh? I think personally, my guess would be to buy ...... ummmm. Hmmm, I see your point! Well, it's what I've heard, and seeing that I don't have enough money to give to someone for wealth management, then I'm probably misinformed! Darn it [sexyama]( you brought me down with a crash :)

Art, as in paintings, statues, classical pieces, like old rolexes, vintage cars and the like. These things tend to keep going up in value. Basically, if they'll auction it at Sotheby's then... it's worth taking a look at it 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:54:27
Woah ... [ Ummm.... you just partially exploded my brain! But I think .... I think it makes sense! 
That's actually pretty awesome, have an upvote my friend!
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:24:21
I like your thinking ..... take an upvote!
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:55:07
You use any losses to offset tax the following year .....
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:21:56
Is this not the dream of all good hoomans?

A gift you can't use for ten years, isn't really a gift.... is it?!? I think it's called..... AN INVESTMENT

 -- Ummm, where did the site go!? I was just about to weigh in and say give the project a chance, but now I'm a bit scared!
