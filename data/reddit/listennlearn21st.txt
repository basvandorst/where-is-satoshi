They should never have sold.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:27:01

“Not gonna talk about bitcoin anymore” yeah that’s what i thought.

She don’t wanna be labelled as market mover but we all know what her heart is telling her ;)
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:42:14
I guess those who want bitcoin to go $900 are weeping.

@_date: 2017-10-23 12:11:50
