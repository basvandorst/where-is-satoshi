BCH is a fork off the original Bitcoin.
Both share the same name, but they have different attributes (fees, protocols, tx times, etc...)
In case you're not aware, there are Bitcoin Diamond, Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold and a few more. All of these are not Bitcoin.

Now hoping Christmas would see another one so I could gather more funds and dive right in.

That platform has its own wallet linked to your account so you just send BTCs to that address.

Happens almost everytime even with popular e-wallet apps like Boost.
