Buy high sell low.

I'd be careful with this one because you justify holding something that may be heading to zero.

Shaking off weak hands, will hit a new ATH by next month.

I am on neither side, except the "ceo" of bcash is a bit crazy. I have hope that bitcoin will implement lightning by the end of next year and people will jump back on, the problems with btc will only get worse until then.

Nope, I keep telling people the real dip hasn't started and I just get down-voted lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:47:46
moo point
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:24
Real dip ain't began yet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:25:30
Trust in the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:22:19
I don't think it's over yet...
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:22:16
Quick maths.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:11
and we will call it bitcoin cash.

Please fix your mic, it's very poppy.

They had some 9k buys and sells then disabled them, making people think BCash was selling at those prices and causing people to buy at 5k+ at other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:34:33
EVERYONE BUY BIRCOIN BEFORE IT MOONS!

Could correct again after that insane bounce.

Some decentralized exchanges are being worked on already. However, it will need people to maintain them and offer customer service, technically the government could imprison the people who work at these exchanges so the exchanges would likely not be used without any human workers.

If the to and from address are correct on the transaction ID then no need to worry, transaction times are slow with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:20:38
Told you so. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:47:16
I said "could", also I don't hold any bitcoins, just eth
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:10:43
It really should be an hour+ it can depend on how congested the block-chain is and who is processing the transactions.
