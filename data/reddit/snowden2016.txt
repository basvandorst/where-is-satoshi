could you explain what you mean by the second sentence?

I am making conclusions which I think are obvious based on things in the white paper and the design of bitcoin. the arguments in favor of my conclusion have been expressed very well by many others. I can find some of the best ones if you would like.

What if they don't have a family? There are people who don't have families to support right. Also they don't need to worry about feeding their family, SNAP takes care of that.

if he would have included those motivations in the white paper it would have hindered mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 07:30:53
God how long ago was that and what is the language. That is pretty shitty unless you are from some tiny crazy language country?

Is there a National competition she might make it to?
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:02:53
false. If bitcoin just doesn't go up and Berkshire stock does the guy will lose lose a ton
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:27:53
So you really just meant that the sub goes into topics that are related to the impetus for its creation too often. Fair enough. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:01:10
I want to do what you are doing I don't have nearly as relevant experience as you but still, I fucking love cryptocurrencies and DAO's and the blockchain so much. They all give me giant freedom boners. 
What do you think of ethereum?
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:51:07
There shouldn't be money transmission laws, imo.
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:11:32
Oh did you catch a cold. the government apolgizes, WHAM! Medicaid? More like MagicAID! 
Let the government take care of you. We got you on lock homeboy! We're going to hook you up. Just don't ask us too many questions ok cause, if you annoy us... we might not feel like helping you out. Ya feel me?

money laundering is not fraudulent activity. but I didn't really mean what I said. What I meant to say was that I am not sure the government should treat money different from other property.

Also it has to do with cash flow and time value of money.

Much less risky than scratch off tickets

I think that is the next step for bitcoin. Getting it to the point where it is main stream enough that a bank starts accepting it as payment. Maybe an online bank like Ally?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:56:07
Certainly but there are other ways for them to attack bitcoin. They could simply buy a majority share and destroy it right? I think there are other ways to attack it as well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:31:54
Thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:32:01
Thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:44:47
For what?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:29:03
By the fall 2014 tv season bitcoin as a plot point and references are going to be commonplace I bet.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:15:47
Ah I see. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:34:18
Even if he isn't lying he could be wrong. Has he had discussions with Yellen and Obama on the matter?
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:17:29
Is this the same site that people thought hired Snowden? I am sure Snowden loves bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:59:49
Yeah but most of the people here don't write for NYT and have one of the most popular economics blogs on the web.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:20:59
I am surprised someone with a giant pile of cash just buy a majority stake in bitcoin and make gazillions if it fully takes of. Apple has like $125 Billion cash on hand. Buying a 80% of all bitcoins and getting a powerful mining farm built to protect their dominance would be chump-change to them. I am actually worried some government hasn't already done it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:46:08
The only reason altcoins are necessary and valued so highly is there is a possibility that the government(s) will eventually try to crush bitcoin by any means available, to save fiat. I have no idea how likely or possible that is but a decent portion thinks it is both. If it does happen, one or more of the altcoins will take over and skyrocket in value.

Point is he wants the free market to decide on what things, plural, should be used as money. If we could magic away all fiat in short order, there would be 10's of commodities used as currencies for business transactions and at least a handful used for consumption transactions, and cryptocurrencies too now. 
Crytptocurrencies, hopefully mainly bitcoin, will be like a large bundle of straw that breaks fiat's back, eventually. It is now only a matter of how long the governments will delay it. Now that Germany is allowing cryptocurrencies it seems even less likely that other major governments will try to impede them. If this happens the economic pressure will build and convince other countries to make them completely legal and not try to subvert them.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:34:15
How so?
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:55:04
So it's not centralized but it's centralized.

I didn't see it I just started watching this season a few episodes in.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:33:31
Thanks but no thanks. I haven't got the time atm.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:20:31
The Good Wife is clearly one of the top 5 dramas on tv and the best on a broadcast network in my opinion.
I just started watching it this year and I feel like a complete fool for ignoring it.

What is this a reference to?
