To be honest, knowing my fellow coutnrymen exchange owners, it's just advertising stunt to call some people in and exchange their fiat to local PLN currency or in reverse. Really doubt they do any crypto trading.

Word of advise, put some shortcuts on start screen for importing data, wallet addresses, something. Now it just starts with blank sheet which might be intimidating for many users what do next. Purely marketing /UX hint. Definitely will try it when have some time to import data.

These are for two different bubbles of course, there's different dynamics and range for them, that's true. Outcome was similar. BTW. I keep like 0.1btc to be fair. I just feel sorry for people that invested all their money.

Well, to me it is less of being a trader than a speculator. Traders can do healthy predictions to some extent. As for technology being experimental I agree, but assuming you're a hodler I don't think you will ever make up your loss when you bought it for 20k$
As clever technology for future payments I truly support it. The problem is, now it's strictly speculative market, and I don't blame anyone. I made some money, I lost some money but I just would like to see this tech being used on daily basis for what it is. And for me the biggest advantage of bitcoin is independence from governmental and bank supervision. I'm just worried that because of speculation it all will be lost for a long time.

Man, you are so right about future generations who will be main users of crypto currencies. Thanks for idea about securing my crypto assets for my kids. I think I will do it as well.

Personally I like Electrum. It's credible, have clients for most of operating systems. Only disadvantage, it is bit ugly and doesn't have modern UX you might be used to, like for example paypal app. But in my opinion it's trustworthy and secure.

Crazy there are people like saleem with this level of expertise. Guy was really lucky this time. And persistent. I would have let go long time before he did. Weird for him being somehow computers expert and tech writer, he had such small experience with Linux.
