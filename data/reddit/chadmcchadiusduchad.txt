Ok I am very confused? What is Bcash? what is the difference between cash and coin? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:24:47
But I only have Bitcoin and my friend accepts Bitcoin so why not?

What is a real bitcoin? I am using a payment system right now and it's working fine for me. I upgraded to Bitcoin Cash in august.

Yeah if you leave your bitcoin behind, because unless you have enough and it's not spread over a lot of addresses it's expensive to send all your bitcoin to and exchange and get another crypto for it. And it's also bullshit. A simple blocksize increase even to 2 MB would fix this mess. When I am talking about a wall I am making a metaphor. I am talking about all the censorship that this sub is known for. That is becoming less. You even hear more and more core developers talking about how bitcoin has a problem. I think they are going to increase the blocksize. They have too, one little market crash can cause enough panic now to get transactions stuck while the prices goes lower and lower ... eventually leading to chaos. So they need to do something to prevent that and the only solution is an immediate blocksize increase. Otherwise Bitcoin is become obsolete, what coin is a coin that costs money to spend?

What? This is Bitcoin sub right? Why is this the wrong sub?

When your sportscar has two problems:
1. It's not aerodynamic enough to sustain speeds above 200 km/s
1. Of your 8 cylinders only 3 are working, because 5 spark plugs are so dirty they don't spark.  
It's kind of stupid not to fix 2 (clean those spark plugs) because 1 is hard to solve.
This is what happened with Bitcoin Core, from as far back as 2013 lots of people saw  a problem coming. Namely the 1 MB artificial limit that Satoshi coded in to the application. Why did he do that? To protect the new born baby network from people taking advantage of the free transactions to spam the network as much as they want without a cost. (that's right for year miners mined transactions without a fee, even long after most clients set a minimum fee). Then block slowly filled up and as the network became big enough there was no purpose anymore for this artificial limit. 
That does not mean it should be removed completely but a small increase as needed is not a problem until bitcoin sees so much adoption that you have a team of software engineers a 1000 times the size of now working on a scaling solution. And make no mistake: a big percentage of bandwidth on the internet is porn and filesharing that people don't really pay that much extra for on top of their internet bill. It that apparently gets funded somehow bandwidth generated by Bitcoin won't become a problem until the traffic it generated takes over the traffic generated by porn. And when that happens it's also not a problem because the incentive to build data centers just to help with Bitcoin traffic will also be there. Banks already have these data centers right now and all though the costs of a centralized system are lower, these costs are being payed by the central unit. While the costs in a decentralized system are higher, these costs are being payed for by the entire network! 
So not changing the artificial blocksize when needed is the equivalent of having only 3 of your 8 cylinders working. You fix it by cleaning those spark plugs, just like you can easily change a couple of lines of code. This will not allow your car to go faster than a 200 km/h because you still have an aerodynamic problem that is much harder to fix because somewhere in the design of the car you made a mistake. And so people wanted a small increase in the blocksize, so that at least they could run at higher speeds if they wanted! 
This was blocked (haha get it) and now bitcoin core is running at 60 km/h while claiming, we can't go faster then 200 km/h anyway and neither can the other sportscars. At the same time other sportscars that can't go faster then 200 km/h drive way faster than 60km/h. How did the sportscar manufacturers respond to being passed by a slow Lamborghini, a Chinese clone of a sportscar, and a very lightweight smartcar and a dog sled? 
**"Oh in the process of fine tuning our car we discovered that what we build is not a sportscar at all but rather a tractor and that is good because lower speeds are much safer."**
and yes if we ever need to go faster then 200 km/h we will find a design for it that allows it, just like offchain solutions are a good idea to implement ... at the right time ... with the right priorities ... when the demand asks for it but not as a surrogate for the editing of a couple of lines of code.

What value has it beside it's use? If it's use is limited so is it's value. What business is going to want to go through the trouble of selling products for bitcoin? What users are going to buy to use it to make transactions with? It's only use is a store of value that is rapidly increasing in value. But if the only value left is the perceived value then Bitcoin is literally becoming a ballon full of hot air. What is going to be left after belief turns around? After all these new people find out that after being a 100 dollar worth of Bitcoin it will cost them 20 dollars in fees and at least a full day wait before they can make just 1 transaction. The emporer is not wearing any clothes but all the adults are still playing along.

Eh eheum Tether anybody? 
Are you going to renounce bitcoin as well, if one day it turn out most volume of 2017 was fake ... and prices crash back to under 5000. Will you tell everybody to stop with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:14:53
That would work fine as long as you can send Bitcoin that you first buy at 2011 prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:34:58
Oh that is sweet. 
One magic internet money for you my friend! As soon as LN is operational I will tip you some bitcoin! With LN we can easily have a bitcoin bot working again, like with changetip in the old days. Ah where is the time ...

My friend Barry called it Fucktard money but then I corrected him that it's Fucktard digital old and then he wasn't laughing anymore but that might also be because I punched him in the blockhead. Texas is a special place.

About 12 hours to 30 hours I would say, 335 satoshi per byte is pretty high. A couple of weeks ago I had a 10 sat/B transaction go through in about 8 days. The congestion will go over, in a couple of days. As a  max I would say maybe 3 days for your transaction, but realistically speaking I think you will have one confirmation in about 12 hours. Make sure to use segwit. that speeds up things a bit.

Yeah what a loser for not knowing what bitcoin is, this guy must be one those people that just stay in their basements all the time and never go outside. Those type of people never know what is going on in the world. Surprised he heard of paypal. He probablly used paypal before but never Bitcoin. I can understand that, a loser like that would not be able to figure out how bitcoin works anyway. Paypal is just click click click, any idiot can do that. But with paypal you can easily get scamed. Paypay is super central and we all know that you can't trust no you must not trust any thing central. Central is the devil, like Bcash and that chinese loser. Decentral is the future, like the real Bitcoin and Lightning Network. Conclusion: this loser lives in the past and will never become a millionaire while the irony is that if he knew about bitcoin he would already be a millionaire and not even on the show. UNBELIEVABLE SAD. Don't be like this guy, buy bitcoin and never sell because it will always eventually go higher. That is how it was designed and it's mathematically impossible to change that. Paypal can be anything tomorrow but Bitcoin always stays pure.

Ethereum is reasonable more price stable compared to Bitcoin at the moment. It's nature is also quiet different. You can't compare it one on one.

You are totally right aheadyriser, I try to find those totally pathetic comments that I know will be defended and upvoted here because of the Bitcointologists. The truth is, Bitcoin with a higher blocksize is Bitcoin, Bitcoin with a hard limit on the blocksize does not work. Eventually people will see that and realize that is antibitcoin + a bunch of victims of lies.  They hijacked the community and now the bitcoin  community is dead and the remnant is over at and Bitcoin Cash.

Big blockers have lost all their funds on trying to spam the  Bitcoin network, which failed because fees are the lowest they have ever been and with LN they are literally ZERO right now and they might even become NEGATIVE because with LN you get paid for sending money over the network if you have a hub. Now even the smallest user can be like a miner again and earn an income from Bitcoin.  Amazing. These people are true hodlers. The OG hodlers.

I am going to cash out soon. I don't really care to much about bitcoin but it is surely a money making machine if you do it properly. Made about 11K the last couple of years on a 5K investment.  (original 5K is back, trying to get the 6K profit on my account soon).
 Now all that I left in bitcoin is bitcoin cash. But at least i can say i made a profit and did not loose any money.
