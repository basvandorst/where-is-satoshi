If *everyone* disregards a law, it tends to cease being a law.

Autonomous corporations and some kind of a constitutional amendment for separation of Corporate and State. Corporations are effectively church.

If nothing else, there's an ego boost in censoring and attempting to control a pretty strong group as an individual. I didn't say it was financial, but I'm sure it probably is in some way.

Because power mongers like to shape their little communities... Honestly if you ban something I'm immediately in support of it just on principle.

Considering the majority of the government at this point *is* corporate CEOs, I'd say they all wanted this.
@_date: 2015-11-22 01:03:19
And exactly who does it affect to imprison all the CEOs?

Watch the news for a bit and listen to the senate and the fed. Yeah, it's gone mainstream.

The financial elite are adopting, too, pretty quickly ...

It's a stupid law, just don't obey. They can't really toss *everyone* in prison. ENCRYPT ALL THE THINGS.

O...kaaaay. Consensus time, then.
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:46:55
... Huh. I did not notice that ... but sure enough, there it is. That's kind of creepy as sheit.

Now there's a jar of worms you should really open and explore!! The Blockchain is the actual value behind bitcoin. Think of it as a distributed, decentralized, very nicely verifiable, cryptographic database of events. You can do quite a bit with that if you can wrap your head around harnessing it.

I'll agree with you there, I don't think he's very corruptible externally. I do think he's very corruptible by himself though - as we all are, in positions of any sway - so he definitely still requires oversight.

Seems kind of weird to have not just destroyed the keys, in that position ...

This is the absolute best advice for anything. Don't buy more than you can lose, and assume all your eggs are bunk before they hatch. Any benefit is just gravy then.

According to google. I don't know how long it's been since I last searched google ...

They do apparently fuck around with weird symbols, though ... look at that all-seeing-eye on the bitcoin.

New World Order often bows down to public demands when they are strong enough. Don't want to look like an enemy to *all* the people.

People accept it as money, and that's its value. What people will pay for it in other currencies is its exchange rate ... you know, same as any other currency. The great thing about BitCoin is that it isn't controlled by a central bank, and you can't print more just because you have some strange legal authority to do so.

Wait ... He actually said he objects to it not being backed by anything? What happens when he realizes the Fed owns no gold ...

Somewhat accurate in a few ways, though it carries with it some bizarre connotations that aren't true of either technology, and there are some insanely huge differences.

Thermus has profit to gain from coinbase shutting up.
