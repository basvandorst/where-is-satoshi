Lets do some simple back of the envelope calculations in terms of dollars, hash rates, and FLOPS to see how the bitcoin network stacks up against supercomputers FLOPS to FLOPS. I realize this is not a fair comparison, since supercomputers are far better for the average scientific use because of their homogenaity, maintenance, and data transfer speeds. The point of the calculation is just to play with the numbers. What I'm calculating is the cost per FLOP per time, so that we can compare how feasible it would be to pay miners to work on other problems.
I'm going to use TACC's Ranger as an example. Ranger does ~500 TFLOPS = .5 PFLOPS, cost $30M in hardware and another $30M in maintenance. Lets also assume it lasts about a decade. That gives $1M / Month / PFLOP.
The current bitcoin network is estimated to have about 100 PFLOPS. I've read that 1 hash/s = 8000 FLOPS. Considering that a 1GH miner can earn around $1000 / month, this means the entire network is pulling about $100M / month. Or in terms of cost per FLOP per time, this gives. $1M/ month / PFLOP.
Amazing, the cost is the same (in this very rough calculation).
So yes, it would be feasible to pay miners a competitive wage to work on scientific problems, assuming all FLOPS are equal.

Bullshit. Easy to track? No, but trackable.


Now you've really got me laughing WikiLeaks.

I did a simple calculation in another thread about this, the idea being to pay miners to turn their attention to scientific calculations.

It seems you missed this paragraph (or chose to ignore it) so I'll post it again for you. The volunteer networks mentioned are no different than the network of BTC miners, except in network size, and are making a real contribution to science.

I have access to a supercomputer with 512 GPUs, so allow me to answer your question:
Nothing. All they're all Nvidia cards.

Yes, this is the design. Consider though that there are a lot of new miners out there that have bought hardware on credit, and are in this for profit. They are most certainly cashing in their BTC for USD as they earn it.

Performance is not the only measure of success. From what I understand CUDA is successful for a lot of reasons, such as relative ease of use. I'm no expert though. I'm taking a course in CUDA and have no OpenCL experience.

Think about what's going on this week. There is a rush of people wanting to buy who just heard about bitcoin, but remember it takes a few days to get an account verified before actually making the transaction. I'm betting this dies down by the end of the week and it goes back down below $15, probably lower.
Hopefully this will be followed by growth at a reasonable pace. Retailers aren't going to really take interest until it stabilizes, and bitcoin needs a bigger market to form lasting value and interest.
For those of you who're in a position to sell, I hope you profit handsomely but cashing everything in at this point would be a real disservice to the future of bitcoin. Consider spending your profits with retailers, perhaps someone should get a list going? 
I'm new to all of this and have &lt;1 BTC myself (from mtred).

What can I say, I'm a physicist. Within a factor of .1-10 is good enough for this kind of calculation. As its been pointed out, we're comparing floating point operations to integer operations, and p2p heterogeneous distributed computing to centralized architecture.

You've completely missed the point, and worse, are factually wrong.
Scientific problems are quite often made to run in parallel across hundreds of nodes in supercomputers. More recently those nodes have been accelerated by GPUs using languages like CUDA and OpenCL by programs that have been written to take advantage of the hardware. 
There are numerous examples of distributed computing in science where people volunteer their computational time. The point here is that by means of an economic incentive, vastly more power is now being dedicated to mining bitcoin. One might ask if it is worth it to pay people to contribute to such projects like [folding [Einstein or [SETI Data dependency and transfer is certainly an obstacle with distributed computing  but all computer systems have weaknesses and strengths. I even conceded this in my original post.
**tl;dr** This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.

Yes, CUDA.

I said it never happened in my other comment, nonetheless it was a capability.

This is the often overlooked feature of the shuttle (because it was never used) - the ability to bring a satellite *back down to earth*. Of course if a satellite failed it would be cheaper to simply launch a new one or repair it in space (Hubble, for example). It wasn't our own satellites that interested us. We wanted to be able to steal Russian spy satellites or weapons. Perhaps the shuttle is the right analogy for bitcoin today?
