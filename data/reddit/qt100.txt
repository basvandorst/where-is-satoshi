If you can handle reading some instructions and typing some stuff in the command line, joinmarket has veeery low fees and works very well.

Your on a slippery slope here. The big question that follows your statement is: who decides what constitutes a crime? The US govt right now is putting financial pressure on businesses they decided are "undesireable" but still "legal" such as porn, gambling, legal arms sellers, etc. 
The us govt tried to cripple wikileaks financially. So then I ask, how much free speech are people allowed before they get wikileaks-ed?.
This could go on and on. Bottom line, trying to fight "crime" by cancelling transactions simply destroys btc fungibility. The upside is that we will be able to look at the extreme corruption going on around us. Or will the "alliance" agree to not talk about that?

I would bet a serious amount that they save the logs of that mixer and turn them over to whoever asks. That's after you take into account that the mixer itself doesn't obscure transactions effectively. 2X scam.

What?? you are fine that anybody can look at exactly how much money you have and what you buy, at any time? Are you also comfortable with cameras throughout your house that watch your every move? Are you an exhibitionist? 
Nobody TRULY is ok with being under surveillance all the time.

Really, Gavin has turned full traitor. Or does it sound nicer to say deputized?
