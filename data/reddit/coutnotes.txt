It looks like their forums are closed?

As long as all the important stuff is done on the backend, why not? Genuinely curious

Do you mean like Mental Poker? There are some implementation problems with it

yup ASIC should make these botnets pretty much obsolete... unfortunately the botnet operators don't really have a reason to stop mining, even if they're only making a tiny amt of money.... like 1 cent for every 10 cents spent on electricity. they're not paying the bill, so why stop?

IIRC I checked Obama's odds are above 50% according to the bookies, so maybe you should offer more if the other guy wins? Otherwise, it would be silly to bet that Obama won't continue his election :]

Late 2010. I was interested in it, but for whatever reason I found it confusing and lost interest in it. Shame, too, cause if I'd maintained my interest I could be sitting on a reasonably larger pile of bitcoins
I don't remember how I had heard of it, probably a forum somewhere
*after reading the responses below, I probably learned about it on 4chan

blah that seems obvious in retrospect. thanks

Somebody else (can't remember off the top of my head) is also developing ASIC with less ridiculous claims, but they were planning on DRMing it somehow. Maybe that's what you're thinking of? AFAIK BFL isn't planning on doing that

are there any tutorials on how to do it by hand?

But if you really think they'll get that big, you'd be better off investing money in bitcoins.
