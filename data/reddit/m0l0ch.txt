What about Chris DeRose?

Nice! If you plan to run homebrew in the future make sure you update the software to 3.0.0 and stay there!

It's a HTTP REST API, check out the docs:

Click an article, you can only read the first part. Then you get a payment request, and once you pay it the rest of the article will be readable.

He tested it a few times before I assume, and didn't want the coffee to go to waste!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:58:41
Love you buddy &lt;3

Seems the futures have reduced volatility so far. Good.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:17:09
Don't send me your BTC!

Your shit is good! Keep it up buddy!

Or the owner bought the car when 1 btc was worth less.

Bitcoin isn't even mentioned, it's about fintech in general. Your title is totally misleading.

See you on the moon, m8!

No problem buddy

I don't think it could happen before the fork, there would be only one coin at that point in time, right?

You da real mvp!
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:16:20
It's incredible how he goes:


Yeah, and so how does Goldmoney do that?
There's no mainstream adoption for either "currency" (or whatever they are) yet - how does he not get that?
Seems to me he's arguing in bad faith.

Bought just before the big crash last year, hodl and you'll be fine most likely.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:25:52
Nice, that's great! However they are certainly not counting the swiss ticket machines, which allow to buy BTC (not to sell).
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:02:20
I'll take that $7. Well, maybe.

In a nutshell: because it is not only a currency but also a payment system.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:19:17
Thought the same thing - how can they claim to be free if they have to pay for their freedom?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:49:44
500k is not nearly enough...
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:05:17
In the code it sais: 200.0/4500.0 - seems like a random test value to me. It could also be his BTC balance, but I kinda doubt it.
That value is multiplied with the BTC course and then displayed. This gives us the value of the BTC in Fiat.
Edit: Typo

We'll have to reach a consensus with rainbow road.
I'd say let us have the B of the Bitcoin text in orange - it looks really cool right now. The rainbow passes in the B in the lower right coin.

Worth mentioning: To understand this you need to first know about Taproot. Jimmy has a video on it as well:

You mean on his website? You can add a pull request, took him less than a day last time I did that.
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:45:15
I'll watch the video later and decide then...
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:58:46
That doesn't mean they 50/50 split, they will probably mine the coin which is more profitable.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:58:40
Pretty much the opposite of Xapo? I like it.

@_date: 2016-10-28 12:25:01
Maybe they will get a fee of each sale? Sounds like a good business opportunity for them. The already have the infrastructure in place, and just need to deploy some software on it to make it work.

They very likely get a flat % of the money as a fee, as far as i understood it. The transaction fee for all chf &lt;-&gt; btc trades will be 6%, as I read on a swiss newspapers site.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:44:45
My point is, we're still quite a bit away from 2.5k.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:21:25
Price hits 2k: "... price continues to move close to $2500"
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:43:53
You might as well write price rushes to 2.5mio usd...
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:46:29
Realisticly I have a lot more trust in the Bitcoin software than in ETH's software. The quality with which it is developed and tested surpasses ETH's (or other Altcoins) by a lot.
Of course people will try to attack the network in any way possible, the bounty for a successful attack is huge. The fact that Antbleed was uncovered (and thus most likely stopped) gives me more hope for BTC, while the manufacturer of devices with backdoors looses their trust.
Just my 2 satoshi, your opinion on that may differ.

There is no need for a miner to fill a block, just an incentive.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:56:20
IMO ETC is the true ethereum, so yes. Code is law was one of their promises, they broke it when they forked. ETH is the centralized ether.
However, in case of hard forks I believe there is no one right Coin, only 2 versions of the original.
And a hardfork could really backfire. When the miners don't like it, they can just attack the fork with their superior hash rate.
All that being said, I'd love to see SegWit activate (whether via hard- or softfork), but I think we should be careful how to do it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:15:57

BTC is the original symbol, but fiat currencies are usually associated with a country, which is their first 2 letters: USD, GBP, CHF... Others that are not specific for a country start with X.

I don't know enough about it honestly, but usually when one side doesn't hold their end of a contract it is voided, if I am not mistaken.

Yeah, we will just shard... /s
Sorry to destroy your hopes, but it's not as easy as most ETH people want to make you think it is.
