Fees per byte is another topic where Bitcoin Core and major wallets fail... Even with mempool empty `estimatefee 10` (how much to pay to get included in 10 blocks) was returning 200 sat/byte yesterday, today  still suggests 210 sat/byte, while 40 sat/byte works just fine and dramatic majority of transactions are included in the next block.
 might be your friend, they do live analysis of the mempool. It's not a perfect tool, but gives a pretty nice overview of current situation.

Both account addresses and change addresses are derived from the same HD seed. So the recovery, although requires some manual work, is possible - you just need to generate addresses from the seed and add their corresponding witness addresses.

I am using `getrawchangeaddress` to get a new change address. Then I am using `addwitnessaddress` to convert it to a Segwit address, but then the resulting address is NOT treated as a change address. I have mentioned it in the BitcoinTalk post I linked. I think it's a major flaw in the way Segwit is implemented right now.

That's right. But if you have large volume of transactions, like we do, the difference is significant.
Plus, we often have a lot of small inputs from multiple small user deposits. Since Segwit makes spending UTXOs cheaper, and we happen to have txes with 8-10 inputs, the savings are non-negligible.

Charging dynamic "per-transaction" fee will not work in our model. My service uses a "shared wallet", i.e. there are no per-user unspent inputs. Prior to making the withdrawal I don't know the number of inputs required and tx size. That's why we charge users flat withdrawal fee.
The only way to deal with increasing fees is to increase/decrease flat fee based on the average tx fees, which we might do in the end. But competing services are fine subsidizing withdrawals and they try to keep user fees low.

Several Bitcoin cassinos offer investment options with annual return over 10%, so this might be one of the most profitable investments. But you might want to do some serious research before you decide to invest (as always).
