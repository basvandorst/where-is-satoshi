So it works like this:  
1. You have a Linux server.  
2. You install the Coinpunk server on that and connect it to a Bitcoin address with funds.  
3. You go to your own Coinpunk page using your iPhone.  
4. You take a picture of the QR code using the iPhone camera.  
5. JavaScript decodes the QR code and completes the transaction.
Please correct me if I'm wrong. 
This sounds very cumbersome - fun for the enthusiast and an impressive feat of technology, but not something that is likely to gain wide acceptance.

While most of this is a load of horseshit, it does touch on an interesting point:
How anonymous is bitcoin? How anonymous can it be with things like mixing services?
Curiously, the opinion of many libertarians is that it's anonymous enough to let them avoid tax and buy drugs, but not anonymous enough to let them hire assassins. 
This seems completely self-contradictory. I would really like someone to clarify this for me.
This is important, because IF bitcoin can be anonymous enough to hire assassins, someone will do just that. The fact that DPR tried was not due to lack of trying, nor to any inherent safeguard in bitcoin.
If bitcoin isn't anonymous enough to avoid taxes, then it will be regulated and taxed just as any other currency system.
You can't have it both ways. You can't have your tax-free cake and eat it too.

Possible? Yes. Likely? No. It's also possible that there is a flaw in the encryption used by your old bank that means someone can make off with all your dollars/euros/whatever. The Bitcoin protocol and software has been scrutinized by some very smart people with very strong incentives for finding weaknesses. So far, they've found nothing.


Some are interesting, none have the brand recognition and market penetration that Bitcoin has. Those are very important for a currency.

The Tea-Party libertarians (of the taxes-is-theft kind) have taken over the bitcoin movement. This is unfortunate, because it scares away more moderate investors.
Without moderates, bitcoin will never reach the mainstream, because moderates are the majority.

I meant "filthy" as in "has recently been handled by tens of pairs of disease-ridden hands, including the hands of the greasy, spotty, chronic-masturbator teen at the McDonalds register".
Paper money is made from cotton paper, lightly oiled and moistened by human handling, and kept in dark little drawers with other bills. It's a wonder our society hasn't succumbed to some virulent disease spread by paper money long ago.

That must be why gold has lost a quarter of its value in the last year.
Ron Paul has been talking about the imminent demise of fiat currency since the 80s. Just another doomsday prophet.

Do I need to trust the person running the server? In other words, is my private key ever transmitted to, or stored on, the server?
If not, then where is the private key stored? There's no app, so no local storage.

True. 
I live in Sweden, and chip-and-pin debit cards are used for everything except garage sales. I haven't touched filthy banknotes in months.
Many cities encourage it because it makes robbery, theft, and begging so much harder.
This means Swedes are used to thinking of money as numbers protected by a password, which is why I think bitcoin is going to make it bigtime here.

Yep, if you're already the market leader you have no reason to innovate.

That's assuming the exchange rate doesn't move during 5 days. If it goes up while you're doing wire transfers you're screwed.
