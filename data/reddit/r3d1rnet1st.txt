It is more than clear that negative credit, targets normal citizens, as they want to push them to "invest" their money (in other words handover them to corporations). Corporations on the other hand, are not affected as they have other agreements with banks.
However putting a simple person transfer life time savings to Bitcoin and make him watching every day  the fluctuations, which are way beyond 0.5%/year, it is totally absurd!

What a stupid article!
I do not understand why Greeks will begin to use Bitcoins which is not a registered EU currency and therefore won't count in the accumulation of the 30%.....? Only to pay the penalty of 22%....?
The exact case is that if an individual wants to avoid the 22% penalty, he has to spend 30% of his revenue electronically which (this is what the article misses) has to pass from the **Greek** Banking system means (**Greek** credit/debit cards, **Greek** IBANs etc) even if he makes purchases within the EU. In addition, simple money transfers between individuals are not added up to this 30%, unless you declare their VAT number into your TAX yearly declaration!
So if you are a Greek, but you have a UK credit card, and you make a purchase this transaction won't be registered in the Greek banking system as a Greek transaction but as a UK one! So it won't count to this 30%!
On the other hand if you use e.g. a Greek credit card to buy from an e-shop in the EU, than yes, this amount is added to the 30%.
But if you use a Greek debit card to buy Bitcoins from an exchange in the US they won't count. If the exchange is in the EU it might count (but then Greek authorities might question why you didn't declare them as stock assets :O )
As soon as this individual  starts to make transactions in Bitcoins (to avoid the control) , he will pay definitely the penalty of 22%, since only transactions in Euro count to the 30%. That is why the article is so stupid.
Of course the Greek government forces its citizen to go electronically and use only the Greek Banking system and therefore increase control, but this is another discussion I believe
