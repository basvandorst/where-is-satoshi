So i went to go watch the video and pay the $1.00 using the Kryptokit Plugin for Chrome.   Normally when I click the plugin, it will automatically read the address and sometimes the amount, and plug it in automatically.   Didn't work here.  Had to select &lt;advanced/manual&gt; to display the address.    I sent the funds...... and nothing.    Refreshed browser......and nothing.   Plus a different Btc address was displayed.    Possibly becasue I run Adblock, blur, don't accept cookies?    I dunno.  not really a complaint, just errrrrr..... fix that if you can.  This could be awesome.

This is great!   I notice your from philly and I've seen you on Coinmap.org.  Have you been to any BitcoinPHL meetings?  we would love to connect with you. Maybe you could introduce us all to your project!

I think you need a new realtor. Their main job is to market the property and this is an excellent way of getting extra attention.  Im doubtful that anyone would actually purchase a multi family with bitcoin unless they have a tremendous amount of bitcoin to burn. I think it would be foolish to use bitcoin to buy commercial real estate. Prices are already inflated due to low interest rates.  Why would you exchange an asset with tremendous upside potential for one with  a limited upside and significant downside potential?   However I think that using it as a marketing tool is a very smart move.

Wow. The ignorance and hubris of the author displayed by both his article and replies to comments is painful to read. I can't understand how anyone can take this man seriously. But apparently some do....   Oye.

I know them. They're members of BitcoinPHL and have been working on this for quite some time.  They were hoping to launch in Philly but the regulators were dragging their feet.

Its not satire. Its just hipster snark. Ok tho. Par for the course here!

Thank goodness, if only for an end to all the bickering.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:14:58
Yup, appears to be the real thing

Apparently confirmed with Mike Belshe of Bitgo and Adreas tweeted about it

Nice place

Very nice. Search is a bit difficult. Would like a browse feature or a global map to see what is available 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:28:02
Did they at least thank you?  That response was a bit curt and not very appreciative.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:30:46
As a proponent of bitcoin I'd like to thank you for telling me what I believe.  I forgot. Viva la revoultion!
