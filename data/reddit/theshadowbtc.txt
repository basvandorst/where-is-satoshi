I propose all the developers that contributed a BIP. The I stand for improvement, so they literally helped improving Bitcoin.

I am worried too. I follow the Bitcoin scene from about 2013, and I find disconcerting to see such heavy push for a vision of Bitcoin that's so radically different from the one that jump-started everything, namely P2P cash. Bitcoin didn't reach the ATH numbers by promising to be only a settlement network or digital gold. It was also the enthusiasm of thousands of people discovering that they could transfer pizza money in a fast and economic way.
I remember the rounds of virtual applause when Gavin announced that with the latest update of Bitcoin (don't know if it was already Core or not) the usual fee got slashed by about 10 times!

That is true.

What you are describing is NOT the Bitcoin that many subscribed too. It certainly is not the Bitcoin I become to know in 2012.

I read that luke-jr himself believed in Mt. Gox so much that he left there a considerable sum (in the high 400 BTC, if I remember correctly). 
So it seems that it was quite the trusted operation, at least up to a point.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:31:27
This. And it's exactly like when Mt.Gox happened. I wasn't in Bitcoin by much, but I too noted the overwhelming bad signs, detailed in a quantity of posts, about the Gox situation for weeks before it imploded.
Still, even some people that should have known better (including a notable Core developer) left their coins there. 
Laziness or bias or whatever often get the better of many.

Right, thanks!

Anyone tried to verify the message?
It appears to be signed with an expired certificate..

So is there any concrete cause of worries for a bip-39 wallet created in 2014 in Tails with a downloaded copy of bitaddress.org, with added entropy from keyboard and mouse?

BitPay begs to differ: 


I'm not judging Stephen correctness here, but it's clear that BitPay is a relevant part of the economic majority, and he definitely doesn't agree.

Still, they are very low anyway.
And most of all, even if there was only a handful of well connected nodes still forwarding blocks as usual, they will be more than sufficient to nullify all the blocking.
It's really a flawed concept from the start. In practice, there's no chanches that UASF can accomplish anything. That's just the reality of it.

It's a vote of confidence on a different dev team, after the miners and a significant part of the industry and the user base felt that the current one failed to serve the best interest of Bitcoin, an foster its adoption.

Oh, I don't know, maybe because it have nothing to do with it?
Alternatively, why not adding the Vigesimal system too? I'm sure the entire Basque community will greatly appreciate it. And no one will be forced to use or like it, right?

That's 500/GB year, with totally full blocks.
A 4TB HD costs less than 100$ now, and will be good for over 6 years (considering current blockchain, overhead, indexes, et cetera).
And next year it will costs even less, and larger ones will be even more common.
So, no,  that argument doesn't stand.

You are also forgetting about Compact Blocks / Xthin and the likes. And still, even without that, 10x that rates of bandwidth is not a problem for thousands and thousands of users.
The fact that the current number of nodes is only about 5-7K is NOT due to how much costly it is to run a node. Because it is not.

You may want to tell that to Adam Back too. I was being more conservative.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:21:33
That's not a problem either. Proof: there are thousands of computer users burning more than that just torrenting/sharing files. 
But please do go on with your next non issue.
