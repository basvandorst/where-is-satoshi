only socially stunted neckbeards, in some definition of the term, could not see why this is not very respectful.

could you post a version without the orange circles?

That might not be possible.

Millions of people want Mubarak dead for example.

1. You assume that only one crook would try this
2. After breaking Bitcoin, your duplicated coins will be worthless.

hopefully less then what our present governance structures are costing in lives, but only time will tell.

Certain technologies do have the opposite effect, just look at Google and Facebook for example, which have been pulling the internet in this direction for the last years.
The fact that Bitcoin actually appeared, pulling the other way, is one of the best things that ever happened to the internet.

Where can i find info about the Berlin (and other) meetups?

Disturbingly sexist (all women in the animation are portrayed as sexual objects), and historicly inaccurate, barter came after money, there was gift economies and other social relation based transactions.
It's also completely forgetting the production side, including unemployment. And the solution is to kill bankers in glorious battle? Come on.
Oh well. Something along these estetical/propaganda lines about bitcoin, without the conspiracy imagery might be interesting to do.

An inaccuracy in the article is the oft repeated myth that gold as a representation for value arose through barter. David Graeber (in his 'debt, the first 5000 years') has demonstrated that history of gold-money is intimately tied to state warfare.
Also, Money is a social relation, not an intrinsic value. In fact, the concept of intrinsic value is empty of content, there are no intrinsic values.

The users of the currency are maybe already too many for something like this to work. 
If not, they will probably continue raising exponentially for a while ahead, when would be the correct time to act to put 1% of the ppl in prison? How would you select them? Pick out the non-white ppl as usual? :P

Would you not want to make your chart look like this, exponential twitter graph! And since this was a year ago or more, an infinite amount of people should be twittering by now!
It is very true that capitalism requires ever-expanding circulation of value, and for this reason the dollar minting process makes sense. But it's the impossible reasoning of a system based on never thinking about where these exponential graphs end up in the real economy. They are inherently unsustainable.
"No one is literally making the market, saying 'no matter what happens, I'll buy Bitcoins from you at some price'". This is also true, it's logics like this that makes it more economically reasonable throwing people out of their homes when the real estate market crashes. It's also not sustainalbe, it can just buy itself more increasingly expensive time.
The point about deflation hits an interesting point. If you had a few bitcents that would be worth more tomorrow than today, then maybe you would not buy that cola. This is only a problem in capitalism, where you need to get the value to circulate all the time. In essence, forcing the economy to make sure you spend as much as possible of your money. In the real economy, a deflatory currency would maybe lead to less things being done, i guess you can see the ecological advantages of this. 
I'm interested in how this could actually be a huge change in how we think about and live economy. In deflation you _do_ spend for what you really need. Food and shelter for example. You spend less on things less important, like a cola, that's actually addictive by design.
tldr: positive exponential curves are unsustainable, capitalism sucks, bitcoin could maybe provide a deflatory-equilibrium of sorts, that change how we think about spending our money, and avoids the forced infinite growth.
