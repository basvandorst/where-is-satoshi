I know this gets posted every so often, but I would encourage everyone to run a node at least a few hours a week. It's a background process that wouldn't even impact your daily computer usage. Bonus points if you have a spare PC that can become a node. 
Anyway, it's as simple as downloading the client and making sure one port is open for traffic.

Hey...sometimes the price will be up...sometimes the price will go down. We are still trending up longterm!

I would look into a feature that most newer routers have called QoS. Quality of Service allows you to set bandwidth rules and prioties for applications and devices on your network. Not sure if it will be granular enough to only impact the application and not the whole PC though.
Otherwise, I know there are some other local applications you could try out that would run directly on the PC to throttle the Bitcoin Core client only...more info here 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:21:55
Did those involved in BTC back in 2010-2013 obsessively check exchange values or is this more of a recent thing?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:55:21
I checked the app's announcement and they say you can.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:50:01
Though I guess if you got into the game at floor 116 it can make you uncomfortable. Whatever, the tides ebb and flow.

Here's a question that popped into my head today...is the Lightning protocol something that other cryptos could adopt or is it somehow exclusive to Bitcoin?

I caught glimpse of it in the middle night checking charts (like I do) and was about to buy the dip when I realized I was way too out of it to try to make any rational decision making.

Micro-analysis is only going to drive you insane. I would encourage you to check the charts less often and you'll get a sense of the trend without worrying about every fluctuation.

When I first used the internet in the 90s it took like nearly a minute to load a webpage on dialup. I went to videogame websites to look at screenshots and read reviews but most times it was easier just to buy a print magazine with the content. Look at us now!

Yes you can. According to the in-app announcement you'll be able to withdraw to an external wallet as long as you provide additional verification.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:31:20
So then it follows that if you don't check on the market, it can't impact your emotional state. Try it for 24 hours...then a week. Make your game plan and consider that the state of market is not going to dictate your actions for selling. So following the market is just causing you stress.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:48:58
Transfer from Coinbase to GDAX wallet (using Coinbase credentials). Then your next transfer to wallet will be paid by GDax. I personally use a Ledger Nano S for all my coins. You can also get a LTC paper wallet and I'm sure there are other software wallets that support it.

As long as you know when to say enough is enough, sure. I personally just enjoy being in the game with the money which would have otherwise been wasted on this or that. Investing in crypto has made me more mindful of my money and that makes me happy.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:32:23
One of the downsides of being in this game is that now Google feeds me every news story related to crypto price activity. All the 12 hour old articles saying, "Bitcoin down! Bitcoin seeing healthy recovery!" are so useless.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:23:51
News like this is such a good defense against the potential manipulation by the futures closing tomorrow.

Does it deposit as BTC or USD?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:43
It is as safe as any intermediary but only a fraction as safe as having your assets stored in a hardware or paper wallet. I would recommend transferring your coins from Coinbase to GDax and then withdrawing to a wallet of your choice.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:10:36
Can you tell us more about these bitcoins you have?
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:54:35

Same reason your PC from 9 years ago can't run new games. By design, the complexity of the cryptography involved in the mining process has now outpaced your computer's specs. Your node can verify solved equations but would just be spinning it's wheels trying to solve a block. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:28:58
Seems like this would have to be more of a recommendation than a requirement...the water can get muddy so quick with a coin exchanging many, many times for differing values. I don't think any exchanges offer a clear way to stay on top of these events. The government will be most concerned with  folks who have massive unexplainable FIAT gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:08
You're effectively still supporting Coinbase with that approach since they are still getting all of their usual fee etc. At least on the initial purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:47:42
The mining process is performed locally on nodes. It is a low bandwidth process besides syncing the blockchain. While the scopd of net neutrality's repeal is not known, I get the sense that no one has concerns of an impact to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:59:45
I think it will be very favorable for anyone in the game. I can only imagine how much press Bitcoin will have by then. You'll see a lot of people investing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:51:19
My advice would be to *maybe* think about making two copies. One you gift along with the instructions, and one you lock away separately. This is in the event that the person says six months from now, "Oh, I never got around to using that Bitcircuit coupon you gave me and it's lost now"

Absolutely. Within a week you'll be more of an enthusiast (I guarantee it, despite what you may think!) and you'll learn how you can transfer over to the GDax exchange from Coinbase and then eventually into a off-exchange wallet to do the proverbial hodl.

If you are enrolled with Coinbase then you need to login via Gdax (same credentials) and then transfer the coins to GDax. From there you can send to the next stop without any fees.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:38:23
The chart's gotta breath...inhale...exhale...inhale...exhale...that's how it grows.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:22:54
Totally get that and I think it's a great example. But I understand that the person who is verified as saying, "Yep, I see a 15" first is awarded new bitcoins for taking part in the transaction. Did I over simplify it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:47:14
So I am going to say...the miner "solved for x" and the nodes verify that the equation that involves "x" does in fact equal 15. Therefore the miner gets the purse which was the fee involved in the exchange?

Can you expand the analogy so that it does? It would be very helpful.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:14:50
Absolutely, go to your Coinbase and select deposit and paste in the wallet address you are pulling from. Don't listen to anyone who tells gives you an address to use (scam).

Go to the bank across the street then. Although my bank is supported on Coinbase, they forbid ACH transactions and require me to call every time I want to make a debit purchase. The only thing my bank does is receive my direct deposit twice a month so I'm very likely going to move my money elsewhere.

Not a good idea for my wallet in the immediate future. I always start down a train of thought about how my cash is just sitting stagnate and gathering dust and cobwebs while crypto is like a living ecosystem that grows like moss. Then I peek at the charts every two minutes even though I set a arbitrary goal to only check once before bed...aaaand then I purchase a chunk of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:13:30

You should jump over to If you only plan to run a single GPU I would suggest you drop the notion of crypto mining. The processing requirements increase on a schedule that has surpassed CPU and GPU power. Those mining with GPUs are running rigs with several cards.

My understanding is that the network can use lanes established by peers. So if there is node connected to the gas station that is a few  hops from the ice cream place, your transaction would find a route through them.  Can anyone else verify my simplification?
