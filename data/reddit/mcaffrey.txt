I frequently go to blockchain.info to look at bitcoin charts, but I forgot the URL today and googled it.
The  match for "Blockchain Info" said Blockchain.com on Google, but actually went to "
Suspiciously, that URL was a login window that looked almost identical to the blockchain.info login window.

ITT we use our children to make political arguments by proxy, and don't think it is passive aggressive or manipulative at all.

OK, lets go!

Because bitpay converts the bitcoin to dollars on the open market and gives only dollars to Microsoft?  The article didn't say that, but that does even lower the risk if it is true.  
Do you know that for certain?  My understanding of most bitcoin commerce was that the seller received actual bitcoin and had to sell them to convert the bitcoin to cash.

Well you sound like you know what you're talking about, but your username...
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:01:31
Making us click the link to know what you are talking about is a little annoying.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:48:38
Yeah, I'd like to do that, but Reddit does not let you.
All I can do is delete the post outright, which I guess is best.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:39:41
Hmmm.  Maybe that was a bad idea.  Don't think I can change it now.
Well, I think it is only dangerous if you try to log into it with an actual blockchain.info account.

I thought about tagging it NSFW but that would probably make MORE people click it!

Ah, yesterday's news - literally!

This part is important too:
"There is a cap on how much you can exchange per day: $1,000 (or its equivalent in your country or region’s currency) to your Microsoft account on any given day, and no more than $5,000 to additional Microsoft accounts that are registered in your name or by you."
Executives at a company like Microsoft look at this in risk vs reward terms.  How much money and customer base growth can they get vs what is at risk.  
Worst case scenario is that bitcoins become worthless.  Best case scenario is that they get a bunch of new customers and make a lot of money.  So for this decision to make sense, they just need to mitigate the risk to minimize the worst case scenario.  They do that through daily bitcoin usage caps.  The caps are daily because they will presumably sell all their bitcoins each day and convert to cash, so their only potential liability is their daily bitcoin holdings.
And fortunately for their business model, $1000 a day is plenty for 99% of their customers, so they have an opportunity to minimize the risk of accepting bitcoin without limiting their customers in any meaningful way.
It is a win/win.

Yes, you are right.  There are more types of risk than just devaluation of bitcoin.  But they are all mitigated by minimizing bitcoin usage to reasonable amounts for their customers.

No - they didn't directly steal any money.  They manipulated the price and made market moves that took advantage of the manipulated price.

Yes, they did rip off their clients, but they didn't steal their clients money.  They manipulated currency values ahead of when their clients made large moves so that they (the criminal traders) could profit.  That profit came out of their clients money - so they definitely were ripping them off.  But they didn't steal money out of their clients account.  They manipulated the system so that they got a better deal than their clients.

It seems to me that the value of bitcoin could be manipulated just as easily.  It is a publicly traded currency whose value goes up and down based on supply and demand.
