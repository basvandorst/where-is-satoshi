What's Coinbase's maximum sell limit? Say someone wanted to sell a hundred coins, would they cash it out?

Is this why it just corrected to 15.5? Back up now to 16.5

For a lot of investors, BTC is backed by fiat currency. Until I can buy groceries and whatnot with BTC, I'm occasionally offloading BTC to cash.

There's safer ways to hide money, I would suggest buying government bonds and putting them away in a safety deposit box. You could also open a high yield (%1.25) Barclay's savings account (UK). Also you can register a sole proprietorship, the business gets a unique tax ID, and invest your funds through that.

I just got support for btccash on Coinbase. Anything to worry about? Also they won't let me buy coins with my credit cards and I'm trying to buy the discount :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:53
You can pump, dump, and manipulate the price though.

Is 1,000,000 a realistic number for BTC to achieve? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:53:53
Pls no

What happens when people want to start cashing out? No one accepts BTC because it's crashing, and no one can sell because it's crashing.

Bitcoin still isn't mainstream. We've discussed it in 3/4 of my classes this quarter. In my marketing class, only 2/80 people had BTC. In finance, only 5/80 people had any, and in Java programming, about 10/50 had some. We're still in the early majority of adopters. Once it becomes mainstream (especially after December,) prices will continue to rise.
