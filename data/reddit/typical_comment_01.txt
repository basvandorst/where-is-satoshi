I'm gonna go and disagree.  That was an incredibly straightforward and informative question.  It's one of the least dodgy and honest things I've seen from a company of their size.
Thumbs up to Coinbase from me.  I really love your service.

1st Rule: Don't talk about downvotes.
2nd Rule: DON'T TALK ABOUT DOWNVOTES.

i dont see how that's a positive.  "I may not agree with his horrific tribalism, ethnocentrism, and elitism, but I'm going to vote for him because he speaks his mind!"
Every horrible person in history spoke their mind. Speaking your mind, having no filter, is a BAD TRAIT.

or when people respond on reddit, they're doing it after they didn't get a response.  otherwise they wouldn't be posting, and you wouldn't be making that comment.

He's pointing out that people are just reading press releases. Why?  Because some news writer just wants to get home at 7pm to see her kid before he falls asleep.  Or make it on time to a Tinder date. 
He's also cherry picking the particular stories where this happen because its humorous.  
Source.  I watched this happen in person for 18 years.  I've also been in the writers room on a top-level even satirical news show for a few years.  So I've got a few of those angles covered.
Sorry, but if the news is bad it's your fault for feeding advertisers, not the government.

or they can implement those things, and bitcoin, and just make more money.

I love these kind of comments.  Go talk to the folks writing the chryons for news.  They're compromising clarity for real-estate because they only have so many words.  Sorta like The Twitter.  
There's no shadowy figure manipulating news stories with subtle wording.  Oy.  There's definitely SOMETHING happening:  news stations want more money so they're wording things in a way that makes people more likely to read/watch.  There's no agenda, except to get eyeballs.  Blame everyone for watching before you blame the Lizard Shadow Hollow Earth People running the NWO.

Rewrite the sentence "Mt. Gox Bitcoin CEO Arrested in Japan" to include all important information with the exact same amount of space.  
There's no evil plan to deligitmize bitcoin.  There isn't enough room on the screen to write "Bitcoin Exchange Mt. Gox CEO Arrested in Japan."

It's tough, because it's sort of unfair to burn down everything that makes money.  Maybe you're seeing this in the wrong order.  It's very possible they actually believe wholeheartedly that increasing the blocksize is a bad idea.  To always assume it's strictly because they're trying to make money is a dangerous mindset.  You'll not only never trust anyone, you'll impede progress (I don't know if the blocksize increase is or isn't progress, this is a broad statement).

It's a forum made of people, and everyone is different.  Sometimes you see waves of delusion, sometimes you see waves of rationality.  It depends entirely on who makes the best arguments and who sounds the least like a yammer 15 year old.

network shows won't take any suggestions (show ideas, unsolicited scripts, etc) from the public.  If they receive anything, they're thrown directly in the trash before its opened.
This is required by their legal departments because if anything that was suggested makes it into an episode, and it can be proven that the suggestion come from a specific source, then there's the possibility of them being sued.  So anything unsolicited goes directly in the trash.
Although office production assistants usually open them for entertainment.

The echo chamber was my first concern/thought/worry as well.  But the more I thought about it, the flare is an interesting case.  Flare for people who can sign an account with bitcoin.  
Everyone else can still comment, but people actually invested will be know.  What makes it even more interesting is that the OPPOSITE of the echo chamber could also occur.  People with bitcoin could easily go one of two ways: they could feel more genuine, or more delusional.  
It's a level of transparency that could yield interesting results.

there's also the possible realization that impressive advancements in technology ≠ (necessarily) societal improvement.
The outcome of this *experiment* might be that we learn government and/or third parties are necessary in the regulation and balancing of money, and that the public much prefers it.
The cat is out of the bag, there's a choice people can make if they want it.  And we're going to slowly learn whether its worth it to people to make that choice.  
It may not be.

accuracy &lt; entertainment
sit in any writers room and you'll see, very quickly, that they're all very aware of the accurate choice, and usually throw it out for the more entertaining scenario.  First drafts of scripts are infinitely more accurate.  But accuracy doesn't add much in the way of story.  Shows like Mr Robot pull it off, but really they probably don't need to.  If they were typing "X:/drive/computer/secretplace.execute" I'd probably have been equally entertained.
