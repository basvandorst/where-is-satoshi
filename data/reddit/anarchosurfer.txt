How much did you have in BTC and why did you have so much in BTC?

This is huge, its saving me 5-8% each time I deposit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:31:04
My order was at Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:48:02
Ok then stay poor.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:31:29
I bought the dip at 18k.  Yes, that was the dip, hope you all got it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:35:00
You will need to get into alts to do that.  Binance or Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:40:20
Bank wires ftw.  Funds come same day if you get the wire in early enough.

Seems like a fail if you are going to have to deal with tax bullshit.
@_date: 2016-01-04 05:31:12
Taxation is part of a religion called Statism.

Those damn Russians again!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:03:34
Russian trolls are irrelevant and had no effect on 2016.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:19:27
That's what kept me from using them.  Too many hoops to jump through.

I remember that thread.  Solid hodl.

Why is this downvoted?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:38:28
Why does s2x cancelling lead to the moon?  I thought the fork was what was causing the spike because people wanted free fork coins.

Unrelated.  It was a trans thing.

in 1st world countries.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:11:01
Someone has actually already eaten their balls and it's on video.  Highly disturbing.  I hope bitcoin doesn't go to 10k in 2017.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:25:30
It is too volatile to spend.  Could be used as a currency in the future when the price stabilizes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:46:27
Yeah so does ShareBlue and Correct The Record.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:37:17
Yes poker is gambling.  Of course there aren't pros in anything that is long term -ev.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:06:38
Yeah there is, Dom is pretty good for champagne.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:50:35
Best case scenario is you make a slight gain at the cost of not sleeping well and stressing for weeks.  Not worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:41:48
Thats awesome.  Do you think you could make a version with a star of david on the jewish guys?

No coiners love to talk about how it's all going to come crashing down.  It's how they cope.

Russian troll farms are a thing now lol?  It's called shilling, why do we always have to blame muh Russians?

How is a Canadian Nationalist platform ignorance?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:55:37
That was because of mtgox.

You said no professional gamblers exist, which is false.  I didnt say whether or not day traders are profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:13:45
No way to know what long term will do.  We have seen massive gains this year.  May as well just get the $500 for her if its not like she needs the money.

Spoken like someone who takes first world lifestyle for granted.

You know hitler kicked the globalist central bankers out of Germany right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:06:07
Yep, I wouldn't buy dom.  I had it for free.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:44:54
My bright idea was sell at 6400 to rebuy 5900.  Seemed so reasonable and not risky.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:48:31
Wait you mean socialism failed?  Im Shocked.
@_date: 2015-11-10 08:11:28
Yes but there is also the concern of a bail in or confiscation, and the risk of stock market collapse or financial meltdown.
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:01:06
So I get to pay exactly what the Amazon list price is minus the savings and I cover zero shipping?
@_date: 2015-11-16 07:27:03
Just further reason to diversify.  BTC, Silver, Gold, Lead, Beans, Etc.

pretty cool, did you use surfboard/boat resin?

Why cant there be a 1 week bubble?
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:49:26
24 hours later were hovering around $375, will it drop any more?

When bitcoin is made illegal is when you need it the most, DUCY?
@_date: 2015-11-16 02:27:12
Can you explain this more simply? I dont understand.
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:03:42
Winning Poker Network accpets BTC deposit and withdraw.  A recent tournament winner got 80k+ in BTC cashed out.
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:53:35
Regulations are always bad because they are based on aggressive use of force.
@_date: 2015-11-08 04:00:26
20% is a lot. Im trying to get a feel for where the price is at after the recent spike, not saying where in a rally or not.  Good point though.
@_date: 2015-11-22 07:04:35
Ans a jew too.  I disregard anything a jew tells me about economics and capitalism.
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:03:36
Waiting 4 days now to get 20% and still no buyer.  Just keep waiting or what?
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:49:53
No.  Socialism does not help the working man.  Denying access to employment (by regulating or banning Uber) does not help those who are struggling to make a living.
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:21:21
I meant that each individual fiat currency is doomed, not fiat currency as a whole.
Why pay $5500 a year into a dying, devaluing currency like the USD which may not even exist in 30 years?  Instead I could use those funds to invest in hard assets like metals or real estate.
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:24:27
A friend of mine bought a 66 bronco on eBay but when he went to register it, it was actually a 65 bronco.  So he got his money back from eBay and got to keep the bronco.
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:14:34
I love hearing these stories.  How did he get the 13000 coins?
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:15:53
So where is the safe haven during the deflation period?  All hard assets will go down in price, so do we just hold cash and BTC and then buy hard assets after the deflation?
@_date: 2015-11-13 19:26:10
Americas fiat money is not 100 years old and the current growth is debt based, unsustainable and leading to a major economic meltdown.
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:03:23
How will the btc economy grow first?
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:35:50
So I should be buying right now?  Don't wait for $2xx?
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:36:36
TFW you started getting into BTC a week ago and have been waiting on limit increases.
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:31:39
And Pokerstars is rigged too huh?
@_date: 2015-11-10 03:16:53
Im not giving any advice I am trying to learn.  You are right I guess the currency wouldnt matter because the account would be invested in stocks etc.  In that case I am putting my faith into the stock market and also hoping there is no bail in like what happened in Cyprus.
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:53:38
So what is?  And how do I put in a limit order on coinbase or circle?
@_date: 2015-11-08 03:00:20
This plan supports the federal reserve system so I vote no.
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:57:24
100 million Americans are on some form of welfare, not sure how that isnt socialism for "us"
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:15:12
I was gonna get in for 10k a few weeks ago when btc was under $300, kicking myself for procrastinating.
@_date: 2015-11-13 16:11:04
You are wrong here.  in ROW (Pstars) the games are horrid, and Pstars is trying to kill off the regs by reducing the VIP program.  In USA, casual players are doing just fine.  And no casual player would get a vpn to get crushed on stars, they would be much more likely to connect coinbase to their checking account to buy BTC and go gamble.  WPN already does BTC withdrawal and deposit.
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:10:29
The dollar is relevant because the investment holdings would be with companies that depend on the dollar.  How do you think their earnings will be with a massively devalued dollar?  So even if you were to cashout the IRA into a difference currency, the shares wont be worth much because the markets will have crashed.
@_date: 2015-11-11 06:46:13
All of you bragging about selling at the top, isnt that what causes the crash?  If you believe in BTC why bank your win so early?
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:58:16
Where will the floor be until then?  I am ready to get in but will it drop closer to $300 before the rally continues?
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:05:58
So I should set my limit order to $305?
@_date: 2015-11-10 04:19:31
And did what with it?
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:54:54
I am, and was planning on doing that before this bubble but taking a while to get fiat to an exchange. So now that I missed the bubble I am speculating when to buy.
@_date: 2015-11-05 05:31:38
Any data or statistical analysis to go with this?
@_date: 2015-11-11 06:29:24
Yep this is a bear trap.  I have a nice size wire going through tomorrow, I am one of those new people lined up for BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:47:27
Back in online poker's heydays one of the biggest backers accidentally sent $1k to the wrong player and pokerstars did nothing to reverse it.  It was funny, some people got very butthurt over it.
@_date: 2015-11-07 06:03:28
Im in the USA, is itbit safe?
@_date: 2015-11-06 01:39:27
Where will the next floor be?  over or under $350?
@_date: 2015-11-09 03:17:46
Well then fuck them for thinking they are entitled to a free education.
@_date: 2015-11-06 06:25:43
Fair enough, but I would have to consider the value nearly doubling as a little more than violent fluctuations.
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:56:36
Who pays shipping? I have Prime so I get free 2 day shipping on tons of stuff.

I never disputed corporate welfare.  They are both immoral.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:28:56
So what is the solution?
Also you spelled dilemma wrong.

I dont know exactly what he did, but he was able to fix it pretty quick.
