Adding: I have a coinbase and GDAX account. I also use several others. Coinbase is certainly not my favorite - with limited options, no margin, high fees. But I appreciate it for what it is. It allows pikers to enter the market. Folks who don’t have sufficient equity or fiat to open a proper trading account.
It’s the etrade of crypto. And it has it’s place in the market.
Without KYC, they won’t survive. No exchange will. 
And then all that will be left are the clandestine untrustowrthy exchanges the end. And big money won’t play in that space.
This nascent thing we’re engaged in needs to mature. This is part of that process.
It’s not the exchanges fault either. They’re playing on the field created by governments. Pay your taxes and don’t launder money - you can play too.
The rules aren’t complicated.
And none of this has anything to do with centralizing. Don’t mix the two up.

Indeed. I use GDAX for some stuff.
I use others for other stuff. Depends on the token/coin/currency. I also take advantage of arbitrage. Buy on one exchange, sell on another. The fact that that is so easy says enough. This market NEEDS to be legitimatized if its going to continue.
But I pay my taxes and got nothing to hide. Check my ID - long hair don’t care.
And to someone else’s point in this thread: you inevitably need fiat to buy - and it will eventually be converted to fiat. Your banks know who you are. Who cares if the crypto exchange does too?

Not sure why everyone is freaking out. Follow me here...
You need ID to open most exchange accounts. Reason is obvious: KYC - fraud, laundering, terror, taxes, etc.
Using an exchange centralizes the transaction. You don’t “own” the currency unless/until you own the keys - which requires you to move it into your own custody (paper, hardware, etc). 
However, all this talk of “centralizing the currency” is FUD. It’s still a decentralized currency. Coinbase won’t become a “central bank” because it cannot control the monetary supply. It can’t print or destroy coins.
Decentralization doesn’t mean “anonymous”. It means what it says: DECENTRlLIZED.
I view this as a positive. The more mainstream crypto becomes, the better. It’s not controlled by central banks or governments.
The exchanges, however, are. Why? Because, at the end of the day, the exchanges are dealing in FIAT. Exchange crypto for local currency, and vice versa. Once fiat enters the mix, so do governments. They don’t want money used for nefarious purposes or tax evasion. 
If that’s what your into, then by all means, don’t use one of the mainstream exchanges. Trade coins anonymously on the web - use exchanges that are unregulated. Spoof your IP. Print paper wallets. Go through enormous lengths to anonymously transact. That actually pushes mainstream away.
And at the end of the day - you can do all that. But eventually you’re going to want to trade it in for fiat. But guess what will happen? Banks will stop accepting incoming wires from unknown, untrusted, or unregulated exchanges. Then what?
You’ll have to come back to a trusted, regulated, known exchange. And show your ID.
The exchange and conversion to fiat has nothing to do with the centralization of a currency. It has to do with AML and tax evasion related to the local fiat.
Flame on. Downvote. Delete. Don’t care. That’s one thing a out Reddit that drives me batshit - any opposing view is sanctioned into oblivion. So much for the decentralization of free opinion...

Eh - agree to disagree. Digicash, created in 1990, put forth the first digital transaction using crypto in 1994. By 1999 they were bankrupt. The tech wasn’t a failure - they went bankrupt due to the “chicken or the egg” scenario. They couldn’t line up enough retailers to accept the currency, therefore any potential consumers lost interest. Back then, not many people transacted online. The idea was ahead of it’s time.
The US markets were also solid during this time. People’s faith in USD, and banks in general, were strong. There was no “need” for people to create exchanges to trade Digicash in the off chance that the experiment took off. Not many ordinary people could even comprehend how the tech even worked. Compared to today, not many people were even using email at the time, much less ready to transact online for goods and services. Hotmail didn’t even launch until 1996; two years after the first Digicash transaction. Heck, Yahoo wasn’t created until 1994. The internet was not nearly as commonplace as it is today. Not a very friendly era to any crypto. 
Bitcoin is superior to Digicash - no doubt. But it also came around almost 20 years later and at a time that e-commerce was rampant and also in the year following one of the worst financial markets the world had seen in nearly 80 years. Better tech - but even better timing. 
In other words - Tech superiority aside - If Bitcoin came about in 1990, it too would have failed. There simply wasn’t enough market support at that time. If Digicash would have launched in 2009 (even with inferior tech), it would probably still be around today; even if it were overtaken by a better “coin”.

@_date: 2018-06-04 02:23:39
Totally agree Bitcoin would have pounced Digicash for this very reason.
But I think also in nearly 20 years time, Digicash might have solved the problem if it were able to survive long enough. The pure reason for it’s failure was not due to tech, but due to market timing. Even if Bitcoin, with better tech, launched in 1990; I believe it would have failed. There simply wasn’t enough support, knowledge, application, or need at the time.  That’s all I’m saying. 
Good chat. Nice to meet someone else who knows a bit more about crypto besides “moon” and “lambo”. :)

Watch the documentary “Betting on Bitcoin”. Pretty sure it’s still on Netflix. Explains a bit of the crypto backstory - starting with the several others BEFORE Bitcoin. Market wasn’t ready for those at the time. Bitcoin coincided with the 2008 financial meltdown. People were ready by then. There was already a small group with esoteric knowledge about crypto - it spread from there.

The whole things makes the whole thing less credible. Stereotyping millions of people into very defined categories based on one person’s opinion. Overusing words (and some incorrectly) in a likely attempt to sound intelligent. Projecting failure upon everyone. OP talking like they are enlightened or somehow smarter/better/faster/stronger than anyone else. Offering literally nothing of value in anything said.
A shitpost, basically.

Please dont do it. For every one person who thinks its cool another several will see it as trashy. Nobody is going to see a BTC sticker and think “Now that Ive seen that Im convinced.”
Stickers and graffiti are for thugs and garage bands. It makes the community trashy.  If you want to paint a mural thats different. Thats art. But get building owner permission. Otherwise your “statement” about “financial freedom” directly infringes the rights of another. And thats just ironic.
Billboards and bus benches are cheap these days. You want to spread awareness then rent one of those and do it there. Otherwise let the market become self aware.

That’s an immovable object meeting an unstoppable force. The encounter could create a time paradox, the result of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe! 
Granted, that's worst-case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy.

Pretty much this. Basically ‘legitimizing’ BTC and lowering the entry barrier. 
Assuming youre long- the good side of BTC ETF is that it not only opens it up to more individuals but also puts institutional money in. Assuming its a true ETF (and not a note imitator) then this means shares of the ETF will be backed by actual BTC, potentially driving price of BTC higher. It might also even out some of the whale manipulation. 
The bad side of an ETF is that the tail might begin to wag the dog. BTC is interesting because like someone pointed out already: you dont really need an ETF to make it easier to exchange. GLD ETF brought some liquidity to gold. Made it easier to exchange. Gold ETFs on the whole have been so attractive that many investors are now flocking to gold itself- and away from the companies that mine it. Im reasonably confident BTC will still be mined because its far less expensive and less risky in relation to mining for gold. However a BTC ETF could probably damage BTC exchanges. Which then transfers more power to the ETF in determining BTC price. And with lower barriers and institutional money in it- who knows what effect that will have on BTC.
All in theory of course.
Personally I welcome an ETF. If for no other reason than it legitimatizes the thing once and for all. Will be interesting to see how everything plays out.

Youre probably going to generally get advice about not investing what you cant afford to lose. Taking a loan is not usually a great strategy.
From one internet stranger to another, I think its a bad idea. Especially as an unsecured loan. Especially for something as volatile as crypto.
Bonus advice: try not to fall victim to the low/affordable monthly payment. Instead look at how much youre paying total.
So if BTC tanks: yeah you can afford $200 a month. But how does it feel losing $10k plus interest?
This is how credit card companies and car dealers sucker people into taking more debt than necessary. The monthly payment. 
Personally I doubt BTC drops to $0. Im bullish and hold long positions. But its also a very volatile thing and I wouldnt be comfortable buying it on loan. Especially unsecured loan. YMMV. Good luck either way!

Good point on the min investment. I should have clarified that Im speaking about ETF in general not this specific one. I think this one will lead to others. Similar to other ETFs.
Good point though.
