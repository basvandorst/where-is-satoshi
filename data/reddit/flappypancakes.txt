Also the bitcoind server is going to be local most likely so theft couldn't happen. The problem is how can i sync between servers and have lets say the web server request a payment that the bitcoind server processes and completes

I can't learn if I don't try, nor will I if no one helps. Simple as that

I want to start a bitcoin only shop. It'd be good to have more shops available.

Bitcoind has an API which I know how to use. The main thing is how I can have the servers connect to each other and have the website pull and push requests/data to use the bitcoind api

I didn't say I was going to put it into action right this instant. Of course I'd work on it until I understand it fully. That's plainly obvious

Thing is it's not a one time payment. Each user has their own wallet and can send coins in or take them out whenever they want to. 
So they have a balance/credit. I cant do that with bit pay or the other one. It'd have to store private keys as well.
My main thing is how I would connect the three VPSs to work together securely

Because it's going to be almost like an auction for people to auction antiques and generally things they don't want/need.
Each person who bids has their wallet and the seller has a wallet so they can fill and take out as they please

There are certain reasons. That's not the point. I'm not here to publicize an in progress business model. Only trying to get help on how to implement a certain feature. Don't be so quick to judge and put all that FUD to actually help others.

I'm not new to the whole web design just the bitcoin implementation. I just need some help in the right direction.
