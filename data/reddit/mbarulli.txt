Good idea! Thanks!

When you do something with passion and money is not your first goal, it's quite easy to keep going. :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:16:17
Same here. I hope it won't take that long to answer my support  ticket.
@_date: 2014-08-05 14:59:01
That's always true! :)
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:56:48
Quite the opposite! The code is pretty clean and consistent (check it for yourself here:  but the overall architecture is quite complex. Clipperz is a single-page web app where everything is built from JS code: app logic, UI, crypto algorithms, ...
Therefore we don't expect any new developer to be productive without a proper understanding. That's why we offer the 3 months mentorship.
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:01:45
Quite true. 
After being offered for free for 7 years, Clipperz is now going to become a paid service. Clipperz is going to accept only Bitcoins because we don't want to know the identity of our users. 
This is also the reason we offered Clipperz for free up until now.

Will Clipperz be able to generate enough revenues? Will Clipperz shares have some values in the future? Honestly I don't know. :)

Yes, I agree the salary is pretty low. That's why we are going to be very generous with company shares (up to 10%-15%). I understand that many may not be interested in our proposal, but this is what we can offer today. At Clipperz we embraced transparency as a rule from code to financials ( and I hope you appreciate that.
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:52:27
Absolutely! :)
Btw, those are just placeholders to be filled with decent screenshots of the upcoming release.

The pricing will certainly consider the exchange rate and once we launch the paid plans (next month?), we are definitely going to update the prices.
However, we won't have and show a fixed USD/EUR pricing.
We would like to stay in the bitcoin economy as much as we can. :)

Three days later I managed to move my bitcoins out of Coinbase. I will hardly recommend them to anyone ... 
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:07:05
Just to say thanks for your attention to our story and the interesting comments and advices.
A special thanks to those that are sending BTC donations! Very much welcome and appreciated.
I'll keep this forum updated of any further development.
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:08:14
As I answered to similar objections we are going to update our prices soon. For the time being (and since 2007) the service is FREE, for a lifetime. No strings attached.

The article itself is not really that interesting, but the fact that was so prominently displayed could eventually make more people in Italy aware of this alternative currency.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:24:17
Yes, really.
Do you see something that looks like a scam or worse?

I'm the Clipperz co-founder and I'd like to tell more about the reasons to adopt BTC as the only payment method.
Basically it boils down to: Clipperz doesn’t want to know your real name.
Why is anonymity so important for Clipperz users?
Because linking your encrypted data stored with Clipperz to your real identity widens the range of potential attacks. Attackers could gain information about the plaintext and target the cryptography defending your data and, more likely, they could enact social engineering strategies. Your security perimeter will be much larger and more difficult to protect. That’s why Clipperz doesn’t want to know you!
The only viable option to achieve this is using Bitcoin! If you bought your subscription to Clipperz using a credit card or a Paypal account, then inevitably your name (and probably street address, email, phone number, …) would end up linked to your encrypted data.
On the other hand, paying with bitcoins is like paying with cash. It’s as if we received your money as banknotes in an blank envelope in our mailbox. Then to anonymously activate your Clipperz account, you would have to enter the serial numbers of those banknotes. Bitcoin makes this rather cumbersome process a breeze.

We want to remain subject to Italian/EU laws.
We are not escaping the law.
We are just trying to keep Clipperz up and running as a service and a website. Because we are not doing anything wrong and because of the thousands of users relying on it.
And being hosted in the US (at a company with a EU safe-harbor agreement in place) makes it very easy for an Italian court to close the service down. This is why we moved.
We do have a lawyer that will help us (if necessary) to fight our battle.

The pricing will certainly consider the current exchange rate. Once we launch the paid plans (next month?), we are definitely going to update the prices.

Great nickname! :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:58:31
Same here. After almost 24 hours: no fix to the problem, no answers to my email messages.
Is Coinbase a joke? Paul Graham where are you?
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:53:40
See my answer above to the same objection.
@_date: 2013-05-16 07:02:39
Take a look at [Clipperz.com]( 
It's a web based digital vault and password manager. It's a pure web app, completely anonymous. You can review the code and even install it on your own server. And you can [donate bitcoins]( to the developers! (Full disclaimer: I'm a co-founder.)
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:33:25
That's quite likely. :)
We didn't run Clipperz for 8 years because of profits, but because we like the idea of powerful but easy to use crypto in the browser.
And we still love web crypto (and therefore Bitcoin)!
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:31:33
Yes, we are waiting to have screenshots of the new version. It will have a completely different interface and we did not want to confuse users. However I concede it doesn't look very professional. (you can get a glimpse of the new interface here: 
Clipperz is running smoothly since April 2007, but the current website has been completely redesigned few months ago and still not completed.
The placeholder it's not from a template (it runs on Octopress), it is an explicit reminder to me. :)
