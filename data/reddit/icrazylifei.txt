Cool story pls tell me more
@_date: 2019-03-21 20:30:47
Was just gonna say the same thing
@_date: 2019-03-11 05:12:36
People will be more worried about them selves and family then making sure your getting electricity pal lol
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:31:13
If you have the keys i guess its yours :/
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:16:15
What guarantees that u will pay out and not take off with every ones stake
@_date: 2019-03-25 17:22:06
I to believe you miss read the article.
But all in all, one day we will be dead everything will be irrelevant, years and years will pass until no one remembers you and the earth is populated by new creatures. Time will take everything.
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:20:44
However there wouldnt be a need for this excess power if no one needed to mine, I think the biggest argument for the no coinners is they deem mining a worthless endeavor in itself, that we don't need cryptocoins and any electricity used for it is a waste regardless of how eco friendly it is sourced
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:53:28
Regardless of what you prefer, you wont find to many who want your paypal
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:01:27
Pal, by the sounds of it you have enough bitcoin.
If bitcoin takes over as a global currency even if you got .1 or .2 btc your gonna be doing all right, if you got more then your set.
Just try  look at it like that, that in the event fiat fails bitcoin is gonna skyrocket, and you are all ready setup to be well off. Then you can start focusing on paying your other debts.
I mean i got a fairly low number of btc, but i know if it takes off, im gonna have more money then i got saved now lol, so i paused on investing anymore.
However if btc fails, im happy knowing ive wasted alot more cash on other dumb stuff and im not exactly rich anyway so id just carry on as normal with out caring to much.
Only invest what your willing to lose are the wise old words I learnt in my life time
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:56:15
Take this picture for what its worth, but btc has some work to do.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:58:13
Fair enough, i honestly just quick read it when i seen and didnt delve to hard into it
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:15:16
Yeah theres always gonna be something else to come along
@_date: 2019-04-11 06:11:26
Looks like you just put text over a image, In fact I think I may be a little Einstein here and that body was was not purposely made for bitmex traders at all.
@_date: 2019-04-25 09:24:56
Its not just an opinion, its a good opinion.
To many people these days are like;
"Huuurrrrrr duurrrrrr look at my creation I'm so special worship me in comments and karma"
Just a shirt mate.
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:15:51
There 5 - 8 years old, were you expecting some sort of political, ethical debate about space and time and the meaning of life? Just let them be kids.
As they go through life and require a source of value to exchange for goods they will naturally get involved with what they deem best at the time ;) 
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:17:54
That one got me too,
I mean, I've met some people who got there education out of a cereal box, but how did you come up with that one?
Almost feels like a troll post to even mention that, to go from going to bash some one then throwing in Russia next to Japan to forgive and god

So you seen a random begging note on a window and decided it has to be thrown up on reddit for all to see?
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:10:28
Haha, i see a man saving a bunch of babies from falling.
Question is why are so many babies falling from the sky?

Hey every one I have bitcoin, follow me home and put a drill to my head!

"an individual animal, plant, or single-celled life form."
Unless your a god or a scientist doing some illegal stuff, I don't think just anyone could create an organism that distributes new bitcoins, unless you give birth to a biological thing that mines the bitcoins/collects them then distributes them himself.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Internet goes goes, *cant access my bitcoin*
Technical things go down pal. You can get through this.
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:40:14
I'd hope not.
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:05:47
Don't be so childish you man baby.
I hope you're burned a live, does having no one care about you make you so bitter?
Coinbase has no obligations to you, if you don't like it don't use it. Super simple stuff.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:13:06
Whats a nodl?
A node? The hodl thing generally only works if it all ready has a L in it..
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:56:51
LOL, careful of them contrails pal.
@_date: 2019-04-18 12:14:43
Not sure why it would be funny, but im certainly vibing with it

No mate, people actually do.
Facebook does not force anyone to sign up.
If people just read the T and C's of what they agree too there wouldn't be a surprise.

Not intelligent enough for a news and media website, its a bot boys
@_date: 2019-04-11 09:39:26
Yeah nah.
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:19:10
Im not trying to argue, I'm telling you facts.
You're  asking for people to be burned alive for a service that has no obligation to you.
If people want to use coinbase they can, they can also choose not to if they don't like it.
Coinbase has no obligation to change for you.
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:24:52
Haha no.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:25:26
Why make a bet on something you don't know about?
Either way I apologise as I only commented to ask a question and honestly have no idea about bitcoin in Rome.
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:27:47
What i don't get is why have the helmet if his not gonna wear it :/
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:06:40
I assure you, there is simpler methods to fuck with people en mass then 5g.
Just make your self a magnetic field to go with your tinfoil hat and go live in the sticks if your that worried, coz technology is only gonna get more crazier from here on out.
And if it is real, meh not much i can do but accept my 5g overlords, better then living with anxiety 24/7
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:46:07

@_date: 2019-04-03 13:45:08
Its certainly in the running for worst ever :/
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:40:42
So the robots have money now and investing 3.5mill before the pesky humans?
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:15:46
Yeah sorta figured that, but if you want something done properly learn to do it yourself and own it, dont rely on others to Finnish what you start :p
Apology accepted ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:16:54
Clearly not related to bitcoin :/ don't understand what your trying to insinuate 
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:49:38
Yeah they have no idea what there doing and you do, good one.
If you honestly think the usa is gonna just one day swap over to bitcoin and everything is gonna be fine, ull wake up and make ur coffe play ur video games online etc... think again pal.
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:03:16
Maybe the sticky is there to stop the endless price shit posting.
either way the reddit owners and mods can post and sticky as they please, you do not own this reddit.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:23:32
Probably not healthy but each to there own
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:30:27
Trust me, once no one can afford 1 bitcoin, we will just adopt a new coin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:34:31
Yeah nah
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:03:13
The more things we find out that change the way people thought how the world work, anxiety and depression increase
@_date: 2019-05-22 09:24:53
Just thinking they were not does not make it true. Welcome to the real world.
Can you please provide evidence they weren't?
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:58:16
A website with a counter
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:51:38
Do they ever learn?
Well hope it all works out for you!
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:51:52
It would give more credibility, I can come across as a bit of an ass, but I just don't trust humans honesty much these days

I see alot of market manipulation to liquidate alot of people. Get ur popcorn ready guys
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:38:19
I concur.
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:19:44
Far as im concerned you edited the print offs to make them look bad.
But I have no idea whats going on here so disregard me!
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:18:02
Far far from a secondary, it shouldnt even be considered as a concern at this level of situation
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:14:35
If u know its a shit post why shit post no one cares
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:24:33
Why dont they just buy bitcoin with their millions of dollars? Im sure whoever pays them the money dont have bitcoins to even pay them :/
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:42:04
No, you are not the only one. The world doesn't revolve around you.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:59:21

Just keep HODLing.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:02:15
If i was a us citizen id be scared of that fallout of bitcoin destroying thr gov.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:49:50
Thats what the no coiners said before bitcoin went main, every other coin is fair game to attempt to take what ever on I say
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:49:17
I hate to be a pessimist, but nothing lasts forever. But you can try ;)
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:06:14
They should, but i feel this will also effect every one in the USA if the government collapsed. Wild west.
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:20:39
The perceived reality of free will is certainly up for debate
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:47:05
Or this the real scam for sympathy donations?
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:50:08
Shit post like everyone else :/
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:21:56
Buy 1 btc??
More of a status then a actual club imo
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:02:12
Its not exactly irrational. If bitcoin does have an effect on the US dollar it will tear to shreds the USA's power as the mightiest nation.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:12:34
Same with fiat, no one forces you, ita just really damm handy if you want to live a well-off life.
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:56:32
Depends what 120 is worth to you, for me thats nothing id just hold, personally
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:11:31
More coins in circulation
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:25:26
Id go half in bitcoin and rest in non crypto assets
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:47:07
The next generation who a born with out crypto and will need to work hard to service the bitcoin whale lords.
These new people will get sick of all the old coiners controlling everything and never having to work for anything, they will revult.
They will create a new crypto coin, all the old coiners will laugh and say how stupid there new fake crypto coin is, and how bitcoin is the only real cryptocoin.
But the new coiners will laugh back, for the new generation dont care or believe in bitcoin, they believe in there new coin so they can get rich for doing nothing and teach those old coinsters a lesson.
Thus the cycle completes
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:40:52
Yeah, shouldn't it read:
Its secure until its hacked?
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:22:09
All hail whanos, he cometh.
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:21:01
So what?
What was so exciting about you finding that out that you just had to create a post about it?
Was your plan to blow our minds with some crazy information and nothing will ever be the same again?
@_date: 2019-05-01 09:42:56
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:34:56
This is far from a digital utopia.
More trash on the internet needs to be cencored.
But each to there own i guess
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:00:59
Well, I have no idea were you're from, but who ever is lending like that is insane, that or they are getting some sort of benefit from doing it
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:54:32
You see, once all the bitcoins are mined and big whales just hodl, the exact same thing that bitcoin is doing to fiat will happen to bitcoin, the new generation will steal the wealth from the old hahaha
And if your to stupid to think it wont, guess your as dumb as the fiat banksters?
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:32:28
The US can just print enough money to buy infinity hash power.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:11:29
Somethjng needs to change, but i dont think a sudden BTC take over will be good for the USA

Im sure having a loan written off will have more repercussions like with future borrowing etc...
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:14:57
Forgive me for my retardedness, I only care about bitcoin and never look at anything else.
Is tether only traded on bitfinex, and how hard would it be for them to just fudge numbers of what its trading at.
And could they just use bots to pretend trade to prop it up fooling people into thinking everything is fine?
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:27:18
No, no you do not.
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:23:33
Yeah nah, ita pretty clear bots and and manipulation is happening to bitcoin and other coins.
Weather you are bothered by it or not is upto you.
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:54:22
You see, once all the bitcoins are mined and big whales just hodl, the exact same thing that bitcoin is doing to fiat will happen to bitcoin, the new generation will steal the wealth from the old hahaha

Id find where you lived, hide in a bush with my battery makkita drill with 8mm drill bit, ambush you when you got home and torture you with my drill until you sent the btc into a wallet I owned before I quietly slip away into the gentle night
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:37:45
Bout time you learn you dont have to pay anything.
However if you choose to live off the assets  that were built with fiat, the Gov man will hunt you down.
Nothing is forced. It comes highly recommended.

Wtf do I win, and it better be good if I have to wait till 2029.
