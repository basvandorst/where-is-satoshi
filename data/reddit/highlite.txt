After a couple years of this, you realize these dips are what you are waiting for.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:46:23
They are mad they sold
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:14:44
Lol; you have no clue
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:46:02
It means you’re rich!!
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:12:10
You must be new

Bitcoin doesn't care what governments think
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:35:18
Look into $BAT and the Brave project. It is made by the guy who invented Javascript and Firefox.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:26:09
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:58:49
Just curious, which alt-coins are most popular in your experience?
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:40:12
Wow that is terrible. Thanks for sharing and good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:31
Gemini 
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:53:55
I honestly never thought someone would actually fall for one of these scams! Sorry to hear that dude oof.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:13:17
Yeah! You tell him! And the internet is just a fad! And get off my lawn too!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:03:41
Yes, this is an obvious noob who needs to stay out of crypto investing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:56:31
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:53:50
Wow, you obviously know nothing about mining gold.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:36:46
Of course! Though a lot of people on this sub dont talk about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:32:58
My crystal ball told me you post this multiple times on multiple threads. Get out of here shill.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:57
There are many apps that you can check prices and set alerts when certain prices are hit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:34
Because it is just used to spread fear and it never even happened!
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:38:42
Convert it immediately to usd.

He is an ass because he proved you are just making things up and talking out your ass? SMH
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:49:56
This poor man; just leave him alone already
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:17:22
Much better than a lambo 
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:34:58
You must be new
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:57:55
Me too - thanks for this.
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:57:47
Good luck man; sounds awesome.
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:12:13
What a clown
@_date: 2019-08-13 02:36:13
Smart move; welcome!
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:50:02
Lost all my crypto friends during the 2018 winter. They bought high and sold low.  I was the only hodler and now they REALLY dont want to hear anything about it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:06:55
Found the buttcoiner
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:37:28
It’s like sending your grandson an email, but instead of a letter it is money.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:14:11
Gemini auctions
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:52:23
Why not both?
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:51:46
Anytime I used Bitpay it took an unusually long time. Just be patient...

This isnt your friends and family investing, it is institutional money this time. Big Money.  
CashApp is buying 10% of it for their users.  
Grayscale is buying 21% of it for their investors.
Also the some of the biggest companies in the world are now integrating it and building on it:
JPMorgan Chase
Bank of America
Walt Disney
Wells Fargo
Bank of China
Morgan Stanley
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:38:24
Institutional money coming in now instead of mainstream media hype
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:45:56
Some people use it; for instance, I paid my AT&amp;T bill with it last month.  I also hold a certain amount like gold, so I see it as the best of both worlds - for payments and as a store of value.  Do you see people using gold to pay for things?
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:49:23
You will be fine. Congrats and hold onto it!
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:49:46
Next week. I have it marked on my calendar.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:23:04
��Quite the compelling argument
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:18:11
You need to use something like Gemini and buy actual bitcoin. You can buy as little or as much as you want, you dont have to buy a whole coin, just buy as much or little as you can afford. Then once you buy it, send it to your personal wallet to hold.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:53:38
You have to read their new book Bitcoin Billionaires. It tells the true story of went down with Zuckerburg. That dude is just terrible.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:57:13
yes please
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:12:45
Repost already??? Geez find something to do with your time.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:23:58
2030? Probably more like 5-10 mil per coin
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:55:08
Sounds more like hurdles for India. Bitcoin will be perfectly fine.
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:09:23
We need more memes
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:33:05
This is so cool!!
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:51:28
HAHAHAHAHHAA that’s original ��
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:58:28
Thumbnail looks like a nice grow setup. Anyways thank you for your service!
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:55:03
If you need it as time goes on, then it was not money you could afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:17:59
This guy is directly responsible for many deaths
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:00:39
Read the book "The Creature from Jekyll Island". It will explain everything.
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:45:22
This is good for Lightning™

Bitcoin miners use ASIC hardware, so no, they are not the reason.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:41:33
Lol, looks like you are full of bullshit.  Merchants will often time give discounts for users who use cash and now crypto. Keep charging things on your credit card, moron.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:16:58
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:08:55
Gemini is awesome
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:04:27
There is only one: Bitcoin (BTC)
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:30:46
Buy the mutha fuckin’ dip! Yeah boi!
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:53:03
Is it that hard to understand?  Sounds like you are the pathetic one.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:42:38
Wall street is in the game.  They are quietly scooping up all these cheap coins, then once they have more they will pump it.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:25:03
Buy high; sell low. This is a great strategy!
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:54:18
It was a gift. Enjoy it; you’re welcome.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:41:01
That’s priceless!
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:51:01
What a clown.
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:23:20
This is great
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:27:17
Not with that attitude.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:55:08
I think the last 20 years have proven this guy is wrong and a complete joke.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:16:38
What do you mean "How so"?  There are plenty of interviews and articles with Mike Novogratz where he explains the technology and why he invested in it and where he thinks it is going.  His former roommate is one of the founders of Ethereum for fuckssake.
Like I said, do your research.  You should explain to everyone here reading this why you assume Novogratz has no clue about the tech or what he's doing and back up your comments.
Get back to your schoolwork, Im done with you.

Most people down talk and make fun of things they don’t understand, even as adults. It is really sad, but I’m glad you smartened up! Congrats!
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:39:25
Thanks for sharing.  You are really nice to do that for your mother.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:05:48
Nice explanation
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:56:55
Yes, yes, yes.  Let the butthurt flow through you...
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:21:02
Yes, yes; let the butthurt flow through you.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:29:27
Thanks for your honesty and for doing this.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:23:36
Love you man!  Appreciate the hard work!!  
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:26:44
I believe the Bible, and I have absolutely no problem with Bitcoin.  In fact if you truly believe the Bible, then in the last days the antichrist will have control over who buys or sells. If you do not worship him, you cannot be "in the system".  Bitcoin was invented for this very reason, to bypass government control!  So I honestly dont understand why every christian isnt buying it up.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:15:07
Not yet...
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:09:01
Genius method for choosing your investments!
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:57:40
Novogratz knows exactly what is going on and knows the technology well.  You will learn that if you do your due diligence.   You assume a lot of things and it just makes you look like an idiot; just saying.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:16:46
I LOVE LAMP
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:51:20
I grew up before and through the internet age and I agree with you 100%.  It is like Déjà vu in a way; a very similar feeling.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:42:06
No no no, it's Bitcorn
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:34:32
We need more old men to yell at bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:39:28
It's like when famous people demand a picture be removed from the internet.  The genie is out of the bottle, son, and it's not going back in.
@_date: 2019-05-04 03:01:47
Awesome! Put it on a Trezor now.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:51:16
Just used the Bitpay option to pay this month's bill and it worked great
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:47:22
Make sure you buy BTC, the real bitcoin!
