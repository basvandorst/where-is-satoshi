Is'nt this what Spork does on Dash? I like the automated aspect. Gets rid of all the ego problems

Fully agree!!   I don't know much about crypto, but I do know if a rugby team is divided and fighting amongst themselves it's a recipe for disaster and they will end up bottom of the log. I watch some of the alt coins shooting up and i wonder how many customers and developers they are gaining from bitcoin, because that is what always happen in rugby. Get your shit together - start talking or you will start slipping down the rankings.

I'm not complaining. (well not about them taking time to write good code - I am complaining about the fighting!) I would like to know. I used to be a coder, so I know a project takes time and more than likely goes over as well. Is there a place where I can see what their plans are and how they are progressing?

Damn - I'm locked in for 2 days. Hope the fork holds off. Can anyone else confirm that this actually happened or is this FUD.

I didn't know the USA still had rockets. I thought India, Russia and China were the only ones who were still launching for the last couple of decades.

On R/btc a guy said he thinks it will go up. You think the same? And why? Because the S... has been sorted?
And how long have core been testing it?

This unending fight does wonders for BTC holdlers confidence. It would seem only a fool will HODL bitcoin.  I also notice that the continual references to S...coins have become quieter lately. Wonder why? Maybe, like me, they have changed 70% of their BTC into S...coins. BTW = I must thank r/bitcoint for convincing me to move a month ago. My one S***coin has been extremely profitable :)  Wonder how long before this gets deleted. Counting 1...2...3

Thanx - Yes, the daily discussion is good. I've been following r/bitcoin for a month now, but I think this is it. I'm not a BU or SW supporter. I support dialogue, but this reddit is definitely not the place. Censorship!!?? FGS!! In this day and age! Goodluck &amp; Goodbye

Thanx 87 - how long did it take before ETC appeared?
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:04:43
See what the market thinks about BU

Both two 'shit' coins I chose has already been around longer than that. 4+ years. Both are dynamic with new add-ons popping up nearly weekly... Mayor companies (like Microsoft and countless other billion dollar companies) choosing them above BTC's blockchain.. BTC's new developments....? Don't really hear about anything happening. Sounds like an old empire sitting on it's arse reflecting about old glories/fighting old battles over and over... doing nothing while the 'shits' are moving up.  Just the arrogance of the people here reffering to 'shit'coins all the time is what raised my suspicions in the beginning. That's what got me shopping around in the 1st place. Arrogance is a sure sign of decline.
Keep on fighting with each other. The longer you waste time, the more people move over to my 'shit'coins and the more money I make :)

Ok kill me. I'm a NOOb and on the Poloniex 24hr/5min graph the drop looked very dramatic - go and have a look. Whole day I've been watching and wondering why BTC is not climbing and wondering if they will be able to keep a lid on the decision. Here in South Africa news always leak. As for FUD to short - forget it! I do know enough to stay away from the Margin box, but that is all.

China - Oh that miserable country that don't start wars and kill millions of people just to get their claws on raw materials and oil.  Uh Yup...?

Luckily I just had dinner :)

THANX!!!  Did us all a great favour. What happens after a fork and I have my BTC on polonix. After hours/days there is suddenly a new coin, BTU or whatever and magically I have the same number of BTC and BTU. How long did it take for ETC to appear... immediately.. days?
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:35:12
Thanx Yoda - handy site that :)

Keep that video for when you are old - worth more than all the coins you hold :)

You are confusing me. Each of his ideas were logically explained and followed in a logical flow from A to Z. Maybe some of the terminology is new and confusing to you? Google them - nothing new or confusing there. I found the talk balanced, illuminating and to the point - that is what makes him one of the best crypto speakers.

I've got things spread over a number of exchanges, but I wanted to get out of the coin (won't say which) that I have on Polo and invest in one of the new rising Alts that is not listed on Polo. Polo only allows $2000 daily withdrawal on a basic account. I needed the $25,000 limit to get rid of the *** coin I had on Polo - change it to BTC and move to the new exchange. Explanation for the newbie higher up.
I.o.w: don't use Polo or 1st upgrade your account before you do. Their poor service might bite you in the **se when you need speed. WTF just stay away from them. Can't trust them. This is a very basic thing. What happens if things really go wrong? Fork etc.
