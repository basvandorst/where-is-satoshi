No no no that's not how it works! You are innocent, it's the money being arrested and charged!
See you are still innocent until proven guilty!!
Civil asset forfeiture is a bunch of bullshit

It's a lot of work, but it can be polished to remove most scratches. After too much thickness is removed a new layer can be added, but if it's not cleaned properly before hand you can have the 2 layers of resin delaminate.

Doubling down is just a term from gambling used because investing in a volatile unregulated market is gambling. What they are doing is not necessarily doubling their holding, but buying at lower values to bring the average price of their holdings down. It's actually a very common tactic with stocks when you are planning on going long (hodling).  What it does is give a slight bit of extra security if you are wrong on your long term projection, get cold feet and want to exit, or need to cash out your holdings for any reason, then if the market value is at or above your average, you break even despite that you bought some at $19,000.
The math (using round numbers for simplicity).  You get all excited over the moon rocket and buy in with 1.0btc at $17,000.  You miss the exit at 19,200 and decide to hodl. You see it crash to $10,000. Instead of panicking You spend less cash than before but now buy 1.5btc.  Your average price is now (17000×1+10000×1.5)/(1+1.5)=12800.  So despite buying so much at a high price the average cost is now 12,800. Now instead of having to wait to get back to $17,000 to break even if btc reaches 12800 you can cash out and not lose a penny and reaching 17000 means lots of profits, and if the moon? Get your lambos ready.

Yup, mom, aunt, and uncle are all residential real estate appraisers. They saw the shit flying long before it hit the fan. They warned me in 2004/5 that a housing market crash was going to happen because of the subprime loans and was going to be exaggerated by the fact loan officers were pretty much forcing appraisers to appraise houses WELL above market value (Bank of America was the worst). If an appraiser wouldn't give a bank the value they wanted that appraiser stopped getting work from that bank.  Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac were the spark and major banks were the gasoline.

What options are available to make arbitrage easier if I can physically travel to S. Korea whenever I want?  The amounts are relatively small, I would be travelling for amounts around $2-5000. I only mine about $50/day but I can fly to S. Korea whenever I like for free. Since the flight is free getting an extra 20-30% payout is well worth a few days visiting Seoul.

Unless you go to the factory and watch it get made yourself buying direct from manufacturer is the safest bet. Buying from anyone else is putting extra steps, extra people, and extra time in the process.
Plus if you can't get it safely straight from the manufacturer, then you can't get it safely from anyone else.... because anywhere you get it they got it from the manufacturer.

They dont have to spit, the spit is showing that they are producing saliva, and that means the nicotine and other chemicals have mixed into it bypassing the main layer of protection in the mouth allowing for faster absorption.

[All substances are absorbed through the skin to some degree.](  Fat cells have nothing to do with it, all skin uses lipids (aka fats) for its structure just to exist. Doesn't matter if it's your arm or your mouth.  You more easily absorb molecules in your mouth because you dont have as thick a layer of dead skin as it depends more on saliva and mucous membranes for protection.
Just a few puffs in the mouth is too low to mix the smoke with saliva to let it absorb. Ever notice tobacco chewers spit a lot? Besides being disgusting that's necessary to get the nicotine in contact with the skin in the mouth and allow the absorption to occur, otherwise chewing would be as effective putting a piece of tobacco on your arm. 
When I smoke a cigar I make a point to keep my lips and the cigar dry. If it gets moist from saliva my lips start tingling from the nicotine being absorbed, but it takes a while, a puff or two doesn't do it, and its not from the smoke.
Point is, just getting smoke in your mouth can theoretically get THC into your system, but in reality it will not get you high. You are getting high from slightly inhaling and from 2nd hand smoke in the air. If you can smell it you are inhaling it, and getting a larger dose than what would be absorbed from smoke in the mouth.

Ever wonder how the inside of an engine works or any other piece of machinery? There is no functional purpose to taking apart an engine, but Its neat to see all the moving parts and how it does what it does. It takes a lot of the mystery out of it.  Same concept. It's in no way to make any kind of money, just a demonstration of how the technology works and exactly what we do as miners.

Not everyone is a super duper btc/crypto/forex expert here. Instead of being a condescending jackass, remove the cock from your mouth and say something constructive.
I know you probably got picked on a lot in High School, or have faced laughter due to the size of your genitals, but the anonymity of the internet doesnt make you cool to be an asshole towards someone who has been misinformed about changes of the last several months.

Holy shit, I've seen some shills... then there is this a guy. He might as well be a neon billboard on Times Square for HitBTC.
Edit* definitely a stolen or sold account. Seemed to be a big T_D type user and disappeared for 8 months to come back in past few weeks doing nothing but promoting HitBTC in every single comment.
