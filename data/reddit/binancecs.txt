**Binance Response:**
The account is under investigation as a result of suspected fraudulent activity. During the investigation of this case, Binance does guarantee the security of the account's assets. This has been addressed multiple times and the situation is the same, otherwise, we would have let you know.
We have also already advised you to contact your local law enforcement, as shown in [your screenshot]( but oddly enough, it seems you are more interested in posting on Reddit. Furthermore, [your video]( of [your altered screenshot]( still does not match [the real response that you received](
While you are free to continue posting on Reddit, it has no bearing on the investigation and will not change the situation.

No one is above our security procedures. We're ready to cooperate when he is ready to cooperate.

**Binance Response**:
Hi there,
Simply because this was your first withdrawal on *this* account of yours does not mean it was your first withdrawal on Binance.
At Binance, as we have stressed many times, security is our priority. As such, we have a risk management system in place that evaluates many different factors before determining whether specified activity is suspicious, and if it is, appropriate action is taken.
As one may assume, your activity was deemed suspicious enough to trigger the risk management system and place your withdrawal under review. To proceed, much like our customer service team has already advised you, you will need to cooperate via support ticket.
We have policies and procedures in place that you must comply with and complaints to social media do not exempt you from this. Furthermore, you agreed to our terms when you registered an account with us, as outlined in our [Terms of Use](
We look forward to resolving this with you in your support ticket.

Sometimes, for security reasons (e.g. to verify ownership of an account), we may ask for certain account details, such as the IP question you're likely referring to. However, simply because we ask a question doesn't mean that it must be answered; it's understandable that some details may be forgotten or inaccessible, thus, if that is the case, we are happy to work through alternatives.

Actually, on the sign-up page, there's a checkbox next to text that reads "I agree to Binance's [Terms of Use]( and you cannot register without acknowledging it.
We take security seriously, and as a result, such suspicious activity will be met with precautions. Unfortunately, he will need to follow procedure.
