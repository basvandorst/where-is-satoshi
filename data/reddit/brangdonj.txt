Armory can do that too (*). You can control both multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
(*) - in addition to using SegWit, as you note.

SegWit fixes transaction malleability, which enables some payment channel protocols, which enables things like the Lightening Network. Those extra layers on top of Bitcoin are where true scaling will come from. Any increase in blocksize is premature until we see how that works out.
That's the argument as I understand it; I'm not saying I agree.

Dot com was different, surely? The Dot com bubble was not one single thing, but a large number of different companies that had business plans based on the internet. Many of those plans turned out not to be viable, and never got anywhere. The specifics depended on the specific business. Some businesses from then did succeed. I don't see how speculating on Bitcoin is like speculating on a business with a bad business plan.
Housing was different too. That was about lending money to people who could never afford to repay it, then mixing the bad debt with good debt, and then selling it on to someone who didn't know what they were buying. Again, not seeing how this fits Bitcoin.

There seems to be some debate about what actually happened with the tulips. It seems despite the high contract prices, those amounts were not actually changing hands. There was a law allowing contracts to be cancelled for a fraction of their value, and that led to the amount of the contracts being multiplied by that value. It was so long ago that details are sketchy.

His point remains if you replace "BCH" with dogecoin, or any of a number of other currencies.

Depends on why they think that. If they think it of all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin.
If they mean cryptocurrencies in general, then you should explain how they are a new thing in the world, and have genuine utility that has value. If they mean that attention may switch from Bitcoin to some other cryptocurrency, then, well, they may be right. However, Bitcoin has a strong first-mover advantage and strong network effects.

Bitcoin isn't the only crypto-currency to offer that.
