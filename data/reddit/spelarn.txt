Dont think so, always needs to input the random 6 digits when i try to login.

What do you mean string after secret? I have copied the QR-code on a paper and on an another harddrive if i would lose my phone. Is that all i need do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:38:10
Nope doesnt says i need to backup it, it says i need to scan the QR-code with Google authenticator and it will create 6 digit numbers in my Mobile app, what do i need to backup?

Alright i do not have an extra computer that is clean but can i use like blockchain mobile app and scan the private key to see if it grants access to the correct public address? thanks.

Okay thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:24:02
Ok thanks!!
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:03:50
Ok thank you but how do i send from that account? I need some software (mobile app/web) To scan the private key and i can withdraw? How do i withdraw without a software?

Thank you, do you buy these bitcoins from an official bitcoin site or from companies that sells them?. And the same as when you want to withdraw the bitcoins to real money? Do you do it from an official site or companies?

Ok i will check that out after i deposited the money into a paper wallet and split the money between hardware and paper. Thank you.

Thank you, but is the private key the only thing i need to secure to have access to everything? And do i not need an account to send bitcoins like blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:04:29
Okey and they have the scan function so i can deposit funds to the cold wallet and withdraw with scanning the QR-code?
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:19:58
Yeah i know, i would never invest the money if i couldnt lose it. Thanks for answer

Ok so if the mycelium software gets removed or something i do not have access to my bitcoins longer? even if i still have the private key? 
Lets say now:
I go to bitadress.org and create a paper wallet offline and print them out and store the paper in a safe place, i now have my public adress and my private key, I go into a exchange site and buy bitcoins worth of 2500$ to my public adress that i have on the paper, Now my paper wallet has a storage of around 0.5 bitcoins and when i want to take this out in 1 year if the value has doubled. How do i do that? Thank you.

Okay thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:06:42
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:35:56
Alright thank you and the public adress and private key is the only thing i need to always have access to my bitcoins? If all software gets closed down and i just have my paper wallet left and i want to cash out. How do i do if i want to cashout like 2 year later and the Mycelium app doesnt exist any longer?
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:45:33
Alright thank you alot but how do withdraw bitcoin or deposit them if i dont have an account somewhere just the private key? Like if i want to send some over to another adress and so on if i wanna sell the bitcoins?. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:06:33
Okey thanks, but if the software closes down, lets say blockchain do i have all my bitcoins removed or can i get them back having access to my private key and public?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:17:01
Okay thank you alot for your answers!
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:32:44
Kinda but not really, i watched a youtube video and that guy said i had to import the Mycelium start file in a usb drive but that aint correct i suppose. Thank you anyways
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:11:34
Okay i think i will use Mycelium to send and get bitcoins but as long as i have my private key i can access everything? 
etc if Mycelium is gone next year and i still have my paperwallet i can still access my bitcoins and exchange them to dollars?
