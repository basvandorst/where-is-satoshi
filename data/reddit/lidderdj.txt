 Just hold. This is a normal market correction after things went up too high,  too fast. Nothing fundamental has changed and crypto is growing every day.  You haven't realised a loss till you sell.  Stop looking at the market and come back in a month.

Why so? What's the issue with this?

I'm not sure about openoffice, but in Google Sheets you can use: =IMPORTDATA("
for ethereum. 
You find the ticker for different coins in the tools tab of coinmarketcap.

It's interesting to me that the cryto community in general seems very adverse to borrowing too invest. In Amy other financial community,  pundits are very quick to sell the benefits of leverage.  Is interesting because borrowing to invest is obviously risky,  but so is just investing in crpto.

Yeah definitely riskier, but potentially more rewarding of course.  Its just interesting to me that the general advice whenever the question of leverage comes up,  is that it's too risky, yet we're all here in a very risky market.

 Interesting,  thanks.

Is there really only 700000 odd people in the world with more than a bitcoin?  That's incredibly small.
