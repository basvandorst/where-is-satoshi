This is a little too vague. Can you specify one? Not saying it doesn't exist.

Does user just mean creating an account?
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:04:19
He's on a team. You can't reason with people on a team.

So being threatened with death or torture and put in chains vs people maxing out credit cards and buying stupid shit. Can I borrow 5 bucks? Thanks. Oh I can't pay you back, I keep spending all my money and borrowing more. You made me a debt slave.
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:51:30
Buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:59:32
Not all of them. You really need to let go of shitfriends sometimes like shitcoins. Need to redo your friend portfolio every few years.
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:00:47
He called you stupid. He's just a fellow now. Part of the fellowship of fiat.
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:03:05
It's alright, we're all just gambling. It's kinda fun. The real hard part is deciding when to cash out or... hold on and hope it's actually adoption time and you get the sit there with all of the BTC you bought in a world where everyone and their mother is trying to get it.

I want 1 sat to buy me a Mcchicken!
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:01:15
Nah, he's just gonna be asking to spare a few sats.
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:03:10
When btc ever goes below it's original price otherwise it has only gone up and revisited friends along the way. 9000 is my favorite friend of bitcoin. I joke but ultimately, have fun!
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:39:44
It does make me feel like I worked real hard to justify my buys or sells! Then I can just blame the charts!
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:30:27
I bought more at 7770.00! You make your own luck just like I made my own graphs to justify my moves.
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:50:12
You have also spoken.
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:39:10
Love it! Come back here for the victory lap or bloodshed!
I don't have similar plans but I have similar risk, goal, situation, and timeframe! Just as long as we're willing to suffer the "worst case" and have a relatively sound plan in the meantime I, we're good.
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:51:31
It's weird that I want both. I'm torn! $2000 or $20,000 or $200,000 but not $200.00. The last one would scare the shit out of me.
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:59:10
Iran needs to give BTC a run already! GO IRAN GO!
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:54:01
I will remember you [u/8w2e5s6h8r6a5n9e0a3s]( if you are correct. But if wrong, I will forget you and never bring this up. Bye bye fiat eitherway!
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:01:21
So that saying goes, so now is the best time? The best time is when it drops a little more after I press this buy button.
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:00:20
It'd be cool if we can say that about sats. I got sats all over the place in different exchanges and wallets!
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:56:32
He obviously meant in terms of "time is money."
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:46:54
Off the lot, immediately loses money. Bitcoin, sure, it can get manipulated and lose money too but whatever, it can also go up. I'm sure insurance is a bitch on that car or gas or whatever, I'll take my 2008 Japanese shitbox.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:32:57
My 8000 average is now 6900 average! Thank you for the 3 quick dumps and me waking up in the afternoon to hopefully catch the bottom?....! Please be the bottom! No more!
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:52:45
I dunno why they bother posting. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-12-08 07:00:07
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:34:24
Scared!? I squeal and get to DCA'ing!
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:10:10
You're basically talking to billionaires and millionaires right now. I'm imagining my spaceship!
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:02:38
THE BANKS, THE GOVERNMENT, SPACE PEOPLE! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:33:46
I don't freak out. I just enjoy watching my average get smaller and trying to time it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:27:58
Nah, we're all just waiting for it to get bored and do something crazy!
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:07:25
You're all clear.
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:51:48
Why's everyone always so angry on here? It's just "a plan."
I plan on going out for a couple of drinks then heading home later. But if something else happens, I'll decide then if it's worth staying but for now, this is what I'm expecting at best. A normal night out. Because it feels normal out there right now. What's considered normal right now? People seem to be bearish short term but overall, bullish 10 years from now. Nothing wrong with planning a course for action. He's mentally preparing himself to execute his buys at that price. He'll buy more if it gets even lower but 6300 is what he's comfortable with. Maybe at 6300 with what's left in his "extra cash he's ok with losing/spending/risking" puts him exactly at a full btc or something. After that, he feels he can walk away and just wait/hope and live life for the next 5-10 years without a worry.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:17:57
Oh good. Can I ask you to ask your friend to ask those rich people to do it again? I'm joking but that's cool. I really thought it was all retail hype or whatever you wanna call regular people. Mostly anyway.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:07:16
I saw him sell it just now.
@_date: 2019-12-30 00:02:38
Yeah, I meant it jokingly like a bunch of bitcoin holders suddenly talking all the time about being persecuted for owning bitcoin. We'd make memes at best and go back to wishful charting.
@_date: 2019-12-27 00:45:16
All scared people send your btc to me. I'll hold them for you.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:38:13
Maybe he bought it recently on Coinbase and then transferred it to his Coinbase Pro?
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:07:13
We need the world to FOMO!
BUY OUR BAGS! BUY OUR BAGS! Our altcoin bags that is. Then we run to BTC!
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:36:41
Maybe this?
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:53:37
I was like, does he not know about stocks?
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:37:02
Yeah but they're 6 "professionals" in suits getting paid to do this. I just woke up at 2 AM to look at charts (mostly memes) in my underwear.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:09:24
Maybe it corrects and he can get it for half and enjoy the other $75k?
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:37:25
I fucking had 5 minutes to take the top and 1 year to buy the bottom! Damn it all! I know I know, hindsight!
@_date: 2019-12-26 05:09:40
Isn't that the usual for all these exchanges?
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:35:15
When I was new to this, I thought WOW wtf, everything I did until this point took "5-7 business days" and lots of verifying. And even more verifying with FEES on FEES on FEES. I was so excited, I literally thought I was like 1 month away from the world changing, in regards to finance. I bought in on April of 2017 when it was like 1000 on ACCIDENT because I wanted to play online poker. After waiting a week (coinbase, wasn't checking prices), it doubled. Now I became an everyday price checker and then looked into the tech. But yeah, now I get why it's gonna be a very, very, very slow process.
@_date: 2019-12-29 23:16:13
It's hard but I believe China would try. We're gonna be seeing people in camps who use to own bitcoin and we're gonna have to get involved.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:40:00
At some point, all I'm buying are dips. I mean, my average is getting better but come on, I want the pay off already!
@_date: 2019-12-23 07:35:22
Anyone know what the fees or cut are like?
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:43:21
That's exactly why people shouldn't feel bad about missing out. If anyone kept their bitcoin in 2010, there's a good chance they would have sold the moment it doubled. It's easy to look back and be like "yeah I bought 100 in 2010, I would have sold at 20k" and completely negate all the speculation in the middle of those 7 years. The luckiest people are the ones that forgot about it on some old computer.
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:47:31
He is a paid shill. The Koch brothers pay him and fund him generously to push the “libertarian” to fascist pipeline. He doesn’t need any donations from poeple. He is just trying to play a fake victim card here.
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:55:40
I like this being introduced to the crypto scene. It's gonna separate the people who are all about decentralization and financial freedom for everyone or just for people they agree with.
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:58:07
Can we accept that a good amount of people are treating this as a gamble or an "investment?"
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:00:10
I read this on my buddy's screen from the couch! Right on!
