That's exactly what I am thinking. Bitcoin is not the banks nemesis, but it will certainly challenge them to review their business model.

Why would they not earn anything? A bank makes money in more ways than just charging fees for transactions. We are talking about a bank actually embracing Bitcoin, like the [Fidor Bank did with Kraken]( With a bank in another country doing the same, they could actually swallow the entire business of PayPal, Venmo, etc and enable instant transactions between customers of their banks AND plenty of other places. Sounds desirable for a bank trying to stay relevant in the digital age. They are in a supreme position to do this since they have ATMs everywhere and plenty of locations that they'd rather not be closing.


You're right, I should have explained better. I'm referencing to the problem that Bitcoin is regarded as very volatile and therefore "useless as a currency". I am anticipating that if such a competition were to start among the banks on who will capitalize on Bitcoin first, we would see a rapid rise of the market cap, since every new institution, may it be an exchange or bank, that is going to sell bitcoins will have to buy them in the first place. We would end up with a lot of financial entities (banks included) that have a pool of bitcoins to use, with every new node joining the network improving the market liquidity.
