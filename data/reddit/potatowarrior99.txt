Im not trying to hate on you but I think you're falling into the trap of analyzing Bitcoin like a stock when it's not that at all

Show me where Bitcoin drops 3k after a rise. Waittttttttttttttttt you can't
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:21:09
Show me a time when Bitcoin died and never came back after a rise. Ohhhhh wait ya can't.

Better get eating bro. Or are you sad you didn't get in at 10k and want a dip so you can buy?

The issue is, I have a friend making 2.50 a day right now using a 1070. Sure, its not a 1060, but it shows that bitcoin mining is still profitable to some extent. Thats over 50 a month.

well the op asked about it so...

That's incorrect. He has been doing it for the past 2 weeks, and I've been watching it happen. Just wondering, you have heard of nicehash, right? And as we live at college, we don't care abt electricity
