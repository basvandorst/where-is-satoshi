You need to go back to basics and learn about addresses, the blockchain, seeds and private keys. Importantly, a private key is not the same as your wallet password. If you deleted your wallet and only had your wallet password, your bitcoins will be gone.
With a basic paper wallet, you have an address and a corresponding private key - which you share with no one. You and anyone else can send funds to the address, and check the balance via the blockchain. 
You could then later import the private key into something like Electrum at a future date, should you wish to use your coins.
Ps. Wallet passwords simply encrypt your private keys, so the passwords can't be used to actually retrieve the keys of they are lost.

If we can get back to 1000, the media will take a lot of notice again. That may be the catalyst for wider interest, and they can't claim it's a fad this time round.

So in a year, if you did nothing else but hammer away on the faucet 24h a day, you'd end up with 0.04 BTC. Sounds like a winner to me.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:35:26
You forgot me. We'll have to start again.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:17:41
You do realise you don't have to use Bitcoin Core, right?
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:13:46
Because to the general public, what's the story? Bitcoin reaches half the value it reached a couple years ago? 
Is that going to sell newspapers? Most people aren't particularly aware that the price fell so dramatically from the last spike.
Also, the message nowadays seems to be that Bitcoin is a store of value, not a potentially disrupting currency competing against existing payment channels - so far less interesting to the average person.
If we hit 1000 I suspect we'll see a bit more interest.

I actually don't find the address system too bad, and combined with the QR system it can be quite elegant. Wallet software and browsing the blockchain however can be confusing for newbies.

He says minutes before a big drop...
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:07:34
We're going back to 550, without a doubt.
@_date: 2016-06-18 07:31:37
It's just fun to watch the tech play out. I love the rises, but I also love the drama of the crashes. I guess you can follow all this without owning any bitcoin, but it's far more exciting if you do. 
I also love the fact that my wealth fluctuates wildly throughout the day.
@_date: 2016-06-15 11:44:25
When you put that "trend" in a three month context, it isn't worrying at all.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:27:51
I suspected something similar. BTC seems to be about to push upwards again after sustaining it's current price point. Then all of a sudden this all kicks off.
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:53:05
It's all well and good trying to make predictions based off patterns, but Bitcoin and the market don't exist in a vacuum. All it would take is China to impose greater restrictions on cryptocurrency and *poof* all the charts in the world won't stop the crash.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:11:53
I was just playing. My guess is that it will end up around 750. The market likes to test for support every now and then.
Will probably hang around this point for a few days, and then continue up. I'm optimistic we'll see 1k by end of month, but with dips on the way.
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:05:23
But is an address much different from a telephone number? I don't memorise all my friends numbers, but at some point I do have to enter them in their raw form, before assigning a name to them. Most consumers seem totally able to comprehend that. Equally, when I pay someone via online banking, I have to enter account numbers and sort codes, and again this doesn't appear to have been a barrier to mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:04:53
With Bitcoin it's all about setting new floors. If 650 becomes the new floor that's an amazing achievement given where we were three weeks ago.
@_date: 2016-06-12 06:31:13
Could quite as easily be back at 570. Who knows. 
It does concern me that the current increase seems based on Chinese demand, and that alone. If the Chinese Government so much as looks like it's going to start looking into the situation the price will collapse.
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:56:45
Maybe pm him. You both posted at almost exactly the same time, about an issue I've never seen before. Hope you get it resolved.

Cancelling unconfirmed transactions is easy. Just submit a higher fee double-spend transaction. For example: if you send a 0-fee transaction it could take a day before 1 block mines it. Then you send another transaction with the same inputs that just sends the money back to yourself. On this transaction you put a higher fee. This becomes more likely to be mined and will get included in the blockchain - invalidating the slower-to-confirm original.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:01:44
Send it to me and I'll do the rest...
@_date: 2016-06-12 06:41:59
I think most would cash out long before the 1m mark. Unless it happened overnight because China adopted it as their national currency or something. Hell, if BTC got to 10k it would be hard to resist.
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:26:52
Most people cashed out when the price hit $5.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:19:03
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:23:30
You can do this on most exchanges anyway.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:10:54
No it's not a joke.
@_date: 2016-06-12 09:13:54
Except that Bitcoin was always meant to be a payment system.
@_date: 2016-06-12 06:21:33
Exactly. Even if you assumed that 21 million people all held one bitcoin, which is impossible today for a number of reasons, that would still only constitute about 0.5% of the global population. 
The last estimates I saw were that around 1m people own bitcoin, and I suspect many of these hold less than 1BTC, but even putting that aside, it would still make Bitcoin holders only 0.02% of the global population.
Not much of a redistribution... 
I'd also guess that most people willing to fuck about with cryptocurrency, at least with sums of 1BTC or above, are unlikely to be the world's most needy.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:53:30
There are so many predictions made everyday it's inevitable that someone will get it right. 
I mean, if everyone on this Reddit guessed the day I'd die, chances are someone would get it right. Did they have any particular insight beyond basic predictions of human longevity? No, they were just lucky.
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:42:47
Why does shit like this always happen when Bitcoin is doing well?
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:01:29
It really isn't. Very few people hold this sort of value in Bitcoin. Most early adopters sold when it hit $30. The number of people sitting on large sums is very small.
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:55:03
I nearly got one too... But then they sold out.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:44:03
I think we'll see 1000 by end of month. The fact we've remained stable at 680 after the vast increase makes me think we've got some way to go yet. I think we'll be looking at about 1500 by end of year. 
That said, it's all a guess. Value is simply whatever people agree it is.

I can confirm that Circle works well in the UK. I used to rely on Bitbargain.co.uk and their crazy high prices, but buying via circle is much cheaper and very easy. They do have weekly spending limits, depending how much you are planning on buying. 
My bank did block one transaction, but after I confirmed it wasn't fraudulent it went through fine.
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:59:19
I really hate this MH bashing. Sure, his exit from bitcoin was a little undignified, but he contributed a hell of a lot to the project.
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:29:38
Presumably you've seen the other person that's posted a similar issue with Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:33:24
Generally not very sensible to shout about your savings, particularly when it comes to Bitcoin.

Isn't there about 60 trillion stored in fiat?
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:39:36
How on earth is that worth 700k?
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:37:03
Did it. 2 bitcoins are now mine.

1) It's the weekend. 
2) There's just been a huge terrorist attack 
3) It's still way below the last high point. 
It's not a conspiracy to sabotage Bitcoin.

The whole of humanity is a bubble. Nothing lasts forever...

I'd assume that they have backup generators. Plus the various mining centres are not all in one geographic location, so the chance of multiple power grid failures seems unlikely.

The problem Ethereum has now is that, without the Dao and a big question mark over the viability of smart contracts, it's essentially just another alt coin.

I'm split between Ether and BTC. Majority in BTC, but ethereum is an interesting concept. I did hold Litecoin for a while, as an insurance policy against some sort of catastrophic bitcoin failure, but I recently sold that all off and moved it to ether.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:43:47
You do realise it's in all our interests for you to buy?
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:30:29
Why do you have to wait? Eg. I last bought some BTC via Circle. Hit my exchange account within ten minutes.
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:20:12
You called it chump change. So presumably you must be holding in excess of a million. I simply don't believe you.
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:10:03
Given the wild increase we've seen over the last 24 hours, the fact it hasn't dropped further is somewhat reassuring. It's actually holding pretty reliably between 680 and 700.
@_date: 2016-05-30 18:42:06
I never get this. Why compare it to gold? Why not the diamond market? Silver? Platinum? Why not compare it to the Baseball Card market? Seems somewhat arbitrary.
