Update: I did not include a fee so that's probably why it's taking so long. I also don't see a way to access the console with my Qt client. The only option under help is About. Settings has nothing.
My current progress in downloading the block chain is 258354 blocks, and I keep getting "Not enough space" and "Bad alloc" errors.
Some background (before this 8 BTC transaction): I had three deposits into this wallet. One of 6.5, one of 3.5, and one of 0.5, totaling 10.5 BTC. About a month ago, I transferred 2 BTC (one at a time) to MtGox successfully. It took only about 45 minutes before each showed up in my Gox account. I checked blockchain.info and found something really strange. When I transferred the first 1 BTC, it seemed to transfer 1 BTC to the MtGox address and 5.5 to another completely new address, totaling exactly the amount of the first deposit. Similarly, the second transaction sent 1 BTC to MtGox, and 2.5 BTC to another different address. According to blockchain.info, my wallet should only include the 0.5 BTC. I assume this is some strange way that the system breaks up transactions and that I still really have the remaining BTC, but worst case scenario is that my transactions sent my BTC to a third party through malware. Can anyone explain this to me?
I'd be willing to link the blockchain.info page for my address unless that is not advised to do publicly.

With my version of the client, I see no way to do this. Help only gives the About option, and Settings has nothing related to this.

It does not show the transaction at all.

I put my laptop in the freezer. Definitely more secure.
