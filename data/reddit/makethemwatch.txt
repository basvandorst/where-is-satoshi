Just keep in mind, rich on paper isn't the same as being rich. It's not real until you buy stuff with it

There is a ~0% chance someone has a typo and sends bitcoin to an active address. But a plausible scenario would be like if someone running a mining pool is doing a manual transaction and copies and pastes the address of the wrong user.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:08:12
Do you think bt2 will last very long with only 10% of the hashing power?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:27:38
Does bitcoin cash have segwit? What if I want blocksize increases and segwit? what are my options then?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:16:37
You can parse it anyway you want but it is clear that they are going to stick with core and core afaik is never going to support 2x ergo...
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:20:36
I learned this the hard way :(
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:03:47
Have they? So when is this doubling of the block size going to occur?
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:13:22
Lol ok bro. Good luck with your altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:33:55
Because they are making a shitty decision and they don't run btc
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:51:14
what are you even talking about? you cant just make up shit and project it on other people. 2x is happening the correct way with 90%+ of hashing power. You lost. If you want replay protection put it on your alt coin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:32:39
Hey if you want me to use my primary account because it has been around for 5 years and therefore my opinion now matters i can do that for you.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:12:20


  
That is obviously what you are doing. They cant make it anymore clear that they are sticking with core
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:37:16
wont a successful 2x fork kill bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:28:54
Open minded. Would rather have that than someone who stubbornly refuses to change their mind or compromise. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:13:04
no 2x fork will also be a huge win for BCH. the only thing that wouldnt be a huge win for bch is a smooth 2x fork, just saying

Idk bad journalism is probably worse than biased/controversial journalism
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:53:40
How is the 2x hf different from the bcc hf? what risks do we have now that we didnt have then?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:34:53
Which core of course would never do because they are ideologues.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:55:16
my man!
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:32:54
Except of course they also said this: 


... Should the Bitcoin developers come to the conclusion to follow the SegWit2X agreement, that chain will be considered the de-facto Bitcoin by Bitwala. 
  
So they are following the core dev team and reneging on the nya
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:11:32
I am sure they will find ways to excuse being so wrong about Venezuela. It is a common theme among the so called experts that when reality doesn't match their theory they try to spin reality instead of changing their theory
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:27:14
Looks like the overstock bitcoin check uses a coinbase service. Thats what i would expect, im sure it is the same thing there
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:44:51
Isn't the idea that the legacy minority chain will just die?
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:18:51
If a government accesses the coin what are the odds I get my coin back? I'm thinking pretty low
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:36:05


for doing what? pissing off the US? Did they even break any laws wherever they were hosted?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:45:51
Really wish toxic people like you would leave
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:19:36
You expect exchange's to provide tens of millions of dollars of liquidity? Lmao
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:23:10
Seriously though 3 months is a long ass time. Plus all the months we have had before the bip got locked in. If you are only allowed to push a feature after 6 months of testing the world will have ground to a halt by now. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:21:38
It was up for 6 years I assumed the governments would crackdown not by taking it offline but just by forcing them to adopt KYC
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:55:18
Dont keep your money on an exchange unless you are moving it no matter what. If you dont own the private keys it is easy to lose access to your funds as many have learned the hard way
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:22:52
Dude do you know how long 3 months of testing is? If you can't find a bug in 3 months there is no way you would have found it in 4 or 5. Is the bip not on a testnet already?
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:17:37
Well shit it sounds like they have a pretty strong incentive to get their act together :)  I know I'll be able to find a half hour over the next 3 months to update my node. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:34:44


@_date: 2017-07-31 01:52:11
Nah I feel like the diplomats thing has been a long time coming with all the sanctions bs. Still if BTC-e comes back online I would have so much respect for them, I probably wouldnt even withdraw all of my crypto.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:20:31
The more people that confirm segwit security the better
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:53:18
It sounds like they are explicitly saying they aren't supporting bch so if you want access to bch you should take your coins off the exchange asap
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:10:51
Idk bullshit will continue through Nov I would be cautious and only buy on big dips now imho
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:20:28
40% penalty???
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:58:06
The last two blocks were not even half full and my txns still have 0 confirmations...
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:42:54
The majority of economic nodes agreed to the 2x
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:39:22
Is there any chance segwit2x doesnt activate the 2mb portion? I think everyone needs to take a breather and relax a bit
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:21:09
getting increasingly nervous about that
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:14:35
Locking in segwit2x locks in both the soft and hard fork. If there is any serious movement to fuck around and try to break the process by not hardforking I personally would just leave btc for good. If btc is so easily manipulated that people would lock in one thing and do another why would anyone want to be in such an insecure asset like that? I am sure I wouldnt be the only person to leave
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:19:41
Are you going to try to mine the minority chain? I would love to sell my coin on any minority chain so let me know if you are and I will give you a great price
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:45:20
I think failure to activate a reasonable protocol change would shake out a lot of people that believe btc will ever hit mainstream use
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:08:55
As someone with a decent amount of coin on btc-e, never keep any siginificant amount of coin on an exchange. If you don't own the private keys you don't own the coin
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:43:09
you give me hope. Thank you. I just feel it will come to nothing and my coin is lost. Once the government labels you a criminal they can do whatever they want to you and no gives a fuck
