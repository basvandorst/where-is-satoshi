I mean, if you're keeping USD on Coinbase you should be fine, as long as you can prove you had X amount of money in case it's ever just gone. The USD on Coinbase is insured, the crypto is not.

Addresses are known dude...
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:20:58
You're right, but it will help with transaction times/fees, so the transactions will finish quickly enough so that the price won't matter.
The reason they brought up BTC price in the Steam post is because tx times took too long, meaning that the price would change before it's ever confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:21:21
No, it isn't. Not to the extent of USD. Coinbase has confirmed this. It's only insured if it's Coinbase's fault. If it's not Coinbase's fault, it's not insured. (Something like employee theft).
Fiat is insured up to $250,000.
Crypto is "not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are **not** subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections."
That's straight from Coinbase themselves.

Pretty much. Private keys give you access to the balance on the blockchain. If someone has your private key, they have your bitcoin.
When sending a transaction, this is essentially what happens: "Hey network, I am (public key, your address) and I am sending (amount) to (receiving public key). Yours truly, (private key, the signature)"

All you've been doing in this entire thread is trashing CNN and praising Fox News... Saying "The Daily Show" viewers are most informed from that study... When if you actually look at the article and read all of it it says NPR viewers are most informed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:31:37
International Questions asked:
Domestic Questions asked:
Taken directly from the article.
"Cassino concluded that 'the most popular of the national media sources—Fox, CNN, MSNBC—seem to be the least informative.'"
You wouldn't be asking those questions if you read the article mate.
"With all else being equal, people who watched no news were expected to answer 1.28 correctly; those watching only Sunday morning shows figured at 1.52; those watching only "The Daily Show" figured at 1.60; and those just listening to NPR were expected to correctly answer 1.97 international questions."
As far as I'm aware, 1.97 &gt; 1.60, so you saying that the article says The Daily Show are most informed is plain wrong.
As for you stating NPR is radio, not TV. Is the whole article bullshit then because one is audio and one is visual with pretty pictures and shit?
Also, if we go to NPR's website, I see pictures and articles to read as well, and videos. Thus, people who follow NPR are viewers, and listeners.

I never disagreed with that mate. I just said Coinbase always overpays fees. It's easy to see $20, but it depends on tx size.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:27:37
You can see the transaction come up before it is confirmed (almost immediately). The block the transaction is in then has to be mined by miners to be confirmed.
Most sellers (in person) just ask you to show the wallet you sent from, the transaction and the fee you sent to say you're good to go, even with 0 confirmations.

Guy interviews Roger Ver about "Bitcoin Cash" but calls it "Bcash" because it is easier to say. Roger Ver sees this as a personal insult to him on a personal level, and says it's similar to Ver calling the host a "four letter word" (I'm assuming 'dick'). It's more like calling the United States of America, the USA.
Ver doesn't called Bitcoin... Bitcoin, he calls it Bitcoin Core, so the host continues to say Bcash. Ver flips the fuck out, saying "I'm a self-made multi-millionaire before Bitcoin was even a thing and you should not disrespect me!" and then continues to ask the host how much his company made last year and how much he made. The host says, "that's none of your business". Ver then says, "oh it was less than a million dollars wasn't it?" and makes fun of the host for saying that the host can't run a business or whatever and Ver keeps reinstating "I'm a self-made multi-millionaire!" and says that the host "doesn't have the right to disrespect me like that by calling my project Bcash!"
The host then has some fun and says, "Bcash Bcash Bcash Bcash Bcash" and Ver yells and flips him off and ends the interview early.

Bitcoin is a digital currency you can use on sites like Overstock.com, Microsoft digital store, Steam (for games), Newegg for computer parts, some other sites and I think a few Subway franchise stores accept it, at least one that I've heard of.
It's a currency where you don't need a middle-man to send or receive. Where most banks will lock down your account if you buy from certain services they don't like, the Bitcoin network doesn't give a shit.
Where fiat (US dollars, euros, etc.) is controlled by a central bank, and they can decide whether a purchase is valid/invalid based on how they feel, Bitcoin is decentralized and transactions are verified using math. As long as 1+1=2, the transaction is valid. (Not entirely exact, but gets the point across hopefully)
You can buy Bitcoin from sites like Coinbase, and use the Bitcoin to pay for it. You can make money from it when the price rises. Holding Bitcoin doesn't get taxed. Selling Bitcoin for profit (or even loss) is taxed.
It's big on Reddit right now because it just hit $10,000.

Restricting the block size will also help re-decentralize Bitcoin. Right now, almost everyone can run a Bitcoin full node, because the Blockchain is only 145GB. Most average computer users these days have 1TB HDD/SSDs. If we increase the block limit so we have, let's say for example, a 10MB block every 10 minutes, the size of the blockchain will increase a lot more. This means it would get expensive to host a full node. Big companies would have the resources to, giving them control over the network.

The price going up too fast isn't healthy for the economy. It'd be a bubble, as people would question its worth, and thus start selling, causing a crash.
It needs to slowly rise.
The price rose too fast in 2014 (or was it 2015?) causing it to crash to ~$300 for about a year. It rose after that.
$2700 --&gt; $2000 --&gt; $4000.

It's honestly really simple. I can explain here.
Go to  --&gt; Resources tab --&gt; Bitcoin Core and download Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 for your OS.
Install Bitcoin Core and set up a folder to store the Blockchain on. (You need at least 146 GB, the Blockchain is fucking huge)
Before you run the program, go to 192.168.1.1 and set up a port forward in your router settings (tutorial:  open port 8333.
Start Bitcoin Core.
Let the Blockchain download. You will know if your port forwarding worked if you go to Help --&gt; Debug window in Bitcoin Core and see if you have incoming connections.
If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I can help.

Not with that attitude.

I think you might be off by about $36,000.

Isn't that just a download page site though? I know where to upload a file, but I just want to know where I can post the download link so people can see it, interact with me and use the wallet.

And before he says: "Yeah just withdraw it from the bank"
How do you intend to withdraw it at the bank, if the bank has no electricity?

As long as people have faith, and it reaches the mainstream, it will.
I can't see 10 years, or even 1 year into the future. This is just the principle of it. Bitcoin is gaining a lot of traction right now though.
So, in theory, it will rise.
It dropping from $4,900 to $4,500 is just a market correction. It rose too fast, so it fell. It's now at $4,600 and ***slowly rising***.

It's entirely possible to have thousands of Bitcoins and not be able to get anything out of it, if **no one mines**.
If there is at least 1 miner, it will work, but at that point Bitcoin would be worth like $0.001.

If I have one person only, and they send a $0.50 transaction fee, thats a $0.50 reward.
Add the entire globe, and the total reward will go up. I never said transaction fees themselves go up.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:29:05
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:31:02
When you send BTC to an address, you have to include a transaction fee. The fee isn't fixed, so you can adjust the fee to whatever you want it to be. However, to get a transaction confirmed quickly, you need a higher fee. These fees are added onto the current 12.5 BTC reward per block. When miners no longer receive newly generated Bitcoin in the year 2140, they will receive their entire income off transaction fees.
You sending 10 BTC for $0.50 may seem like nothing, but when you add everyone sending transactions across the globe, it adds up.

What about logarithmic charts? On those, the bubbles are VERY apparent. Right now, you can tell its just starting to form a bubble, but its near the bottom.
Linear looks like a bubble 24/7

Buy on GDAX
Transfer to your actual wallet (Trezor, Ledger, paper, etc) for no fee at all, because GDAX pays it for you.

If it's an absolute crash, then 1100-2000 is pretty likely. If it's a slow bleed, then the bottom might be a bit higher.

Oh, he's got 10.7 BTC left.
I was under the impression they did a 50/50 split.

just my taste. i'm not like one of those stupid ass tapout dudes, and it's not like, "HEY BITCHES I BOUGHT BITCOIN" ^^^^at ^^^$4700, it's just, "I bought Bitcoin, bitch." simplistic, and not overstating it.
i like minimalism.

Short answer
Long answer
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:28:55
even at $3650 i can still make a profit.
i spent a total of $218 across all cryptos, bought some things with it, and then sold for $218, so i technically made a profit, because of the stuff i bought.
if i buy back in at $3,650 and it goes to $5,000, then i'll have an even nicer profit.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:53:28

You can build a good computer for gaming for maybe $1,200 (assuming GPU prices are what they were before the crypto mining craze kicked off)
So you can build 5 computers.

Which is $2,500 now.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:45:43
IIRC, they already removed that code due to some other security issue, so the opt-in replay protection is gone.
