Good answer. For some, a github repo means the ability to compile the code themselves. And also to review it for errors. But for most people who just need it to work, trust is necessary at some level.

The kickbacks are limited to the app, and therefore more gift cards. But I’m shopping at Target anyway, so I might as well save some money!

Square acquired a patent to allow transaction between customers and merchants on their private blockchain, then settling the payment on the main. This will be as fast as credit cards, and the risk will be on square.

"Fiat," just in case people don't know. "Wallet" because it has a very specific definition here. Maybe HD Wallet as well.

Thanks for sharing, I’ll sign up tonight.

I've never wanted free money less than I do right now.

I don’t even see it on this website. Just stickers and socks.

I’m not sure if this is real or not, but it’s an interesting read regardless.

I started looking for HODL immediately.

It’s okay to use that the same way you would a leather wallet. Small amounts of cash that wouldn’t ruin you if stolen. 
When you hear Hardware Wallet around here it’s in reference to a Trezor or Ledger. Dedicated devices for only crypto. 
These are much more secure and can be used like a safe or bank account. Large amounts of money that you need immediate access to.
*to further explain, backing up in the cloud is seen as insecure because accounts can be hacked remotely, while pen and paper cannot.

Thanks for the summary and link. That sounds awful.

That’s awesome!

Thanks for explaining. Can you summarize the difference between ABC and HSV? Not that I want to buy either one, just curious.

This a good question. I’m guessing that the missed opportunity from not mining out weighs the benefit of this behavior.

I’ve also heard it translated as Central Intelligence Agency. I don’t believe that one, bit it’s interesting.

It would be a great way to track everyone’s spending. Maybe the IRS did it?
Who could turn down billions of dollars to maintain their anonymity?

Oh sorry, the interface looks like robinhood. Good luck!

Is bitWallet still ok? Everyone keeps saying Mycelium
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:47:00
Does Robinhood let you send bitcoin to addresses? Or can you control the keys at all? I saw that buying and selling was an option, but I’m not interested if I’m not in control.
