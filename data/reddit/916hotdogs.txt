It's like setting up a more modern and efficient McDonalds across the street from the original McDonalds, and putting the original McDonalds out of business.
Which is exactly what happened with McDonalds in real life. 
Kind of a bad analogy with that in mind.

To put that in perspective,  altcoin Monaco did 4000BTC worth of volume in the last 24 hours. 
Basically a blip any more.

Yeah, addresses. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:36:30
Yeah, how many there really are. How many are accessible versus lost, destroyed, belonging to dead people, etc.

I'm almost your age myself, and I regret having no time. Forget cars and toys. I'd like to be able to spend time with my family, get outdoors more, and not worry about my kids college. That's it. Keep the lambos. 
Every day is work, work to pay for a place to sleep while I get ready for work.

And that's why it will never dip that low. There's too much BTC tied up in long term holders like you and me, nevermind lost forever. The supply is more limited by the day. 
I won't sell tomorrow for $100, or $20K. I'm holding year by year and will reevaluate on those terms. I literally don't care what it does today, tomorrow, next week or next month. Those BTC are off the market.

[Then, according to this]( about 55% of wallets have too little BTC to cover the fee to get it out of the wallet. Which in total adds up to 2500BTC.

Keyloggers won't be able to pick up your pin # because it's randomized on the screen. And any malicious software on your pc cannot interact with the physical buttons needed to confirm any sends.
The sneakiest thing (I can think of) would be swapping out your address in software. So make sure to always confirm the address on the screen before hitting "confirm."

No I'm not sure, but for 300k I think it's worth checking out. A lot of times just the electronics component is fucked and can be replaced.

Explain?

I actually did bet on a Trump win on predictit and made out well.
I wish I'd loaded up on btc that day. 700 to 10k since November 8th.
Amazing.

There's thousands or millions that won't let it go to $1000. And they don't have limit orders, which is what OP doesn't understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:13
Why would you sell at a loss? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:13:10
A $5000 purse? Or something else? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:37:15
Didn't you read the warning? Intentional spins prohibited.
*Accidental* barrel rolls however...

It's their money. And it's not like the money is now gone. It just belongs to someone else now

Converting to ZWL is definitely a quicker route to millionaire status than the one I'm on.

I bought over 10 around $15, lost my job and remembered I had them still. I was so happy to cash out that $300.

There are a couple of truecrypt crackers that can be set up with limited dictionaries.
So if you know that your password might be XXYYZ you can have it try all variations of that. You can set it to various caps, substitutions, etc. 
Like you said, there's no penalty in trying to crack a truecrypt container, so you might as well try.
