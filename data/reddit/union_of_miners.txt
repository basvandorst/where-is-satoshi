Can you find a wash trading law which applies to crypto tokens in the country where the exchange is located?  Because BTC does not meet the SEC criterion for a share or security and even if it did the exchange issuing USDT is not in the US.

The Trade Marks only apply to clothing and drinks and were filed in Dec 2017.  Invalidating them is not as simple as 'Bitcoin is a generic term' because you need to show it is a generic term with respect to clothing or drinks.  This will be why it got past the Trade Mark office examination.   
A related case is outdoor clothing named after famous climbing areas like 'Glencoe': there are Trade Marks granted on well known place names when applied to clothing e.g. 'Glencoe Jacket'.   This is a bit different because somebody made up the word 'Bitcoin' and chose to put it in the public domain: the person who invented it might have standing to complain about some random guy trademarking it.
If you were selling T shirts with 'Bitcoin' on them in the UK before 2017 you are probably OK.   However, if you just started selling Bitcoin T shirts yesterday you *may* have a problem.   You might need to show that lots of people were selling Bitcoin T-shirts before Dec 2017 so as to argue that Bitcoin on T-shirts was a generic item.  I guess going on CafePress or Redbubble and finding a ton of them listed before this was filed might do the job.
NB:  I'm not a lawyer don't take this as legal advice!
