When you use any centralized system it is based on trust. As humans in free world we can not get rid of trust when doing any business. That's why we still use centralized bitcoin exchanges whereas 30% of them collapsed. 
There is no doubt that decentralized and blockchain based solutions eliminate trust factor. There is still the issue related to implementation and comfort/simplicity of usage of decentralized systems.
As to ddos of any centralized system or single user nothing can be guaranteed.

As you know you can set up a game room with your favorite game and its parameters. There are no restrictions to create a room for any user. In near future we would like to create a place to arrange a meeting for players. It'll be a forum or any other automatic arrangement sheet.

Thank you. If chopcoin is based on three principles

then answer is yes.

Thanks for all of you who participate in the first official promo of cgbets.com
200 tokens have been granted to our new CGBeters. The system works stable and we have not observed any issues. We have turned off token registration and the website is open for everyone. You can sign up and create more than one login to play simultaneously in preferred games or just create rooms with your parameters to wait for other participants. If you are not so confident to play for bitcoins at the beginning, you can choose the practice mode while creating the game room.
So feel free to register and seek for the new promos coming soon!

We are aware that it is almost impossible to prevent the site to be accessed by the people who want to cheat. We have implemented some heuristic solutions to alarm us about such behaviour. Of course it is based on probability. The site is designed to be the place of fun, play with friends and to bet small amounts of BTC. The minimal bet is 0.0001 BTC now. 
Besides of logical games (Chess, GO) we deliver skill games, as for now it is basketball. This is fast played and very simple game where the only solution to cheat is to write program and connect it with our backend.  From our perspective it will be really hard to do this.
