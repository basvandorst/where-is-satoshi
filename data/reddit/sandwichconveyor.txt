well i still don't see the one in screenshot when looking from incognito. im guessing it's either my account being very new or words  "removals" or "censorship" triggering some filter.
thank you for your patience, none of this is bitcoin related anyway so im okay with whatever i learned here.
edit: hidden comment is now visible

is there minimum account age requirement i don't know about? i have to start somewhere, you know.
i replied to another comment with [screenshot]( of what i see. can you see both comments? 
not everyone is a sockpuppet, i just want to get involved, ask question and learn about bitcoin.

i wouldn't call it whinings but whatevers. pardon my plurals i should've typed "comment", im sorry.
i don't even know whose sockpuppet i could be...

thank you. it's understandable. i did lurk for a while around bitcoin related subs until decided to create account ~3 hours ago. i know a little about the trolls and dramas and whatnot, though not much.
however, my comment does look like it was hidden from others and only visible to myself. maybe you have insights of why could that be?
if it is indeed hidden, i'd like to get a glimpse of why, i don't want to repeat same mistake
thanks for any answers.

it's open source and removals would probably shout "censorship" so i guess they leave it like that
edit: this comment is the one where i refer to as "comments  removed" [here]( i believe due to my new account and word "censorship" it was caught by automoderator and hidden temporarily.
edit2: aaaaand im banned :(

thanks for confirming, though this is a second comment, first one is not visible for me in incognito :(
i made a [screenshot]( of what i see. did i do something wrong to get it removed? is my account too new? im just starting out, should i lurk more here before commenting? how do i know when im allowed to comment?
