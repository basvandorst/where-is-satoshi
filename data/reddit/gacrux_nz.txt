The economic majority would not recognise your new fork as valid, no matter how long it was. If would be as if you did nothing at all. If your 51% attack isn't creating blocks that other people recognise as valid then you're just wasting your time :)

Hilariously naive understanding of Bitcoin mechanics :) Hasn't heard of GBT. Mistakes distributed hashpower forming mining pools for monopoly. Overlooks individual incentives not to participate in 51%. Far 
Far worse, greatly overestimates limits of a 51% attack. No, majority hashpower can not alter protocol. Only economic majority can do that. Can't decide who owns what coins either; can only censor legitimate transactions.
People should really read a bit about Bitcoin before announcing it is doomed based on their flawed guesses about how it works. Sigh.

Hi PhantomPhreak. I think you're missing the point here -- please allow me to rephrase Chakra_Scientist's question in a more interesting way:
*What is it about the functionality that Counterparty aims to provide that fundamentally requires the existance of XCP?*
(For example: the Bitcoin blockchain fundamentally requires its own unit of account - BTC - to function, without which there would be no way to compensate miners and secure the network.)
People ask questions like this because they rather suspect the answer to be: "it's just our particular implementation that requires XCP," which obviously does not bode well for XCP's future value :) 
Once you prove the features you are developing to be useful and popular, what would prevent their direction integration with BTC at some point in the future, either implemented in a Bitcoin sidechain, or in Bitcoin itself via a hardfork ? (the question of whether you would consider doing this work yourself is beside the point.)

The Bitcoin network validates and secures (by building PoW on top of) only BTC transactions. It merely acts as a *timestamp* for Counterparty transactions, both valid and invalid (leaving decisions about which transactions are considered valid - and thus their security - up to the Counterparty client at runtime.)
This is one big advantage of coloured coin transactions - being standard bitcoin transactions, they're effectively validated by mining hashpower.

Indeed; it seems inevitable eventually. 
But, where does that leave Counterparty, which does not currently have a blockchain? :)
Counterparty really just works by maintaining a big database of timestamped transaction attempts, the validity of which the client determines at runtime. Yes, it effecitvely uses Bitcoin's blockchain as a timestamping mechanism, and as a convenient place to stuff the aforementioned big database... but that does not a blockchain make. 
Bitcoin's blockchain is a public record of BTC transactions considered valid by an enormous amount of CPU power. It is not a record of Counterparty transactions and does not attest to the validity of any Counterparty transactions - Bitcoin miners are completely unaware of Counterparty transactions and do not validate them.
That's a far weaker security model than Bitcoin; some would go as far as to say not even decentralised.
Are there any plans to address this? 
(I ask because I've seen Counterparty developers sometimes mention the potential to port Counterparty to a different blockchain / its own blockchain in future.)

Yep. That's what an altcoin is: another set of tokens that float in value vs. BTC.


The term you're looking for there is "premine." 
This point is still true though, and bears repeating - Counterparty's "proof of burn" launch (ie. limited time one-way peg with BTC) was completely *fair*. Nobody can question the legitimacy of XCP's distribution - if the devs have made any money off of XCP's price going up, it'd only be because they took the same risk on it that anyone else could have taken. 
That's a lot more than can be said for most altcoins **cough** Mastercoin **cough** Ethereum **cough**.

Nonsense. Who owns what (XCP) tokens is defined by *the client's runtime interpretation of unvalidated data stuffed in the Bitcoin blockchain.* 
You need a 51% attack to successfully cause a Bitcoin reorg. But you don't need a Bitcoin reorg to rewrite XCP history - you merely need a tweak to the client. Which version of the client is "correct" is highly subjective.
For example: earlier this year they had a bug where the client didn't validate signatures properly, allowing the spending of arbitrary peoples' XCP. They simply released a bugfix which **retroactively rolled back the fradulent XCP transactions and all their dependent transactions.** XCP transactions that were buried an arbitrary number of blocks deep just vanished in a puff of smoke (because the updated client considered them invalid.)
Which client version would you consider "correct"? 
* One that fixed an obviously critical bug that "should never have been there in the first place" outright, or:
* One that deliberately maintained all past transactions as valid (by implementing the bugfix only where blockHeight &gt; N, and maintaining the buggy behaviour for interpretation of past blocks.)
There's no obviously right answer - it's subjective.
It's a horribly weak security model compared to Bitcoin. I think your criticism of sidechains is valid (the potential to steal the peg, which probably greatly outweighs the reward for honest behaviour, increases the risk of a 51% attack substantially,) but you'd still be hard pressed to end up less secure than Counterparty's current implementation. 
A merge mined sidechain with a sufficiently high hashrate and tweaked parameters (eg. very long fraud proof wait, 75% to steal the peg) looks downright rosy by comparison. I'd trust that with my money over PhantomPhreak's python script any day :)
