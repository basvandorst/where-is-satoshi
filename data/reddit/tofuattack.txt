I was never arguing that bitcoin has intrinsic value, just that all value is subjective.
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:09:17
The value of all those things are still subjective, how much is eating that apple worth to you verses somebody who hates apples?
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:36:35
If you are willing to do those things with an apple then it DOES have value to you, if it wasn't valuable to you AT ALL then you would completely disregard the apple. Hence, the apple is more valuable to you verses somebody who does not care for the apple under any circumstances. Therefore the value is still ultimately subjective.

I tried their service as they were offering the best price at the time, I will probably never use them again. 
I bought $50 in btc (~0.11 at the time) as a test. After the painfully slow verification process, I sent my 0.11btc to my wallet immediately and it took over 8 days to process.

I haven't invested in any digital currency at the moment, so you'd be wrong.
I'm not offended, quite the opposite, i like conflicting arguments, you asked for thoughts and i gave you mine, don't tell me to leave the thread as if you own it, especially after asking for opinions (but only those that support your ideals).

It's a terrible currency atm, fiat is much more useful, but in the future, it has the potential to change the world. This is (part of) why it's going up so fast, those of us who have the vision to see it's potential realise btc is only just in it's infancy, and we want to be a part of it when/if our vision is realised.
The true value is also going to increase, as it's usefulness increases proportional to it's user base, which is rapidly growing, due to many factors such as weak confidence in fiat currency and advantages in btc.
Even if it crashes sub 50, which is unlikely, it isn't going away, the pandora's box has been opened it's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:21:33
Is that possible? i have not read enough on how digital currencies work, would you be able to explain how it can be done, the converting of a decentralised digital currency to centralised.

Throughout almost all of history the price ratio of gold:silver was around 1:11, unsurprisingly, the ratio of mineable gold to silver in the ground is also 1:11.
The trading ratio today is 1:57 - either gold is highly overvalued, or silver is undervalued.
If we look at above ground supply, silver is very close to, and may even actually be scarcer than gold, because silver is used as an industrial metal, and large quantities are consumed/destroyed daily. It's also not profitable to mine it at current cost so physical supply is dwindling. Supply is dwindling, yet demand is constant.
The market price doesn't reflect any of the data around silver, and the only reasonably explanation anyone eventually comes to is that of price manipulation through "paper silver" and silver leasing. I'm not going to go into detail, going to sleep now, but there is a stack of resources out there if you're interested.
My investment in silver was a hedge against the potential collapse/failing of fiat currencies, but since btc came along, it looks to be a much better opportunity.

How do you do this? is it only possible with specific clients, don't see this option in multibit.
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:28:23
Control? how do you plan on controlling a decentralised p2p currency? when you said back i thought you meant through some ease of transaction, trading, and stuff like that.

Could you speculate on the types of systems or services that might exist on top of the bitcoin protocol in the future? 
(such as the payment system you mentioned earlier)

Bitcoin has first mover advantage, it's highly unlikely that a competitor will be able to corner even a small section of the digital currency market. Especially since the competing product is almost identical and at least not superior in any meaningful manner.
@_date: 2013-05-13 07:39:33
You have my sympathy. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:05:12
If Bitcoin becomes mainstream currency, first there has to be a serious redistribution of wealth, such an event would almost certainly cause the dollar to collapse, it's not going to be carebears in the sky, it'll probably be the toughest depression in all of history.
Never before has the entire world used one currency as a reserve. Many years after that though, it will be the most prosperous era of humanity, it'll probably spur the post-scarcity civilisation so many futurists dream of.

excuses! i also signed up and wanted to buy at 50, took &lt;1 week, and bought at ~58.
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:26:53
Sure, and that is why i didn't invest in BTC when it was trading for &lt;$5USD, first mover advantage creates barriers for competitors but by no means ensures domination of the market, it's just unlikely especially after seeing the growth and exposure in recent weeks.

It's only linked in the sense that any good can be linked to any other when there is demand for the two goods. It's worth in fiat is only a representation of it's value in terms of another unit. If you wanted, you could compare it to the number of bananas, or units of labour that a bitcoin is worth. USD is just much easier for trading purposes. 
It's all about the value of one good relative to another. Many of us here believe that Fiat is an unsustainable monetary system, and will lose much of it's value as it's usefulness diminishes. If this happens, the value of bitcoin relative to USD will rise dramatically. 
If you are scared about Bitcoin being linked to fiat, do some homework on what Fiat money is linked to.

I think an internet-wide service will soon exist, with bitcoin or not, where people will finally be paid proportionally to the value of the content they contribute.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:09:30
It's possible, but I say that it's unlikely because it's captured the attention of quite a lot of people now, and a percentage of those people, such as myself, see btc as a huge opportunity to revolutionize the way wealth is transferred, and for those in developing countries to participate in the global market and that concept in itself is worth something now. 
The reason it wasn't before, was because it was so small that there was a chance a (better) competing cryptocurrency could take the throne, but the growth in btc has given us confidence it'll be the dominant digital currency, for some time at least.
(This isn't to say we're not in a bubble, i do expect a drop, but i'm in this for the long run)

Hypothetically, if you were a major US financial institution, would you rather back BTC or LTC? Yep, you're going to choose the one that has more users.
Seems to me you missed the 'early' adopter boat for BTC and want a second shot via LTC, go ahead, no one's stopping you.

Exactly, one of the biggest drivers for bitcoin, will be for those in developing countries to participate in the global market. 
In the next 10 years, it is projected that there will be 3.5 billion more internet users.

@_date: 2013-03-10 05:35:26
Thanks for that.
But, don't you think the vast majority of people would choose to use a decentralised currency over centralised? 
The biggest shift towards digital currency will be when the current fiat paradigm unbuckles, and using a centralised currency when a decentralised alternative is available would be the unlikely choice.
I don't see it as being feasible, either way, they would more likely start their own digital currency rather than buying out LTC or another competitor, no?

Max was very bullish on silver before btc exploded, I was also, and spent a great deal of time researching it. Despite not having gained much in my investment in silver (compared to btc), I still firmly believe it is one of the most undervalued assets in existence. 
(and definitely a very safe place to store wealth)

So you know the future price of bitcoin? Please share, oh wise one.
Sorry to be so snarky. Yes, OP could've made arguably better investment, but let's be honest, we are all new to this and no one knows what's going to happen, if bitcoin does succeed like we want it to, well, those bits OP finds may be worth far more than his original investment, I'm just happy he's participating in the bitcoin ecosystem.
