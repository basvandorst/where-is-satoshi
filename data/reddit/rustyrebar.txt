You do not have a tax liability for hodling.  If you cash it out, or if you transfer to a different alt coin that is a taxable event.  If you earn bitcoin, that is taxable.

It is a real pain in the butt right now.  You need to know when you made the trades, and what the USD equivalent was at the time of the trades.  
So, if you buy BTC and then change it out for LTC without making a gain on BTC, no cap gains.  If instead you held the BTC for 2 months and it appreciated, then you traded it for some other crypto the gains would be taxable.  If you were mining bitcoin, the payouts would be income -- if you held on to those BTC and they gain value then you traded for a different crypto, or out to cash, that is cap gains as well.. 
Example.  I get $100 in BTC from mining.  That is $100 in income.  If two months later that same BTC is worth $200 and I cashed it out, I would still have made the income, so that is taxable, and the $100 in gains would be taxable under capital gains.

We have a 9 to 1 fractional reserve system.  This means that they must keep 10% in reserve.
If I put $100 into the system (remember the federal reserve system is all connected) the bank can loan $90 on that (they have to keep 10% of the $100 or $10, and can loan out $90).  Then when that $90 is deposited into the federal reserve system $81 can be loand out (they have to keep 10% of the $90 or $9).  then when that $81 is deposited $72.90 can be loaned out, so on and so on down the line until eventually from that $100 deposit $999.99 is created.
So to answer your question, both a and b are correct (although the B number should be $999.99).  
Hear is some info on it if you are interested:

What creates money is the bank lending the money (at least at that level).  What enables the banks to lend money is reserve holdings.
Are you deliberately being obtuse?  No matter the semantics of it, putting cash into the bank, or getting a wire transfer of some sort, does not make a difference.  Any money you put into your checking account / savings account etc... is money the bank has in it's reserve, and is therefore able to create 9 times that amount to lend out.
I guess I can argue that you are wrong, it is not created with the stroke of a pen, rather a click of a mouse on a computer, but I am not trying to be a total ass hat and argue unimportant points.
Putting money in a bank account is in no way hoarding it, which is exactly what you were saying above. 


You are wrong.  Rich people do not hoard their money, they invest it, that is how they become rich.  Do you think that billionaires and millionaires make their money by going to work everyday and working hard?
Are you being deliberately belligerent, or do you really think this is the case?
EDIT: BTW, I just read the article you linked... it just backs up what I was saying in the previous comment


@_date: 2014-10-31 15:21:12
That is not how it works... that is not how any of this works.
Putting money in a bank is not "hoarding" money.  The fact that you put money in a bank account allows the bank to lend 9 times that out, so if anything they are creating money by putting it into a bank account.
Do you really think that the bank just puts all that cash in a big ol vault?  That there is some chest somewhere with your account number on it and a big stack of cash?  No, they take that money and lend it out to people who need home loans, business loans, student loans etc... 
The only way you can "hoard" money is to literally bury it in your backyard or stuff it in a mattress.

If he hired a hit man, then they should charge him with that.  If they did not charge him with it, then it is not germane to sentencing.

Yeah too bad we have never elected presidents in this country based off a national popular vote, this is not how the political system in this country works.  If you do not like it please feel free to advocate for an appropriate constitutional amendment to alter that. Until then, no one cares who won the popular vote.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:07:47
When the country was founded, it was intentionally set up to avoid democracy.  Democracy was a huge fear of some of the founders:
*James Madison, Federalist Paper No. 10:*
*In a pure democracy, "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual."*
Democracy is three wolves and one sheep all voting on what they want for dinner.  Not very fair to the sheep.
We have a Republic, which sees certain rights as inalienable, and these rights are not subject to a vote by the majority.  In fact, there is no way to have a national referendum here... The only things we can vote on at a national level is who we want as president (and we don't actually vote on that if you want to get technical).  All other votes are more local in nature... as in California does not get to vote for the senator from Maine, or the Governor of Nevada.  Some states do have initiative, recall and referendum, but again, that is a state level thing, not national.
The electoral college has it's issues, but the idea that there are 50 separate elections seems sound to many people.  California has 1 out of ever 6 people in this country, if we just had a popular vote the voices of people in N. Dakota or Montana would not be heard.
I think a better way to do it would be to award electoral votes proportionately for each state, and those are automatic, meaning we don't need electors to actually vote somewhere.  An example... In California we have 58 electoral votes... This election was 62% Clinton, 31% Trump, 6% other, so just do the math and that is like 36 for Clinton and 18 For Trump... There is no need for electors.. we just apply those numbers using math, and determine who would have won.
The United States has a weird kind of system, and it is not like what you may be used to.  In fact, the United States is a lot like the EU.  Each state is really kind of it's own nation.. and we try to bring political decisions to the lowest, most local, level we can.  So, when we have an election it is really thousands of elections, as each precinct (there are over 22,000 in California alone) could have slightly different issues on each ballot, from city council and school boards all the way up to President of the United States. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 20:45:23
Don't get it twisted.  I am not saying I am into spending, but it seems a bit disingenuous to me to lambaste Trump for spending that he has not even done yet, but at the same time ignore the tens of trillions that Obama and Bush spent on bankers and killing women and children in the middle east.
Further, I have no issue with infrastructure spending, as that is an investment in the future of the country, as opposed to just spending billions and billions of dollars on stuff that you just blow up.

You basically have 4 options.
1.  Hold it on an exchange.  You do not have the keys, so your really do not have the bitcoin, but in general you should be ok.  You just really have no recourse if something gets weird, and you have to trust someone, in a trustless system.  This is kind of counter to the purpose of bitcoin.
2.  Keep you bitcoin in a wallet on either your PC or Phone.  Your phone is, arguably, much more secure than your PC.  There are several options, but basically for IOS you can use something like Bread or Mycillium, Android Mycillium, and on Windows or Mac Electrum.  There is the possibility of getting hacked, so you need to be careful, but for keeping a little bit of bitcoin in a convenient place, this might be the best option.
3.  You can use a paper wallet.  You can generate one at bitaddress.com.  Best to grab the code ( and do this offline, boot a live CD once you have the zip, and your wallet will never see the internet.
4.  Use a hardware solution.  Trezor and Ledger are both great options.

Depending on what your needs are, it could be as simple as just putting up a QR code to one of your public addresses.
Do you want to hold the bitcoin?  Or would you like it converted back to dollars to reduce your exposure to exchange rates?
Is transaction time important?  Depending on the value of what you are selling for bitcoin maybe 1 confirmation is enough to let someone walk out the door (say for something under $50), maybe you want 6 (perhaps for a $10,000 purchase).  Even for a $2 purchase, it will take maybe 10 minutes to get a confirmation.  Maybe you only want to see it broadcast to the network, that can happen in under 30 sec...
Do you want to tell who sent you what?  You may need to create a separate public address for each transaction.
There are just a lot of questions you need to address.

If you wanted to trade these things for value, you would have some problems, I can check that no one has spent it when I buy it, and I can quickly transfer the balance, but if I was using this for long term storage, what is to stop someone from looking at the private key and transferring the balance after they traded you the bill?

You can deposit to bit floor via local till from bofa. Go to bit floor and create account, then select deposit and select cash deposit (I am not sure what the exact name of this option is in the menu but it is obvious) then you will get an email with deposit instructions.

1.  They are ledger entries.  When they are "mined" what is actually happening is the ledger is being vetted by the entire power of the network.  This is not easy to explain in a couple of sentences.  When you submit a transaction it is broadcast to the network.  Mining computers hear these broadcasts and include the transactions in a block.  Once the miner has enough transactions in a block they start to hash that block with a nonce (random number) trying to make the hash come out with a defined amount of leading zeros.  The first miner to find a hash that has the defined number of zeroes they broadcast that to the network with the nonce, that is easily verified by others, 25 bitcoins are awarded to the miner who got it, and they all start working on the next block.
2.  Nothing, anyone could do the same thing.  The hard part is getting people to go along.
3.  This is by design.  The protocol calls for a deflationary currency.
4.  Like anything else, its value comes from what people are willing to pay for it.

I have had good experience with bitfloor.  The exchange is smaller than Mt Gox so the prices are not always in line, the other day I saw them trading at 141 when mt gox was at 138, then last night I saw them at 171 when mt gox was at 182. 
I have only done &lt;$100 with them, I heard about someone who had some trouble with a $1300 deposit, but it sounds like someone did something  wrong in that transaction.

and the violent drug trade is enabled by the state.  No one is shooting each other over alfalfa hay.  When you make things illegal, especially things that do not harm others, you cause a cycle of violence.  Just go look at a graph of violent crime in this country and overlay that with the start of the "drug war".
I could care less what crime syndicates do, the biggest crime syndicates are various governments of the world, the United States very much included.

So in essence, they are all (or could all) be working on hashing different things, but once someone gets the proper hash that is the valid block?  What about transactions that did not make it into the valid block, they just wait to get into the next one?

Just put a third QR called Check Balance, and have it link to blockchain.

They are up and down.  I just lost connection, came back, and lost again...

Also--- 
for(int i=0; i&lt;=100; i++) { if( f(i) == B ) return i; }
For a 256bit key this would take somewhere on the order of 3*10^51 years, assuming you had a computer that could check 10^18 keys per second.

points 2 and 3 already exist.  The no reversal thing is a feature of Bitcoin.

Well that looks like a depth chart (the one with the arrow) and shows where the current buy and sell order are distributed.
I am certainly not an expert, but I think that depth charts for any commodity would work the same, there are probably some good youtube videos explaining.
The gist of it is, you can see where a good place to sell and buy is, and probably predict where prices are likely to change based on the desire.

Is this a brick and mortar business,or online?
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:36:02
I have been using this service to buy some bitcoin, very easy.  I had heard about this "hack", so I have not been keeping a balance there.

You fund into a localtill account. I don't do business with bofa as they are evil, but I find this to be the easiest way for me.

too funny, when I opened that link, my fingers were in the same position.

um... you sure?  I am not seeing any trades there.

So I just did a $20 transaction and it went through fine.  It took 7 min.

if you like, nothing to stop you.

I have never done a transaction with that much money ($1300 was it?).  I will make a quick deposit of $10 in a few if you would like, so as to test it out.
[EDIT] just set up a $20 payment, will let you know in about an hour or so how it went.

well, thanks for the tip

I would like to see a ripple protocol implemented right on top of Bitcoin.  I don't really understand why I would switch from one virtual currency ie.. Bitcoin into another XRP? Why not just go the full route with bitcoin?  
It would not be a part of Bitcoin per se, more like what greesemonkey is to firefox,

We need more like bitpay.  I would hate to see anothe Mt. Gox like situation.  Competition will be key to get even that 1% fee down. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:42:42
I transferred the entire amount,  There was a dialog that said, you do not have enough for the fee, Cancel or Adjust amount.  I selected cancel thinking cancel this transaction, but I guess that cancel means just don't send a fee, because it left my control at that point, and I was unable to  do anything but watch as prices fell all day long.
It was just a silly mistake, but I think it is one that is too easy to make, and if I was not a geeky type, I would have probably just considered it lost.

Have you looke at blockchain.info for a wallet.  They have a few nice features, 1 they don't have the keys to your wallet, and they let you auto backup and encrypted to your google drive, dropbox, email etc..
I also think they are open source.  If you have a look at their technical FAQ there is rather more information about DB structures etc than I have ever seen someone put out there.

ok, say you find one site where you can buy BTC for $50, and another where you can sell for $100.  So you buy one at the first site and then transfer the bitcoin to the second and sell it for $100... now what?  Now you need to get the $100 back over to the first site, bitcoin is easy to transfer, cash... not so much.  Have to withdraw it to your bank... you did set that up right?  no.. .well then you have to wait the time to get that set up, and then transferred.... two days later (if you are lucky) you can then re-deposit it in your first account, and do it all again...

Yes, thank you all.  I think I sort of understand this now.  This just gets cooler and cooler.
