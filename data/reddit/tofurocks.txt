I think the distinction would be based more along the lines of variance or standard deviation of return rather than expected value.

Did you take cash out of an exchange? If not, I would not declare the sale.

I doubt it. The IV would be insane. If liquid options were available on BTC I'd probably be selling straddles/strangles and Iron condors all day.

He could be a VLSI engineer who made his own. I know some digital design engineers who designed ASIC miners back then and just uploaded them to FPGA.

You have it backwards. Undefined risk trades are used by, and should only be used by experienced traders. Larger firms are very particular about controlling their portfolio greeks, naked options are super common for non-retail traders.

Someone with 10+ btc would actually have a much easier time than someone with 0.1. Having 10+ implies they have some knowledge or financial literacy because of the capital, so they have a plan and know exactly what they're in for. Someone with 0.1 btc can be any ignoramus without any background or plan.
When you've been in the markets long enough you know how to have a plan and follow it and not lose sleep over 6 figure swings.

You should not use a stop loss when trading options, ever.

But isn't that basically what does?

If his cost basis is close to $10 then he can only declare that he lost $10.

could've bought on margin

I'm in for 6 figures. My mindset is similar to yours. I'm taking on a bit of leverage with bitmex as well as we continue to dip down.

About 120% with leverage.

There are 2^256 private keys. There are 28.5 million bitcoin wallets that have more than 0.001 BTC.
2^256 / 28.5 million = 4 x 10^69
So you have a one in 4 x 10^69  chance of guessing a private key and landing an account with funds. To put that in perspective if you guessed 1 million random keys a second for the entire existance of the universe (13.7 billion years). You'd have still only have a one in 9.4x10^45 chance of guessing a private key.

Much much lower actually.

It's $45, just buy something with it. Or just give it to a friend for $45 if there really are no crypto ATMs near you and you don't want to bother with an exchange.

I don't think you could get a girlfriend for 1.5 BTC or quit your job for 5 BTC. Maybe if you could get a prostitute and quit your job if you live in a shithole 3rd world country. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:45:16
Go to any of the dozens of exchanges and pick some up with credit card or bank transfer. Or go to a local crypto ATM. Or just ask a friend with some bitcoin to sell you some.

Your broker is left holding the bag after you go bankrupt. This is vary rare since it is required that you hold enough cash to cover your position, and they will automatically close your position if it moves against you. However, in rare cases such as buyouts where the price spikes drastically both you and and your broker will be screwed.

Imagine you have 0 apples. You then go and sell 5 apples for 1$ each leaving you with -5 applies and $5. Now to close the position (get back to owning no apples) you need to buy 5 apples. But wait, the only place you can get apples at sells them for $2 each! So now in total you've bought apples at $2 and sold them at $1.
