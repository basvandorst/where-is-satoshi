I've been using both Blockfolio and Delta trying to figure out which I like better. Delta has basically won for me. Prices seem to be more accurate. The app isn't constantly having sever issues like Blockfolio seems to have every week. I like having a portfolio and watch list separate. I like the minimal design. Most of all, entering transactions is way better than Blockfolio. In Delta, I select my crypto and then select the purchasing pair, enter amounts and rates and then enter the fee and I'm done. In Blockfolio, say you purchase ETH with USD so you add the ETH/USD pair and enter your transactions. Then, later you sell and alt for BTC and then decide to move that BTC into ETH. Since the previous ETH pair you added was ETH/USD, you won't be able to enter your BTC &gt; ETH transaction unless you convert all your rates over to USD which is a pain. So the only way to record it is to add a new pair for ETH/BTC and enter the transaction which of course then adds that pair to your portfolio list. So then you'll have one pair for ETH/USD where you've got some ETH and then another pair for ETH/BTC where you also hold some ETH and they won't show a total ETH. Just kind of annoying to me.
I also love that in Delta right on the home screen, I can see my total portfolio as well as my profit. In Blockfolio, I have to go into each individual coin to see the profit.

What do you need that the free version of Delta doesn't offer? You don't *have* to pay for the premium membership to use the free version.

Follow up noob question:
Can you store all crypto on a hardware wallet or will it only support a handful of them?

I'm a noob. Is there a way to store Bitcoin in a wallet outside of coinbase without having to download the entire blockchain to get them transferred to the local wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:49:44
Ah yeah that's true. I never thought about the USD wallet.

Im sad to say that I didn't realize this until the price was ~2000. I'd have purchased some well before if I had known.

So serious question, does everyone think this is just the pump before the next split that's going to happen? I realize it's not going to come back down to 2k or something but after the slip do you foresee it coming back to earth a little?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:20:33
Yeah I guess obviously no one really knows. But hell, if it keeps going it may be 9k before the fork happens and then simply fall back to where it is now after.

Seems like there should be a way to verify who you are and that yes you do in fact want to empty everything out completely
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:06:39
I guess that depends on the verification process. Maybe require ID along with some other forms of identification which someone trying to do some shady shit isn't likely to have all together in front of them? I'm not really sure. 
Just seems like there HAS to be a way to get your money quicker. I could imagine sitting on millions of bitcoin and wanting out but Bitcoin takes a turn downward and then your millions just dwindle away while you way to be able to withdraw the next 10k

Well now I feel like even more of a noob. No, I didn't know that.
So where are the coins stored when using a hardware wallet? Your computer? 
If you buy a wallet that supports a couple different coins, can you store them all together or is it only one per wallet?
Thanks for all the info.
